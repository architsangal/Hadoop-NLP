They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the only team in their division not to be based in California. Their home arena since 1992 has been the US Airways Center, which was formerly known as America West Arena, in downtown Phoenix. The Arena is often referred to as the &quot; Purple Palace &quot; due to its purple seats. The Suns began play as an expansion team in 1968. The franchise owns the NBA&apos;s fourth-best all-time winning percentage, winning 56 percent of its games, as of the end of the 2010–2011 season. In forty-three years of play, they have made the playoffs 29 times, posted nineteen seasons of 50 or more wins, made nine trips to the Western Conference Finals, and advanced to the NBA Finals in 1976 and 1993. As a result, based on their all-time win-loss percentage, the Suns are the most winning franchise to have never won an NBA Championship. { Intro to all-time NBA franchise rankings  – ESPN } [ Franchise history ] [ Early years (1968–1975) ] Original Suns logo (1968-1992) The Suns were one of two franchises to join the NBA at the start of the 1968–69 season, alongside the Milwaukee Bucks. They were the first major professional sports franchise in the state of Arizona, and would be the only one for twenty years until the Cardinals of the National Football League relocated from St. Louis in 1988. The team played its first 24 seasons at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, located northwest of downtown Phoenix. The franchise was formed by an ownership group led by local businessmen Karl Eller, Don Pitt, Don Diamond, Bhavik Darji, Marvin Meyer, and Richard Bloch, and also part of the group were entertainers Andy Williams, Bobbie Gentry and Ed Ames. There were many critics, including then-NBA commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, who said that Phoenix was &quot; too hot &quot;, &quot; too small &quot;, and &quot; too far away &quot; to be considered a successful NBA market. { SUNS: The Suns Rise in Phoenix } This was despite the fact that the Phoenix metropolitan area was (and still is) rapidly growing and the Suns would have built-in geographical foes in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. After continual prodding by Bloch, the NBA Board of Governors finally decided that on January 22, 1968, Phoenix and Milwaukee were granted franchises. They paid an entry fee of $2 million. The Suns nickname was among 28,000 entries that were formally chosen in a &quot; Name the Team &quot; contest sponsored by the Arizona Republic; { SUNS: The Prickly Pears? } the winner was awarded $1,000 and season tickets to the inaugural season. Suns was preferred to Scorpions, Rattlers, Thunderbirds, Wranglers, Mavericks, Mustangs and Cougars. Stan Fabe, who owned a commercial printing plant in Tucson, designed the team&apos;s first iconic logo for a mere $200; this was after the team paid $5,000 to a local artist to design the team&apos;s logo, but to disappointing results. In the 1968 NBA Expansion Draft, notable Suns&apos; pick-ups were future Hall of Famer Gail Goodrich and Dick Van Arsdale. Jerry Colangelo, a then-player scout, came over from the Chicago Bulls { SUNS: Colangelo’s 40-year journey reaches Hall of Fame, NBA.com. Retrieved 2011-03-07. By Mike Tulumello, Tribune. } (a franchise formed two years earlier ) as the Suns&apos; first general manager at the age of 28, along with Johnny &quot; Red &quot; Kerr as head coach. Unlike the first-year success that Colangelo and Kerr had in Chicago, in which the Bulls finished with a first-year expansion record of 33 wins and a playoff berth (plus a Coach of the Year award for Kerr), Phoenix finished its first year at 16–66, and finished 25 games out of the final playoff spot. Both Goodrich and Van Arsdale were selected to the All-Star Game in their first season with the freshly minted Suns. Goodrich would return to his former team, the Lakers, after two seasons with the Suns, but Van Arsdale would spend the rest of his playing days as a Sun and even become a one-time head coach for Phoenix. The Suns&apos; last-place finish that season led to a coin flip for the number-one overall pick for the 1969 NBA Draft with the expansion-mate Bucks. Milwaukee won the flip, and the rights to draft UCLA center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor), while Phoenix settled on drafting center Neal Walk from the University of Florida. While the Bucks went on to win the NBA Finals in 1971 and reach the Finals again in 1974, the Suns would not go to the Finals until 1976. The 1969–70 season posted better results for the Suns, finishing 39–43, but losing to the eventual Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. The next two seasons ( 1970–71 and 1971–72 ), the Suns finished with 48- and 49-win seasons, however they did not qualify for the playoffs in either year, and would not reach the playoffs again until 1976. [ The Sunderella Suns (1975–1976) ] The 1975–76 season proved to be a pivotal year for the Suns, as they made several key moves, including the offseason trade of former All-Star guard Charlie Scott to the Boston Celtics, in exchange for guard Paul Westphal, a member of Boston&apos;s 1974 championship team. They also drafted center and eventual fan favorite Alvan Adams from the University of Oklahoma and guard Ricky Sobers of UNLV. The Suns and Buffalo Braves made a midseason trade, with Phoenix sending forward/center John Shumate to Buffalo in exchange for forward Gar Heard. Phoenix had an &quot; up-and-down &quot; regular season, starting out at 14–9 (then the best start in team history), then went 4–18 during a stretch of which the team went through injuries (including &quot; Original Sun &quot; Dick Van Arsdale breaking his right arm in a February game), but they caught fire, going 24–13 in the final 37 games to finish 42–40, clinching their first playoff spot since 1970. The Suns faced the SuperSonics in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, winning the series four games to two, and beat the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals, four games to three, to advance to their first-ever Finals. The Suns faced a battle-tested Celtics team, led by eventual Hall of Famers Dave Cowens and John Havlicek. The crucial Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals took place at Boston Garden, where the Suns came back from a 22-point first-half deficit to force overtime. Havlicek made what was supposed to be a game-winning basket, but due to fans rushing the floor before time officially expired, officials put one second back on the clock with Phoenix having possession of the ball, but under their own basket. Instead of attempting a desperation heave, the Suns&apos; Westphal intentionally called a timeout that they did not have, which was a technical foul, giving the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White converted to put them up 112–110. However, this advanced the ball to half-court, and once the Suns had possession, Heard made a buzzer-beating turnaround jump shot to force a third overtime. However, the Suns&apos; hard-fought battle would be short-lived, as Boston&apos;s little-used reserve player Glenn McDonald scored six of his eight points in the third overtime to lead the Celtics to a 128–126 win. Boston eventually won the series in six games, clinching the championship at the Coliseum, defeating Phoenix in game six, 87–80. [ Drug scandal; Colangelo takes control (1977–1987) ] In the late &apos;70s and early &apos;80s, the Suns enjoyed several successful seasons, making the playoffs 8 seasons in a row. Problems arose however, on and off court, in the mid &apos;80s. In 1987 the Maricopa County Attorney&apos;s Office indicted 13 people on drug-related charges, three of whom were active Suns players ( James Edwards, Jay Humphries and Grant Gondrezick ). These indictments were partially based on testimony from star player Walter Davis, who was given immunity. No defendants ever went to trial: two of the players went into a prosecution diversion program, while another received probation. Nevertheless, the scandal, although now perceived in many respects to be a witchhunt, tarnished the reputation of the franchise both nationally and within the community. The scandal did provide an opening for general manager Jerry Colangelo to lead a group that bought the team from its owners for $44 million, a record at that time. With a drug scandal and the loss of promising young center Nick Vanos, who was killed in the crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255, the franchise was in turmoil both on and off the court. [ 1988 February Trade with Cleveland ] The Suns&apos; luck began to turn around in 1988, however, with the acquisition of Kevin Johnson from the Cleveland Cavaliers, along with Mark West and Tyrone Corbin for popular All-Star power forward Larry Nance. This was beginnings of a franchise-record 13 consecutive playoff appearances happened for the Suns. All-Star Tom Chambers came over from the Seattle SuperSonics (the first unrestricted free agent in NBA history), 1986 second round draft pick Jeff Hornacek continued to develop, and &quot; Thunder &quot; Dan Majerle was drafted with the 14th pick in the 1988 draft, (obtained via the trade involving Kevin Johnson). Kurt Rambis was added from the Charlotte Hornets in 1989, and the team (coached by Fitzsimmons), in an upset, beat the Los Angeles Lakers in five games that season, before falling to the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals. In 1991, the Suns went 55–27, however lost in the first round to the Utah Jazz, 3–1. In 1992, the Suns went 53–29. Having sent four players to the All-Star Game in the last two seasons (Chambers, Johnson, Hornacek and Majerle), the Suns were poised to make a serious run at the NBA Finals. They started by sweeping the San Antonio Spurs in three games in the first round of the 1992 NBA Playoffs. But again, the Suns fell in five games to the Trail Blazers in the Conference Semifinals. The series was punctuated by an electrifying Game 4, in which the Suns lost in double overtime 153–151 (the highest scoring game in NBA Playoff history to-date). That game would end up being the last Suns game ever played at the Coliseum. The Suns were again denied a shot at a title, but it would not be long before the Suns enjoyed a degree of success they had not experienced for quite some time. [ &quot; Charles Barkley era &quot; (1992–1996) ] &quot; Streaking Suns &quot; Logo (1992–2000) In 1992, the Suns moved into their new arena in downtown Phoenix, the America West Arena (now US Airways Center ). The arena was not the only new arrival into Phoenix though, as flamboyant All-Star power forward Charles Barkley was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers for Hornacek, Andrew Lang, and Tim Perry. Barkley went on to win his first and only MVP that season 1993. In addition to Barkley, the Suns added some key players to their roster including Danny Ainge and draft players in University of Arkansas center Oliver Miller and forward Richard Dumas (who was actually drafted in 1991 but was suspended for his rookie year for violating the NBA drug policy). Under rookie head coach Paul Westphal (a former Suns assistant and, as a player, member of the 1976 Suns squad that went to the NBA Finals), the Suns squad consisting mostly of Barkley, Majerle, Johnson and Ainge won 62 games, tying a franchise-record. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the eighth-seeded Lakers, coming back from an 0–2 deficit in the five game series. The Suns went on to eliminate the Spurs and Sonics, advancing to the Finals for the second time in franchise history. They eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls, led by eventual Hall of Famers Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. The series included a triple-overtime game (Game 3) that along with Game 5 of the 1976 series are the only triple overtime games in the history of the NBA finals. [ Paxson&apos;s Trey Propels Bulls into NBA history NBA http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19921993.html April 18, 2007 ] { 1993 NBA finals } [ Triple-OT Classic Highlights Boston&apos;s 13th Title NBA http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19751976.html April 18, 2007 ] { 1976 NBA Finals } Approximately 300,000 fans braved the 105 degree heat to celebrate the memorable season in the streets of Phoenix. [ The Good Ol&apos; Days NBA http://www.nba.com/suns/history/00692542.html April 18, 2007 ] { Parade after the Finals } The Suns continued to be successful in the regular season, going 178–68 during the 1992–93, 1993–94, and 1994–95 seasons. They continued to bolster their roster adding players such as A. C. Green, Danny Manning, Wesley Person, Wayman Tisdale, and Elliot Perry. Despite a Pacific Division title in 1995, the Suns were eliminated in consecutive Western Conference Semifinal rounds by the Houston Rockets, both series going a full seven games. Manning was rarely at full strength with the Suns, injuring his ACL in 1995 just before the All-Star break. In both years the Suns led the series by two games at one point (2–0 in 1994, 3–1 in 1995) only to see the Rockets come back to win each series. At the end of the 1994–95 season, Phoenix general manager, Bryan Colangelo (son of Jerry) initiated what proved to be a very costly trade, sending the All-Star Majerle and a first round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for John &quot; Hot Rod &quot; Williams. Majerle was a fan favorite in Phoenix as well as the Suns locker room. [ Dan Mejerle NBA http://www.nba.com/suns/history/allcentury_majerle.html April 18, 2007 ] { Dan Majerle, fan favorite } The trade was made to address the Suns&apos; desperate need of a shot blocking center, but proved frustrating as Majerle&apos;s presence was sorely missed, and Williams&apos;s production never met expectations. The 1995–96 season turned into a very disappointing year for the Suns (despite drafting All-Rookie First Team member Michael Finley, who was later unavailable for the playoffs due to injury) in which they posted a 41–41 record, and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs. Westphal was fired mid-way through the season and replaced by Fitzsimmons, the third stint as head coach for him. A combination of front office unrest, along with the dwindling possibility of winning a championship led to turmoil in Barkley&apos;s relationship with Jerry Colangelo who both spurned each other publicly. This led to Barkley being traded to Houston for Sam Cassell, Robert Horry, Mark Bryant, and Chucky Brown; the trade did not produce the results either team had hoped for. (The feud between Barkley and Colangelo has since been repaired, and Barkley has appeared at a number of Suns&apos; home games in the years since. [ March 2007 ] He was also present to see his number retired into the Suns &quot; Ring Of Honor &quot; in 2004.) As for the Suns, three of the four players were not with the franchise just one year later, and furthermore two of the most talented players (being Horry and Cassell) constantly clashed with the coach and seemed to be a negative influence in the locker room. [ March 2007 ] In the 1996 NBA Draft, the Suns used their 15th pick for Santa Clara guard Steve Nash. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player, due to the fact that he had not played in one of the major college conferences. During his first two seasons in the NBA, he played a supporting role behind star point guards Jason Kidd and Kevin Johnson. With Kidd starting at the point, Nash was traded in June, 1998, from to the Mavericks in exchange for Martin Muursepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick (later used to select Shawn Marion ). [ The average times (1997–2004) ] After the Barkley trade, the Suns began the 1996–97 season 0–13 which was a franchise record for the worst start. During the 13-game losing streak Fitzsimmons stepped down as coach and was replaced by former player Danny Ainge. After an on-the-court altercation between Ainge and Horry, Horry was traded to the Lakers for former Sun and NBA all-star Cedric Ceballos. Cassell was later traded to Dallas for all-star guard Jason Kidd. With a mostly small lineup, the Suns put together an 11-game win streak that put them in the playoffs, in a series that almost upset the highly favored Sonics. In the off-season prior to the 2000 NBA season, the Suns traded for perennial All-Star Anfernee &quot; Penny &quot; Hardaway stirring a large amount of hype by creating the tandem of Kidd and Hardaway, which was called &quot; Backcourt 2000 &quot;. [ March 2007 ] However, the combination of Hardaway and Kidd was never fully realized as Hardaway would miss a number of games during the middle of the 1999–2000 season and Kidd would break his ankle going into the playoffs just as Hardaway began his return to the court. As the Suns, now led by the returned Hardaway, entered the 2000 playoffs, they beat the higher seeded San Antonio Spurs by ousting them from the playoffs 3–1 in the best-of-five series. The Spurs were without their best player Tim Duncan throughout the whole series. However, even with the return of Kidd at Hardaway&apos;s side in the next round, the Suns fell to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in a 4–1 series. The Suns continued to make the playoffs until the 2001–02 campaign, when they fell short for the first time in 14 years. That season marked the trade of Jason Kidd, partly due to a publicized domestic violence episode, to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury. Lottery-bound, however, the Suns were able to draft Amar&apos;e Stoudemire. The 2002–03 campaign saw the emergence of Stoudemire, a graduate from Cypress Creek High School (Orlando, Florida). He became the first high school player to win the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 2002–03 season (until LeBron James did it the following season ), during which the Suns posted a record of 44–38 and returned to the playoffs. Marbury had a stellar individual season, making the All-NBA Third Team and being selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. The Suns were eliminated in the first round once again by the San Antonio Spurs; a six-game series with the eventual NBA champions. In the 2003–04 season, the Suns found themselves out of the playoffs. The Suns made a blockbuster mid-season trade sending Marbury and Hardaway to the New York Knicks for Antonio McDyess and a future first round pick, that was later dealt to Denver. [ Nash &amp; amp; Stoudemire era (2004–2010) ] A home game against the Sacramento Kings in the 2006–07 NBA season. The beginning of 2004 saw the departure of the face of Suns management since the team&apos;s inception, when Jerry Colangelo announced that the Phoenix Suns were to be sold to an investment group headed by San Diego-based business executive (and Tucson native) Robert Sarver for $401 million. However, the 2004–05 season marked the Suns&apos; return to the NBA&apos;s elite, finishing with the best record at 62–20, and tying a franchise record set by the 1992–93 team. This feat was made possible by the off-season unrestricted FA signing of All-Star point guard Steve Nash from Dallas who had formerly played for them at the beginning of his career. Nash would go on to win the MVP award that season. Amar&apos;e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion were named All-Stars and first year coach, Mike D&apos;Antoni, was named NBA Coach of the Year. In the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Phoenix was the first seed in the Western Conference. The Suns swept the Memphis Grizzlies 4–0 and defeated the fourth-seeded Dallas Mavericks in the second round 4–2, Nash forced Game 6 into OT with a 3-pointer in the closing seconds. In the Western Conference Finals, the Suns played the San Antonio Spurs who won the series 4–1, ending Phoenix&apos;s season, partly due to Joe Johnson missing the first two games of the series. Joe Johnson went on to start the remaining games where he averaged 40 minutes per game and 18.3 PPG. The Suns lost the first 2 at home, as well as the following game in San Antonio to fall behind 3–0 in the series, escaping with a win in Game 4 at San Antonio 111–106. The team then lost Game 5 at home 101–95 to be eliminated from the playoffs. Stoudemire averaged 37.0 ppg, the highest ever by a player in their first Conference Finals. [ March 2007 ] The 2005–06 NBA season began with Stoudemire undergoing microfracture surgery in his knee on October 18, 2005. He missed all but three games that year. Along with that, shooting guard Joe Johnson demanded a Sign and Trade deal to the Atlanta Hawks, in which the Suns got Boris Diaw along with two future first round picks. Other acquisitions that year included Raja Bell and Kurt Thomas. Despite the turnover in players, the Suns were once again able to win the Pacific going 54–28 and capturing the second seed in the Western Conference. Nash was awarded a second consecutive NBA Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the second point-guard ( Magic Johnson was the first) to win the award in consecutive seasons. Also, Diaw was named NBA Most Improved Player. The Suns began the 2006 Western Conference Playoffs as favorites against the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning Game 1 in Phoenix, they found themselves trailing in the series 3–1 after impressive performances by Laker shooting guard Kobe Bryant. However, the Suns went on to win three straight games. They won Game 5 easily at home. With 7:33 left in the game, Suns guard Raja Bell grabbed Bryant around the neck and threw him down as the Lakers star drove to the basket. Bell earned a technical foul, his second of the game, and an automatic ejection. The Suns took game 6 in OT, their first OT win all season despite 50 points from Bryant and Bell out serving a one-game suspension (for a flagrant foul against Bryant in Game 5) with last second help from mid-season acquisition Tim Thomas. On their home court, the Suns won Game 7 121–90, eliminating the Lakers for the first time since 1993. The Suns became only the eighth team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being behind 3–1. In the second round, the Suns faced the Los Angeles Clippers. The series was played closely, with both teams trading games on each others&apos; courts. The series was 2–2 and The Suns faced a huge deficit in Game 5 but fought back and won in double OT and after a Game 6 loss finally won the series in the decisive seventh game on their home court at US Airways Center, winning by a margin of 20 with an NBA record 15 3-point FG&apos;s May 22, 2006. They went on to play the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. Underdogs this time, The Suns took Game 1 in Dallas by a single point and their May 30 victory in Game 4 marked the most wins thus far for the franchise in a Conference Finals series since the 1993 season. Many credit this success (despite losing Stoudemire) to the emergence of Diaw, Bell (out for two games of the series due to injury), and Barbosa as clutch playoff performers; and an overall team depth they did not possess the previous season. The Suns lost Games 5 and 6 by a combined 25 points and eliminated from the series on June 3, 2006 in Game 6. It was yet another disappointing end for the Suns. On June 6, former TNT analyst and NBA three-point specialist, Steve Kerr, was appointed Suns&apos; General Manager and President of Basketball Operations. Kerr was also a part of the Sarver-led investment group that purchased the franchise from Jerry Colangelo. [ March 2008 ] On May 11, 2008, after the Suns had lost to the San Antonio Spurs 4–1 in the first round of the 2008 Western Conference Playoffs, Suns Head Coach Mike D&apos;Antoni signed with the New York Knicks. And on June 9, 2008, Terry Porter was named Head Coach of the Phoenix Suns, succeeding Mike D&apos;Antoni. Porter was an Assistant Coach of the Detroit Pistons when he was let go after the Pistons were eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the 2008 NBA Eastern Conference Finals. During the offseason, the Suns had difficulties signing free agents because of being over the luxury tax. They made attempts to sign a backup point guard, Tyronn Lue, however, he decided to sign with the Bucks for more money. The Suns selected Robin Lopez (15th overall pick out of Stanford University ) in the 2008 NBA Draft and acquired Goran Dragic, who was originally picked by the rival San Antonio Spurs. On February 16, the Suns fired Terry Porter and he was succeeded by Alvin Gentry. The Suns were expected to make the transition back to the up-tempo style basketball nicknamed the &quot; 7 Seconds or Less &quot; or &quot; Run and Gun style. &quot; On February 18, Alvin Gentry began his head coaching tenure with a 140–100 blowout over the Clippers at home. Six Suns players scored in double digits, led by Leandro Barbosa&apos;s 24 points. The Suns led by as much as 50 points during the game and were without their swingman Jason Richardson who was serving a one game suspension. However, this offense cost them their defense, allowing over 107 points per game, 27th in the league. The Suns would score 140 in the next two games. On February 20 Amar&apos;e Stoudemire underwent eye surgery and was out for 8 weeks. They went 18–13 under Alvin Gentry in the last 31 games. At the end of the season the Suns missed the playoffs with a 46–36 record. The offseason brought uncertainty for the Suns, with the possibility of rebuilding the base of the team. During the 2009  – 2010 season, the Suns played a far more balanced style of basketball and finished with a 54–28 record. The Suns advanced to the NBA&apos;s Western Conference Finals, eliminating the Portland Trail Blazers in six games and the San Antonio Spurs in four games, including an explosive performance by Goran Dragic in game 3 against the Spurs, scoring 23 points in the fourth quarter. The Suns faced the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, but lost in six games. On June 15, 2010 Kerr resigned as General Manager of the Suns effective June 30, 2010. In the wake of Kerr&apos;s decision to leave the club, Senior V.P. of Basketball Operations David Griffin told Managing Partner Robert Sarver he did not want to be a candidate to replace Kerr and will leave once his contract expires June 30. [ Rebuilding (2010–present) ] Since mid 2010, the Suns have been in rebuilding mode. In the summer of 2010, the Suns let superstar Stoudemire go to the New York Knicks, and hired player agent Lon Babby as president of basketball operations. The team then paid over $80 million to acquire Hedo Türkoğlu, Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick to replace Stoudemire and add bench depth. On December 19, 2010, the Suns acquired Vince Carter, Mickaël Piétrus, and Marcin Gortat from the Orlando Magic, along with a low draft pick and cash considerations. For this acquisition, the Suns traded Jason Richardson, Earl Clark, and the recently acquired Hedo Türkoğlu. On February 24, 2011 the Suns acquired Point guard Aaron Brooks, trading first round (Lottery Protected) draft pick and Point guard Goran Dragić to the Houston Rockets. In the 2011 NBA draft in June 2011, the Suns used their 13th pick selected Markieff Morris, standing about 6 ft 10, a power forward from Kansas Jayhawks. Markieff is the 7-minute-older twin brother of Marcus Morris, who played together for 3 years in Kansas. [ Season-by-season records ] [ List of Phoenix Suns seasons ] [ Uniforms ] [ Uniforms ] Since their debut, the Suns home uniforms are always white with purple and orange trim. On the road their uniforms are purple with white and orange trim, with accents of black during the 1990s and gray on the current versions. They also had a black alternate uniform during the mid-1990s. Their first jerseys had the word Phoenix in a Western-stylized font. Those jerseys were worn by their beginnings up until the 1992–93 season, though it had revisions (e.g. the futuristic-looking &apos;Phoenix&apos; wordmark used from 1968–74). During the remainder of the 1990s, Phoenix replaced the Western font with the new Suns logo being a part of their jerseys. Starting at the beginning of the 2000–01 season, the Suns ended using their normal font for Phoenix on the road and Suns at home.On October 20, 2003, an alternate orange uniform was introduced that was to be used at a minimum, five games a year, both at home and on the road. At the time, it was the only uniform in the NBA that has an abbreviated version of the city name, Phoenix, across the front chest; since then the Atlanta Hawks donned a similar alternate jersey starting in 2009, followed by the New Orleans Hornets in 2010. For the 2006–2007 season, the Suns removed the uniform number from the side of the shorts, replacing it with the same sun logo that is found on the other side. During the 2010 NBA Playoffs, the Suns announced they would wear uniforms with the words &quot; Los Suns &quot; to honor their Latino fans on Cinco de Mayo for Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs. Sports reporter Dave Zirin called the &quot; Los Suns &quot; action an &quot; un-precidented political statement by a sports team. &quot; [ Here Come Los Suns: Dave Zirin on Sports and Resistance http://www.radioproject.org/2010/07/here-come-los-suns-dave-zirin-on-sports-and-resistance/ Making Contact July 27, 2010 National Radio Project ] The move was also widely reported to be a protest of an Arizona illegal-immigration law enacted in April. The said uniform has been used during NBA Noche Latina events every March since the 2007-08 NBA season. That jersey had gained controversy towards fans since the Cinco de Mayo game. [ Suns mascot ] [ The Suns Gorilla ] The Suns Gorilla is one of the more famous mascots in the NBA. For the first eleven seasons of their existence in the NBA, the Suns had no official mascot. An early attempt was made involving a sunflower costume, but it never caught on. [ The Gorilla NBA http://www.nba.com/suns/history/history_gorilla_80.html May 1, 2007 ] { The Gorilla } In the winter of 1980, a singing telegram (sent by James Oberhaus, a loyal fan) named Henry Rojas from Eastern Onion Telegram service was sent to the arena in a gorilla costume. Security saw him and suggested to him to stay for a while to entertain the fans during the breaks. He kept coming to games until officially invited to be the Suns&apos; mascot. Since then, the gorilla, named Go, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter.

Halfway through the song, a group of &quot; muggers &quot; attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. The gorilla was honored in 2005 when he was selected to be one of three inaugural members of the Mascots Hall of Fame.
