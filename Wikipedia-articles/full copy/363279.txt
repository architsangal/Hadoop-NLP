This compromise negated both the Democrats&apos; use of a filibuster and the Republican &quot; nuclear option &quot; as described in the media. Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an &quot; extraordinary circumstance &quot;, and three conservative Bush appellate court nominees ( Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor ) would receive a vote by the full Senate. [ Detainee interrogations ] In July 2005, Graham secured the declassification and release of memoranda outlining concerns made by senior military lawyers as early as 2003 about the legality of the interrogations of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. { Military&apos;s Opposition to Harsh Interrogation Is Outlined, New York Times } In response to this and a June 2004 U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing detainees to file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detentions, Graham authored an amendment { S8859, The Graham Amendment } to a Department of Defense Authorization Act attempting to clarify the authority of American courts which passed in November 2005 by a vote of 49–42 in the Senate despite opposition from human rights groups and legal scholars because of the lack of rights it provides detainees. { ACLU Urges Congress to Reject Court Stripping Measure } { Right To Trial Imperiled by Senate Vote by Jeremy Brecher &amp; Brendan Smith } Graham has said he amended the Department of Defense Authorization Act in order to give military lawyers, as opposed to politically appointed lawyers, a more independent role in the oversight of military commanders. He has argued that two of the largest problems leading to the detainee abuse scandals at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib were this lack of oversight and troops&apos; confusion over legal boundaries. { FRONTLINE Interview: Rumsfeld&apos;s War. Retrieved February 10, 2009. } Graham further explains that military lawyers had long observed the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention, but that those provisions had not been considered by the Bush administration in decisions regarding the treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay.

Rumsfeld that had already been granted cert; this compromise version passed by a vote of 84–14, though it did little to satisfy many critics of the original language. The Graham-Levin amendment, combined with Republican Senator John McCain &apos;s amendment banning torture, became known as the Detainee Treatment Act and attempted to limit interrogation techniques to those in the U.S. Army Field Manual of Interrogation. Verbal statements by Senators at the time of the amendment&apos;s passage indicated that Congress believed that Levin&apos;s changes would protect the courts&apos; jurisdiction over cases like Hamdan, though Levin and his cosponsor Kyl placed in the Congressional Record a statement indicating that there would be no change. In February 2006, Graham joined Senator Jon Kyl in filing an amicus brief in the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case that argued &quot; Congress was aware &quot; that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear &quot; pending cases, including this case &quot; brought by the Guantanamo detainees. { Invisible Men: Did Lindsey Graham and Jon Kyl mislead the Supreme Court?, by Emily Bazelon – Slate Magazine } In a May 2009 CNN interview, Graham referred to the domestic internment of German and Japanese prisoners of war and US Citizens as a model for domestic detention of Guantanamo detainees by saying, &quot; We had 450,000 Japanese and German prisoners housed in the United States during World War II.
