He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1714–1717), Lord Privy Seal (1715–1716), Lord President of the Council (1717–1719) and First Lord of the Treasury (1718–1721). [ Early life ] He was the second son of Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland and Anne Digby, daughter of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol. On the death of his elder brother Henry in Paris in September 1688, he became heir to the peerage. Called by John Evelyn &quot; a youth of extraordinary hopes, &quot; he completed his education at Utrecht, and in 1695 entered the House of Commons as member for Tiverton. In the same year, he married Arabella, daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle; she died in 1698 and in 1700, he married Anne Churchill, daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. This was an important alliance for Sunderland and for his descendants; through it he was introduced to political life and later the dukedom of Marlborough came to the Spencers. [ Career ] Having succeeded to the peerage in 1702, Sunderland was one of the commissioners for the union between England and Scotland, and in 1705, he was sent to Vienna as envoy extraordinary. Although he was tinged with republican ideas and had made himself obnoxious to Queen Anne by opposing the grant to her husband, Prince George, through the influence of Marlborough he was foisted into the ministry as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, taking office in December 1706. From 1708 to 1710, he was one of the five Whigs collectively called the Junto, who dominated the government, but he had many enemies, the queen still disliked him, and in June 1710, he was dismissed. Anne offered him a pension of £3000 a year, but this he refused, saying &quot; if he could not have the honour to serve his country he would not plunder it. &quot; Sunderland continued to take part in public life, and was active in communicating with the court of Hanover about the steps to be taken in view of the approaching death of the queen. He made the acquaintance of George I in 1706, but when the elector became king, Sunderland only secured the comparatively unimportant position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In August 1715, he joined the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal. After a visit to George I in Hanover, he secured in April 1717 the position of Secretary of State for the Northern Department. This he retained until March 1718, when he became First Lord of the Treasury, holding also the post of Lord President of the Council. He was now effectively the prime minister. Sunderland was especially interested in the proposed peerage bill, a measure designed to limit the number of members of the House of Lords, but this was defeated owing partly to the opposition of Sir Robert Walpole. In 1719 he was one of main subscribers in the Royal Academy of Music (1719), a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage. { Deutsch, O.E. (1955), Handel. A documentary biography, p. 91. Reprint 1974. } { See the year 1719 Handel Reference Database (in progress) } The bursting of the South Sea Bubble led to his political ruin. He had taken some part in launching the scheme of 1720, but he had not profited financially by it; however, public opinion was roused against him and it was only through the efforts of Walpole that he was acquitted by the House of Commons, when the matter was investigated. In April 1721, he resigned his offices, but he retained his influence with George I until his death on 19 April 1722. Sunderland inherited his father&apos;s passion for intrigue, while his manners were repelling, but he stands high among his associates for disinterestedness and had an alert and discerning mind. From his early years he had a great love of books, and he spent his leisure and his wealth in forming the library at Althorp, which in 1703 was described as &quot; the finest in Europe. &quot; In 1749 part of it was removed to Blenheim Palace. Sunderland&apos;s second wife died in April 1716, after a career of considerable influence on the political life of her time. In 1717, he married an Irish lady of fortune, Judith Tichborne (d. 1749), daughter of Sir Benjamin Tichborne (younger brother of Sir Henry Tichborne, 1st Baron Ferrard, (Irish cr. 1715) and Elizabeth Gibbs. She later married Sir Robert Sutton. [ Children ] His first wife was Arabella Cavendish, daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. They had a single daughter: Frances Spencer (died 27 July 1742), married Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle. His second wife was Lady Anne Churchill. They had five children: Robert Spencer (24 October 1701 – 27 November 1729), succeeded his father as 4th Earl of Sunderland Anne Spencer (1702 – 19 February 1769), married William Bateman, 1st Viscount Bateman. Charles Spencer (22 November 1706 – 20 October 1758), succeeded his brother as 5th Earl of Sunderland, and succeeded his aunt, Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, as 3rd Duke of Marlborough. John Spencer (13 May 1708 – 19 June 1746), father of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer. Diana Spencer (1710 – 27 September 1735), married John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. His third wife was Judith Tichborne. They had three children who all died young.
