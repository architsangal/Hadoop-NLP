According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 1.8 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 1.8 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and 0.55% is water. While Chapin is a part of Lexington County, the creation of Lake Murray, South Carolina by the Dreher Shoals Dam cut Chapin off from the rest of the county, creating something of an exclave. [ History ] Chapin is named after Martin Chapin who traveled south from Cortland, New York after marrying his wife Laura. After Martin Chapin and Laura Anne Benjamin were married on June 16, 1850. The married coupled moved to the south because of Martin’s health. He had a lung ailment and thought that moving south would help improve his lung condition. Martin Chapin and his wife were living in Columbia, South Carolina when his doctor suggested he to move to the Piney Woods area. He bought property in this area, and over the years Martin Chapin bought 4,218 acres in Chapin. He built his Chapin home and the Chapin hotel in the 1880s along the new rail line that ran from Columbia, South Carolina to Laurens, South Carolina.The railroad provided a way to trade and transport goods to the capital city, Columbia, SC. Cotton and the lumber industry were flourishing with the railroad providing transportation.

Bryan Company Columbia, South Carolina 1–6, 29 ] On March 28, 1907, Job S. Wessinger, P.M. Frick, and J. S. Honeycut founded the Bank of Chapin. One year later the building for the bank was built. The bank was prospering with help from the railroad. [ 30 ] During World War I, Chapin was doing well economically. The price of cotton had risen and the farmers were making plenty of money. As a result, The Bank of Chapin was also thriving during this time. In addition, the first high school was built in 1924. [ 43 ] Slowly the businesses in Chapin were starting to experience hard times nearing the 1930s. On Thursday, October 15, 1931 the Bank of Chapin did not open, and like other banks around the world, the Bank of Chapin would not let allow customers to withdraw their money. Anybody who had money saved in the bank lost that money due to the crash of the stock market, later known as the start of the Great Depression. Another disaster to hit Chapin was the building of the dam on the Saluda River that would result in the building of a lake. This lake would take over most of the Chapin families’ farm and homeland. The building of the dam was started in 1927. [ 61–68 ] In the midst of the Great Depression Chapin started a recreational team sport of baseball. In 1935, the Dutch Fork League was formed where Chapin had its own team. This team helped the unemployed men occupy their time during these difficult times. These baseball games attracted thousands of people. [ 75 ] The midpoint in Chapin’s history is the 1940s. During this period Chapin grew through improvements on the school and opening new businesses. One new business that came to Chapin was filling stations. The next business was a cabinet shop called E. A. Frick and Son. Chapin also built paved roads, a baseball field and established the public library. In 1950 the first post office building was constructed, along with new telephone services. The 1960s were about new and better services. Garbage collection was an issue in the 60s, so the town government bought land and built a landfill. Transportation was the next service provided by access to an interstate. On September 7, 1960 a section of the interstate was opened between Columbia and Pomaria, South Carolina. The interstate made Chapin more accessible. [ 118 ] Streets in town were also improved. Another improvement of the 60s was the new water system. Later during 1965 a volunteer fire department was organized. Then in 1966, the town had its first ambulance. Chapin started also started growing in population as more people moved to Chapin in the 1960s. [ 124 ] During the 1970s new schools were built.

On September 21, 1927, work on the dam for the Saluda River was started. The construction finished on the June 30, 1930. Chapin families who had lived on Chapin land for over 200 years had to sell and move to make room for the lake that was a result of the dam. The lake was to spread between Dutch Fork and Chapin becoming 14 miles wide and 40 miles long. [ 61 ] The earthen dam stands over 200 feet tall and runs 1.5 miles across. Lake Murray has over 500 miles of shoreline and covers approximately 50,000 acres. The dam itself takes up 99 acres. [ Chapin, South Carolina http://www.sciway.net/city/chapin.html SCIWAY South Carolina&apos;s Information Highway 3 November 2011 ] The dam on Lake Murray has been through many changes since it was originally built in 1927. In 1943 three feet was added to the dam’s height to help flooding issues. Much later in the 1980s SCE &amp; G added a sheet piling way on the lakeside of the highway again to help with flooding. This sheet piling way raised the height of the dam again. The latest changes to the dam occurred in 2002 when the backup dam was built. The backup dam was built for more protection to withstand earthquakes. The backup dam is made of rock and concrete to withstand the weight of the water behind the dam if any damage were to occur to the existing dam.
