The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. { History of DJIA, globalfinancialdata.com } Founded in 1917, the company&apos;s research ers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products. { Union Carbide Corporation, History, Accessed July 9, 2008. } The company is also notorious for numerous serious public health incidents, particularly the Bhopal disaster (1984) in which a major toxic gas leak from a production centre in Bhopal caused over 3000 deaths and seriously injured 400,000 others in the surrounding residential area. [ History ] The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed in 1917 from the merger of the former Union Carbide founded in 1898 and the National Carbon Company founded in 1886. These companies made carbon rods for arc light s and electrodes for electric arc furnace s, and produced aluminium. { Themistocles D&apos;Silva, The Black Box of Bhopal: A Closer Look at the World&apos;s Deadliest Industrial Disaster,Trafford Publishing, 2006 ISBN 1-4120-8412-1, page 27 } Other companies merged included Linde Air Products, maker of liquid oxygen, Prest-O-Lite, manufacturer of calcium carbide, and Electro Metallurgical. In 1920 the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, for example, the Bakelite Corporation became a division in 1939. The company changed its name to &quot; Union Carbide Corporation &quot; in 1957 and often referred to as Carbide. Ucar batteries was Carbide&apos;s industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business including Energizer alkaline batteries was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover attempt. [ Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster ] [ Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster ] The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476. [ December 2011 ] [ Asbestos Mining and &apos;Calidria&apos; Brand Fibers ] In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, Caliornia. The fibers were sold under the brand name &quot; Calidria &quot;, a combination of &quot; Cal &quot; and &quot; Idria. &quot; These fibers were sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including addition into joint compound or drywall accessory products. { LA Times, &quot; Case Hinges on Material Witness &quot;, Lisa Gurion, September 26, 2004 } Union Carbide sold this mine to its employees under the name KCAC ( &quot; King City Asbestos Mine &quot; ) in the 1980s but it only operated for a few more years. The open pit mine is now closed to all visitors except when special passes are obtained. [ March 2012 ] [ Bhopal disaster ] [ Bhopal disaster ] The Bhopal disaster was an industrial disaster that took place at a Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Around midnight on 3 December 1984, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. The disaster left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness. { Eckerman, Ingrid (2001) Chemical Industry and Public Health — Bhopal as an example. Accessed 8 November 2010 } Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. The plant site clean up and India&apos;s demand for the extradition of then-Union Carbide CEO Warren Anderson are yet to be resolved. [ Sydney Harbour ] Union Carbide also heavily contaminated land in the suburb of Rhodes, Sydney, Australia with dioxin waste. As a result no fish caught west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge should be eaten by recommendation of the Food Authority NSW. The Rhodes site was central to the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
