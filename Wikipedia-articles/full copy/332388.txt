He supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and is a supporter of Israel. While once a longtime supporter of the American Civil Liberties Union, Hentoff has become a vocal critic of the organization for its advocacy of government-enforced university and workplace speech code s.

Hentoff&apos;s book, Free Speech for Me — But Not for Thee, outlines his views on free speech and excoriates those whom he feels favor censorship in any form. Hentoff was critical of Bush Administration policies such as the Patriot Act and other civil liberties implications of the recent push for &quot; homeland security. &quot; He was also strongly critical of Clinton Administration policies such as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In March and April 2003 Hussein was deposed by a US-led invasion, launching the ongoing Iraq war. In summer 2003, Hentoff wrote a column for the Washington Times in which he supported Tony Blair &apos;s humanitarian justifications for the war.

An ardent critic of the Bush administration&apos;s expansion of presidential power, Hentoff in 2008 called for the new president to deal with the &quot; noxious residue of the Bush-Cheney war against terrorism. &quot; Among the national security casualties have been, according to Hentoff, &quot; survivors, if they can be found, of CIA secret prisons ( &quot; black site s &quot; ); victims of CIA kidnapping renditions; and American citizens locked up indefinitely as &quot; unlawful enemy combatants. &quot; [ Nat Hentoff http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-11-12/columns/caged-citizen-will-test-president-obama/ Caged Citizen Will Test President Obama - Page 1 - Columns - New York Village Voice 2008-11-12 2011-03-03 ] He has advocated prosecuting members of the Bush administration, including lawyer John Yoo, for war crimes.

Bush &apos;s practice of state torture of prisoners. [ Nat Hentoff http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-01-12/columns/george-w-obama/ George W.
