{ Never Say Never } [ y 1983 10 7 ] { 134 minutes } { English } { $36 million } { $160 million } Never Say Never Again is a 1983 spy film based on the James Bond novel &apos;&apos;Thunderball&apos;&apos;, which was previously adapted in 1965 under that name. Unlike the majority of Bond films, Never Say Never Again was not produced by Eon Productions, but by an independent production company, one of whose members was Kevin McClory, one of the original writers of the Thunderball storyline with Ian Fleming and Jack Whittingham. McClory retained the filming rights of the novel following a long legal battle dating from the 1960s. The film was directed by Irvin Kershner and, like Thunderball, stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond, 007, marking his return to the role 12 years after Diamonds Are Forever. The film&apos;s title references how Connery said to the press in 1971 that he would &quot; never again &quot; play James Bond. As Connery was 52 at the time of filming, the storyline features an aging Bond, who is brought back into action to investigate the theft of two nuclear weapons by SPECTRE. Filming locations included France, Spain, the Bahamas and Elstree Studios in England. Never Say Never Again was released by Warner Bros. in the autumn of 1983. It opened to positive critic reviews and was a commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although this was less overall than the official Bond released in June of the same year, Octopussy. In 1997 the distribution rights of Never Say Never Again were purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which distributes Eon&apos;s Bond films, and the company has handled subsequent home video releases of the film. [ Plot ] After MI6 agent James Bond, 007 fails a routine training exercise, his superior, M, orders Bond to enrol in a health clinic in London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man&apos;s face is bandaged and after Fatima finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym: however Bond manages to defeat the assassin. Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent security at an American military base in England. Whilst doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads in two cruise missile s with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then obtains the warheads to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush subsequently murders Petachi. Under orders from the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons. Before leaving, he is outfitted with several gadgets by Q Branch, including a fountain pen that shoots an explosive dart. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot&apos;s sister, and her wealthy lover, Maximillian Largo, another SPECTRE agent. Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas, where he spars with Fatima Blush and Largo. Bond is informed by Nigel Small-Fawcett of the British Consulate that Largo&apos;s yacht is now heading for Nice, France. There, Bond joins forces with his CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter. Bond goes to a beauty salon where he poses as an employee and, whilst giving Domino a massage, is informed by her that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a 3-D video game called Domination, which Bond ultimately wins; Bond then informs Domino of her brother&apos;s death. Bond returns to his villa to find Nicole, his French contact, dead, having been killed by Blush. After a vehicle chase on his motorbike, Blush captures Bond. Forced to write his memoirs putting her as his &quot; Number One &quot; sexual partner, Bond uses his MI6-issue fountain pen to shoot Blush. Bond and Felix then attempt to board Largo&apos;s motor yacht, the &apos;&apos;Flying Saucer&apos;&apos;, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo&apos;s base of operations in North Africa. Largo punishes Domino for betraying him by auctioning her off to some passing Arab s. Bond subsequently escapes and rescues Domino. After her rescue, Domino and Bond reunite with Felix on a US Navy submarine and track Largo to a location known as The Tears of Allah, below a desert oasis. Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Felix&apos;s team and Largo&apos;s men in the temple. In the confusion Largo makes a getaway with one of the warheads. Bond catches and fights Largo underwater. Just as Largo tries to detonate the last bomb, he is killed by Domino, taking revenge for her brother&apos;s death. Bond then returns to the Bahamas with Domino.

[ Pfeiffer Worrall 1998 213 ] Fleming, along with independent producer Kevin McClory and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had worked together on a script for a potential Bond film, to be called Longitude 78 West, which was subsequently abandoned because of the costs involved. [ Chancellor 2005 226 ] Fleming, &quot; always reluctant to let a good idea lie idle &quot;, [ Chancellor 2005 226 ] turned this into the novel Thunderball which did not credit either McClory or Whittingham; [ Macintyre 2008 198 ] McClory then took Fleming to the High Court in London for breach of copyright [ Macintyre 2008 199 ] and the matter was settled in 1963. [ Poliakoff Keith License to Copyright - The Ongoing Dispute Over the Ownership of James Bond Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law 2000 18 387–436 http://www.cardozoaelj.net/issues/00/Poliakoff.pdf 3 September 2011 ] After Eon Productions started producing the Bond films, they subsequently made a deal with McClory, who would produce Thunderball, and then not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965. [ Chapman 2009 184 ] In the mid-1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring a Thunderball adaptation to production and, with the working title Warhead, he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery to work on a script. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 152 ] The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. [ Chapman 2009 184 ] Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, [ Chapman 2009 184 ] but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project [ Pfeiffer Worrall 1998 213 ] he brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr [ Benson 1988 240 ] to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais [ La Frenais, Ian (1936-) and Clement, Dick (1937-) http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462850/credits.html Screenonline British Film Institute 3 September 2011 ] to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 155 ] The film underwent one final change in title: after Connery had finished filming Diamonds are Forever he had pledged that he would &quot; never &quot; play Bond again. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 152 ] Connery&apos;s wife, Micheline, suggested the title Never Say Never Again, referring to her husband&apos;s vow [ Dick Sandra Eighty big facts you must know about Big Tam 5 September 2011 Edinburgh Evening News 25 August 2010 20 ] and the producers acknowledged her contribution by listing on the end credits &quot; Title &quot; Never Say Never Again &quot; by: Micheline Connery &quot;. A final attempt by Fleming&apos;s trustees to block the film was made in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983, but these were thrown out by the court and Never Say Never Again was permitted to proceed. [ Chapman 2009 185 ] [ Cast and crew ] When producer Kevin McClory had first planned the film in 1964 he held initial talks with Richard Burton for the part of Bond, [ A Rival 007 - It Looks Like Burton 2 September 2011 Daily Express 21 February 1964 13 ] although the project came to nothing because of the legal issues involved. When the Warhead project was launched in the late 1970s, a number of actors were mentioned in the trade press, including Orson Welles for the part of Blofeld, Trevor Howard to play M and Richard Attenborough as director. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 152 ] In 1978 the working title James Bond of the Secret Service was being used and Connery was in the frame once again, potentially going head-to-head with the next Eon Bond film, &apos;&apos;Moonraker&apos;&apos;. [ Davis Victor Bond versus Bond 2 September 2011 Daily Express 29 July 1978 4 ] By 1980, with legal issues again causing the project to founder, [ Barnes Hearn 2001 153 ] Connery thought himself unlikely to play the role, as he stated in an interview in the Sunday Express &quot; when I first worked on the script with Len I had no thought of actually being in the film &quot;. [ Mann Roderick Why Sean won&apos;t now be back as 007... 2 September 2011 Sunday Express 23 March 1980 23 ] When producer Jack Schwartzman became involved, he asked Connery to play Bond: Connery agreed, asking (and getting) a fee of $3 million, ($ [ US 3 1983 ] million in dollars [ US y ] ) a percentage of the profits, as well as casting and script approval. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 154 ] Subsequent to Connery reprising the role, the script has several references to Bond&apos;s advancing years – playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming [ Barnes Hearn 2001 154 ] – and academic Jeremy Black has pointed out that there are other aspects of age and disillusionment in the film, such as the Shrubland&apos;s porter referring to Bond&apos;s car ( &quot; they don&apos;t make them like that any more &quot; ), the new M having no use for the 00 section and Q with his reduced budgets. [ Black 2004 58 ] For the main villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery suggested Klaus Maria Brandauer, the lead of the 1981 Academy Award -winning Hungarian film &apos;&apos;Mephisto&apos;&apos;. [ Benson 1988 243 ] Through the same route came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, [ Smith 2002 195 ] although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film. [ Chapman 2009 135 ] For the femme fatale, Director Irvin Kershner selected former model and Playboy cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush – the name coming from one of the early scripts of &apos;&apos;Thunderball&apos;&apos;. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 155 ] Carrera&apos;s performance as Fatima Blush earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, [ Barbara Carrera http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28374 Official Golden Globe Award Website Hollywood Foreign Press Association 2 September 2011 ] which she lost to Cher for her role in Silkwood. [ Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/category_year/608 Official Golden Globe Award Website Hollywood Foreign Press Association 3 September 2011 ] Micheline Connery, Sean&apos;s wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a hotel in London and suggested her to Connery, which he agreed upon. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 155 ] For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter may make him more memorable. [ Benson 1988 243 ] Others cast included comedian Rowan Atkinson, who would later parody Bond in his role of Johnny English. [ Johnny English http://plrcatalogue.pearson.com/Samples/PRFS_058277957X.pdf Penguin Readers Factsheets 5 September 2011 2003 ] Former Eon Production&apos;s editor and director of On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service, Peter R.

A number of the crew from the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark were also appointed, including second unit director David Tomblin; director of photography Douglas Slocombe and production designer s Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes.

[ Barnes Hearn 2001 156 ] Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983. [ Benson 1988 240 ] Production on the film was troubled [ Smith 2002 199 ] with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 156 ] Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that whilst he was a good businessman &quot; he didn&apos;t have the experience of a film producer &quot;. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 156 ] After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make. [ Smith 2002 199 ] Many of the elements of the Eon-produced Bond films were not present in Never Say Never Again for legal reasons. These included the gunbarrel sequence, where a screen full of 007 symbols appeared instead, and similarly there was no &apos;James Bond Theme&apos; to use, although no effort was made to supplement another tune. [ Benson 1988 240 ] Never Say Never Again did not use a pre-credits sequence, which was filmed but not used; [ Smith 2002 193 ] instead the film opens with the credits run over the top of the opening sequence of Bond on a training mission. [ Barnes Hearn 2001 156 ] [ Music ] The music for Never Say Never Again was written by Michel Legrand, who composed a score similar to his work as a jazz pianist.

[ Benson 1988 243 ] Legrand also wrote the main theme &quot; Never Say Never Again &quot;, which featured lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman —who had also worked with Legrand in the Academy Award winning song &quot; The Windmills of Your Mind &quot; [ Academy Awards Database Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 4 September 2011 ] —and was performed by Lani Hall.

[ Contemporary reviews ] Never Say Never Again was broadly welcomed and praised by the critics: Ian Christie, writing in the Daily Express, said that Never Say Never Again was &quot; one of the better Bonds &quot;, [ Christie Ian A Hero&apos;s Return 30 August 2011 Daily Express 18 December 1988 20 ] finding the film &quot; superbly witty and entertaining, …the dialogue is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative. &quot; Christie also thought that &quot; Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero. &quot; David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: &quot; Connery...is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way &quot;. [ Robinson David Never Say Never Again (PG) 30 August 2011 The Times 16 December 1983 10 ] For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo &quot; very nearly make it all worthwhile. &quot; The reviewer for &apos;&apos;Time Out&apos;&apos; summed up Never Say Never Again saying &quot; The action&apos;s good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff. &quot; [ Never Say Never Again (1983) http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/63241/never-say-never-again.html 30 August 2011 Time Out ] Derek Malcolm in The Guardian showed himself to be a fan of Connery&apos;s Bond, saying the film contains &quot; the best Bond in the business &quot;, [ Malcolm Derek True to his Bond 30 August 2011 The Guardian 15 December 1983 16 ] but nevertheless did not find Never Say Never Again any more enjoyable than the recently released Octopussy (starring Roger Moore), or &quot; that either of them came very near to matching &apos;&apos;Dr. No&apos;&apos; or &apos;&apos;From Russia with Love&apos;&apos;. &quot; Malcolm&apos;s main issue with the film was that he had a &quot; feeling that a constant struggle was going on between a desire to make a huge box-office success and the effort to make character as important as stunts. &quot; Malcolm summed up that &quot; the mix remains obstinately the same-up to scratch but not surpassing it. &quot; Writing in The Guardian&apos;s sister paper, The Observer, Philip French noted that &quot; this curiously muted film ends up making no contribution of its own and inviting damaging comparisons with the original, hyper-confident Thunderball &quot;. [ French Philip Thunderball recycled 30 August 2011 The Observer 18 December 1983 Philip French 31 ] French concluded that &quot; like an hour-glass full of damp sand, the picture moves with increasing slowness as it approaches a confused climax in the Persian Gulf. &quot; Writing for Newsweek, critic Jack Kroll thought the early part of the film was handled &quot; with wit and style &quot;, [ Kroll Jack Back in the Bond Business 31 August 2011 Newsweek 10 October 1983 93 ] although he went on to say that the director was &quot; hamstrung by Lorenzo Semple&apos;s script &quot;. Richard Schickel, writing in &apos;&apos;Time&apos;&apos; magazine was praising of the film and its cast. He wrote that Klaus Maria Brandauer&apos;s character was &quot; played with silky, neurotic charm &quot;, [ Schickel Richard Cinema: Raking Up the Autumn Leavings http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C952223%2C00.html#ixzz1Vl0PhpEl 31 August 2011 &apos;&apos;Time&apos;&apos; 17 October 1983 ] whilst Barbara Carrera, playing Fatima Blush, &quot; deftly parodies all the fatal femmes who have slithered through Bond&apos;s career &quot;. Schickel’s highest praise was saved for the return of Connery, observing &quot; it is good to see Connery&apos;s grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond&apos;s cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore&apos;s mere twirpishness. &quot; Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, was broadly praising of the film, saying she thought that Never Say Never Again &quot; has noticeably more humor and character than the Bond films usually provide. It has a marvelous villain in Largo. &quot; [ Maslin Janet Sean Connery is Seasoned James Bond 31 August 2011 The New York Times 7 October 1983 13 ] Maslin also thought highly of Connery in the role, observing that &quot; in Never Say Never Again, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill. &quot; Writing in The Washington Post, Gary Arnold was fulsome in his praise, saying that Never Say Never Again is &quot; one of the best James Bond adventure thrillers ever made &quot;, [ Arnold Gary &apos;Never&apos;: Better Than Ever; Sean Connery Rides Again in the Best of Bonds 31 August 2011 The Washington Post 6 October 1983 E1 ] going on to say that &quot; this picture is likely to remain a cherished, savory example of commercial filmmaking at its most astute and accomplished. &quot; Arnold went further, saying that &quot; Never Say Never Again is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation &quot;. The critic for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott, also praised the film, saying that Never Say Never Again &quot; may be the only instalment of the long-running series that has been helmed by a first-rate director &quot;. [ Scott Jay A first-rate director works wonders: The classiest Bond of all 31 August 2011 The Globe and Mail 7 October 1983 ] According to Scott, the director, with high quality support cast, resulted in the &quot; classiest of all the Bonds &quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ out of 4 stars, and wrote that Never Say Never Again, while consisting of a basic &quot; Bond plot &quot;, was different from other Bond films: &quot; For one thing, there&apos;s more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo. &quot; [ http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F19831007%2FREVIEWS%2F310070301%2F1023 Never Say Never Again Ebert Roger 7 October 1983 rogerebert.com 18 October 2008 ] Ebert went on to add, &quot; there was never a Beatles reunion...but here, by God, is Sean Connery as Sir James Bond. Good work, 007. &quot; [ Reflective reviews ] Because Never Say Never Again is not an Eon-produced film, it has not been included in a number of subsequent reviews.

When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don&apos;t work because viewers usually can’t tell the hero and villain apart and they know doubles are being used? &quot; [ Peary 1986 296 ] [ Legacy ] In the 1990s, McClory announced plans to make another adaption of the Thunderball story, Warhead 2000 AD, with Timothy Dalton in the lead role, but this was eventually scrapped.
