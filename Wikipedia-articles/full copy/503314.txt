Graves graduated from Southwest High School in 1944, and spent two years in the United States Army Air Force near the end of World War II. He then enrolled at the University of Minnesota on the G.I.

Graves was the only original cast member to return as a regular (although others made guest appearances). { InBaseline Database } The series was filmed in Australia, and Graves made his third journey there for acting work. The new version of Mission: Impossible lasted for two seasons, ending in 1990. Bookending his work on Mission: Impossible, Graves starred in two pilot films called Call to Danger, which were an attempt to create a Mission: Impossible-style series in which Graves played a government agent (the Bureau of National Resources) who recruited civilians with special talents for secret missions. [ 0453002 Call to Danger (1968) (TV) ] [ 0069835 Call to Danger (1973) (TV) ] { InBaseline Database } The 1960s version of the pilot, according to Patrick White in The Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier (which White reports was actually the second such pilot, but Graves was not involved in the first), is credited with winning Graves the role of Phelps; after Mission: Impossible ended in 1973, Graves filmed a third version of the pilot (this one structured as a made-for-TV movie ), but it did not sell as a series. The concept was later used in the brief 1980s adventure series Masquerade. { America: A Call to Greatness &apos;&apos; (1995) with } { Charlton Heston, } { Mickey Rooney and } { Deborah Winters } Graves with wife Joan Endress in October 2009 During the 1990s, he hosted the documentary series Biography on A &amp; E. { InBaseline Database } He also acted in a number of films featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, which subsequently featured running jokes about Graves&apos; Biography work and presumed sibling rivalry with Arness.

In 1995, Graves starred with Charlton Heston, Mickey Rooney and Deborah Winters in the Warren Chaney docudrama, America: A Call to Greatness. { America: A Call to Greatness Website } In the 1996 film update of Mission: Impossible, the character of Phelps (played by Jon Voight ) was re-imagined as a traitor who murders three fellow IMF agents only to be killed himself at the end of the film, a decision that disappointed Graves. On October 30, 2009, Graves was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
