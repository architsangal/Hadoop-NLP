[ right ] The following is a list of United States cities, towns, and census-designated places in which a majority (over 50% or close to it) of the population is Hispanic or Latino, according to data from the 2010 Census. This list does not include cities such as Los Angeles, California or Houston, Texas in which, according to the 2010 Census, merely a plurality (as opposed to a majority) of the residents are Hispanic. The list below is organized by state and, within each state, by population size. The percentage of each city&apos;s population that is Hispanic is listed in parentheses next to the city&apos;s name. The largest city with a Hispanic majority is San Antonio, Texas, and the highest percentage for any major U.S. city is El Paso, Texas at 82.2%. Nineteen states do not have any communities that are majority-Hispanic. The following demographics are from the 2010 census. Note: According to the U.S. Census, Hispanics can be of any race.
