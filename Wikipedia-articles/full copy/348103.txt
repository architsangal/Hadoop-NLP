Through his work with the band, Cocker became a figurehead of the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s. [ COMMON PEOPLE – THE STORY OF PULP BBC http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/documentaries/pulp.shtml ] Following Pulp&apos;s hiatus, Cocker has led a successful solo career, and currently presents his own radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music, Jarvis Cocker&apos;s Sunday Service. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ptsjd Jarvis&apos;s Sunday Service BBC 11 March 2012 ] [ Career ] [ Pulp ] [ Pulp (band) ] Cocker founded &quot; Arabacus Pulp &quot; (named after a tradeable commodity he saw in an economics class) at the age of 15 while he was still at The City School. After numerous line-up changes, and a shortening of the name to &quot; Pulp &quot;, they eventually found fame in the 1990s with the success of the albums His &apos;n&apos; Hers (1994) and Different Class (1995). As Pulp&apos;s front-man, part of his trademark image was his glasses, which seemed to &quot; stay magically on his face &quot; no matter his antics on stage, apparently this was achieved with &quot; a huge rubber band round the back &quot;. [ In Search of the Holy Whale BBC Radio 4FM 22 January 2011 22 January 2011 ] Pulp released two more albums ( This Is Hardcore and We Love Life ) to critical acclaim, though neither achieved the commercial success of Different Class. After releasing a greatest hits album, the band was on hiatus from 2003 to 2010, but returned to activity in 2011. Cocker is also renowned for his wit and observations of the cultural scene. He was a frequent guest on TV shows in the 1990s, as well as hosting an arts series for the Channel 4 – &quot; Journeys into the Outside &quot;. Here he took a trip across the globe, meeting so-called &quot; outsider artists &quot;, people who create wacky and wonderful works of art, and trying to understand what compels them to do so. Cocker&apos;s penchant for TV appearances was reflected in a parody of &quot; Common People &quot; ( &quot; Showbiz People &quot; ) which was featured on the satirical comedy show Spitting Image in 1996. [ BRIT Awards incident ] [ BRIT Awards#Michael Jackson and Jarvis Cocker (1996) ] Cocker invaded the stage at the 1996 BRIT Awards in a spur of the moment protest against Michael Jackson &apos;s performance. Jackson was performing his hit &quot; Earth Song &quot; while surrounded by children and a rabbi. Cocker and his friend Peter Mansell (a former Pulp member) performed an impromptu stage invasion in protest. Cocker was detained and interviewed by the police on suspicion of assault. He was accompanied by comedian Bob Mortimer, a former solicitor, who represented him in that capacity. He was subsequently released without charge. Opinions from the press on Cocker&apos;s actions were mixed. The 2 March 1996 edition of Melody Maker, for example, suggested Cocker should be knighted, and Noel Gallagher of Oasis said that &quot; Jarvis Cocker is a star &quot; and should be awarded an MBE. Regarding his actions, Cocker said, &quot; My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn&apos;t make any contact with anyone as far as I recall. &quot; [ http://www.mlp.cz/space/opatrilp/Pulp/the_Brits_96.html [SPACE &amp; #93; Jarvis&apos; stage invasion at the 1996 Brits Mlp.cz 10 March 2009 ] On 2 July 2009 he appeared as a panellist on BBC TV&apos;s Question Time. He said that Jackson&apos;s recent death had been over-hyped by the media. When asked what he objected to about Michael Jackson at the time of the BRIT Award incident, he reiterated his earlier comments about Jackson and Christ (whilst admitting he himself wasn&apos;t religious). When asked, &quot; Otherwise as a performer you thought he was a genius? &quot; Cocker replied, &quot; He invented the moonwalk. &quot; [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DLCI6zmVOf14%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dfvw Jarvis Cocker reaction to Michael Jackson death (Question Time) youtube 16 September 2009 ] [ Solo career ] [ Jarvis: 2006–2008 ] At the 2006 Reading festival, the video for &quot; Running the World &quot; was played on the main video screens of the main stage throughout the day, notably before the headline act, Muse, performed.

Around the record&apos;s release, Cocker participated in a project proposing to tackle the question, &quot; What is Music? &quot; It was designed to enter into the debate over the future of the music industry. &quot; Does this mean, &quot; asked the singer, &quot; that music can now go back to being an art form again? Also, what happens if you get a band to rehearse in an art gallery instead of a rehearsal space? &quot; [ http://jarviscocker.net/news/jarvis-cocker-is-making-an-exhibition-of-himself Jarvis Cocker.net Jarvis Cocker.net 13 April 2011 ] Consequently, Cocker and his band installed themselves in an art gallery in Paris for five days.
