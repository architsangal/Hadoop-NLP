Arecibo is spread over 18 wards and Arecibo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). Arecibo is located on the north coast of the island of Puerto Rico, about 50 miles (80  km) west of San Juan, or approximately a 1-hour trip by car. It is the largest municipality by area in Puerto Rico and is part of the San Juan, Caguas and Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. Arecibo is known as El Diamante Del Norte (The Diamond of the North) as well as La Ribera del Arecibo (The shore of Arecibo). Arecibo is also known as La Villa del Capitán Correa (Captain Correa&apos;s Villa) after the Puerto Rican hero Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa, who as a member of the Spanish Army defended Arecibo from a British invasion led by rear-admiral William Whetstone on August 5, 1702. With 2 British Navy ships and 40 men, Whetstone tried to take control of the city; so Cpt. Antonio Correa ambushed him, killing 22 British seamen. The Spanish defenders only had one soldier killed in action (KIA) and 3 soldiers wounded in action (WIA). The nearby Arecibo Observatory is known for housing the world&apos;s largest radio telescope. Arecibo is also the head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arecibo. [ History ] Arecibo, settled in 1556, was the island&apos;s third Spanish settlement, after Caparra (which later became San Juan ), and San German. It is named after the Taíno Cacique Xamaica Arasibo, who ruled the Taino Yucayeque (town), then named Abacoa. Arecibo was officially founded as a city by the Spanish crown May 1, 1616, under the governorship of Captain Felipe de Beaumont y Navarra, when the King of Spain granted the land (and the Taino s living there) to Lope Conchillos. [ Geography ] Arecibo is located in the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico, extending further inland into the Karst region. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean; north of Utuado; east of Hatillo; and west of Barceloneta and Florida. The city occupies an area of 127 square miles (330  km 2 ), of which, [ 45.23 sqmi km2 on ], is water. { http://www.topuertorico.org/city/arecibo.shtml } The Rio Grande de Arecibo is the main river in the municipality, running through the middle of it. South of the municipality, in the karst region, it forms the Dos Bocas Lake, a primary source of water for Northern Puerto Rico. Several rivers feed the Rio Grande, including the Tanama River. East of the river, lies Caño Tiburones, a marshland area. Arecibo has two forest reserves. Cambalache State Forest is located along the Barceloneta city limits, while Rio Abajo State Forest is located between Arecibo and Utuado. Caves include Cueva Ventana, which overlooks a valley formed by the Rio Grande de Arecibo, and La Cueva del Indio (Cave of the Indian), where paintings made by Indians have been sighted.

The original church was built towards the middle of the 17th century and was destroyed by an earthquake in 1787, construction of a new one began soon after, although it was not completed until 1846. Four days after its dedication another quake seriously damaged it, and still in 1875 necessitated repairs were not completed until 1882. The 1918 earthquake damaged the vault so badly it was replaced by a flat concrete roof; a vaulted ceiling of composition board was placed inside. The cathedral of Arecibo is Puerto Rico&apos;s second largest church after the Cathedral of San Juan. The plan is rectangular with three naves; the side naves are cut short to allow large flanking chapels which occupy almost half the length of the church. The apse is semicircular, and has an unusual half-dome covering it. The facade is a triangular composition of three stages, although the top stage, a short central tower, is a later addition, according to local architects and historians. Neoclassic ornamentation is used in an academic fashion on the lowest stage, but the other two show a less traditional use of bands and pilasters. The Renaissance style windows are uncommon in Puerto Rican churches, but the central tower over the entrance is frequently seen throughout the island. City Hall City Hall The City Hall built in 1866, served as jail to &quot; El Grito de Lares &quot; participants in 1868. In 1918, the frontal section of the building was destroyed by an earth tremor. Repairs were made and a tower and clock were added to the building. In 1978, the building was restored to its original form. The City Hall of Arecibo is typical of these regional seats of government. It is relatively modest in size, of stuccoed masonry, with an academically correct composition having a pedimented center pavilion which projects slightly. The lower story is rusticated, with arched openings, the three doorways in the center giving the effect of a loggia. The upper windows all have segmental pediments and balconies; the central trio shares one long balcony. Architectural detailing is modest but the building is graceful and charming. Punta Los Morrillos Lighthouse In 1898 the Spaniards built the Arecibo Lighthouse which was automated in 1964 and is in use today. Today, there is a small park called Arecibo Lighthouse and Historical Park that surrounds the lighthouse. Arecibo Observatory The Arecibo Observatory is the largest single-unit radio telescope ever constructed and one of the world&apos;s most powerful radar-radio telescopes. While the observatory exists to support scientific studies, a number of Hollywood movies have been filmed there, most recently GoldenEye and Contact. The radio telescope was used in 1974 to send the Arecibo message to space.
