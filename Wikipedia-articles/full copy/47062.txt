[ #3333CC ] [ #3399FF ] { Former pupils } { Old Elizabethans } { http://www.qebarnet.co.uk } Queen Elizabeth&apos;s School, Barnet is a boys&apos; grammar school in Barnet, North London, which was founded in 1573 by Edward Underne, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and others, in the name of Queen Elizabeth I. It is one of the most academically successful secondary school s in England and was chosen as The Sunday Times State School of the Year 2007. { Honoured by the Standard: best state schools in London (2009) } { Department for children, schools and families Achievement and attainment tables } { Queen Elizabeth&apos;s School website: State School of the Year } The school is non-denominational, non-fee paying and academically selective. It has a specialist status in Music { OFSTED summary for Queen Elizabeth&apos;s School } and also from April 2009 as a Training School { http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/who_we_are/training_school_status } The school is also known as Queen Elizabeth&apos;s School or simply QE Boys. [ History ] [ Foundation and location ] The school was founded in 1573 by Queen Elizabeth I, petitioned by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and assisted by local alderman Edward Underne. { School Website: History } Elizabeth I &apos;s charter of 1573 describes the school&apos;s purpose thus: { &quot; a grammar school which shall be called The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth for the education, bringing up and instruction of boys and youth, to be brought up in grammar and other learning, and the same to continue for ever, and the said School for one Master and one Usher for ever to continue and remain and that there shall be for ever four-and-twenty discreet, honest governors of the said Free Grammar School. &quot; The London Encyclopedia: Weinreb, Hibbert, Keay and Keay (2008) } The original Tudor building, known as Tudor Hall, was erected in 1577 opposite the Church of St John The Baptist on Wood Street, with money raised by the first governors of the school and by collections in London churches. It was repaired in 1597 and again in 1637. During the 17th century, further extensive repairs were carried out, in spite of a poor financial situation following the Civil War. Financial conditions became progressively more comfortable during the 18th century. { http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/who_we_are/our_history } The trustees of Elizabeth Allen’s Charity, which had been established by her will dated 10 February 1725, gave financial assistance to save it from a state &quot; very ruinous and unfit for habitation &quot;. { The London Encyclopedia: Weinreb, Hibbert, Keay and Keay (2008) } It then became a private boarding school. { The London Encyclopedia: Weinreb, Hibbert, Keay and Keay (2008) } It was closed in 1872 and restored in 1874 with many additions. In 1885 a governor, H E Chetwynd Stapleton, bought a plot of land behind the Jesus Hospital, a building in Wood Street dating back to 1679; today the Stapylton field stands in front of the main School building and is used for rugby and cricket. { http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/who_we_are/our_history } As the number of pupils outgrew the capacity of Tudor Hall, so the school was transferred in 1932 to a new site in Queen’s Road, which backed on to the Stapylton field. It was administered by the South Herts Division of Hertfordshire County Council, until 1965 when it became part of the borough of Barnet. In the 1960s, there were around 550 boys with 150 in the sixth form. Tudor Hall was completely restored in 1968 by the London Borough of Barnet, and is now part of Barnet College. { The London Encyclopedia: Weinreb, Hibbert, Keay and Keay (2008) } [ Grammar school reinstatement ] It returned to its previous selective grammar school status in August 1994, due to opting out of the London borough and becoming a grant-maintained school in 1989. Other schools in London (outer London) did this, and many became partially selective (up to 50%) at this time. In the 1990s it went on to become England&apos;s top state school for A-Levels. { Telegraph: Queen-Elizabeth&apos;s boys show the girls they too can excel (2002), retrieved May 2009 } The girls&apos; school remained a comprehensive. Since 1999, the Headmaster has been Dr John Marincowitz, who commissioned the new Martin swimming pool, opened in 2006, Shearly Hall, opened in 2009, and a digital library which is currently in construction. In 2011, Neil Enright became Headmaster. [ Jeremy Corbyn ] After the school became selective again, many parents flocked to the school, and not just from the borough of Barnet. It was offering what many schools in London could not. One parent was Claudia Bracchitta, the wife of staunchly left-wing Jeremy Corbyn (who himself attended Adams&apos; Grammar School in Shropshire ). She wanted their son to go to the school and not a comprehensive, the Holloway School. { http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/may/13/uk.politicalnews2 Jeremy Corbyn&apos;s wife&apos;s argument over school in May 1999 } This led to the left-wing MP and his wife separating. They had been married for 12 years. She said I could not compromise my son&apos;s future for my husband&apos;s career. [ Culture and sports ] Queen Elizabeth&apos;s School is divided into six houses, named after famous old boys, patrons and former teachers. They are Broughton, Harrisons&apos;, Leicester, Pearce, Stapylton and Underne. { School Website: Houses } There are many inter-house competitions, from rugby to creative writing. The inter-house debating tournaments, for all years, take place at the end of the year and are probably the most fiercely contested non-physical inter-house competition. Rugby union, played during the Winter and Spring terms, is compulsory for boys in their first four years at the school, as are cross-country running and most other school sports, which include orienteering, swimming, basketball, tennis, cricket, Eton Fives and athletics. { ___extra_curricular qebarnet.co.uk: Clubs and Extra curricular } { ___extra_curricular/our_clubs___activities qebarnet.co.uk: List of Clubs and Activities } QE is well known for not practising football in lessons or playing football competitively against other schools. A particularly boggy part of the cross-country route, suitably nicknamed the &apos;Elephant Dip&apos;, due to its depth, links Barnet Rugby Club and the north-west gate of the bottom fields. There is much competition in the Summer term when frequent competitions between houses are held before the summer examinations begin in June, including the QE Sevens Tournament which takes place in the school for the U14&apos;s and U16&apos;s it is normally held at the end of the Spring Term. { qebarnet.co.uk: PE } [ Sixth form ] Boys usually choose four subjects which will be studied for both AS and A-level, although provision can be made for five to be taken. These subjects can only be chosen after receiving recommendations from that subject teacher. Entry to the Sixth Form is dependent on gaining enough such recommendations [ April 2009 ]. All boys in the Sixth Form are made to wear a suit.One of the main focuses of sixth form is preparation for entry into higher education. As a result the school focuses on career advice, the UCAS application process, personal statements, finance and other things related to university entry. The school also encourages that students partake in a wide range of extra curricular actives both outside of and during school time, and students who do not take part in sport on Wednesday afternoons take up voluntary service in the community. [ Founder&apos;s Day Fête ] The Founder&apos;s Day Fête, and the preceding service of celebration at St John the Baptist&apos;s Church, Barnet, is the largest cultural event in the school calendar. Steeped in tradition, it is held every year, regardless of weather, on the third Saturday in June, and celebrates the founding of the school in 1573. { Friends of QE Founder&apos;s Day Fete } { ___forthcoming_fqe_events qebarnet.co.uk Friends of QE events } All Year 7 boys must attend the church service. The governors also attend, as do most teachers, in academic dress. The head boys, past and present, are readers at the service [ April 2009 ], and the school choir sings. The boys then walk back to the school along Wood Street and prepare for the roll call on Staplyton Field. This is again compulsory for all of Year 7, with five boys from each house attending from all other senior years. In the past, this was compulsory for the whole school. The boys troop in from the two wings of the main building and form three lines stretching across the School Field. The boys of each house sit together, although traditionally they had to stand. [ April 2009 ] The Fête itself is attended by some three thousand people every year, and is a source of funds for the school. [ Kerala partnership ] QE Boys has formed a long-term successful partnership with a school in Kerala called the Shri Sathya Sai School, funded by the &apos; Sathya Sai Appeal&apos;. In addition, the school has strong links with charities through the house system, and each house holds at least one event a year to generate funds for its associated charity. [ Traditions ] [ August 2009 ] The name of every head boy of the school is written on two boards in the school&apos;s main hall. Each house has its own colour, shown on the school uniform ties. The colours used to be on the boys&apos; caps, but these are no longer worn. Red denotes Broughton, Brown for Harrisons&apos;, Yellow for Leicester, Purple for Pearce, Blue for Stapylton and Green for Underne. Different ties are used denote achievement or position, e.g. school prefects can be identified with their ties which are patterned with thick light-blue stripes. [ Academic performance ] In 2007, QE came first in the A-Level league table for state schools, and twelfth in the GCSE league table for state schools. { Daily Mail: A-grades all the way as grammar school gulf grows } { Telegraph: Two Grammars Lead the Field } In 2008 QE again topped the league table in A-level results and a record number of 37 pupils gained a place in Oxbridge Universities. { qebarnet.co.uk: QE is top state school } { Telegraph. Grammar tops table for third year in a row } In 2009 QE topped the league table in A-level results for the third consecutive year.

H. Jenkins (1972) Elizabethan Headmaster 1930-1961 } The future headmaster of Eton John Lewis briefly taught Latin in the early 1970s. [ Criticisms ] [ Admissions procedure ] There have been calls throughout the United Kingdom for the end of selective grammar schools in favour of selection by distance to school or lottery. { Independent: Top Grammar under siege (1998) } The school was also on a list of schools breaching admissions laws in England. { Balls names schools that broke rules } [ Academic league tables ] In the 1990s the school frequently gave leave-or-be-expelled ultimatums to boys in trouble, which were allegedly aimed at passing lower-performing students on to other schools. This led in the mid 1990s to QE Boys becoming national news, with this practice dubbed ‘Eamonn’s Hit List’, referring to the head teacher, Eamonn Harris. Most notably, The Times Education supplement ran a front page with a sizeable cartoon of Mr Harris. [ November 2010 ]. The school has been criticised for its attitude to Sixth Form admissions by many parents and commentators. { Francis Beckett &quot; Not Good Enough &quot;, The Guardian, 18 January 2005 } [ References ] [ External links ] [ London Schools ] Queen Elizabeth&apos;s School website Old Elizabethans EduBase [ News items ] &apos;&apos;Telegraph&apos;&apos; August 2009 &apos;&apos;Observer&apos;&apos; May 1999 Category:Boys&apos; schools in London Category:Music Colleges in London Category:1573 establishments in England Category:Educational institutions established in the 1570s Category:Academies in Barnet Category:Grammar schools in Barnet Category:Training schools in England Category:Schools with Combined Cadet Forces
