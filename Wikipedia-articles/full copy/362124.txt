(advertising slogan) www.baskin-robbins.com ] Baskin-Robbins is a global chain of ice cream parlors founded by Burt Baskin and Irvine Robbins in 1953, from the merging of their respective ice cream parlors, in Glendale, California. It claims to be the world&apos;s largest ice cream franchise, { Baskin-Robbins About Us } with more than 5,800 locations, 2,800 of which are located in the United States. Baskin-Robbins sells ice cream in over 30 countries. The company is headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts. { &quot; Contact Us. &quot; Baskin-Robbins. Retrieved on January 25, 2010. } The Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlors started as separate ventures from Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins, owning Burt&apos;s Ice Cream Shop and Snowbird Ice Cream respectively. Snowbird Ice Cream featured 21 flavors, a novel concept for the time. When the separate companies merged in 1953, this concept grew to 31 flavors. { http://www.baskinrobbins.com/About/OurHistory.aspx } Baskin-Robbins is known for its &quot; 31 flavors &quot; slogan (which is featured in logo, in pink). The idea for having so many came from the Carson-Roberts advertising agency (which later became Ogilvy &amp; Mather ) in 1953, along with the slogan &quot; Count the Flavors. Where flavor counts. &quot; It also was more than the 28 flavors then famously offered at Howard Johnson&apos;s restaurants. In addition, the number 31 was chosen so a customer could have a different flavor every day of any month. Burt and Irv also believed that people should be able to sample flavors until they found one they wanted to buy ― hence the iconic small pink spoon. [ Corporate history ] { Melrose Avenue in } { Los Angeles, California } { By } 1948, Burt and Irv opened six stores, the first franchise covering the sale of ice cream was executed May 20, 1948, for the store at 1130 South Adams in Glendale (Store #1). Burt and Irv were brothers-in-law. In 1949, the company’s production facility opened in Burbank. They made the decision to sell the stores to the managers, thus becoming one of the first franchised food service businesses [ October 2007 ]. In 1953, Baskin-Robbins hired Carson-Roberts Advertising who recommended adoption of the 31 as well as the pink (cherry) and brown (chocolate) polka dots and typeface that were reminiscent of the circus. The first store that adopted the new 31 look was 804 North Glendale Ave. in Glendale, California in March 1953. Between 1949 and 1962, the corporate firm was Huntington Ice Cream Company. The name succeeded The Baskin-Robbins Partnership and was eventually changed back to Baskin-Robbins, Inc. on November 26, 1962. Baskin-Robbins also was the first to introduce ice cream cake s to the public. Baskin Robbins often still incorporates 31 in its promotions despite offering more flavors. For example, in Malaysia this includes giving 31% off their hand-packed ice cream on the 31st of a month, which invariably causes queues at their outlets. Baskin-Robbins was owned by the founders until purchased in 1967 (just prior to Burt Baskin &apos;s death) by the United Brands Company (United Fruit). In 1972, the company went public for the only time in its history when United Brands sold 17% in an IPO. A year later, British food company J. Lyons and Co. purchased Baskin-Robbins from United Brands and all public stock. J. Lyons then merged with Allied Breweries, becoming Allied-Lyons in 1978. Allied-Lyons then merged with Pedro Domecq S.A. in 1994, becoming Allied Domecq. Baskin-Robbins, Togo&apos;s, and Dunkin&apos; Donuts now comprise Dunkin&apos; Brands, Inc. Dunkin&apos; Brands was part of Allied Domecq until its purchase in 2006 by a group of private equity firms - Bain Capital, Thomas Lee, and The Carlyle Group. { This page, http://www.dunkinbrands.com/aboutus/history.html, at the Dunkin&apos; Brands site (last updated in 2004), confirms the Baskin-Robbins founding date, the J. Lyons purchase (and date), the Allied Breweries merger (and date), and the Pedro Domecq merger (and date). Quotes: &quot; 1946: Baskin-Robbins is founded by Burt Baskins and Irv Robbins. &quot;; &quot; 1973: London-based J. Lyons &amp; Co., Ltd., purchased Baskin-Robbins. &quot;; &quot; 1978: J. Lyons is purchased by Allied Breweries, creating Allied Lyons. &quot;; &quot; 1994: Allied Lyons partners with Pedro Domecq, the leading spirits marketer in Spain and Mexico, to form Allied Domecq. &quot; } In 1999, Baskin-Robbins terminated approximately 200 domestic franchisee agreements in Southern markets it deemed &quot; nonstrategic. &quot; { Spector, Amy. &quot; Ex-Baskin-Robbins franchisees sue chain, open scoop shops. &quot; } { Nation&apos;s Restaurant News, 2001-06-18, p. 4. } These shop owners were notified of the agreement cancellation via a conference call. Over 40 former franchisees united to form a new company, KaleidoScoops, which operates as a cooperative, and is based in Aurora, Illinois. Other former Baskin-Robbins franchisees converted their stores to franchises of McConnell&apos;s (of Santa Barbara, California ), and The Ice Cream Club. Baskin-Robbins has maintained solid, controlled growth through development of stores that combine Dunkin&apos; Donuts and Togo&apos;s. Recently the company announced plans to aggressively grow their standalone locations, actively seeking franchises [ October 2007 ]. Irv Robbins died at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California on May 5, 2008, at age 90. { Co-founder of Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores dies at 90, &apos;&apos;Yahoo News&apos;&apos;, 2008-05-05 } [ Going Viral ] A video that was shot at one of the Baskin-Robbins stores in India went viral after a gang of friends entered the outlet, captured the action and uploaded the video on YouTube. On seeing a long queue at the store, the girl in the video created a scene by throwing a tantrum, much to the amusement (and annoyance) of onlookers. This was caught on camera by one of the friends and then promptly uploaded by another on YouTube.
