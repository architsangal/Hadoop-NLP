The team is part of the East Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The team changed its name from the original Boston Patriots after relocating to Foxborough in 1971, although Foxborough is a suburb of Boston, [ 22 mi km ] away. An original member of the American Football League (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the 1970 merger of those leagues. The team advanced to the playoffs four times before appearing in Super Bowl XX in January 1986, losing to the Chicago Bears. The team also appeared in Super Bowl XXXI in January 1997, losing to the Green Bay Packers. In the 2000s, the Patriots became one of the most successful teams in NFL history. They are third in appearances in a Super Bowl with seven (the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys each have 8), and have the most appearances in the last 25 years. Between 2001–2010, the Patriots set a record for most wins in a decade (126, different from conventionally bounded decades, 2000–2009, 1990–1999, etc.; this record references any ten-year stretch; 2nd is the 1984–1993 San Francisco 49ers, with 120 wins). Between 2001 and 2005, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys ) to win three Super Bowls in four years ( Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, and XXXIX ), and the eighth (and most recent) to win consecutive Super Bowls. The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season. They were defeated again by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI. Under quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots have also compiled the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history, a 21-game streak from October 2003 – October 2004. [ Franchise history ] [ History of the New England Patriots ] &quot; Pat Patriot &quot; logo, used through 1992. On November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team&apos;s official name. The most popular choice—and the one that Sullivan selected—was &quot; Boston Patriots &quot;. Immediately thereafter, The Boston Globe artist Phil Bissell developed the &quot; Pat Patriot &quot; logo. [ Official New England Patriots History http://www.patriots.com/history/index.cfm?ac%3DHistory 2008-01-13 New England Patriots ] The Patriots&apos; time in the AFL saw them struggle most years as they never had a regular home stadium. Nickerson Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park, and Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. They did play in one AFL championship game, following the 1963 season. They lost to the San Diego Chargers 51–10. They would not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years. When the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots were placed in the AFC East division, where they still play today. The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots. The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 23, 1971, the team officially announced they would become the New England Patriots. During the 1970s, the Patriots had some success, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976—as a wild card -team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times. In 1985, they returned to the playoffs, and made it all the way to Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1-15. They changed ownership three times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri, but sold the team two years later to current owner Robert Kraft in 1994. Though Orthwein&apos;s period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach Bill Parcells in 1993. Also a change was made that same year to the Patriots uniforms, changing their primary colors from their traditional red and white to blue and silver, and introducing a new logo. { Article by [[Bill Plaschke ] on Kevin Loh&apos;s design of the new Patriots&apos; logo.] LATIMES.COM. Accessed January 20, 2008. } Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI, which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35–21. Pete Carroll, Parcells&apos;s successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 &amp; 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season. The Patriots&apos; current coach Bill Belichick was hired in 2000, and a new home field, Gillette Stadium was opened in 2002. Under Belichick, the team won three Super Bowls in four years, and finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16–0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games. After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team&apos;s fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were defeated by the Giants to end their bid for a 19–0 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18–1, becoming only one of three teams to go 18–1 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. Those teams, however, won the Super Bowl. [ Season-by-season records ] This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Patriots.

The Cincinnati Bengals joined the AFL in 1968 and played only twice against the Patriots in the last two years of the AFL as an independent league. The two clubs have met 22 times entering 2012 with the Patriots wining 14 times. [ New York Jets rivalry ] The closest geographically has been the rivalry with the New York Jets, who have also been members of the AFC East since its inception in 1970 and played each other in the same division since both teams&apos; foundings in 1960. The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll. Four years later Carroll was fired, and Parcells&apos; assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the day he was named the Jets&apos; head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots. Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets. The rivalry picked up another burst of attention with the trading for former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow to the Jets for the 2012 season. [ Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts rivalry ] The Patriots rivalry with the Colts ran through the two clubs&apos; tenure together in the AFC East (1970-2001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971 as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21-17 New England win; on September 18, 1978 the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34-27 on Monday Night Football; on September 4, 1983 the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29-23 in their final season in Baltimore. The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23-17 on December 8, 1991, and 37-34 on November 15, 1992. However, it was rise of quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning in the early 2000s and the separation of the two clubs in the NFL&apos;s 2002 divisional realignment with formation of the AFC South that led to an increased rivalry between Manning&apos;s Indianapolis Colts and Brady&apos;s Patriots. The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season&apos;s Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning&apos;s rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31-28 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28-7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20-15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady-Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001 as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44-13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38-17. With the formation of the AFC South in 2002 the modern rivalry began on November 30, 2003 in a 38-34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots. The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005, then won twice in 2006; in the AFC Championship Game the Colts erased a 21-6 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38-34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007 meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8-0 Patriots and the 7-0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24-20. The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009&apos;s 4th and 2 game. Manning&apos;s final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31-28 Patriots win. { Oakland Raiders. The Patriots won 49-26. } [ Buffalo Bills rivalry ] Other rivalries over the years have included divisional foes in the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins. The Patriots defeated the Bills 26-8 in a 1963 divisional playoff for the two clubs&apos; only playoff showdown entering 2012. The Bills dominated the rivalry during their O.J. Simpson era, going 11-5 in Simpson&apos;s career in Buffalo; one of his most productive days as a player came on November 23, 1975 when he ran in two touchdowns and caught two more in a 45-31 Bills victory. The Bills also dominated the Patriots in the 1990-93 run of Buffalo Super Bowl appearances, winning seven of eight meetings in that span and winning five in a row in a run that extended into 1994. The Patriots dominated the rivalry in the Bill Belichick era, winning 21 of the first 24 matchups in that period, including 15 in a row following Buffalo&apos;s 31-0 shutout win in September 2003 after acquiring former Patriots safety Lawyer Milloy. [ Miami Dolphins rivalry ] The rivalry between the Patriots and Dolphins involves the two clubs with the most wins in the AFC East (as of the 2011 season ) and the two teams most associated with the quest for perfection, as the 1972 Dolphins posted a perfect season and the 2007 Patriots came within a minute of doing likewise. The Dolphins won 30 matchups during the career of coach Don Shula while Dan Marino won seventeen meetings with New England. The Patriots won fourteen of the first 19 meetings in the Tom Brady era while Matt Cassel was 1-1 in his 2008 season as Patriots quarterback. Cassel&apos;s season with New England saw the Dolphins debut the Wildcat formation in a 38-13 Miami win at Foxboro in September 2008; the Patriots won the season rematch that November in Miami 48-28. The September 4, 1994 meeting between the two clubs at Joe Robbie Stadium was memorable on several levels. It marked the return of Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino after missing most of 1993 due to injury; it marked the debut of new onwership for both teams in Wayne Huizenga for Miami and Robert Kraft for the Patriots; and it was one of the highest-scoring games in the history of the rivalry - the Dolphins won 39-35 on a late Marino touchdown on 4th and 5. Dolphins legend Dan Marino held a 17-13 record against the Patriots, while Tom Brady won 14 of his first 20 meetings with the Dolphins. [ Pittsburgh Steelers rivalry ] During the reign of coaches Bill Parcells, Pete Carroll, and Bill Belichick a bitter rivalry developed with the Pittsburgh Steelers; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in the 1996 AFC Divisional playoff round (28-3); the Steelers triumphed in the divisional round in 1997 (7-6), then the Patriots defeated the Steelers for the AFC Championship in 2001 (24-17) and 2004 (41-27). Other notable games between the two clubs include the Halloween 2004 game where the Steelers ended New England&apos;s run of 21 straight wins (winning 34-20) and the 2007 matchup where the Patriots won 34-13 after Steelers safety Anthony Smith brought attention to himself with a public prediction of a Steelers win; the Patriots responded with a flea flicker touchdown over Smith&apos;s head. { 2007 Patriots touchdown against Steelers } Before the 1990s the two clubs met sporadically; the Patriots in 1976 staged a comeback win in Week Three (30-27), and in Week One of 1979 the Steelers won in overtime 16-13. [ San Diego Chargers rivalry ] Also during the Belichick reign a major rivalry developed with the San Diego Chargers. The two clubs were founding members of the AFL in 1960; the Chargers defeated the Patriots in the 1963 AFL Championship game while the Patriots defeated San Diego in the 2006 AFC Divisional playoff game and the 2007 AFC Championship Game. In 2001 former Patriot Doug Flutie led the Chargers to Foxboro but in his third start Tom Brady led a dramatic comeback for a 29-26 overtime Patriots win. [ Other AFL/AFC rivalries ] Some older rivalries that have cooled over the years include the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders; as with San Diego both rivalries date to the inauguration of the American Football League in 1960. The rivalry with the Raiders reached an apex in the 2001 Tuck Rule Game that sent the Patriots to the 2001 AFC Championship Game. Prior to 2001 the rivalry was known for the 1976 &quot; Ben Dreith &quot; playoff game, the 1978 preseason game that paralyzed Patriots receiver Darryl Stingley for life, and the 1985 AFC Divisional playoff win by the Patriots. The two teams also had a memorable shootout on October 16, 1964 ending in a 43-43 tie, the only tie in the rivalry&apos;s history. The rivalry with the Broncos was tight in the AFL era and the 1970s, then was monopolized by Denver during their era with John Elway as quarterback; Elway went a perfect 11-0 against New England. The rivalry produced playoff wins for Denver in 1986 and 2005, but in 2011 the rivalry picked up with the ascension of quarterback Tim Tebow to national prominence. { Piece on Tim Tebow popularity } The Patriots defeated the Broncos 41-23 in the 2011 regular season, then won 45-10 in the AFC Divisional playoff round. The signing of Peyton Manning for 2012 (with subsequent trading of Tebow to the NY Jets ) means the Patriots will face him for the first time since he left the Colts. Other lesser-known rivalries include the Houston Oilers-Tennessee Titans, the Baltimore Ravens, and Kansas City Chiefs. The Titans and Chiefs rivalries both date to the beginning of the AFL as the Patriots, Oilers-Titans, and Chiefs were founding members of the league. The rivalry with the Chiefs has generally not been dominated by either team, with Kansas City&apos;s five-game win streak spanning 1967-73 being the longest streak by either team. The rivalry is best known for Week One of 2008 when safety Bernard Pollard caught Tom Brady on a pass play and seriously injured Brady&apos;s knee, knocking him out for the season. The highest-scoring game in the rivalry came in 2002, a 41-38 overtime Patriots win. The Patriots and Oilers were AFL division rivals in the 1960-69 period; the Patriots edged the Oilers in the AFL era 10-9-1; the lone tie (31-31 score) came on October 13, 1961. The two teams met four times in the 1970s; in 1978 the Oilers erased a 23-0 gap to win 26-23 in the regular season, and the two teams met in the 1978 AFC Divisional playoff round, the Oilers winning 31-14. They also met in a 38-34 Oilers win in 1980 on Monday Night Football. The rivalry reached a new bitterness when the Oilers moved to Tennessee after the 1996 season. The Patriots edged the Oilers in September 1998 in the club&apos;s final season under the Oilers name. Four years after being renamed the Titans they defeated the Patriots 24-7. The Patriots triumphed in a 38-30 game in October 2003 { Recap of 2003 Patriots-Titans game } and then edged the Titans 17-14 in the 2003 AFC Divisional playoff round in bitter cold. Their 2006 game (a 40-23 Patriots win) saw controversy between linebacker Tedy Bruschi and Titans coach Jeff Fisher following injury to safety Rodney Harrison and the bitterness spilled into an August 2007 preseason game between the two (won 27-24 by the Titans). { Rodney Harrison hit on Vince Young 2007 preseason } October 2009 then saw a 59-0 massacre by the Patriots in an unexpected snowstorm as the Patriots broke or tied multiple league and team scoring records. { Patriots 59-0 game vs. Titans } The rivalry with the Ravens began in the Ravens&apos; first season in a 46-38 Patriots win. The rivalry resumed a football rivalry between the New England region and Baltimore that had been discontinued since the March 1984 move of the Colts to Indianapolis. The rivalry has been one-sided, with the Patriots winning the first six regular-season meetings. The rivalry began picking up steam in 2007 when the Patriots erased a late Ravens lead on Monday Night Football to preserve their run to perfection. Following a 27-21 New England win in October 2009, the Ravens crushed the Patriots 33-14 in the 2009 AFC Wildcard playoff. The Patriots won in overtime 23-20 in the two teams&apos; 2010 regular-season meeting, then the Patriots edged the Ravens 23-20 in the 2011 AFC Championship Game, winning on a missed field goal attempt by the Ravens in the game&apos;s final seconds. The game was also known as Bernard Pollard was once again involved in a play that injured a key Patriots player; a tackle of tight end Rob Gronkowski left Gronkowski with a leg injury that hobbled him in Super Bowl XLVI. The Ravens host the Patriots on NBC Sunday Night Football in 2012; the rivalry before the season became more personal following a John Harbaugh radio interview questioning the integrity of the Patriots&apos; Super Bowl titles. { Harbaugh calls Patriots Super Bowls &quot; Stained &quot; } A frequent playoff rival of the Patriots has been the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Patriots entering 2012 have played the Jaguars five times in the regular season and four times in the playoffs; Jacksonville&apos;s wild card round victory in 1998 (25-10) is the Jaguars&apos; only career victory over the Patriots. The rivalry began in 1996 with a dramatic 28-25 overtime victory by the Patriots after the Jaguars erased a 22-0 second-quarter gap; the two teams met in the AFC Championship Game the following January and the Patriots won 20-6 on an Otis Smith fumble recovery. In January 2008 the Patriots extended their 2007 winning streak to 17 straight with a 31-20 win in which Tom Brady (26-28, 262 yards, three touchdowns) compiled an NFL-record 92.9% completion percentage for a playoff game. [ Interconference rivalries ] The Patriots most well-known interconference rivalry is with the New York Giants. The Giants defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl s XLII (derailing their 2007 push to a perfect season) and XLVI; the combined score of the two games was 38-31. The Patriots&apos; two most memorable wins over the Giants came in a December 1996 comeback win 23-22 (where the Patriots erased a 22-0 gap) and the 2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game. The two clubs met in the first ever NFL broadcast for ESPN in 1987. The Patriots have also seen memorable interconference games with the Carolina Panthers (whom they defeated 32-29 in Super Bowl XXXVIII ), the Green Bay Packers (who defeated the Patriots 35-21 in Super Bowl XXXI ), the St. Louis Rams (whom the Patriots defeated 20-17 in Super Bowl XXXVI ), the Chicago Bears (who defeated the Patriots 46-10 in Super Bowl XX ), and the Minnesota Vikings (the Patriots comeback win over the Vikings in 1994 proved to be the team&apos;s turning point in that season). The rivalry with the Bears is best-known from Super Bowl XX and the dominance of Chicago&apos;s 46 defense in that season, yet the Patriots since that game have dominated the rivalry. The Patriots produced a huge comeback win in 2002 by erasing a 27-6 Bears lead and winning 33-30, then edged the Bears 17-13 in 2006 at Gillette Stadium in the stadium&apos;s first game with Field Turf. A subplot of the Patriots&apos; interconference rivalries was the club&apos;s rivalry with quarterback Brett Favre. The Patriots defeated the Packers and third-year starter Favre on October 2, 1994 17-16 as the game lead changed three times in the fourth quarter. Favre defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI and in the 1997 and 2002 regular seasons before the Patriots delivered a 35-0 shutout at Lambeau Field on November 19, 2006. Favre played the Patriots twice in 2008 as Jets quarterback; the Patriots won at The Meadowlands in September in Matt Cassel &apos;s first career NFL start, then the Jets won in overtime in November 34-31. Favre played the Patriots one final time in 2010 with the Vikings; the Patriots won 28-18 on Halloween, and a hit by Myron Pryor knocked Favre out of the game. A lesser-known rivalry is with the Seattle Seahawks, with whom the Patriots have played in the Seahawks&apos; history in both conferences of the NFL. The Seahawks were 7-6 against the Patriots during their 1977-2001 period in the AFC West while the Patriots have won the first two meetings since Seattle&apos;s realignment into the NFC West. In 1984 the Patriots produced their largest ever comeback victory in a 38-23 victory over the Seahawks after erasing a 23-0 Seattle lead; two years later the Seahawks produced a dramatic 38-31 win over the Patriots by outscoring them 24-14 in the fourth quarter; two blocked kicks led to Seattle touchdowns.
