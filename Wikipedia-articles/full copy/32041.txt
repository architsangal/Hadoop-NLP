The Hainish Cycle consists of a number of science fiction novels and stories of Ursula K. Le Guin. Most of them are not set on the planet Hain, but have it as a distant background. People from Hain are often present but mostly as secondary characters. In keeping with Le Guin&apos;s soft science fiction style, the setting is used primarily to explore anthropological and sociological ideas. Notable and award-winning Hainish novels are The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. The short novel The Word for World is Forest and the short story &quot; The Day Before the Revolution &quot; have also won awards. [ Sequence of writing ] In the first three novels— Rocannon&apos;s World, Planet of Exile, and City of Illusions —there is or was a League of all Worlds; in City of Illusions, it seems to have been conquered or fragmented by an alien race, called the Shing, from beyond the League. In the fourth, The Left Hand of Darkness, it seems that the planets of the former League of Worlds have re-united as the Ekumen, which was founded by the Hainish people. The fifth, The Dispossessed, is the earliest chronologically in the Hainish Cycle. The Cetians have been visited by people from other planets, including Earth and Hain. The various planets are separate, though there is some talk of a union. The idea of an ansible is known but none yet exists - Shevek&apos;s new physics may be - in fact, eventually is - the key. The sixth, The Word for World is Forest, has the League of Worlds and the ansible as new creations. The term &apos;Ekumen&apos; is not used. Later novels and short stories speak only of the Ekumen, which now includes the Gethenians, who were the subject of The Left Hand of Darkness. [ Back Story ] Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the people of Hain colonized a large number of worlds, including Earth, known as Terra. Most of these were similar enough that humans from one world can pass as natives of another, but on some the Old Hainish &apos;Colonisers&apos; used genetic engineering. At least one of the various species of Rokanan are the product of genetic engineering, as are the &apos;hilf&apos; of Planet S (whose story has not so far been told), and the androgyne s of Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness. The Ekumen do not know whether the Colonisers sought to adapt humans to varied worlds, were conducting various experiments, or had other reasons. Hainish civilization subsequently collapsed and the colony planets (including Earth) forgot that other human worlds existed. The Ekumen stories tell of the efforts to re-establish a civilization on a galactic scale through NAFAL (Nearly As Fast As Light) interstellar travel taking years to travel between stars, although only weeks or months from the viewpoint of the traveler, because of time dilation, and through instantaneous interstellar communication using the ansible. This seems to have happened in two phases. First the League of All Worlds was formed, as an alliance of planets, mostly descended from colonization efforts from the planet Hain, uniting the &quot; nine known worlds &quot; { The Dispossessed } - along with colonies, presumably. By the time of Rocannon&apos;s World it has grown but is also under threat from a distant enemy. It is destroyed by aliens called the Shing, who have the ability to lie in Mindspeech. After the apparent overthrow of the Shing by Terran descendants from Alterra/Werel, the alliance is eventually reconstructed as the Ekumen. In City of Illusions it is recalled as a league of some 80 worlds. The second phase begins with The Left Hand of Darkness. The 80-plus planets seem to have reunited as the &apos;Ekumen&apos; – a name derived from the Greek &quot; oikoumene &quot;, meaning &quot; the inhabited world &quot;, though characters occasionally refer to it as &quot; the Household &quot;, { The Left Hand of Darkness } which is in turn a reference to the Greek &quot; oikos &quot;, a word which developed from the same root as oikoumene. Unexplained references are made to the &apos;Age of the Enemy.&apos; [ Planets of the Hainish Cycle ] [ Planets of the Hainish Cycle ] The Hainish Cycle contains a very large number of planets and is continually exploring new ones. Genly Ai in The Left Hand of Darkness explains that there are 83 planets in the Ekumen, with Gethen a candidate for becoming the 84th. [ Technology ] Societies tend to use sophisticated but unobtrusive technologies. Most notable is the ansible, an instant-communication device that keeps worlds in touch with each other. Physical communication is by NAFAL ships, Nearly As Fast As Light. The physics is never explained: the ship vanishes from where it was and reappears somewhere else many years later. { Vaster than Empires and More Slow } The trip takes slightly longer than it would to cross the same distance at the speed of light, but ship-time is just a few hours for those on board. It cannot apparently be used for trips within a solar system. Trips can begin or end close to a planet, but if used without a &quot; retemporalizer &quot;, there are drastic physical effects at the end of long trips. { City of Illusions } It is also lethal if the traveler is pregnant. { The Shobies&apos; Story } City of Illusions mentions automatic death-machines that work on the ansible principle and can strike instantly at distant worlds. Such a device is clearly used in the events of Rocannon&apos;s World. They are not mentioned again in later books. ChuChurten theory, as developed by the physicists of Anarres, should allow people to go instantly from solar system to solar system. It is a development of the work of Shevek, whose tale is told in The Dispossessed. Shevek&apos;s work made the ansible possible - it is mentioned in his tale that engineers decided they could build it once the correct theory was found. Churten theory offers a way to move whole spacecraft instantaneously, but there are side-effects. These are described in two short stories, &quot; The Shobies&apos; Story &quot; and &quot; Dancing to Ganam &quot;, both of which appeared in A Fisherman of the Inland Sea. It should be noted that the ansible has been adopted by several other science fiction and fantasy authors, such as Orson Scott Card, Elizabeth Moon, and Vernor Vinge. [ Post-technological worlds ] The idea of post-technological societies and social collapse comes into several of these stories: In City of Illusions, Earth has suffered some sort of collapse in a distant future, losing contact with the stars. In &quot; Another Story &quot; in A Fisherman of the Inland Sea, it is mentioned that Earth still suffers badly from pollution. Eleven-Soro had a high technology and then a massive crash, as is told in the short story &quot; Solitude &quot; in The Birthday of the World. Hain itself has gone back to a simpler life with high technology only where it is justified, as is told in the first part of &quot; A Man of the People &quot; in Four Ways to Forgiveness. This also seems to apply to planet Ve. Orint and Kheakh are mentioned in passing as worlds that have totally destroyed themselves. In The Left Hand Of Darkness, the planet Gde is described as extremely hot rock and desert, the result of a technological society that &quot; wrecked its ecological balance &quot; some millennia previous, and &quot; burned up its forests for kindling. &quot; [ Biology ] Most of the people in the tales have a common descent from the planet Hain, which settled many surrounding worlds. Mostly they remain similar and can marry and have children. The unusual hairyness of the Cetians is mentioned in The Word for World is Forest and The Dispossessed - though to Cetians, it seems that other types of human have unusually little hair. The Telling includes the detail that the people of Chiffewar are all bald. There are some cases of ancient biological manipulation: Unique among known humans, the Hainish have complete voluntary control of their fertility. In order for a Hainish man and woman to reproduce, they must both consciously choose to produce viable genetic material, which they learn to do in adolescence. The required genetic changes to the Hainish population were made in the far distant past, and apparently took many generations to accomplish. A Man of the People (Hain) The Left Hand of Darkness mentions that the &apos;hilfs of S&apos; must have been produced by human genetic manipulation by the ancient Hainish people, along with the Gethenians and the degenerate winged hominoids of Rokanan. The hermaphrodite humans of Gethen may have been produced as an adaptation to a harsh climate, or an experiment to see how people would live without gender. Both ideas are mentioned and nothing is definitely settled. The degenerate winged hominoids are seen in Rocannon&apos;s World. They live in cities that require much higher technology to build than the rest of the races on Rokanan, but live in bat-like societies, hunting for humans and animals on which their larvae feed by sucking their blood. We hear no more about the &apos;hilfs of S&apos;, unless these are the same as the small furry natives of Athshe (who are of Hainish descent, like the various other humans and quasi-humans). The Matter of Seggri tells us that the extreme gender imbalance of the people of Seggri may be another case of genetic manipulation. Alterrans with their distinctive cat-like eyes are nevertheless able to breed with Earth-humans. They may be another case of genetic manipulation, or a natural adaptation. The Shing of City of Illusions seem to be of some other origin: they cannot interbreed with Earth-humans.
