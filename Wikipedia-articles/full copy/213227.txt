She was laid down by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 20 June 1903, launched on 3 December 1904, sponsored by Ms. Annie K. Frazier (daughter of Governor James B. Frazier of Tennessee and later the foundress of the Society of Sponsors of the United States Navy ), and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 July 1906, Captain Albert Gleaves Berry in command. [ Operational career ] The new armored cruiser departed Hampton Roads on 8 November 1906 as escort for [ Louisiana BB-19 2 ] in which President Theodore Roosevelt had embarked for a cruise to Panama to check on the progress of work constructing the Panama Canal. After a brief visit to Puerto Rico on the return voyage, the warships arrived back at Hampton Roads on 26 November. Tennessee was present for the Jamestown Exposition held in 1907 to commemorate the tricentennial of the founding of the first English settlement in America. On 14 June, Tennessee sailed for Europe and reached Royan, France on the 23rd for duty with the Special Service Squadron. She returned home in August but departed Hampton Roads on 12 October for the Pacific. Tennessee then patrolled off the California coast until 24 August 1908 but suffered a boiler tube explosion on 5 June, which killed seven men, while steaming at full speed. The explosion occurred just after the rear admiral in charge of the squadron had visited on a tour of inspection; had the explosion taken place a few minutes earlier, he might have been among the casualties. Since the ship&apos;s 16 boilers were sub-divided into separate watertight compartments, the rest of the engineering section was not affected. { The Navy, pp. 24-5 } Once repairs had been made and her tour had ended, Tennessee sailed for Samoa, arriving at Pago Pago on 23 September to resume service with the Pacific Fleet. On 15 May 1910, she arrived at Bahía Blanca to represent the United States at the centenary celebration of the independence of Argentina. On 8 November, the armored cruiser departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, to embark President William Howard Taft for a round trip voyage to Panama to inspect further progress on the canal. She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 November and then engaged in battle practice off the Virginia coast into February 1911. Following a Mardi Gras visit to New Orleans and a visit to New York early in March, the ship steamed to Cuba n waters for two months of operations out of Guantanamo Bay. Placed in reserve at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 15 June 1911, she remained on the east coast for 18 months before departing Philadelphia on 12 November 1912 for the Mediterranean. Arriving off Smyrna (now İzmir ), Turkey on 1 December, she remained there protecting American citizens and property during the First Balkan War until 3 May 1913, when she headed home. After reaching Hampton Roads on the 23rd, Tennessee operated on the East Coast until entering the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 23 October. On 2 May 1914, she became receiving ship at the New York Navy Yard. On 6 August, Tennessee sailed from New York for duty in Europe through the first half of 1915 supporting the American Relief Expedition by carrying gold bullion and other resources to assist in the extraction of American refugees from war-ravaged Europe. In August, she transported the 1st Regiment, Marine Expeditionary Force, and the Marine Artillery Battalion to Haiti. From 28 January-24 February 1916, the cruiser served as flagship of a cruiser squadron off Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In March, she embarked a group of dignitaries at Hampton Roads for a two-month, round trip cruise to Montevideo, Uruguay. On 25 May, Tennessee was renamed Memphis, honoring a city of Tennessee, so that the name &quot; Tennessee &quot; could be reassigned to a new warship, Battleship No. 43. In July 1916, under the command of Captain Edward L. Beach, Sr., the ship got underway for the Caribbean arriving at Santo Domingo on 23 July for peace-keeping patrol off the rebellion-torn Dominican Republic. [ Loss ] Memphis was at anchor [.5 nmi mi km in on ] off a rocky beach in [ 45 ft m on ] of water in the harbor of Santo Domingo on the afternoon of 29 August 1916 with two of her 16 boiler s operating in case she needed to get underway; the gunboat [ Castine PG-6 2 ] also was anchored in the harbor. Shortly after 12:00, Memphis began to roll heavily and Captain Beach observed an unexpected heavy swell developing. Memphis and Castine both made preparations to leave the harbor and began to raise steam; Memphis expected to be able to get underway at about 16:35. The wreck of &apos;&apos;Memphis&apos;&apos; at Santo Domingo on 29 August 1916. Conditions in the harbor had deteriorated badly by 15:45, when Memphis sighted an approaching [ 75 ft m on ] wave of yellow water stretching along the entire horizon. By 16:00, the wave was closer, had turned ochre in color, and had reached about [ 100 ft m on ] in height; at the same time, Memphis was rolling 45°, so heavily that large amounts of water cascaded into the ship via her gun port s and water even was entering the ship via ventilators [ 50 ft m on ] above the waterline. By 16:25, water began to enter the ship via her funnels, [ 70 ft m on ] above the waterline, putting out the fires in her boilers and preventing her from raising enough steam to get underway. She began to strike the rocky harbor bottom at 16:40, damaging her propellers just as she was raising enough steam to begin moving, and her engines lost steam pressure. At about this time, the giant wave Memphis had seen approaching over the past hour arrived; she rolled into a deep trough and was struck immediately by what proved to be three very large waves in rapid succession, the highest of them estimated by the crew to have been [ 70 ft m on ] in height, completely swamping her except for her highest points, and washing crewmen overboard. The waves rolled her heavily, caused her to strike the harbor bottom, then pushed her to the beach [.5 nmi mi km on ] away. By 17:00, she had been driven under cliffs along the coast of the harbor and was resting on the harbor bottom. She was battered into a complete wreck in 90 minutes. Castine, meanwhile, managed to reach safer waters by getting underway and putting to sea through the large waves, although damaged by them and at times in danger of capsizing. { For a description of the loss of Memphis, see Smith, pp. 67-70. } Memphis s casualties, including a boatload of her sailors returning from shore leave, numbered some 40 men dead or missing and 204 badly injured. Due to their heroic actions during this incident, Chief Machinist&apos;s Mate George William Rud, Lieutenant Claud Ashton Jones, and Machinist Charles H. Willey were awarded the Medal of Honor. [ Alternative explanations for the wreck ] In his 1966 account of the incident, The Wreck of the Memphis, Captain Beach s son, Edward L. Beach, Jr., ascribed her loss to an unexpected tsunami (possibly a rogue wave ) exceeding [ 100 ft m on ] in height, { Beach, The Wreck of the Memphis. } and this explanation has been carried forward by most sources discussing her loss. { See, for example, Gardiner, Robert, ed., Conway&apos;s All the World&apos;s Fighting Ships 1860-1905, New York: Mayflower Books, Inc., 1979, ISBN 0-8317-0302-4, p. 149, for another citation of the 100-foot tsunami explanation. } More recent research, however, has called this explanation into question. No record of any seismic event in the Caribbean on 29 August 1916 that could have triggered a tsunami has been found, and the rate of advance of the large wave Memphis reported — about an hour to cross the distance from the horizon to the ship — matches that of a wind-generated ocean wave; a tsunami, in contrast, would have covered the distance in only a few minutes. The periods of the three large waves that struck Memphis also are characteristic of large wind-generated waves rather than tsunamis. { For a discussion of the lack of evidence for a tsunami and the more compelling evidence for freak wind-generated waves having wrecked Memphis, see Smith, pp. 68-69. } A likely source for such large, wind-generated waves in Santo Domingo Harbor on 29 August 1916 does exist, in that three hurricane s active in the Caribbean between August 12 and September 2, 1916, (the first struck Corpus Christi, Texas, on August 18) passed westward just to the south. Waves generated from these storms could well have combined to create a large wave like those that struck and wrecked Memphis. Such a circumstance appears to explain the loss of the ship better than the tsunami theory. { For a discussion of the lack of evidence for a tsunami and the more compelling evidence for freak wind-generated waves having wrecked Memphis, see Smith, pp. 68-69. } Oceanographer Dr. George Pararas-Carayammis in particular published an extensively detailed rebuttal demonstrating that a tusnami could not have caused the foundering of the Memphis, but that the last of the three hurricanes, a category 2 hurricane, likely did, creating a 59-foot wave that reached a breaker height of 90 feet as it approached the Memphis. This swamped the cruiser, ill-advisedly anchored in only 55 feet of water, and would have done so even had the ship been at full maneuvering power. Pararas-Carayammis concluded that had Memphis been anchored in 100-120 feet of water, it would have ridden out the swells including the killer wave. { &quot; The Loss of the USS Memphis on 29 August 1916 - Was a Tsunami Responsible? Analysis of a Naval Disaster &quot; by Dr. George Pararas-Carayannis } [ Final disposition ] Memphis was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 December 1917 and sold to the A. H. Radetsky Iron and Metal Company of Denver, Colorado on 17 January 1922 for scrapping. [ Notes ] [ 2 ] [ References ] [ Jane&apos;s Fighting Ships of World War I Taylor, Michael J.H.
