Her construction was ordered on 25 November 1910, and her keel was laid down on 20 October 1911, at the Kaiserliche Werft Danzig. She was launched on 10 October 1912, and commissioned into the Imperial German Navy on 6 July 1913. [ Service ] From 1 August 1914, to 15 March 1916, U-19 was commanded by Constantin Kolbe. During this period she had the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first U-boat casualty of World War I when she was rammed by [ Badger 1911 6 ] on 29 October 1914. { Destroyers, Antony Preston, ISBN 0-600-32955-0, p29 } Her hull was badly damaged, but she survived and was repaired. He was relieved by Raimund Weisbach, who had previously served as torpedo officer on [ U-20 Germany 2 ] and had (on Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger &apos;s orders) launched the torpedo that sank [ Lusitania ]. During his brief command, Weisbach carried out an unusual mission: he delivered the revolutionary Roger Casement and two other agents to Ballyheige Bay in Ireland in hopes that they would foment an uprising that would distract the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from World War I. Weisbach was relieved on 11 August 1916, by Johannes Spiess, who was relieved in turn on 1 June 1917, by Heinrich Koch. Koch turned the boat over on 25 October 1917, to Hans Albrecht Liebeskind, who commanded for less than a month before being relieved on 17 November 1917, by Johannes Spiess again. On 1 June 1918, Hans Albrecht Liebeskind took over again and commanded U-19 until the end of the war. U-19 conducted 12 patrols, sinking 46 ships totalling 64,816 tons, including Santa Maria (5,383 tons) off Lough Swilly on 25 February 1918, Tiberia (4,880 tons) off Black Head near Larne on 26 February 1918, and [ Calgarian ] (17,500 tons) off Rathlin Island on 1 March 1918. [ Fate ] U-19&apos;s gun today On 11 November 1918, U-19 was surrendered to the British, and wasbroken up at Blyth sometime in 1919 or 1920. The main gun of U19 was donated to the people of Bangor, Co. Down and today sits near the War Memorial in the town&apos;s Ward Park. It was donated by the Admiralty in recognition of the valorious conduct of Commander The Hon. Edward Bingham whilst on board HMS Nestor while fighting in the Battle of Jutland in July 1916 for which he received the Victoria Cross.
