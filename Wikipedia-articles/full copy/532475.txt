[ Camellia Mitsubishi, NTT 2000 E2, MISTY1 CRYPTREC, NESSIE 128, 192 or 256 bits 128 bits Feistel network 18 or 24 ] In cryptography, Camellia is a 128-bit block cipher jointly developed by Mitsubishi and NTT. The cipher has been approved for use by the ISO/IEC, the European Union &apos;s NESSIE project and the Japan ese CRYPTREC project. The cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to the Advanced Encryption Standard. [ Japan&apos;s First 128-bit Block Cipher &apos;Camellia&apos; Approved as a New Standard Encryption Algorithm in the Internet physorg.com 2005 http://www.physorg.com/news5315.html 2010-08-12 ] Camellia&apos;s block size is 16 bytes (128 bit s ), and can use 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key s. The block cipher was designed to be suitable for both software and hardware implementations, from low-cost smart cards to high-speed network systems. [ Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS IETF RFC 4132 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4132.txt 2005 2010-08-12 ] [ Design ] Camellia is a Feistel cipher with either 18 rounds (when using 128-bit keys) or 24 rounds (when using 192 or 256-bit keys). Every six rounds, a logical transformation layer is applied: the so-called &quot; FL-function &quot; or its inverse. Camelliauses four 8 x 8-bit S-boxes with input and output affine transformations andlogical operations. The cipher also uses input and output key whitening. The diffusion layer uses a linear transformation based on an MDS matrix with a branch number of 5. [ Security analysis ] [ August 2010 Security analysis ] Camellia is a block cipher which can be completely defined by minimal systems of multivariate polynomial s. [ What does this sentence say?

[ N. T. Courtois, J. Pieprzyk Cryptanalysis of block ciphers with overdefined systems of equations Springer-Verlag 2002 267–287 http://eprint.iacr.org/2002/044.pdf 2010-08-13 ] The key schedule can be described by 1120 equations in 768 variables using 3328 linear and quadratic terms. The entire block cipher can be described by 5104 equations in 2816 variables using 14592 linear and quadratic terms. In total, 6224 equations in 3584 variables using 17920 linear and quadratic terms are required. The number of free terms is 11696, which is approximately the same number as for AES. Theoretically, such properties might make it possible to break Camellia (and AES ) using an algebraic attack, such as Extended Sparse Linearisation, in the future (provided that the attack becomes feasible). With today&apos;s technology, such an attack would take years to compute, and thus is not realistic. [ Patent status ] Although Camellia is patented, it is available under a royalty-free license. [ Announcement of Royalty-free Licenses for Essential Patents of NTT Encryption and Digital Signature Algorithms NTT 2001-04-17 http://www.ntt.co.jp/news/news01e/0104/010417.html 2006-11-08 ] This has allowed the Camellia cipher to become part of the OpenSSL Project, under an Open-source license, since November 2006.

[ Adoption ] Support for Camellia was added to the final release of Mozilla Firefox 3 in 2008. [ http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2007/07/30/camellia-cipher-added-to-firefox/ Camellia cipher added to Firefox Mozilla Mozilla in Asia July 30, 2009 ] Later in the same year, the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team announced that the cipher had also been included in the FreeBSD 6.4-RELEASE. Also, support for the Camellia cipher was added to the disk encryption storage class geli of FreeBSD by Yoshisato Yanagisawa. In September 2009, GNU Privacy Guard added support for Camellia in version 1.4.10. [ http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2009q3/000291.html GnuPG 1.4.10 released September 2, 2009 ] Moreover, various popular security libraries, such as Crypto++, GnuTLS, PolarSSL and OpenSSL also include support for Camellia.
