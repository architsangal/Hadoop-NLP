[ Bennettsville the settlement in the midwestern United States Bennettsville, Indiana ] [ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1246743 } [ 3 ] Bennettsville is a city located in the U.S. state of South Carolina. It is the county seat of Marlboro County and home to the Bennettsville Historic District. According to the 2000 census, Bennettsville has a population of 9,425. [ Geography ] Bennettsville is located at [ 34 37 17 N 79 41 5 W type:city ] (34.621270, -79.684830) [ 1 ]. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 6.2 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 5.6 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and [ 0.6 sqmi km2 ] of it (10.13%) is water. [ History ] The city of Bennettsville was founded in 1819 and named after Thomas Bennett, Jr., then governor of South Carolina. In the same year, the S.C. General Assembly authorized the relocation of the courthouse from the eastern bank of the Great Pee Dee River to a more central location, selecting a [ 3 acre m2 on ] apple orchard located on a bluff above Crooked Creek for the new courthouse, designed by South Carolina architect Robert Mills. Streets were then developed spreading out from the square, one of the state&apos;s largest. In 1852, the Mills building was replaced. In 1865, during the American Civil War, the city was occupied by Union troops. During this time, the Jennings-Brown House and the first County Courthouse was used as the headquarters for General William T. Sherman during the Civil War. The new courthouse escaped burning, making it one of South Carolina&apos;s few county seats with records accessible for genealogical research dating back to 1785. In 1884, another Second Empire style courthouse was erected on the site and is the central portion of the present building. Two story red brick wings and the present clock steeple designed by Bennettsville architect Henry D. Harrall were added during the 1952-1954 remodeling. In 1885, Duncan Donald McColl brought the first railroad, bank and textile mills to Bennettsville. The economy boomed during this &quot; king cotton &quot; era. The city became one of the richest agricultural areas in the state. Because of this importance to its early history, the State of South Carolina gave Bennettsville the designation of its first &quot; G.R.E.A.T. Town &quot; (Governor&apos;s Rural Economic Achievement Trophy). [ Notable natives ] Hugh McColl, former president of the Bank of America Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children&apos;s Defense Fund Henry Steel Commager, historian Aziz Ansari, comedian and actor [ Architecture ] Within the Bennettsville Historic District, historic buildings include the Jennings Brown House (1826), the Female Academy (1830), the Medical Museum (1902), and the Murchison School (1902) — as well as other residences in the Queen Anne and Beaux Arts style. The D. D. McColl house at 300 West Main Street is a South Carolina mosquito cottage built in 1826 originally constructed by H. H. Covington on Darlington Street and sold in 1871 to Duncan Donald McColl (1842–1911) (who brought the first railroad, bank, and textile mills to Marlboro County). McColl lived in the home until 1884 — the house later being moved to S. Liberty Street, and later still to McColl Street. Now home to the Marlboro Chamber of Commerce and The South Carolina Cotton Trail, the house had been purchased, restored, relocated to its West Main Street location and presented to the county in 1991 by D.D. McColl&apos;s great-grandson, Bennettsville native Hugh L. McColl, Jr., former Bank of America Chairman of Charlotte. D. D. McColl&apos;s 1884 Victorian brick home sits nearby. &apos;&apos;&apos;See:&apos;&apos;&apos; the D.D.
