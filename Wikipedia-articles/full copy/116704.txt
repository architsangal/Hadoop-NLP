The population was 10,303 at the 2010 census. [ History ] Acushnet was first settled in 1659. It has been included as a part of three separate towns throughout its history. It was formerly the northeastern section of the town of Dartmouth, which included the towns of Westport, New Bedford, and Fairhaven. In 1787, New Bedford separated from Dartmouth, and included the lands of Fairhaven and Acushnet. In 1812, Fairhaven was incorporated as a separate town, again including the lands of Acushnet. Finally, the town was officially incorporated in 1860. The name &quot; Acushnet, &quot; which is also the name of the river the town lies on, comes from the Wampanoag &quot; Cushnea, &quot; meaning &quot; peaceful resting place near water, &quot; originally designating the fact that the tribe which sold the land to the Puritans inhabited the lands leading up to the river. In 1910, the Acushnet Process Company (now the Acushnet Company ), was founded in the town, and continues to be one of Southeastern Massachusetts&apos;s most enduring industries. The Acushnet Company owns the Titleist brand name, under which golf balls, golf clubs, and other golf paraphernalia are marketed. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 18.9 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 18.5 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and [ 0.5 sqmi km2 ] of it (2.43%) is water. Acushnet is located on the eastern border of Bristol County, and is bordered to the east by Rochester, to the southeast by Mattapoisett, to the south by Fairhaven, to the west by New Bedford, and to the northwest by Freetown. [ Transportation ] A short, 2.8-mile stretch of Route 105 passes through the northeast corner of town, both entering and exiting through Rochester. It is one of two state highways of any grade in the town, the other is a short section of South Main Street. Route 18 passes closely along the western border in New Bedford.
