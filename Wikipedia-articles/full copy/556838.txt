Popular for its nest made of leaves &quot; sewn &quot; together and immortalized by Rudyard Kipling in his Jungle Book, it is a common resident in urban gardens. Although shy birds that are usually hidden within vegetation, their loud calls are familiar and give away their presence. They are distinctive in having a greenish upper body plumage, long upright tail and the rust coloured forehead and crown. This passerine bird is typically found in open farmland, scrub, forest edges and gardens. Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider silk to make a cradle in which the actual nest is built. Like most warblers, the Common Tailorbird is insectivorous. The song is a loud cheeup-cheeup-cheeup with variations across the populations. The disyllabic calls are repeated often. [ Taxonomy and systematics ] The scientific name sutorius means &quot; cobbler &quot; rather than &quot; tailor &quot; while Orthotomus means &quot; straight-cutting &quot;. [ 1909 62–67 Birds of the plains Dewar, Douglas John Lane http://www.archive.org/stream/birdsofplainsdew00dewarich#page%2F62%2Fmode%2F2up ] The species was earlier placed in the family Sylviidae but more recent molecular studies place the species within the family Cisticolidae, along with Prinia and Cisticola.

The nominate race is from the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Race fernandonis is found in the highlands of Sri Lanka. Neighbouring India has guzuratus in the peninsula and west to Pakistan while towards the north patia is found in the Terai of Nepal along the Himalayan foothills until Myanmar. A small population of patia is also found in the northern Eastern Ghats (Wangasara). [ Ripley,S Dillon; Beehler,Bruce M; Raju,KSR Krishna 1988 Birds of the Visakhapatnam Ghats, Andhra Pradesh-2 J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 85 1 90–107 ] The hills of northeastern India have luteus. In Southeast Asia inexpectatus and maculicollis are found in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. South east China, including the island of Hainan, and Tonkin in Vietnam have longicauda while edela is found on Java. [ Description ] Calls of &apos;&apos;guzuratus&apos;&apos; from southern India The Common Tailorbird is a brightly coloured bird, with bright green upperparts and whitish underparts. They range in size from [ 10 – 14 cm in ] and weigh [ 6 – 10 g oz ]. They have short rounded wings, a long tail, strong legs and a sharp bill with curved tip to the upper mandible. They are wren -like with a long upright tail that is often moved around. The crown is rufous and the upperparts are predominantly olive green. The underside is creamy white. The sexes are identical, except that the male has long central tail feather s in the breeding season. (The reliability of sexing of specimens in determining this difference has been questioned by Hugh Whistler. [ Ali,Salim; Whistler,Hugh 1939 The birds of Central India. Part I. J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 41 1 82–106 ] ) Young birds are duller. When calling the dark patches on the sides of the neck become visible. [ 94–115 Cave, WA The Birds of Colombo Spolia Zeylanica 8 http://www.archive.org/stream/spoliazeylanica08nati#page%2F96%2Fmode%2F2up ] These are due to the dark pigmented and bare skin that are present in both sexes and sometimes give the appearance of a dark gorget. [ Ali, S &amp; S D Ripley Handbook of the birds of India and Pakistan 2 Oxford University Press 8 1997 78–84 ] [ Behaviour and ecology ] Foraging for insects Tailorbirds are found in singly or in pairs, usually low in the undergrowth or trees sometimes hopping on the ground. They forage for insects and have been known to feed on a range of beetles and bugs. They are attracted to insects at flowers and are known to favour the inflorescenses of mango. They are known to visit the flowers of Bombak, Salmalia and other large flowers for nectar and get covered on the head and throat with pollen, giving them a golden-headed appearance. [ Ali, S &amp; S.D. Ripley 1997 Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan. Volume 8 2 Oxford University Press New Delhi 78–84 ] The birds roost alone during the non-breeding season but may roost side-by-side during the breeding season, sometimes with the newly fledged juvenile sandwiched between the adults. The roost sites chosen are thin twigs on trees with cover above them and were often close to human habitation and lights. [ Roosting behaviour of common tailorbird Orthotomus sutorius(Pennant) Andheria, A. P. J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 2002 99 2 312–315 ] [ Breeding ] Nest from India The breeding season is March to December peaking from June to August in India, coinciding with the wet season. In Sri Lanka the main breeding season is March to May and August to September, although they do breed throughout the year. [ Rasmussen PC &amp; JC Anderton 2005 Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide. Vol. 2 Smithsonian Institution &amp; Lynx Edicions 477 ] Although the name is derived from the nest, the nest is not unique and similar nests are also found in many Prinia warblers. The nest is a deep, soft cup lined with soft materials and is placed in thick foliage and the leaves used to hold the nest have the upper surfaces outwards so that the nest is difficult to spot. The punctures made on the edge of the leaves are minute and do not cause browning of the leaves, further aiding camouflage. The nest lining of a nest in Sri Lanka that was studied by Casey Wood was found to be lined with lint from Euphorbia, Ceiba pentandra and Bombax malabaricum species. Jerdon had noted that the bird made knots, however no knots have been described by subsequent observers. Wood classified the processes used by the tailorbird in nest as sewing, rivetting, lacing and matting. In some cases the nest is made from a single large leaf; the margins of which are rivetted together. Sometimes the fibres from one rivet are extended into an adjoining puncture and appearing more like sewing. [ 1925 Smithsonian Report Wood, Casey A. The nest of the Indian tailor bird 349–354 http://www.archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1925smit#page%2Fn387%2Fmode%2F2up ] The stitch is made by piercing two leaves and drawing fibre through them. The fibres fluff out on the outside and in effect they are more like rivets. [ Neelakantan,KK 1976 On some nests of the Tailor Bird (Orthotomus sutorius) J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 73 2 396–400 ] There are many variations in the nest and some may altogether lack the cradle of leaves. One observer noted that the birds did not utilize cotton that was made available [ Briggs,FS 1929 A note on the breeding of the Tailor Bird Orthotomus sutorius J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 33 3 710–712 ] while another observer, Edward Hamilton Aitken, was able to induce them to use artificially supplied cotton. [ 106 The common birds of Bombay EHA 1900 Thacker &amp; Co http://www.archive.org/stream/commonbirdsofbom00aitkrich#page%2F106%2Fmode%2F2up ] The usual clutch is three eggs.

Birds Edition 4. 167–168 Gurney and Jackson http://www.archive.org/stream/popularhandbooko033226mbp#page%2Fn207%2Fmode%2F2up ] It is said that only the female stitches the leaves of the nest. The incubation period is about 12 days. Both male and female feed the young. Mortality of eggs and chicks are high due to predation by rodents, cats, crow-pheasants, lizards and other predators. The incubation period is about 12–14 days and the young birds fledge in about 14 days. The female alone incubates according to some sources, while others suggest that both sexes incubate but both parents take part in feeding and sanitation. [ Neelakantan,KK 1976 On a nesting pair of Tailor Birds (Orthotomus sutorius) J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 73 1 219–221 ] The males are said to feed the incubating female. An unusual case of a pair of tailorbirds adopting chicks in an artificially translocated nest belonging to a different pair has been recorded. [ Rane,Ulhas 1983 Unusual adoption by Tailor Birds (Orthotomus sutoriusPennant) J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 80 3 641–642 ] Nests are sometimes parasitized by the Plaintive Cuckoo ( Cacomantis merulinus ). Eggs of common tailorbird Close-up of nest Incubating Tailorbird [ In culture ] Rudyard Kipling in Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, one of his Jungle Book stories, includes a tailorbird couple, Darzee (which means &quot; tailor &quot; in Urdu) and his wife, as two of the key characters. [ http://www.archive.org/stream/birdsofcalcutta00finnrich#page%2F34%2Fmode%2F2up 34–38 Birds of Calcutta Finn, Frank 1904 Thacker, Spink &amp; Co ] Darzee&apos;s wife is said to have feigned injury, but this behaviour is unknown in this species. [ Injury-Feigning in Nesting Birds Swarth, Harry S. The Auk 52 3 1935 352–354 ] The local names of the bird in India include phutki (Hindi) and tuntuni (Bengali).
