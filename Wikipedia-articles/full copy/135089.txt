[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1272813 } [ 3 ] Townsend is a city in Blount County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The population was 244 at the 2000 census. Townsend is one of three &quot; gateways &quot; to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the home of several museums and attractions relating to both the natural and human history of the Smoky Mountains. Dubbing itself &quot; the Peaceful Side of the Smokies, &quot; Townsend has the least traffic of the park&apos;s three main entrances. The park&apos;s other two entrances — one just south of Gatlinburg and the other just north of Cherokee — are home to multiple commercial attractions that draw millions of tourists each year. Townsend is more low-key, with a handful of inexpensive restaurants and motels, several businesses geared toward outdoor sports, and the world-renowned horse show. [ Geography ] Townsend is located at [ 35 40 32 N 83 45 18 W type:city ] (35.675471, -83.755012) [ 1 ]. Townsend is situated in Tuckaleechee Cove, one of several &quot; limestone windows &quot; that dot the northern base of the Smokies. These windows form when erosional forces carry away the older rocks (mostly sandstone), exposing the younger rock below (i.e., limestone). { Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 33. } Limestone windows are normally flatter than other mountainous valleys, and are typically coated with rich, fertile soil. Other limestone windows in the area include Cades Cove, Wear Cove, and Jones Cove. Tuckaleechee Cove is situated between Bates Mountain to the north and Rich Mountain to the south, with the cove&apos;s greater population estimated at around 1,500. Little River, its source high in the mountains on the north slopes of Clingmans Dome, { http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=35.57888 &amp; lon=-83.48574 &amp; size=l &amp; u=4 &amp; datum=nad27 &amp; layer=DRG } slices east-to-west through Tuckaleechee and drains much of the cove. The city of Townsend dominates the eastern half of Tuckaleechee. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 0.9 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. As of 2004, annexation increased the size of the town considerably. Townsend is included in the Knoxville, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area.

[ History ] Historical marker in Townsend near the site of the Cherokee villages of Tuckaleechee. Native Americans were the first inhabitants of Tuckaleechee Cove, with the oldest archaeological finds in the cove dating to 2000 B.C. A number of pottery fragments and ax heads dating to the Woodland period have also been found. By 1200 A.D., Tuckaleechee&apos;s Native American inhabitants had built a fortified village near the cove&apos;s northern entrance. { Iva Butler, &quot; Archaeologists Pack Up Townsend Dig. &quot; The Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times, 17 February 2001. } The Cherokee arrived in the area around 1600, and built a series of small villages along Little River. The name &quot; Tuckaleechee &quot; is from the Cherokee &quot; Tikwalitsi &quot;, and its original meaning is unknown. { James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 534. } A branch of the Great Indian Warpath forked in the cove, with one branch heading west to the Overhill towns along the Little Tennessee River and another heading south to North Carolina. 19th century anthropologist James Mooney recounted an attempted raid on the Cherokee villages in Tuckaleechee by the Shawano in the mid-18th century. The raid was thwarted when a Cherokee conjurer named Deadwood Lighter envisioned the position of the Shawano ambush, and the Cherokees surprised the raiders from the rear, killing many of them and chasing the rest back over the crest of the Smokies. { Mooney, page 374. } By the time the first Euro-American settlers arrived in Tuckaleechee in the late 18th century, the Cherokee villages had been abandoned. { Tennessee Historical Commission marker IE 15 along US-321, Townsend, Tennessee. Information accessed in August, 2007. } In 1843, humorist George Washington Harris published an account of a country dance held that year in Tuckaleechee ( &quot; Tuck-a-lucky &quot; ) Cove on the farm of &quot; Capt. Dillon. &quot; Moonshine, cornbread, eggs and ham were served, and revelers danced to music provided by a fiddle-and- dulcimer duo. To win dance partners, the men engaged in a display of &quot; feats of strength, &quot; while the women quilted. { George Washington Harris, M. Thomas Inge (ed.), &quot; Sporting Epistle From East Tennessee, &quot; High Times and Hard Times (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1967), pp. 28-31. Originally published in the } { Spirit of the Times, 2 September 1843. } [ The logging industry ] In the 1880s, the lumber industry experienced a boom, due largely to two key innovations — the band saw and the logging railroad. Flatland forest resources in the Ohio Valley and along the Mississippi Delta were quickly exhausted, and logging firms began turning more and more to the untapped resources of the more mountainous areas. { Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 165-166. } 70-ton Shay engine at the Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum. In 1900, hoping to capitalize on the thick virgin forests of the Smokies, Colonel W.B. Townsend of Pennsylvania purchased [ 86,000 acre km2 ] of land along Little River, stretching from Tuckaleechee Cove all the way to Clingmans Dome. The following year, Townsend received a charter for his new firm, the Little River Lumber Company. A band saw mill was erected in Tuckaleechee, and Townsend gave his name to the community that grew in the mill&apos;s vicinity. The Little River Railroad was constructed shortly thereafter, connecting the saw mill with Walland to the west, and following Little River all the way to Elkmont, to the southeast. Townsend quickly profited from the forests of the Little River bottomlands. In 1916, he reported that Little River Lumber&apos;s consistently-high rate of planks-per-acre was showing no sign of decline. Indeed, a single giant chestnut tree in the Smokies could produce 18,000 planks of wood. Townsend&apos;s success led to a rapid expansion of logging operations throughout the Smokies. By the time the park was formed in the 1930s, nearly two-thirds of area forests had been cut down. The rapid destruction of the forests of southern Appalachia led to increased efforts by conservationists to slow or halt logging operations. Col. Townsend initially opposed the effort, but after some wavering, sold at base price [ 76,000 acre km2 ] of his Little River Lumber tract in 1926 to what would eventually become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. { Carlos Campbell, Birth of a National Park In the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), 33-35. } Although some predicted that the loss of the lumber industry would doom Tuckaleechee, the explosion in tourism as a result of the park&apos;s creation kept the area economy relatively healthy. { Frome, page 192. } [ Present-day Townsend ] Little River Tuckaleechee Road, which follows U.S. 321, is the main highway connecting Townsend with Walland (and eventually Maryville ) to the northwest and Pigeon Forge (via Wears Valley ) to the east, where it intersects U.S. 441. Near the eastern end of Townsend, SR73 turns southeast from US-321 and heads straight into the national park. This road eventually intersects Little River Road at a popular swimming area known as &quot; The Y &quot;. From this intersection, Cades Cove is seven miles to the west, and the Sugarlands and Gatlinburg are roughly eighteen miles to the east. Townsend is home to the Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center, which details life in pre-park days, and the Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum, which recounts the area&apos;s logging history. The Tuckaleechee Caverns — a mile-long cave system that reaches depths of up to 150 feet - is also nearby. Just to the north of Townsend, US-321 intersects Foothills Parkway, a national parkway that traverses Chilhowee Mountain and offers multiple overlooks with views of the Smokies to the south and the Tennessee Valley and Cumberland Plateau to the north and west.
