Portuguese territory also includes a series of archipelagoes in the Atlantic Ocean (the Azores and Madeira ), which are strategic islands along western sea approaches to the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea. In total, the country occupies an area of [ 92090 km2 sqmi on ] of which [ 91470 km2 sqmi on ] is land and [ 620 km2 sqmi on ] water. [ https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html Portugal CIA - The World Factbook 2009-11-28 ] Despite these definitions, Portugal&apos;s border with Spain remains a unresolved territorial dispute between the two countries. Portugal does not recognise the border between Caia and Cuncos River deltas, since the beginning of the 1801 occupation of Olivenza by Spain. This territory, though under de facto Spanish occupation, remains a de jure part of Portugal, consequently no border is henceforth recognised in this area. [ Physical ] Portugal is located on the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula and plateau, that divides the inland Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. It is located on the Atlantic coast of this plateau, and crossed by several rivers which have their origin in Spain. Most of these rivers flow from east to west disgorging in the Atlantic; from north to south, the primary rivers are the Minho, Douro, Tagus and the Guadiana. { Eldridge M. Moores and Rhodes Whitmore Fairbridge (1997), p.612 } [ Coastline ] Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone The continental shelf has an area of [ 28000 km2 mi2 on ], although its width is variable from 150  km in the north to 25  km in the south. Its strong relief is marked by deep submarine canyons and the continuation of the main rivers. The Estremadura Spur separates the Iberian Abyssal and Tagus Abyssal Plains, while the continental slope is flanked by sea-mounts and abuts against the prominent Goringe Bank in the south. Currently, the Portuguese government claims a 200 metre depth, or to a depth of exploitation. The Portuguese coast is extensive; in addition to approximately [ 943 km mi on ] ) along the coast of continental Portugal, the archipelagos of the Azores (667  km) and Madeira (250  km) are primarily surrounded by rough cliff coastlines. Most of these landscapes alternate between rough cliffs and fine sand beaches; the region of the Algarve is recognized for its tourist-friendly sand beaches, while at the same time its steep coastlines around Cape St. Vincent is well known for steep and foreboding cliffs. An interesting feature of the Portuguese coast is Ria Formosa with some sandy islands and a mild and pleasant climate characterized by warm but not very hot summers and generally mild winters. Alternatively, the Ria de Aveiro coast (near Aveiro, referred to as &quot; The Portuguese Venice &quot; ), is formed by a delta (approximately 45  km length and a maximum 11  km width) rich in fish and sea birds. Four main channels flow through several islands and islet s at the mouth of the Vouga, Antuã, Boco, and Fontão Rivers. Since the 16th century, this formation of narrow headlands formed a lagoon, that, due to its characteristics allowed the formation and production of salt. It was also recognized by the Romans, whose forces exported its salt to Rome (then seen as a precious resource). The Azores are also sprinkled with both alternating black sand and boulder-lined beaches, with only a rare exception is their a white sand beach (such as on the island of Santa Maria in Almagreira. The island of Porto Santo is one of the few extensive dune beaches in Portugal, located in the archipelago of Madeira. Tidal gauges along the Portuguese coast have identified a 1 to 1.5  mm rise in sea levels, causing large estuaries and inland deltas in some major rivers to overflow. As a result of its maritime possessions and coastline, Portugal has the third largest Exclusive Economic Zone of the European Union countries (and eleventh in the world). The sea-zone, over which Portugal exercises special territorial rights over the economic exploration and use of marine resources encircles an area of 1,727,408  km 2 (divided as: Continental Portugal 327,667  km 2, Azores Islands 953,633  km 2, Madeira Islands 446,108  km 2 [ Continent ] [ Geology of the Iberian Peninsula ] Tectonic structures of Europe, showing Iberia and the three &apos;&apos; &quot; Portuguese &quot; &apos;&apos; tectonic regions (far left) Hot, dry conditions sparked dozens of devastating wildfires in southern and central Portugal and central Spain in the summer of 2003. By the time this image was taken on January 19, 2004, the scars had begun to fade in areas, though the scars in Central Portugal and across the border in Spain are still dark red in the false-color image. The Portuguese territory came into existence during the history of Godwana and became aligned with European landforms after the super-continent Pangea began its slow separation into several smaller plates. The Iberian plate was formed during the Cadomian Orogeny of the late Neoproterozoic (about 650-550   Ma ), from the margins of the Gondwana continent. Through collisions and accretion a group of island arcs (that included the Central Iberian Plate, Ossa-Morena Plate, South Portuguese Plate) began to disintegrate from Godwana (along with other European fragments). These plates never separated substantially from each other since this period [ López-Guijarro Armendáriz Quesada Fernández-Suárez 2008 ]. By the Mesozoic, the three &quot; Portuguese plates &quot; were a part of the Northern France Armoric Plate until the Bay of Biscay began to separate. Following the separation of the Iberian Abyssal Plain, Iberia and Europe began to drift progressively from North America, as the Mid-Atlantic fracture zone pulled the three plates away from the larger continent. Eventually, Iberia collided with southern France attaching the region into a peninsula of Europe (during the Cenozoic ). Since the late Oligocene, the Iberian plate has been moving as part of the Eurasian plate, with the boundary between Eurasia and Africa situated along the Azores–Gibraltar fracture zone.

This formation is crossed by the Central Cordillera, along a east-northeast to west-southwest alignment, parallel to the European Baetic Chain (an aspect of the Alpine Chain ). The Central Cordillera is itself divided into two blocks, while three main river systems drain the differing geomorphological terrains: the Northern Meseta (with a mean altitude of 800 meteres) is drained by the Douro River (running east to west); the Southern Meseta (within a range of 200 to 900 metres altitude) is drained by the Tagus River (running east to west) from Spain, and the Guadiana River (running north to south), comprising the Lower Tagus and Sado Basins. To the north the landscape is mountainous in the interior areas with plateaus, cut by four breakings lines that allow the development of more fertile agricultural areas. The south down as far as the Algarve features mostly rolling plains with a climate somewhat warmer and drier than the cooler and rainier north. Other major rivers include the Douro, the Minho and the Guadiana, similar to the Tagus in that all originate in Spain. Another important river, the Mondego, originates in the Serra da Estrela (the highest mountains in mainland Portugal at 1,993  m). No large natural lake s exist in Continental Portugal, where the largest inland water surfaces are dam-originated reservoir s, (such as the Alqueva reservoir with 250  km 2, the largest in Europe). However, there are several lagoon s in Portugal with a river as origin: in Serra da Estrela, the Comprida Lagoon (Lagoa Comprida) and the Escura Lagoon (Lagoa Escura) were formed from ancient glacier s. the Pateira de Fermentelos is a small natural lagoon near Aveiro Some lagoons are near the Atlantic Ocean. For instance, the Albufeira Lagoon (in the Setúbal Peninsula ) and Óbidos Lagoon (near Foz do Arelho, Óbidos ).In the Azores archipelago lagoons were formed in extinct volcanos. Lagoa do Fogo and Lagoa das Sete Cidades (two small lakes connected by a narrow passage) are the most famous lakes in São Miguel Island. [ Archipelagos ] In addition to continental Europe, Portugal consists of two Autonomous Regions in the Atlantic Ocean, consisting of the archipelagos of Madeira and Azores. Madeira is located on the African Tectonic Plate, and comprises the main island of Madeira, Porto Santo and the smaller Savage Islands. The Azores, which are located between the junction of the African, European and North American Plates, straddle the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. There are nine islands in this archipelago, usually divided into three groups (Western, Central and Eastern) and several smaller Formigas (rock outcroppings) located between São Miguel and Santa Maria Islands. Both island groups are volcanic in nature, with historic volcanology and seismic activity persisting to the present time. In addition, there are several submarine volcanos in the Azores (such as Dom João de Castro Bank ), that have erupted historically (such as the Serrata eruption off the coast of Terceira Island). The last major volcanic event occurred in 1957-58 along the western coast of Faial Island, which formed the Capelinhos Volcano. Seismic events are common in the Azores.The Azores are occasionally subject to very strong earthquake s, as is the continental coast. Wildfire s occur mostly in the summer in mainland Portugal and extreme weather in the form of strong winds and floods also occurs mainly in winter. The Azores are occasionally stricken by tropical cyclones such as Hurricane Jeanne (1998) and Hurricane Gordon (2006). [ Climate ] [ Portugal#Climate Climate ] Portugal has a Mediterranean climate, Csa in the south and Csb in the north, according to the Köppen climate classification. The annual average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from [ 12 - 13 °C °F 1 ] in the mountainous interior north to [ 17 - 18 °C °F 1 ] in the south (in general the south is warmer and drier than the north). The Madeira and Azores archipelagos have a narrower temperature range with the annual average temperature sometimes exceeding [ 20 °C °F ] in the south coast of Madeira Island. Extreme temperatures occur in the mountains in the northeast of the country in winter, where they may fall to [ -15 °C °F ], and in southeastern parts in the summer, sometimes exceeding [ 45 °C °F ]. The official absolute extreme temperatures are [ -16 °C °F 1 ] in Penhas da Saúde on 4 February 1954 and [ 47.4 °C °F 1 ] in Amareleja in the Alentejo region, on 1 August 2003. There are, however, unofficial records of [ 50.5 °C °F 1 ] on 4 August 1881 in Riodades, São João da Pesqueira. { Dan dan the weatherman } It&apos;s very plausible since this region is known for its microclimate. The annual average rainfall varies from a bit more than [ 3000 mm in 1 on ] in the mountains in the north to less than [ 600 mm in 1 on ] in southern parts of Alentejo. The country has around 2500–3200 hours of sunshine a year, an average of 4-6h in winter and 10-12h in the summer, with higher values in the southeast and lower in the northwest. The sea surface temperature is higher in the south coast where it varies from [ 15 - 16 °C °F 1 ] in January to [ 22 - 23 °C °F 1 ] in August, occasionally reaching [ 25 °C °F ]; on the west coast the sea surface temperature is around [ 14 - 15 °C °F 1 ] in winter and [ 18 - 20 °C °F ] in the summer, with higher values as one goes southwards. Both the Azores and the Madeira Islands have a subtropical climate with mild, rainy winters and mainly dry, warm summers. The Savage Islands, that belong to the Madeira archipelago, have an arid climate with an annual average rainfall of around [ 150 mm in 1 on ]. The sea surface temperatures in these archipelagos vary from [ 16 - 18 °C °F 1 ] in winter to [ 23 - 24 °C °F 1 ] in the summer, occasionally reaching [ 26 °C °F 1 ].
