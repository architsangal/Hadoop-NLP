[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1430389 } [ 3 ] Moab is a city in Grand County, in eastern Utah, in the western United States. The population was 4,779 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat and largest city in Grand County. [ 6 ] Moab hosts a large number of tourists every year, mostly visitors to the nearby Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. The town is a popular base for mountain bikers who ride the extensive network of trails including the famed Slickrock Trail, and off-roaders who come for the annual Moab Jeep Safari. [ History ] Native American pictographs in nearby Hell Roaring Canyon The Biblical name Moab refers to an area of land located on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Some historians believe the city in Utah came to use this name because of William Pierce, the first postmaster, believing that the biblical Moab and this part of Utah were both &quot; the far country &quot;.

[ http://www.moabcity.org/visitors/history.cfm City of Moab Moab - History ] Some of the area&apos;s early residents attempted to change the city&apos;s name because in the Christian Bible, Moabites are demeaned as incestuous and idolatrous. One petition in 1890 had 59 signatures and requested a name change to Vina. [ Daughters of the Utah Pioneers 1972 Grand Memories Grand County, Utah Daughters of the Utah Pioneers 50 Government 2nd 4790603 ] Another effort attempted to change the name to Uvadalia. During the 1800s the area around what is now Moab served as the Colorado River crossing along the Old Spanish Trail. Mormon settlers attempted to establish a trading fort at the river crossing called &quot; Elk Mountain Mission &quot; in 1855 to trade with travelers attempting to cross the river. After repeated Indian attacks, the fort was abandoned in late 1855. A new round of settlers established a permanent settlement in 1878. Moab was incorporated as a town on December 20, 1902. In 1883 the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad main line was constructed across eastern Utah. The rail line did not pass through Moab, instead passing through the towns of Thompson Springs and Cisco, forty miles to the north. [ Carr Stephen L. Edwards, Robert W. Utah Ghost Rails 1989 Western Epics Salt Lake City, Utah 0-914740-34-2 188–194 Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway ] Later, other places to cross the Colorado were constructed, such as Lee&apos;s Ferry, Navajo Bridge and Boulder Dam. These changes shifted the trade routes away from Moab. Moab farmers and merchants had to adapt from trading with passing travelers to shipping their goods to distant markets. Soon Moab&apos;s origins as one of the few natural crossings of the Colorado River were forgotten. Nevertheless, the U.S. military deemed the bridge over the Colorado River at Moab important enough to place it under guard as late as World War II. Moab&apos;s economy was originally based on agriculture, but gradually shifted to mining. Uranium and vanadium were discovered in the area in the 1910s and 1920s. Potash and manganese came next, and then oil and gas were discovered. In the 1950s Moab became the so-called &quot; Uranium Capital of the World &quot; after geologist Charles Steen found a rich deposit of uranium ore south of the city. This discovery coincided with the advent of the era of nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the United States, and Moab&apos;s boom years began. The city population grew nearly 500% over the next few years, bringing the population to near 6,000 people. The explosion in population caused much construction of houses and schools. Charles Steen donated a great deal of money and land to create new houses and churches in Moab. With the winding down of the Cold War, Moab&apos;s uranium boom was over, and the city&apos;s population drastically declined. By the early 1980s a number of homes stood empty and nearly all of the uranium mines had closed. Morning Glory Natural Bridge near Moab In 1949, Western movie director John Ford was persuaded to use the area for the movie Wagon Master. Ford had been using the area in Monument Valley around Mexican Hat, Utah, south of Moab, since he filmed Stagecoach there 10 years earlier in 1939. A local Moab rancher found Ford and persuaded him to come take a look at Moab. [ January 2010 ] There have been numerous movies filmed in the area since then, using Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park as backdrops. Since the 1970s, tourism has played an increasing role in the local economy. Partly due to the John Ford movies, partly due to magazine articles, the area has become a favorite of photographers, rafters, hikers, rock climbers, and most recently mountain bikers. Moab is also an increasingly popular destination for four-wheelers as well as for BASE jumpers and those rigging Highlining, who are allowed to practice their sport in the area. Moab&apos;s population swells temporarily in the spring and summer months with the arrival of numerous people employed seasonally in the outdoor recreation and tourism industries. In recent years Moab has experienced a surge of second-home owners. The relatively mild winters and enjoyable summers have attracted many people to build such homes throughout the area. In a situation mirroring that of other resort town s in the American West, controversy has arisen over these new residents and their houses, which in many cases remain unoccupied for most of the year. Many Moab citizens are concerned that the town is seeing changes similar to those experienced in Vail and Aspen in neighboring Colorado : skyrocketing property values, a rising cost of living, and corresponding effects on local low- and middle-income workers. { Stiles, Jim.

A toll ferry service across the river ended when a permanent bridge was built in 1911. This bridge was replaced with a new bridge in 1955, which was in turn replaced by another new bridge in 2010 (the 1955 bridge was subsequently demolished). The highway that uses this bridge has been renumbered multiple times and is presently numbered U.S. Route 191. Moab gained freight railroad access in 1962, when a spur railroad line (now the Union Pacific Railroad &apos;s Cane Creek Subdivision ) was built to service the Cane Creek potash mine. Moab has never had passenger rail service, although the California Zephyr has advertised service to Moab in the past via stops at Thompson Springs (no longer a scheduled stop), Green River or Grand Junction, Colorado. Moab currently does not have regular bus service, although charter busses and shuttle service to Salt Lake City or Grand Junction in Colorado are available. Air service is available at Canyonlands Field, with three daily nonstop flights to Denver, Colorado.
