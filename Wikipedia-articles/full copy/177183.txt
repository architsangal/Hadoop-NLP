It existed until 1940, when it was proscribed by the authorities. [ History ] [ Background ] Oswald Mosley was the youngest elected Conservative MP before crossing the floor in 1922, joining first the Labour Party and, shortly afterwards, the Independent Labour Party. He became a minister in Ramsay MacDonald &apos;s Labour government, advising on rising unemployment. In 1930 he issued his &apos;Mosley Memorandum&apos; a proto- Keynesian programme of policies designed to tackle the unemployment problem, and resigned from the party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the New Party, with policies based on his memorandum; but, despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in Ashton-under-Lyne in early 1931, the party failed to achieve any electoral success. Over 1931 the New Party became increasingly influenced by Fascism. The next year, after a January 1931 visit to Benito Mussolini in Italy, Mosley&apos;s own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, The Greater Britain, and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched in October 1932. { Thorpe, Andrew. (1995) Britain In The 1930s, Blackwell Publishers, ISBN 0-613-17411-7 } [ Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] [ Prominence ] The BUF claimed 50,000 members at one point { Andrzej Olechnowicz, ‘Liberal Anti-Fascism in the 1930s: The Case of Sir Ernest Barker’ in Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies, (Vol. 36, No. 4, Winter, 2004), p. 643. } and the Daily Mail was an early supporter, running the headline &quot; Hurrah for the Blackshirts! &quot; { Hurrah for the Blackshirts } Despite strong resistance from anti-fascists, including the local Jewish community, the Labour Party, the Independent Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain, the BUF found a following in the East End of London, where in the London County Council elections of March 1937 it obtained reasonably successful results in Bethnal Green, Shoreditch and Limehouse, polling almost 8,000 votes, although none of its candidates was actually elected. { R. Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, London: Allan Lane, 1969, pp. 279-282 } However, the BUF never stood in a General Election. Having lost the funding of newspaper magnate Lord Rothermere that it previously enjoyed, at the 1935 General Election the party urged voters to abstain, calling for &quot; Fascism Next Time &quot;. { 1932-1938 Fascism rises - March of the Blackshirts } There never was a &quot; next time &quot;, as the next General Election was not held until July 1945, by which time the Second World War in Europe had ended and fascism was discredited. Towards the middle of the 1930s, the BUF&apos;s violent activities and its alignment with the German Nazi Party began to alienate some middle-class supporters, and membership decreased. At the Olympia rally in London, in 1934, BUF stewards violently ejected anti-fascist disrupters, with one protester claiming to have lost an eye, and this led the Daily Mail to withdraw its support for the movement. The level of violence shown at the rally shocked many, with the effect of turning neutral parties against the BUF and contributing to anti-fascist support. As one observer remarked &quot; I came to the conclusion that Mosley was a political maniac, and that all decent English people must combine to kill his movement &quot;. { LLOYD. G, Yorkshire Post 9 June 1934 } The reaction to the Olympia rally can be illustrated in the growth in British Communist parties from 1935 onwards. { STEVENSON. J, Britain in the Depression (Longman Group UK LTD: 1994) p155 } [ Final years and legacy ] { Duce &apos;&apos; } { Benito Mussolini (left) with Leader } { Oswald Mosley (right) during Moseley&apos;s visit to Italy in 1936. } With lack of electoral success, the party drew away from mainstream politics and towards extreme antisemitism over 1934-1935, which saw the resignation of members such as Dr. Robert Forgan. Its provocative antisemitic activity in London led to serious, often violent, conflict, most famously at the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936, when over 100,000 anti-Fascists of English, Irish, Jewish and Somali (amongst others) descent successfully prevented the fascists from marching through London&apos;s East End. Membership fell to below 8,000 by the end of 1935. The government was sufficiently concerned, however, to pass the Public Order Act 1936, which banned political uniform s and required police consent for political marches. This act hindered BUF activity, although in the years building up to the war they enjoyed brief success on the back of their &quot; Peace Campaign &quot; to prevent conflict with Germany. In May 1940, the BUF was banned outright by the government, and Mosley, along with 740  other fascists, was interned for much of World War II. After the war, Mosley made several unsuccessful attempts to revive his brand of fascism, notably in the Union Movement. [ Character ] { Nazi Party. } Though the BUF had its own flag it recognized the Union Flag as Britain&apos;s national flag and the Union Flag appeared in various BUF events, posters, and propaganda. Mosley, known to his followers as The Leader, modelled his leadership style on Benito Mussolini and the BUF on Mussolini&apos;s National Fascist Party in Italy, including an imitation of the Italian Fascists&apos; black uniform s for members, earning them the nickname &quot; Blackshirts &quot;. The BUF was anti-communist and protectionist, and proposed replacing parliamentary democracy with executives elected to represent specific industries, trades or other professional interest groups – a system similar to the corporatism of the Italian fascists. Unlike the Italian system, British fascist corporatism planned to replace the House of Lords with elected executives drawn from major industries, the clergy, and colonies. The House of Commons was to be reduced to allow for a faster, &quot; less factionist &quot; democracy. { Tomorrow We Live (1938) } The BUF&apos;s programme and ideology were outlined in Mosley&apos;s Great Britain (1932) and A. Raven Thompson&apos;s The Coming Corporate State (1938). Many BUF policies were built on isolationism, prohibiting trade outside an insulated British Empire. Mosley’s system aimed to protect the British economy from the fluctuations of the world market, especially during the Great Depression, and prevent &quot; cheap slave competition from abroad. &quot; { Tomorrow We Live (1938), by Sir Oswald Mosley and http://www.oswaldmosley.com/audio/speeches.html entitled http://www.oswaldmosley.com/audio/speeches.html&apos; } [ Relationship with the Suffragettes ] In a January 2010 BBC documentary, Mother Was A Blackshirt, James Maw reported on how in 1914 Norah Elam was placed in a Holloway prison cell with Emmeline Pankhurst for her involvement with the Suffragette movement, yet in 1940 she returned to the same prison with Diana Mosley, but this time for her involvement with the fascist movement. Another leading suffragette, Mary Richardson, became head of the women&apos;s section of the BUF. The report described how Elam&apos;s fascist philosophy grew from her suffragette experiences, how the British fascist movement became largely driven by women, how they targeted young women from an early age, how the first British fascist movement was founded by a woman, and how the leading lights of the Suffragettes had, with Oswald Mosley, founded the BUF. { http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00pk7zp/Mother_Was_A_Blackshirt/?from=r &amp; id=35227e69-fcbf-45d7-8295-2c78e9703b74.0 } Mosley&apos;s electoral strategy had been to prepare for the election after 1935, and in 1936 he announced a list of BUF candidates for that election, with Elam nominated to stand for Northampton. Mosley accompanied Elam to Northampton to introduce her to her electorate at a meeting in the Town Hall. At that meeting Mosley announced that &quot; He was glad indeed to have the opportunity of introducing the first candidate, and it killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back into the home, this is simply not true. Mrs Elam, he went on, had fought in the past for women&apos;s suffrage... and was a great example of the emancipation of women in Britain &quot;. [ McPherson Angela McPherson, Susan Mosley&apos;s Old Suffragette - A Biography of Norah Elam 2011 http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk 978-1-4466-9967-6 ] [ Marching song ] [ BUF Songs ] The BUF march, Comrades the Voices, was a rough translation of Horst-Wessel-Lied, the anthem of the Nazi Party, and was set to the same tune. It was reused by Mosley&apos;s Union Movement in the 1950s with slightly modified lyrics. &apos;&apos;Comrades, the voices of the dead battalions, &apos;&apos;Of those who fell that Britain might be great, &apos;&apos;Join in our song, for they still march in spirit with us, &apos;&apos;And urge us on to gain the fascist state! &apos;&apos;Join in our song, for they still march in spirit with us, &apos;&apos;And urge us on to gain the fascist state! &apos;&apos;We&apos;re of their blood, and spirit of their spirit, &apos;&apos;Sprung from that soil for whose dear sake they bled, &apos;&apos; &apos;gainst vested powers, Red Front, and massed ranks of reaction, &apos;&apos;We lead the fight for freedom and for bread! &apos;&apos; &apos;gainst vested powers, Red Front, and massed ranks of reaction, &apos;&apos;We lead the fight for freedom and for bread! &apos;&apos;The streets are still, the final struggle&apos;s ended; &apos;&apos;Flushed with the fight we proudly hail the dawn! &apos;&apos;See, over all the streets the fascist banners waving, &apos;&apos;Triumphant standards of a race reborn! &apos;&apos;See, over all the streets the fascist banners waving, &apos;&apos;Triumphant standards of a race reborn! [ In popular culture ] The television serial Mosley featured the BUF and Oswald Mosley, through his political career to the internment of the BUF. In the film It Happened Here, the BUF appears to be the ruling party of German-occupied Britain. A Mosley speech is heard on the radio in the scene before everyone goes to the movies. { P.G. Wodehouse &apos;s fictional &apos;&apos;Black Shorts&apos;&apos; movement, featured in the television series &apos;&apos; } { Jeeves and Wooster &apos;&apos;. } Harry Turtledove &apos;s alternate history novel, In the Presence of Mine Enemies, is set in 2010 in a world where the Nazis were triumphant, the BUF governs Britain and the first stirrings of the reform movement come from there. The BUF and Mosley also appear as background influences in Turtledove&apos;s Colonization trilogy which follows the Worldwar tetralogy and is set in the 1960s. James Herbert &apos;s 1996 novel &apos;48 features a protagonist who is hunted by BUF Blackshirts in a devastated London after a biological weapon release in WW II. The history of the BUF and Mosley is recapitulated. In Ken Follett &apos;s novel Night Over Water, several of the main characters are BUF members. The BUF is also in Guy Walters book The Leader (2003), where Mosley is the dictator of Britain in the 1930s. British humorous writer P. G. Wodehouse satirized the BUF in books and short stories. The BUF was satirized as &quot; The Black Shorts &quot; (shorts being worn as all the best shirt colours were already taken) and their leader was Roderick Spode, owner of a ladies&apos; underwear shop. British novelist Nancy Mitford satirized the BUF and Mosley in Wigs on the Green, initially published in 1935 and republished in 2010. Diana Mitford, the author&apos;s sister, had been romantically involved with Mosley since 1932. In the 1992 Acorn Media production of Agatha Christie &apos;s One, Two, Buckle My Shoe with David Suchet and Philip Jackson, one of the supporting characters (played by actor Christopher Eccleston ) secures a paid position as a rank-and-file member of the BUF. The BUF and Oswald Mosley are also alluded to in Kazuo Ishiguro &apos;s novel The Remains of the Day. Mark Gatiss &apos;s second Lucifer Box novel The Devil in Amber &apos;s main villain is a thinly-veiled version of Mosley named Olympus Mons. The BUF and Mosley are featured heavily in the 2010 BBC version of Upstairs, Downstairs The Pogues song &quot; The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn, &quot; from their 1985 album Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash, references the BUF in its second verse with the line &quot; And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the Yids. &quot; Ned Beauman&apos;s 2010 debut novel Boxer, Beetle portrays the Battle of Cable Street.
