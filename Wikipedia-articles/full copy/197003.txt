He was one of the Young British Artists. Since 2005, Ofili has been living and working in Trinidad, where he currently resides in Port of Spain. [ Early life ] Ofilli, who is of Nigeria n descent, was born in Manchester. He had a Catholic school education for years attending St. Pius X High School for Boys, and then Xaverian College in Victoria Park, Manchester. { Chris Ofili Brief biography on Artnet. Retrieval Date: 26 July 2007. } Ofili completed a foundation course in art at Tameside College in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester and studied in London, at the Chelsea School of Art from 1988 to 1991 and at the Royal College of Art from 1991 to 1993. [ Career ] Ofili was established through exhibitions by Charles Saatchi at his gallery in north London and the travelling exhibition Sensation (1997), becoming recognised as one of the few British artists of African/Caribbean descent to break through as a member of the Young British Artists group. Ofili has also had numerous solo shows since the early 1990s including the Serpentine Gallery. In 1998, Ofili won the Turner Prize, and in 2003 was selected to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale of that year, where his work for the British Pavilion was done in collaboration with the architect David Adjaye. In 1992 he won a scholarship that allowed him to travel to Zimbabwe. Ofili studied cave painting s there, which had some effect on his style. Though Ofili&apos;s detractors often state that he &quot; splatters &quot; { &apos;&apos;The Independent&apos;&apos;, February 27, 2000 } elephant dung on his pictures, this is inaccurate: he sometimes applies it directly to the canvas in the form of dried spherical lumps, and sometimes, in the same form, uses it as varnished foot-like supports on which the paintings stand. Ofili&apos;s paintings also make reference to blaxploitation films and gangsta rap, seeking to question racial and sexual stereotypes in a humorous way. His work is often built up in layers of paint, resin, glitter, dung (mainly elephant) and other materials to create a collage. Ofili has been founder and prime mover behind the short-lived Freeness Project. { &apos;&apos;Free stuff&apos;&apos; by James Cowdery, 22 September 2005. } This involved the coming together of artists, producers and musicians of minority ethnic groups (Asian and African) in an attempt to expose the music that may be unheard in other spaces. Freeness allowed the creativity of unsigned contemporary British ethnic minority artists to be heard. The result of months of tours to 10 cities in the UK resulted in Freeness Volume 1 - a compilation of works that were shown during the tour. Ofili is represented by Victoria Miro Gallery, London, David Zwirner, New York, and Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin. [ Exhibitions ] Ofili&apos;s work was featured in a museum in the 1995 exhibition Brilliant! New Art from London at the Walker Art Center. { Chris Ofili, Third Eye Vision (1999) } { Walker Art Center, Minneapolis. } Significant solo exhibitions include the Arts Club of Chicago (2010), Kestnergesellschaft, Hanover (2006), the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2005), and the Serpentine Gallery, London (1998). In 2010, Tate Britain presented the most extensive exhibition of his work to date. { Adrian Searle (January 25, 2010), Chris Ofili heads into the shadows } { The Guardian. } [ Controversy ] [ The Holy Virgin Mary and Mayor Giuliani ] One of his paintings, The Holy Virgin Mary, a depiction of the Virgin Mary, was at issue in a lawsuit between the mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art when it was exhibited there in 1999 as a part of the &quot; Sensation &quot; exhibit. The painting depicted a Black Madonna surrounded by images from blaxploitation movies and close-ups of female genitalia cut from pornographic magazines, and elephant dung. These were formed into shapes reminiscent of the cherubim and seraphim commonly depicted in images of the Immaculate conception and the Assumption of Mary. Following the scandal surrounding this painting, Bernard Goldberg ranked Ofili #86 in 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Red Grooms showed his support of the artist by purchasing one of Ofili&apos;s paintings in 1999, even after Giuliani famously exclaimed, “There’s nothing in the First Amendment that supports horrible and disgusting projects!” [ Red Grooms’s Chris Ofili Drawing Robert Ayers ARTINFO November 20, 2007 http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26119/red-groomss-chris-ofili-drawing/ 2008-04-17 ] The painting is now owned by David Walsh and is on display at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania.

It was bought by the Tate Gallery in 2005 and caused controversy as Ofili was on the board of the Tate Trustees at the time of the purchase. In 2006 the Charity Commission censured the Tate for this purchase.
