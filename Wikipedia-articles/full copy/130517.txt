QAccessed March 29, 2012 } [ History ] Yale&apos;s founding in 1895 is attributed to a local farmer, Sterling F. Underwood, who established a post office by that name in his general store, about [ 1.5 mi km ] east of the present town. When the Eastern Oklahoma Railway built its line across Payne County, a group led by George W. Canfield began a different townsite closer to the railroad. Underwood moved his store to the new site in 1902, making the new site the permanent location for the town of Yale. By 1910, Yale had a population of 685, supported mostly by agricultural services and cotton processing. { Newsom, D. Earl.

An even larger gusher began producing a month later. More discoveries quickly followed. By the end of 1914, the combined Yale and Cushing fields were producing 220,000 barrels a day. The town boomed, attaining a population of 2,601 by the census of 1920. The oil boom quickly deflated. Production began to decline sharply in 1915, and more dry holes were reported. Major producers began to shut down or reduce operations in the early 1920s. By 1930, the population had dropped to 1,734. In 1940, the census reported a population of 1,407.
