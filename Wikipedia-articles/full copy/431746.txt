The name amphipoda refers to the different forms of appendages, unlike isopod s, where all the thoracic legs are alike. Of the 7,000 species, 5,500 are classified into one suborder, Gammaridea. The remainder are divided into two or three further suborders. Amphipods range in size from [ 1 to 340 mm 2 ] and are mostly detritivore s or scavenger s. They live in almost all aquatic environments; 750 species live in cave s and the order also includes terrestrial animal s and sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator. [ Description ] Although they are very abundant, widespread and diverse, amphipods do not feature strongly in the public imagination. Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing wrote in 1899: [ Annual Review of Entomology 31 25–48 1986 10.1146/annurev.en.31.010186.000325 Biology of terrestrial amphipods J. Anthony Friend &amp; Alastair M. M. Richardson ] No panegyrist of the Amphipoda has yet been able to evoke anything like popular enthusiasm in their favour. To the generality of observers they are only not repelled because the glance which falls upon them is unarrested, ignores them, is unconscious of their presence. [ Anatomy ] { gammaridea n amphipod &apos;&apos; } { Leucothoe incisa &apos;&apos; } The body of an amphipod is divided into 13 segments, which can be grouped into a head, a thorax and an abdomen.

The thorax and abdomen are usually quite distinct and bear different kinds of legs; they are typically laterally compressed, and there is no carapace. The thorax bears eight pairs of uniramous appendage s, the first of which are used as accessory mouthparts; the next four pairs are directed forwards, and the last three pairs are directed backwards. Gills are present on the thoracic segments, and there is an open circulatory system with a heart, using haemocyanin to carry oxygen in the haemolymph to the tissues. The uptake and excretion of salts is controlled by special gland s on the antennae. The abdomen is divided into two parts: the pleosome which bears swimming legs; and the urosome, which comprises a telson and three pairs of uropod s which do not form a tail fan as they do in animals such as true shrimp. [ Size ] Amphipods are typically less than [ 10 mm ] long, but the largest recorded living amphipods were [ 28 cm ] long, and were photographed at a depth of [ 5300 m ] in the Pacific Ocean. [ J.

As a female ages, she produces more eggs in each brood. Mortality is around 25%–50% for the eggs. There are no larva l stages; the eggs hatch directly into a juvenile form, and sexual maturity is generally reached after 6 moults. Some species have been known to eat their own exuvia e after moulting. [ Diversity and classification ] Amphipods are difficult to identify, due to their typically small size, and the fact that they must be dissected. As a result, ecological studies and environmental surveys often lump all amphipods together. [ http://www.crustacea.net/crustace/amphipoda/index.htm Introduction Amphipoda: Families J. K. Lowry &amp; R. T. Springthorpe Australian Museum April 5, 2010 ] Carolus Linnaeus described two species of amphipods in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae, which is defined as the starting point for zoological nomenclature. His descriptions (such as that for Gammarus pulex : &quot; [ la Cancer macrourus articularis, manibus adactylis, cauda attenuata spinis bifidis ] &quot; [ Carl Linnaeus 1758 Systema Naturae 10th ] ) were, however, &quot; very poor &quot;, and could apply to &quot; nearly every species of amphipod &quot;.

One suborder, Gammaridea, contains more than 5,500 species, including all the freshwater and terrestrial species. [ What are amphipods? John R.

The classification of the Amphipoda is not yet settled, with the relationships within the suborder Gammaridea suffering the most confusion.

They are almost always an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Most species in the suborder Gammaridea are epibenthic, although they are often collected in plankton samples. Members of the Hyperiidea are all planktonic and marine. Many are symbionts of gelatinous animals, including salp s, medusae, siphonophores, colonial radiolaria ns and ctenophores, and most hyperiids are associated with gelatinous animals during some part of their life cycle.

The most notable example of parasitic amphipods are the whale lice (family Cyamidae); unlike other amphipods, these are dorso-ventrally flattened, and have large, strong claws, with which they attach themselves to baleen whale s. They are the only parasitic crustaceans which cannot swim during any part of their life cycle. [ http://web.viu.ca/goatert/PARASITE/PARAMPH.HTM Parasitic Amphipoda Vancouver Island University April 7, 2010 May 4, 1996 Tim Goater Interactive Parasitology ] Most amphipods are detritivore s or scavenger s, with some being grazers of algae, omnivore s or predator s on small insect s and crustacean s. Food is grasped with the front two pairs of legs which are armed with large claws. [ Names and etymology ] The name Amphipoda comes, via the New Latin [ la amphipoda ], from the Greek roots [ el ἀμφί ] ( &quot; different &quot; ) and [ el πούς ] ( &quot; foot &quot; ), in reference to the two kinds of legs that amphipods possess. This contrasts with the related Isopoda, which have a single kind of thoracic leg. [ Amphipoda ] Particularly among anglers, amphipods are known as freshwater shrimp, scuds or sideswimmers.
