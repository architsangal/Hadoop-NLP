Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean country that relies heavily on industrialisation and tourism, has various transport systems. Trinidad is the larger island, with a business-oriented economy and the seat of the country&apos;s government and Piarco International Airport, the country&apos;s major airport. A smaller number of international flights from fly directly to Tobago &apos;s Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport (formerly Crown Point Airport). There is also a small airfield name Camdem Airfield in Couva, which is mainly used for cropdusting planes. [ Public Transport ] { East-West Corridor from } { Port of Spain to } { Arima. } Public transport is provided by a government -run bus service (known as the Public Transport Service Corporation, or PTSC), privately owned mini-buses (locally known as maxi-taxis), as well as privately owned car s. Maxi-taxi s and some cars carry passengers along fixed route s for a fixed fare, although cars are slightly more expensive for similar routes carried by maxi-taxis because of their much smaller passenger capacities. Travellers can also negotiate with car taxi drivers to go off-route for short distances for an additional charge if one&apos;s destination is not exactly on the car taxi&apos;s route. Car taxis are not allowed to utilise the Priority Bus Route, however, and as such maxi-taxis and buses are preferable for speedily entering and exiting the cities (especially Port of Spain ) during rush hour (7am–9am and 4pm–6pm). In Port of Spain all maxi-taxis and buses heading out of the city are centrally housed in the transportation hub known as City Gate. In all other locations and for Port of Spain Intra-city transportation, taxi-stand s are scattered at various streets of the town or region, and after sunset some of these taxi-stands may change location, although this changed location is also fixed. Recently there has also been a growth in popularity of American-style taxi-cabs that do not work along a fixed route and the can be booked for specific times for specific journeys. [ Ferry Service ] [ November 2010 ] Ferries operate between Port of Spain and Scarborough. Cars can be brought onto the ferries and kept in the cargo areas. Ferries run daily, Sundays to Sunday (less sailings on the weekend). The ferries are inexpensive, in spite of the minimum 2½–3 hour travel time between Port of Spain and Scarborough. Passengers fares are (prices in TT dollars): Fast Ferry (One Way) Adult: $50 Child: $25 Minor: $0Fast Ferry (Return) Adult: $100 Child: $50 Minor: $0 Conventional Ferry (One Way) Adult: $37.50 Child: $18.75 Minor: $0Conventional Ferry (Return) Adult: $75 Child: $37.50 Minor: $0 Conventional Ferry (One Way) CABIN Adult: $80.00 Child: N/A Minor: N/AConventional Ferry (Return) CABIN Adult: $160.00 Child: N/A Minor: N/A Fast Ferries - T &amp; T Express, T &amp; T Spirit,Conventional - Warrior Spirit Because of the ferries&apos; popularity, many people book their ferry trip well in advance. A Water Taxi service was started in December 2008. Using the water taxi people can travel from Port of Spain to San Fernando which cost TT $15.00 one way and TT $30.00 return. It only takes about 50 minutes to 1 hour between the two cities by utilizing this service according. There are currently three(3) vessels:H.C. Olivia,H.C. Milancia and H.C. Katia. There are currently orders for four new vessels which are being built and would be handed over mid to late 2010.They have now arrived named: Carnival Runner,Calypso sprinter,Paria Bullet and the Trini Flash Schedules are available at http://www.patnt.com/ferry_schedule.shtml for the Trinidad to Tobago ferry [ Railways ] There is a minimal agricultural railway system near San Fernando, but the Trinidad Government Railway that was built while Trinidad and Tobago was a colony of the United Kingdom was gradually scaled back until it was discontinued in 1968. (The narrow-gauge agricultural railroad was shut down in the late 1990s). On April 11, 2008 the Trinitrain consortium announced it would plan and build 105  km two line Trinidad Rapid Railway.
