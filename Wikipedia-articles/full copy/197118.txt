[ Early life ] Thigpen was born in Joliet, Illinois, and obtained a degree in teaching. She taught English in high school briefly in while studying theatre and dance at the University of Illinois. Thigpen moved to New York City in 1971 to begin her work as a stage actress. [ Career ] [ Theatre ] Thigpen had a long and prolific theater career, and appeared in numerous musicals including Godspell, The Night That Made America Famous, The Magic Show, Working, Tintypes and An American Daughter (for which she won her Tony Award for her portrayal of Dr. Judith Kaufman in 1997). [ Film ] Her first feature film role was Godspell ( 1973 ) co-starring opposite Victor Garber and David Haskell. She appeared notably as the omniscient Radio DJ in The Warriors, and as (Leonna Barrett) the mother of an expelled student in Lean on Me, a story of famous American principal Joe Louis Clark. She had a role in Shaft, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, as the murder victim&apos;s mother. She also played the Second President of the world council in Bicentennial Man ( 1999 ). Her last film was Anger Management ( 2003 ) starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson (which was released only a month following her death and paid tribute to her in the end credits). [ Television ] Thigpen was perhaps best known for playing Luna in the television show, &quot; Bear in The Big Blue House &quot; as well as &quot; The Chief &quot; of the ACME Detective Agency in the long-running PBS children&apos;s geography game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, which involves both education and comedy, and, on occasion, musical performance. As well as its successor, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?, she still remained the Chief, but was the Chief of ACME Time Net. She also appeared in many other television series during her career, most notably her recurring role as Grace Keefer on the ABC daytime drama All My Children and a supporting role as Ella Mae Farmer, a statistics clerk for the Washington, D.C. police department, on the CBS crime drama The District. She guest-starred in episodes of Gimme A Break!, L.A. Law, Law &amp; Order, The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd, Homicide: Life on the Street, and Thirtysomething. [ Radio ] She appeared in radio skits of the Garrison Keillor program The American Radio Company of the Air. { http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/hodgepodge/25anniversary/timeline.htm } Her voice was also heard on over 20 audio books, primarily works with socially relevant themes. { Muppet Central Articles - Tributes: Lynne Thigpen } [ Death ] Thigpen died of cerebral hemorrhage on March 12, 2003 in her Marina del Rey, California home. She had been complaining of headaches for several days. Drugs and foul play were ruled out by the coroner&apos;s autopsy, which found &quot; acute cardiac dysfunction, non-traumatic systemic and spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage and hemorrhage in the brain &quot;. Thigpen was interred at Elmhurst Cemetery in her hometown of Joliet, Illinois. [ Response and legacy ] When Thigpen died, the third season finale of The District centered around a funeral for her character, Ella Mae Farmer. Her death led to a four-year hiatus of Bear in the Big Blue House. [ January 2010 ] A planned film version of Bear was also put on hold. According to journalist Tara Mooney (who plays Shadow on the show), who interviewed with &quot; Bear&apos;s &quot; Ray D&apos;Arcy on Ireland &apos;s Today FM in 2005, stated that &quot; the crew&apos;s hearts just weren&apos;t in it anymore. &quot; Thigpen&apos;s family and close friends established a non-profit foundation, The Lynne Thigpen - Bobo Lewis Foundation, to help young actresses and actors learn how to survive and succeed in New York theater, to mentor the next generation of Broadway stars. Thigpen was posthumously nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for voicing Luna the moon in Bear in the Big Blue House, but lost to Jeff Corwin. Her final film, Anger Management, starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, was dedicated to her memory.
