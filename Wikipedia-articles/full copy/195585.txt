He served as the model for the character Dean Moriarty in Jack Kerouac &apos;s novel On the Road. [ Biography ] [ Early Years ] Cassady was born to Maude Jean Scheuer and Neal Marshall Cassady in Salt Lake City, Utah. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/books/chapters/1119-1st-sandi.html?_r%3D1%26amp%3Bpagewanted%3Dprint%26amp%3Boref%3Dslogin The New York Times ‘Neal Cassady&apos; David Sandison Graham Vickers 2006-11-19 2010-05-20 ] After his mother died when he was ten, he was raised by his alcoholic father in Denver, Colorado. Cassady spent much of his youth living on the streets of skid row with his father, or spending time in reform school. As a youth, Cassady was repeatedly involved in petty crime. He was arrested for car theft when he was 14, for shoplifting and car theft when he was 15, and for car theft and fencing when he was 16. In 1941, the 15-year old Cassady met Justin W. Brierly, a prominent Denver educator. [ Cassady Moore 2004 1 ] {. } Brierly was well known as a mentor of promising young men, and, impressed by Cassady&apos;s intelligence, Brierly took an active role in Cassady&apos;s life over the next few years. He helped admit Cassady to East High School where he taught, encouraged and supervised his reading, and found employment for him. Cassady continued his criminal activities, however, and was repeatedly arrested from 1942 to 1944; on at least one of these occasions, he was released by law enforcement into Brierly&apos;s safekeeping. In June 1944, Cassady was arrested for receipt of stolen property, and served eleven months of a one-year prison sentence. He and Brierly actively exchanged letters during this period even through Cassady&apos;s intermittent incarcerations; these represent Cassady&apos;s earliest surviving letters. [ Cassady Moore 2004 1 ] {; } [ Sandison Vickers 2006 42–46 ] {. } Brierly, apparently a closeted homosexual, is also believed to have been responsible for Cassady&apos;s first homosexual experience. [ Turner 1996 79 ] { ( &quot; Brierly had been sexually attracted to Neal, and managed to entice him into his first homosexual experience. &quot; ); } [ Sandison Vickers 2006 41–42 ] { ( &quot; Brierly was most likely also a closet homosexual, and it was probably through him that Neal Cassady would first discover and explore gay sex and serve as a hustler in Denver&apos;s gay community. &quot; ). According to some reports, however, Brierly&apos;s sexual orientation was an open secret. See } [ Weir John Everybody knows, nobody cares, or: Neal Cassady&apos;s Penis TriQuarterly http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5075349/Everybody-knows-nobody-cares-or.html June 22, 2005 ] {. } [ Love Life ] In October 1945, after being released from prison, he married the fifteen-year-old LuAnne Henderson. In 1947, Cassady and his wife moved to New York City, where they met Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg at Columbia University through Hal Chase, another protégé of Justin W. Brierly &apos;s. Although Cassady did not attend Columbia, he soon became friends with them and their acquaintances, some of whom later became members of the Beat Generation. Carolyn Robinson met Cassady in 1946 while she worked in Denver, Colorado, as a teaching assistant. Carolyn originally dated Jack Kerouac and would leave the Beat group shortly after walking in on Neal, Allen Ginsberg and Neal&apos;s wife at the time, LuAnne, in bed together. Five weeks after her departure, Neal got an annulment from LuAnne and married Carolyn. Her book, &quot; Off the Road, &quot; details her marriage to Cassady and recalls him as &quot; the archetype of the American Man. &quot; [ Ferlinghetti Lawrence &quot; Off the Road: My Years with Cassady, Kerouac and Ginsberg &quot; 1990 Nation 652-653 ] After Cassady&apos;s marriage to LuAnne Henderson was annulled, Cassady married Carolyn on April 1, 1948. The couple eventually had three children and settled down in a ranch house in Monte Sereno, California, 50 miles south of San Francisco, where Kerouac and Ginsberg sometimes visited. [ Cassady Carolyn 1990 Black Spring Press London 0-948238-05-4 ] In 1950 he entered into a bigamous marriage with Diane Hansen, with whom he fathered one son, Curtis Hansen. During this period, Cassady worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad and kept in touch with his &quot; Beat &quot; acquaintances even as they became increasingly different philosophically. Cassady had a sexual relationship with Ginsberg which lasted off and on for the next twenty years, { Allen Young, &quot; Allen Ginsberg: the Gay Sunshine Interview, &quot; page 1 (Bolinas, California: Grey Fox Press, 1973) } and he traveled cross-country with both Kerouac and Ginsberg on multiple occasions. [ Role of Drugs ] Following an arrest during 1958 for offering to share a small amount of marijuana with an undercover agent at a San Francisco nightclub, Cassady served a sentence at San Quentin State Prison. After his release in June 1960, he struggled to meet family obligations, and Carolyn divorced him when his parole period expired in 1963. Cassady shared an apartment with Allen Ginsberg and Charles Plymell in 1963 at 1403 Gough Street, San Francisco. Cassady first met author Ken Kesey during the summer of 1962, eventually becoming one of the Merry Pranksters, a group who formed around Kesey in 1964 who were vocal proponents of the use of psychedelic drugs. During 1964, he served as the main driver of the bus Further on the iconic first half of the journey from San Francisco to New York, which was immortalized by Tom Wolfe &apos;s book, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. Cassady appears at length in a documentary film about the Merry Pranksters and their cross-country trip, Magic Trip, directed by Alex Gibney, released on 5 August 2011. [ Travels and Death ] In January 1967, Cassady traveled to Mexico with fellow prankster George &quot; Barely Visible &quot; Walker and longtime girlfriend Anne Murphy. [ August 2011 ] In a beachside house just south of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, they were joined by Barbara Wilson and Walter Cox. All-night storytelling, speed drives in Walker&apos;s Lotus Elan and the use of LSD made for a classic Cassady performance – &quot; like a trained bear, &quot; Carolyn Cassady once said. [ August 2011 ] Cassady was beloved for his ability to inspire others to love life. Yet at rare times he was known to express regret over his wild life, especially as it affected his family. [ August 2011 ] At one point Cassady took Cox, then 19, aside and told him, &quot; Twenty years of fast living – there&apos;s just not much left, and my kids are all screwed up. Don&apos;t do what I have done. &quot; [ August 2011 ] During the next year, Cassady&apos;s life became less stable and the pace of his travels became more frenetic. He left Mexico in May, traveling to San Francisco, California; Denver, Colorado; New York City, New York and points in between: then returned to Mexico in September and October (stopping in San Antonio, Texas on the way to visit his oldest daughter who had just given birth to his first grandchild); visited Ken Kesey&apos;s Oregon farm in December; and spent the New Year with Carolyn at a friend&apos;s house near San Francisco. Finally, in late January 1968, Cassady returned to Mexico once again. On February 3, 1968, Cassady attended a wedding party in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the party he went walking along a railroad track to reach the next town, but passed out in the cold and rainy night wearing nothing but a T-shirt and jeans. In the morning, he was found in a coma by the track, reportedly by Dr. Anton Black, later a professor at El Paso Community College, who carried Cassady over his shoulders to the local post office building. Cassady was then transported to the closest hospital, where he died a few hours later on February 4, four days short of his forty-second birthday. The exact cause of Cassady&apos;s death remains uncertain. Those who attended the wedding party confirm that he took an unknown quantity of Secobarbital, a powerful barbiturate sold under the brand name of Seconal, that can easily lead to overdose. Cassady was not a heavy drinker, though he may have participated in a toast to the bride and groom. The physician who performed the autopsy wrote simply &quot; general congestion in all systems &quot;. When interviewed later, the physician stated that he was unable to give an accurate report, because Cassady was a foreigner and there were drugs involved. &apos;Exposure&apos; is commonly cited as his cause of death, although his widow disputes this and believes he may have died of renal failure. { Neal Cassidy website (retrieved 26 January 2009) } [ An American Icon ] &quot; He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con-man, he was only conning because he wanted to so much to live and to get involved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him. &quot; [ Kerouac Jack On The Road 1976 Penguin Group USA 1101127570 ] These lines from &quot; On the Road &quot; provide the core reason that so many were overtaken by Neal. Following WWII, the younger generations of America were left to wander the country in search of a purpose. The dropping of the first nuclear bomb made people all over the world, but most significantly those in the United States, acutely aware of how small their existence is in comparison to the rest of the world. It has been argued that this turning point in American history marked the end of the &quot; era of good feelings &quot; and left people grossly unsettled with their superficial suburban lives; from this came the Beats and Neal Cassady. Neal Cassady was in many ways the poster-child, catalyst, and propellant behind the Beat Generation and in turn, forever impacted American culture. To all who met Neal, there was an undeniable magnetism felt for his unquenchable thirst for life. His appetite for everything was insatiable; he was often described as more of a force of nature rather than a fellow man. [ Sandison, Vickers David, Graham Neal Cassady: The Fast Life of a Beat Hero 2007 Chicago Review Press Chicago, IL 9781556526916 viii. ] Many fell into the spell that Neal seemed to cast upon whichever room he occupied at the present. Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Jack Kerouac were all consumed by Neal&apos;s brilliantly chaotic, Benzedrine filled ramblings about life, and everything in between. In his novel, &quot; On the Road &quot; the narrator, Sal Paradise (the personification of Jack Kerouac) states to the reader that &quot; Somewhere along the line I knew there&apos;d be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line, the pearl would be handed to me. &quot; { On the Road } The &quot; pearl &quot; that Sal (Kerouac) was searching for was what every Beat was searching for, and for the Beats, Neal Cassidy was the phantom that would lead them to &quot; IT &quot;. [ In Literature ] Ken Kesey wrote a fictional account of Cassady&apos;s death in a short story named &quot; The Day After Superman Died &quot;, where Cassady is quoted mumbling the number of railroad tie s he had counted on the line (sixty-four thousand nine-hundred and twenty-eight) as his last words before dying. It was published as a part of Kesey&apos;s 1986 collection Demon Box. Cassady&apos;s autobiographical novel The First Third was published posthumously in 1971, three years after his death. His complete surviving letters are published in Grace Beats Karma: Letters from Prison (Blast, 1993) and Neal Cassady: Collected Letters, 1944-1967 (Penguin, 2007). Cassady was the model for the character Dean Moriarty in Kerouac&apos;s On the Road, and Cody Pomeray in many of Kerouac&apos;s other novels. In the surviving first draft of On the Road, which Kerouac typed on a 120-foot roll of paper specially constructed for that purpose, { Paul Maher Jr. Kerouac: The Definitive Biography (Lanham, MD: Taylor Trade Publishing, 2004) p. 233 ISBN 0-87833-305-3 } the story&apos;s protagonist&apos;s name remains &quot; Neal Cassady. &quot; However, in Kerouac&apos;s final edition of On The Road, Cassady&apos;s character is known as &quot; Dean Moriarty. &quot; One of the interviewees in the film Magic Trip states that Cassady was also the inspiration for the main character of Ken Kesey &apos;s novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest. Ginsberg mentioned Cassady in the notorious and critically acclaimed poem &quot; Howl &quot; (1955) as &quot; N.C., secret hero of these poems... &quot; Cassady is credited with helping Kerouac break with his Thomas Wolfe -influenced sentimental style, as seen in The Town and the City, and Kerouac&apos;s discovery of a unique style of his own he called &quot; spontaneous prose &quot;, a stream of consciousness prose form, first used in On the Road. [ Knight Arthur and Kit Kerouac and the Beats 1988 Paragon House New York, NY 1-55778-067-6 ] [ Hunter Thompson ] In Hunter S. Thompson &apos;s book Hell&apos;s Angels, Cassady is described as &quot; the worldly inspiration for the protagonist of two recent novels, &quot; drunkenly yelling at police at the famed Hells Angels parties at Ken Kesey&apos;s residence in La Honda, California, an event also chronicled in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. Although his name was removed at the insistence of Thompson&apos;s publisher, the description is clearly a reference to the character based on Cassady in Jack Kerouac&apos;s works, On the Road and Visions of Cody. His name appears explicitly in the 50th anniversary edition of the original scroll of On the Road (On the Road: The Original Scroll, Viking 2007). Cassady also appears in Ken Kesey&apos;s book Demon Box as &quot; Superman &quot; in the chapter &quot; The Day After Superman Died &quot; and briefly in &apos;Howl&apos; by Allen Ginsberg under the initials &apos;NC&apos; as &apos;the secret hero of these poems&apos;. [ In Music ] Cassady lived briefly with The Grateful Dead and is immortalized in the &quot; Cryptical Envelopment &quot; section of their song &quot; That&apos;s It For The Other One &quot; as the bus driver &quot; Cowboy Neal. &quot; { http://www.dead.net/song/other-one, retrieved 4 August 2007 } { http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/other1.html, retrieved 23 August 2007 } A second Grateful Dead song, &quot; Cassidy, &quot; by John Perry Barlow, { Cassidy&apos;s Tale } might seem to be a misspelling of Cassady&apos;s name; in fact the song primarily celebrates the 1970 birth of baby girl Cassidy Law into the Grateful Dead family, though the lyrics also include references to Neal Cassady himself. A New York City -based folk duo, Aztec Two Step, in their 1972 debut album memorialized Cassady in the song &quot; The Persecution &amp; Restoration of Dean Moriarty (On The Road) &quot;. The Beat-inspired folk revival band the Washington Squares released a song named &quot; Neal Cassady &quot; on their 1989 album Fair and Square. The Doobie Brothers guitarist and songwriter Patrick Simmons refers to Cassady in his song &quot; Neal&apos;s Fandango &quot; as his incentive for taking to the road. The progressive rock band King Crimson released a song named &quot; Neal and Jack and Me &quot; on their 1982 album Beat. Tom Waits composed and recorded a song named &quot; Jack &amp; Neal &quot; (included in his 1977 Foreign Affairs album) about a trip to California, with Neal Cassady driving in the company of Jack Kerouac. The Franco-American band Moriarty is named after the fictional character Dean Moriarty that Kerouac created from Neal Cassady. Fatboy Slim produced a track, &quot; Neal Cassady Starts Here &quot;, that appeared as a B-side to the singles Santa Cruz and Everybody Needs A 303. Singer-songwriter Eric Taylor &apos;s 1995 song &quot; Dean Moriarty &quot; describes a character patterned after Neal Cassady. Jazz guitarist John Scofield wrote a song called &quot; Cassidae &quot; [sic], released on his 1979 album &quot; Who&apos;s who ? &quot;. [ In Film ] Neal Cassady and his friendship with Jack Kerouac were portrayed in John Byrum &apos;s film, Heart Beat, starring Nick Nolte as Cassady and John Heard as Kerouac. The film was based on Carolyn Cassady&apos;s memoir of the same name. Released in 1980 immediately after Warner Bros. acquired Orion Pictures, the film was given a limited release due to studio politics and a perceived lack of public interest, and the film quickly fell from view. Talk show host Steve Allen, who was a big supporter of On The Road appears briefly as himself. The film Who&apos;ll Stop The Rain (1978) is a psychological drama released by United Artists. The film is based on Robert Stone&apos;s novel Dog Soldiers. This film also starred Nick Nolte. Stone based the character of Ray Hicks (Nolte) on Beat writer Cassady, with whom Stone became acquainted through novelist Kesey, a classmate of Stone&apos;s in graduate school at Stanford University. Hicks&apos; death scene on the railroad tracks at the film&apos;s conclusion was directly based on Cassady&apos;s death along a railroad track outside of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico in 1968. The film The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), with Thomas Jane as Cassady, is based on the &quot; Joan Anderson letter &quot; written by Cassady to Jack Kerouac in December 1950. Although much of this letter had been lost, a surviving remnant was originally published in a 1964 edition of John Bryan&apos;s magazine Notes from Underground. A 2007 short film, Luz Del Mundo, deals with Cassady&apos;s friendship and adventures with Jack Kerouac. Cassady is played by Austin Nichols and Kerouac is played by Will Estes. IMDB title The biopic Neal Cassady, was also released in 2007. IMDB entry This film focuses more on the Prankster years and stars Tate Donovan as Neal, Amy Ryan as Carolyn Cassady, Chris Bauer as Kesey, and Glenn Fitzgerald as Kerouac. Noah Buschel wrote and directed the film. The film deals primarily with how Neal became trapped by his fictional alter-ego, Dean Moriarty. The Cassady family criticized this film as highly inaccurate. http://www.nealcassadyestate.com/carolyn.html, retrieved 28 August 2007 [ http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/movies/03sundance.html Sundance Tries to Hone Its Artsy Edge Brooks Barnes December 2, 2009 newyorktimes.com ] [ http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/alessandro-nivola-is-hotter-than-audrey-tautou/11028 Alessandro Nivola is hotter than Audrey Tautou BlackBookMag.com 2009-09-22 ] Cassady is portrayed by Jon Prescott in the film, Howl, which chronicles the creation of the poem &quot; Howl &quot; by Allen Ginsberg and the obscenity trial surrounding its publication.
