&quot; Desolation Row &quot; is a 1965 song written and sung by Bob Dylan. It was recorded on August 4, 1965 and released as the closing track of Dylan&apos;s sixth studio album, Highway 61 Revisited. It has been noted for its length (11:21) and surreal lyrics in which Dylan weaves characters from history, fiction, the Bible and his own invention into a series of vignettes that suggest entropy and urban chaos. [ Recording ] [ Desolation Row.ogg &quot; Desolation Row &quot; ] &quot; Desolation Row &quot; was first recorded during a late evening session on July 29, 1965 with Harvey Brooks on electric bass and Al Kooper on electric guitar. This version was eventually released in 2005 on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack. [ Gorodetsky 2005 ] On August 2, Dylan recorded five further takes of &quot; Desolation Row &quot;.

Nashville -based guitarist Charlie McCoy, who happened to be in New York, was invited by producer Bob Johnston to contribute an improvised acoustic guitar part and Russ Savakus played bass guitar. [ Polizzotti 2006 141–142 ] [ http://www.bjorner.com/DSN00785%20%2865%29.htm#DSN01100 Columbia Recording Studios, 4th August, 1965 Bjorner, Olof 2010-11-17 2011-02-14 Bjorner&apos;s still on the road ] Polizzotti credits much of the success of the song to McCoy&apos;s contribution: &quot; While Dylan&apos;s panoramic lyrics and hypnotic melody sketch out the vast canvas, it is McCoy&apos;s fills that give it their shading. &quot; [ Release and interpretation ] When asked where &quot; Desolation Row &quot; was located, at a TV press conference in San Francisco on December 3, 1965, Dylan replied: &quot; Oh, that&apos;s some place in Mexico, it&apos;s across the border. It&apos;s noted for its Coke factory. &quot; [ Cott 2006 72 ] Al Kooper, who played electric guitar on the first recordings of &quot; Desolation Row &quot;, suggested that it was located on a stretch of Eighth Avenue, Manhattan, &quot; an area infested with whore houses, sleazy bars and porno supermarkets totally beyond renovation or redemption &quot;. [ Polizzotti 2006 133 ] Polizzotti suggests that both the inspiration and title of the song may have come from Desolation Angels by Jack Kerouac, and Cannery Row by John Steinbeck. &quot; Desolation Row &quot; has been described as Dylan&apos;s most ambitious work up to that date. { Heylin, Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited, p. 219. } In the New Oxford Companion to Music, Gammond described &quot; Desolation Row &quot; as an example of Dylan&apos;s work that achieved a &quot; high level of poetical lyricism. &quot; Clinton Heylin notes that Dylan is writing a song as long as traditional folk ballads, such as &quot; Tam Lin &quot; and &quot; Matty Groves &quot;, and in that classic ballad metre, but without any linear narrative thread. [ Heylin 2009 248 ] When he reviewed the Highway 61 Revisited album for The Daily Telegraph in 1965, the English poet Philip Larkin described the song as a &quot; marathon &quot;, with an &quot; enchanting tune and mysterious, possibly half-baked words &quot;. [ Larkin 1985 151 ] For Andy Gill the song is &quot; an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of iconic characters, some historical ( Einstein, Nero ), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary ( T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound ), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse. &quot; [ Gill 1999 89 ] When Jann Wenner asked Dylan in 1969 whether Allen Ginsberg had influenced his songs, Dylan replied: &quot; I think he did at a certain period. That period of... &quot; Desolation Row &quot;, that kind of New York type period, when all the songs were just city songs. His poetry is city poetry. Sounds like the city. &quot; { Wenner, Jann. Rolling Stone, November 29, 1969, reprinted in } [ Cott 2006 148 ] The south-western flavored acoustic guitar backing and eclecticism of the imagery led Polizzotti to describe &quot; Desolation Row &quot; as the &quot; ultimate cowboy song, the &apos;Home On The Range&apos; of the frightening territory that was mid-sixties America &quot;. [ Polizzotti 2006 139–141 ] In the penultimate verse the passengers on the Titanic are &quot; shouting &quot; Which side are you on? &quot; &quot;, a slogan of Left-wing politics, so, for Robert Shelton, one of the targets of this song is &quot; simpleminded political commitment. What difference which side you&apos;re on if you&apos;re sailing on the Titanic? &quot; [ Shelton 1986 283 ] In an interview with USA Today on September 10, 2001, the day before the release of his album Love and Theft, Dylan claimed that the song &quot; is a minstrel song through and through. I saw some ragtag minstrel show in blackface at the carnivals when I was growing up, and it had an effect on me, just as much as seeing the lady with four legs. &quot; [ Edna Gunderson Dylan is positively on top of his game http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2001-09-10-bob-dylan.htm#more 2001-10-09 USA Today 2011-03-02 ] The song opens with a report that &quot; they&apos;re selling postcards of the hanging &quot;, and notes &quot; the circus is in town &quot;. Polizzotti, and other critics, have connected this song with the lynching of three black men in Duluth. The men were employed by a travelling circus and had been accused of raping a white woman. On the night of June 15, 1920, they were removed from custody and hanged on the corner of First Street and Second Avenue East. Photos of the lynching were sold as postcards. [ Polizzotti 2006 134–135 ] Duluth was Bob Dylan’s birthplace; at the time of the lynching, Dylan’s father, Abram Zimmerman, was eight years old, and lived two blocks from the scene of the lynchings. Abram Zimmerman passed the story on to his son. { Hoekstra, Dave, &quot; Dylan&apos;s Duluth Faces Up to Its Past, &quot; Chicago Sun-Times, July 1, 2001. &quot; The family lived a couple of blocks away from the lynching site at what is now a parking lot at 221 Lake Ave. North. &quot; The connection is also made by Andrew Buncombe in a June 17, 2001, article in The Independent (London): &quot; &apos;They&apos;re Selling Postcards of the Hanging...&apos;: Duluth&apos;s Day of Desolation Remembered. &quot; } { In The Bootleg Series Volume 7 recording, Dylan changes the lyric &quot; On her 22nd birthday she already is an old maid &quot; to &quot; On her twentieth birthday she was already an old maid. &quot; Irene Tusken, the supposed victim of the alleged rape that was the catalyst for the Duluth Lynchings was 19 years old at the time. (Fedo, Michael (2000). The Lynchings in Duluth. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press) } Rolling Stone ranked the song as number 187 in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. [ The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html#500Songs Rock List Music 2010-12-09 ] [ Live performance ] Dylan premiered &quot; Desolation Row &quot; at the Forest Hills Music Festival in Queens, New York on August 28, 1965, after he &quot; controversially went electric &quot; at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. It was part of the acoustic set Dylan played before bringing on his electric band. The displaced images and Kafkaesque cavalcade of historical characters were at first greeted with laughter. { Heylin, Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited, pp. 219-226. } Live versions are included on Dylan&apos;s MTV Unplugged, and Live 1966. The song is still featured in live performances as recent as November 2011.

The song is included on their 2002 release Postcards of the Hanging (which, in itself, is an allusion to the lyrics of &quot; Desolation Row &quot; ), which features a recording from March 24, 1990, at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York. The song was frequently included in Dead set lists and is often abbreviated as &quot; D-Row. &quot; Italian singer-songwriter Fabrizio de André wrote &quot; Via della Povertà &quot;, an Italian translation of &quot; Desolation Row &quot;, and included it in his 1974 album Canzoni. In Norway, Åge Aleksandersen recorded his version called &quot; Nederst på Karl Johan &quot; (on Fredløs: Dylan på norsk, 1997). Dan Tillberg made a Swedish cover version called &quot; Hopplöshetens gränd &quot; on the &quot; Kärlek minus noll &quot; ( &quot; Love Minus Zero &quot; ) cover album. Chris Smither recorded the song on his 2003 album Train Home with Bonnie Raitt providing backup on vocals and slide guitar.
