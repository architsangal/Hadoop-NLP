[ ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ studio Ministry Ministry-Psalm69.jpg July 14, 1992 1991–1992 at Chicago Trax Studios Industrial metal 44:38 Sire / Warner Bros. (26727) Hypo Luxa, Hermes Pan In Case You Didn&apos;t Feel Like Showing Up (1990) Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs(1992) Box (1993) ] Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs is the common title for the fifth studio album by industrial metal band Ministry, released in 1992 on Sire Records. The actual title of the album is ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ (a Greek word meaning &quot; head &quot;, and the number 69 in Greek numerals ), though Psalm 69 is used for simplicity&apos;s sake. The album gave Ministry a more mainstream audience, with the track &quot; Jesus Built My Hotrod &quot; receiving major airplay on MTV and various other music stations. [ January 2011 ] Psalm 69 also marked Ministry&apos;s first release with guitarist Mike Scaccia, who had joined the band in 1989. The song &quot; N.W.O. &quot; (New World Order) features samples of George H. W. Bush and was used in the Ralph Bakshi half-live action/half-animated film Cool World. It is front man Al Jourgensen&apos;s critical take on the state of world affairs after the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War and an uncertain future. &quot; Jesus Built My Hotrod &quot; features guest vocals by Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers. [ Etymology ] The title of the album is directly linked to chapter 69 of The Book of Lies, a written work of Aleister Crowley, where he uses the expression &quot; The way to succeed and the way to suck eggs &quot; as a pun for the 69 sex position ( &quot; suck seed &quot; and &quot; suck eggs &quot; ). Moreover, Crowley titled the chapter ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ, Greek κεφαλη or &quot; head &quot; and Ξ Θ or &quot; 69 &quot; (both slang in English for oral sex - but not the original ancient Greek words) and is used often in the New Testament. There is no direct link to the Old Testament passage Psalm 69. Since the album&apos;s release, Ministry had put multiple references to the number 69 in future albums. For example, the albums Dark Side of the Spoon and Houses of the Molé both had hidden track s with a track number of 69.
