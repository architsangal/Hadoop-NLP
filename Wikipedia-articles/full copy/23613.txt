Postmodern music is either simply music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetical and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to modernism. Even so, postmodern music still does not primarily define itself in opposition to modernist music; this label is applied instead by critics and theorists. Postmodern music is not a distinct musical style, but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. The terms &quot; postmodern &quot;, &quot; postmodernism &quot;, &quot; postmodernist &quot;, and &quot; postmodernity &quot; are exasperating terms (Bertens 1995, 3). Indeed, postmodernists question the tight definitions and categories of academic disciplines, which they regard simply as the remnants of modernity (Rosenau 1992, 6–7). [ The postmodernist musical attitude ] Postmodernism in music is not a distinct musical style, but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. Postmodernist music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with postmodernist art —that is, art that comes after and reacts against modernism (see Modernism in Music ). Fredric Jameson, the major figure in the thinking on postmodernism and culture, calls postmodernism &quot; the cultural dominant of the logic of late capitalism &quot; (Jameson 1991, 46), meaning that, through globalization, postmodern culture is tied inextricably with capitalism (Mark Fisher, writing 20 years later, goes further, essentially calling it the sole cultural possibility (Fisher 2009, 4)). Drawing from Jameson and other theorists, David Beard and Kenneth Gloag argue that, in music, postmodernism is not just an attitude but also an inevitability in the current cultural climate of fragmentation (Beard and Gloag 2005, 141–45). As early as 1938, Theodor Adorno had already identified a trend toward the dissolution of &quot; a culturally dominant set of values &quot; (Beard and Gloag 2005, 141), citing the commodification of all genres as beginning of the end of genre or value distinctions in music (Adorno 2002, 293–95). In some respects, Postmodern music could be categorized as simply the music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism, but with Jameson in mind, it is clear these definitions are inadequate. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of modernism, but in fact postmodern music is more to do with functionality and the effect of globalization than it is with a specific reaction, movement, or attitude (Beard and Gloag 2005, 142). In the face of capitalism, Jameson says, &quot; It is safest to grasp the concept of the postmodern as an attempt to think the present historically in an age that has forgotten how to think historically in the first place &quot; (Jameson 1991, ix). Jonathan Kramer posits the idea (following Umberto Eco and Jean-François Lyotard ) that postmodernism (including musical postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an attitude. Kramer enumerates 16 (arguably subjective) &quot; characteristics of postmodern music, by which I mean music that is understood in a postmodern manner, or that calls forth postmodern listening strategies, or that provides postmodern listening experiences, or that exhibits postmodern compositional practices. &quot; According to Kramer (Kramer 2002, 16–17), postmodern music: is not simply a repudiation of modernism or its continuation, but has aspects of both a break and an extension is, on some level and in some way, ironic does not respect boundaries between sonorities and procedures of the past and of the present challenges barriers between &apos;high&apos; and &apos;low&apos; styles shows disdain for the often unquestioned value of structural unity questions the mutual exclusivity of elitist and populist values avoids totalizing forms (e.g., does not want entire pieces to be tonal or serial or cast in a prescribed formal mold) considers music not as autonomous but as relevant to cultural, social, and political contexts includes quotations of or references to music of many traditions and cultures considers technology not only as a way to preserve and transmit music but also as deeply implicated in the production and essence of music embraces contradictions distrusts binary oppositions includes fragmentations and discontinuities encompasses pluralism and eclecticism presents multiple meanings and multiple temporalities locates meaning and even structure in listeners, more than in scores, performances, or composers It should be noted here that Kramer is again referencing work in the Western art music tradition, and does not seem to be addressing music from the &quot; popular &quot; end of the spectrum [ February 2012 ]; this kind of intentionality is not unheard-of in popular music, but it is quite unusual. [ February 2012 ] [ Timescale ] One author has suggested that the emergence of postmodern music in popular music occurred in the late 1960s, influenced in part by psychedelic rock and one or more of the later Beatles albums (Sullivan 1995, 217). Beard and Gloag support this position, citing Jameson&apos;s theory that &quot; the radical changes of musical styles and languages throughout the 1960s [are] now seen as a reflection of postmodernism &quot; (Beard and Gloag 2005, 142; see also Harvey 1990). Others have placed the beginnings of postmodernism in the arts, with particular reference to music, at around 1930 (Karolyi 1994, 135; Meyer 1994, 331–32).
