As the area became prosperous, wealthy traders set up shops and houses, and guild s were formed. Unlike other settlements in the vicinity, Oundle was unaffected by the Black Death in the mid-14th century. [ August 2008 ] Oundle had a grammar school since at least 1465, at which Sir William Laxton (Lord Mayor of London) was educated. He founded Laxton Grammar School in 1556, administered by the Worshipful Company of Grocers, from which Oundle School evolved. In 1743, a group of mutineers from the Black Watch were captured at Ladywood, near Oundle. They had deserted in protest at being sent abroad, instead of patrolling the Highlands, for which the regiment had been raised. { The Black Watch - The Mutiny } { Legends of The Black Watch or Forty-Second Highlanders - The Story of Farquhar Shaw } [ Buildings ] Among the oldest buildings is the Talbot Hotel. This was constructed of timber; it was rebuilt with stone from the ruins of nearby Fotheringhay Castle. Other public house s include the Rose &amp; Crown, the Ship Inn (a 14th century coaching inn ), the Angel, the George and the Riverside, which is currently derelict. There are a number of churches.
