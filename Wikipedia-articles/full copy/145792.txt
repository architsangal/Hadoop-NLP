There are many other hydrological divides in the Americas, however the Great Divide is by far the most prominent of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, at a generally much higher elevation than the other divides. [ Geography ] { Front Range of the } { Rocky Mountains of north central } { Colorado, taken from the } { International Space Station on October 28, 2008 } The Continental Divide of the Americas begins at Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, the westernmost point on the mainland of the Americas. The Divide crosses northern Alaska into the Yukon, then zig-zags south into British Columbia via the Cassiar Mountains and Omineca Mountains and northern Nechako Plateau to Summit Lake, north of the city of Prince George and just south of the community of McLeod Lake. From there the Divide traverses the McGregor Plateau to the spine of the Rockies, following the crest of the Canadian Rockies southeast to the 120th meridian west, from there forming the boundary between southern British Columbia and southern Alberta. The Divide crosses into the United States in northwestern Montana, at the boundary between Waterton Lakes National Park and Glacier National Park. In Canada, it forms the western boundary of Waterton Lakes National Park, and in the US bisects Glacier National Park. Further south, the Divide forms the backbone of the Rocky Mountain Front (Front Range) in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, heads south towards Helena and Butte, then west through the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness to the Bitterroot Range, where it forms the eastern third of the state boundary between Idaho and Montana. The Divide crosses into Wyoming within Yellowstone National Park and continues south-east into Colorado, then western New Mexico. Note that, although the Divide represents the height of land between watersheds, it does not always follow the highest ranges/peaks within each state or province. In Mexico, it passes through Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Querétaro, México, the Federal District, Morelos, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. In Central America, it continues through southern Guatemala, southwestern Honduras, western Nicaragua, and western/southwestern Costa Rica, and southern Panama. The Divide continues into South America, where it follows the peaks of the Andes Mountains, traversing western Colombia, central Ecuador, western and southwestern Peru, and eastern Chile (essentially conforming to the Chile- Bolivia and Chile- Argentina boundaries), southward to the southern end of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. In North America another, mainly non-mountainous divide, the Laurentian Divide (or Northern Divide), further separates the Hudson Bay - Arctic Ocean drainage region from the Atlantic watershed region. Secondary divides separate the watersheds that flow into the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway (ultimately into the Atlantic) from watersheds that flow to the Atlantic via the Missouri-Mississippi complex. Another secondary divide follows the Appalachian chain, which separates those streams and rivers that flow directly into the Atlantic Ocean from those that exit via the Mississippi River. [ Triple points ] Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park, Montana, is the point where two of the principal continental divides in North America converge, the Great Divide and the Northern or Laurentian Divide. From this point, waters flow to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Ocean via Hudson Bay. Most geographers, geologists, meteorologists, and oceanographers consider this point the hydrological apex of North America. This is not the only place on earth where two oceanic divides meet, i.e., where waters from a single point area feed into three different oceans. This status of Triple Divide Peak is the main reason behind the designation of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park as the &quot; Crown of the Continent &quot; of North America Sources differ, however, on whether Hudson Bay is part of the Atlantic or Arctic Ocean. Hudson Bay&apos;s waters flow predominantly to the Atlantic and do not directly contribute to the Arctic Ocean. [ Lewis Edward Lyn Jones E. Peter North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

[ Birrel Dave Snow Dome Peaks of the Canadian Rockes PeakFinder (Rocky Mountain Books) 2007 http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName%3DSnow%2BDome 2007-12-28 ] From this peak, water flows into the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River system; the Arctic Ocean via the Athabasca River and MacKenzie River systems; and Hudson Bay via the North Saskatchewan River system. Canadians generally consider Snow Dome the hydrological apex of North America because they consider Hudson Bay an extension of the Atlantic Ocean, [ Sanford Robert W. Our World&apos;s Heritage: Creating a Culture Worthy of Place in Canada&apos;s Western Mountain Parks 2010 Athabasca University Press 978-1-897425-57-2 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D2aPnUlT5HAkC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA160 160 ] and because Snow Dome is [ 1000 m ] higher than Triple Divide Peak and receives considerably more precipitation. [ Timmer Henry Snow Dome - The Hydrological Apex of North America Snow Dome climbwild.net 2006 http://climbwild.net/MP_Snow_Dome_page_one.html 2007-12-28 ] In fact, there are such triple divide points wherever any two continental divides meet. [ Andersen Robert N. Triple Divide Points and North American Drainage Basins University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire 2006 http://www.uwec.edu/andersrn/Triple_Divide_Pts.htm 2007-12-29 ] North America can be considered to have five major drainage systems: into the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, plus Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Within this system there are four continental divides and three triple points, the two mentioned previously and a third near Hibbing, Minnesota where the Northern Divide intersects the Saint Lawrence Seaway divide. [ monica driscollian rivers atlas Minnesota Rivers Map Minnesota State Map Collection Geology.com 2006 http://geology.com/state-map/minnesota.shtml 2007-12-29 ] Since there is no true consensus on what a continental divide is, there is no real agreement on where the triple points are. [ Gonzalez Mark A. Continental Divides in North Dakota and North America NGDS Newsletter North Dakota Geological Survey 2002 https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/Newsletter/NLS03/pdf/Divide.pdf 2007-12-29 ] However, the main Continental Divide described in this article is a far more distinctive geological feature than the others and its two main triple points are much more prominent. [ Hiking Trail ] The Continental Divide Trail follows the divide through the U.S. from the Mexican border to the Canadian border. A less-developed Canadian extension called the Great Divide Trail continues through five national parks and six provincial parks, ending at Kakwa Lake in east-central British Columbia. [ Lynx Dustin Hiking Canada&apos;s Great Divide Trail Rocky Mountain Books 2000 http://rmbooks.com/book_details.php?isbn_upc%3D9781894765893 0-921102-79-8 ] [ Human Impact ] Aboriginal impact with The Divide in North America was largely undocumented until the early 19th Century, when the Corps of Discovery first crossed then recrossed it in search of a waterway connecting the Columbia and Missouri drainages. A slightly earlier voyage by Simon Fraser crossed the Divide further north. Much of the exploration was in search of a fabled Northwest Passage. { Allen, John Logan, Journey through the Garden, 1974, ISBN 0-252-00397-7 } Aboriginal in-migration is thought to have been profoundly affected by the Divide. [ Exceptions ] Many endorheic regions in North America complicate the simple view of east or west, &quot; ocean-bound &quot; water flow. Several endorheic basins straddle the continental divide, including the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming, the Guzmán Basin in New Mexico and Chihuahua, Mexico, and the Bolsón de Mapimí in Mexico. Water from North Two Ocean Creek and Isa Lake, on the continental divide in Wyoming flow into both oceans.
