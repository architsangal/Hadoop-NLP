Its members were in bands such as Carcass, Armageddon, Carnage, Mercyful Fate, Spiritual Beggars, and Eucharist to name a few. It was founded by Carcass guitarist Michael Amott along with Johan Liiva, who were both originally from the influential death metal band Carnage. The band has released nine studio albums, a live album ( Burning Japan Live 1999 ), two DVD s and three EPs. The band was originally fronted by Johan Liiva, who was replaced by German Angela Gossow as lead vocalist in 2000. [ History ] [ Early years and Black Earth (1996–1997) ] Arch Enemy, the brainchild of Michael Amott ( Carcass, Carnage, and Spiritual Beggars ) was originally assembled when Michael Amott left Carcass. Guitarists Michael Amott and younger brother Christopher Amott ( Armageddon ) joined with vocalist Johan Liiva (ex-Carnage, Furbowl, Devourment) and then-session drummer Daniel Erlandsson ( Eucharist ) in what Michael Amott called &quot; an attempt to merge melody with aggression and technicality &quot;. [ January 2010 ] The band&apos;s debut, entitled Black Earth was recorded in Studio Fredman and released by the now defunct Wrong Again Records in 1996. It obtained a fair amount of success in Japan, achieving MTV rotation with their first single &quot; Bury Me an Angel &quot;, as well as moderate success in Sweden. At this point, Arch Enemy was more of a &quot; solo effort &quot; than a full band; Michael Amott wrote all the songs himself, and even played bass guitar on the album, contrary to the album&apos;s liner notes, which listed vocalist Johan Liiva as handling bass duties. Amott later revealed that he had the credits listed that way to make the album seem more of a &quot; band &quot; effort. Many consider it to be the band&apos;s most aggressive album, a trait that was softened to some degree on its following releases, but never abandoned. [ January 2010 ] [ Stigmata, Burning Bridges, and Gossow (1998–2000) ] Arch Enemy drummer Daniel Erlandsson After the release of Black Earth the band switched labels, signing a contract with Century Media. In 1998 Arch Enemy released Stigmata, for which bassist Martin Bengtsson and drummer Peter Wildoer joined the band. The album caught the attention of a wider audience, gaining popularity in both Europe and America. This was also the first Arch Enemy album to be released worldwide. In 1999, Sharlee D&apos;Angelo assumed the role of Arch Enemy&apos;s bassist, and Daniel Erlandsson was once again recruited to handle drum duties, this time on a permanent basis. Burning Bridges was released, and was soon followed by the live album Burning Japan Live 1999, which was initially a release limited to Japan, but later given worldwide distribution due to strong demand. [ January 2010 ] During the touring-cycle for Burning Bridges, Sharlee D&apos;Angelo was temporarily replaced twice; first by Dick Lövgren ( Meshuggah, ex- Armageddon ) and then by Roger Nilsson (ex- Spiritual Beggars, Firebird, The Quill ). Burning Bridges marked a shift in Arch Enemy&apos;s core sound, now opting for a more melodic approach, while still keeping the original melodic death metal-sound first heard on the first two albums. [ January 2010 ] In November 2000, vocalist Johan Liiva was asked to quit the band. Michael Amott stated that the he wanted more dynamics from the band&apos;s frontman, and that Liiva&apos;s live performance was not up to par with the rest of the band.

[ Wages of Sin and Anthems of Rebellion (2001–2004) ] The first album with songs featuring Gossow was Wages of Sin, released in 2001.
