He tries to make a home for his family, but Kate Dawson, the aging spinster who raised him after his parents died, remains a formidable presence in his life and tries to sabotage his efforts, threatening to have him returned to prison if he fails to acquiesce to her demands.

[ Critical reception ] Bosley Crowther, film critic for the New York Times, observed, &quot; As honest and humble as is the effort to make the viewer sense a woman&apos;s baffled love for a shifty and mixed-up fellow in Baby, the Rain Must Fall, there is a major and totally neglected weakness in this film from a Horton Foote play that troubles one&apos;s mind throughout the picture and leaves one sadly let-down at the end. It is the failure of the screenwriter--Mr. Foote himself--to clarify why the object of the woman&apos;s deep affection is as badly mixed-up as he is and why the woman, who seems a sensible person, doesn&apos;t make a single move to straighten him out...Granting that the wife is astonished and distressingly mystified at the neurotic behavior of her husband, this doesn&apos;t mean that the viewer is satisfied to be kept in the dark as to the reasons for the stark and macabre goings-on...As it is, we only see that these two people are frustrated and heart-broken by something that&apos;s bigger than the both of them. But we don&apos;t know what it is. &quot; { Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review review, January 14, 1965. } The staff at Variety said the film&apos;s chief assets were &quot; outstanding performances by its stars and an emotional punch that lingers...Other cast members are adequate, but roles suffer from editorial cuts (confirmed by director) that leave sub-plots dangling. &quot; { &apos;&apos;Variety&apos;&apos;. Film review, January 13, 1965. } [ References ] [ 2 ] As a side note, in one scene where McQueen sings at a bar with his rockabilly band, one of his bandmates is singer-song writer Glen Campbell, who is uncredited in the film.
