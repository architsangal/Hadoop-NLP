It stars Christian Bale as Batman, along with Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Ken Watanabe, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer. The film reboots the &apos;&apos;Batman&apos;&apos; film series, telling the origin story of the character and begins with Bruce Wayne&apos;s initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, and his journey to becoming Batman. It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Long Halloween. After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman on screen following the 1997 critical failure of Batman &amp; Robin, Nolan and David S. Goyer began work on the film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film. The goal was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The film, which was primarily shot in England and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and miniatures — computer-generated imagery was used minimally. A new Batmobile (called the Tumbler) and a more mobile Batsuit were both created specifically for the film. Batman Begins was both critically and commercially successful. The film opened on June 15, 2005, in the United States and Canada in 3,858  theaters. It grossed $48  million in its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $372  million worldwide. The film received an 85  percent overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes. Critics noted that fear was a common theme throughout the film, and remarked that it had a darker tone compared with previous Batman films. The film begins Nolan&apos;s Batman trilogy; a sequel titled The Dark Knight was released in July 2008 and also saw the return of both Nolan and Bale to the franchise, [ http://www.leesmovieinfo.net/Video-Sales.php?type%3D3 Lee&apos;s Movie Info – DVD Sales Chart Leesmovieinfo.net April 19, 2005 January 2, 2011 ] and a second sequel titled The Dark Knight Rises is scheduled for release in July 2012.

As he completes his training, Bruce learns of the League&apos;s true intentions: to liberate Gotham from the evils that plague it by destroying the city. He burns down the League&apos;s temple, killing Ra&apos;s in the process, while saving the life of Ducard. } Bruce returns to Gotham. While publicly posing as a reckless playboy, he takes an interest in his family&apos;s company, Wayne Enterprises, a technology and defense conglomerate run by the unscrupulous CEO William Earle, who intends to take the company public. Bruce meets Lucius Fox, who introduces him to several of Wayne&apos;s experimental prototype technologies, including an armored car and protective bodysuit, which Bruce uses to form his crime-fighting persona, Batman. As Batman, Bruce intercepts an illegal drug shipment, empowering Sgt. Jim Gordon and the Gotham police to arrest the previously untouchable Falcone. Meanwhile, a Wayne Enterprises cargo ship is raided and an experimental weapon is stolen, a &quot; Microwave Emitter &quot; that uses microwaves to vaporize an enemy&apos;s water supply. Back in Gotham, Falcone and his henchmen are declared mentally unfit for trial and transferred to Arkham Asylum by the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane, who had been using Falcone to import a dangerous hallucinogenic drug that causes severe psychosis. Crane exposes Falcone to the toxin while wearing a burlap mask, driving Falcone mad with fear of the &quot; Scarecrow. &quot; While investigating Crane, Batman is also exposed to the drug and is rescued by Alfred and given an antidote by Fox. Rachel goes to Arkham, where Crane reveals that he has been dumping the toxin into Gotham&apos;s water supply before dosing her with it. She is rescued by Batman, who exposes Crane to the toxin and interrogates him. Crane reveals that the toxin is harmless in liquid form and only dangerous if inhaled. Batman inoculates Rachel and gives her two vials of the antidote, one for Sgt. Gordon and one for mass production. At his birthday celebration at Wayne Manor, Bruce is confronted by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra&apos;s al Ghul. Bruce fakes a drunken tirade to get rid of his guests, leaving him alone with Ra&apos;s and his ninjas. Ra&apos;s reveals the League&apos;s plan to destroy Gotham: having stolen the Microwave Emitter and conspired with Crane, they intend to vaporize the city&apos;s toxin-riddled water supply, creating mass hysteria and violence. The League sets fire to the mansion and Bruce is nearly trapped inside but is saved by Alfred. As the League begins unleashing the toxin, Batman rescues Rachel from a drug-induced mob and reveals his true identity to her. He entrusts Sgt. Gordon with the Batmobile and pursues Ra&apos;s, who is using Gotham&apos;s train system to deliver the weapon throughout the city. Batman confronts Ra&apos;s on the train and escapes just as Gordon uses the Batmobile to destroy the elevated tracks, leaving Ra&apos;s to die in the ensuing crash. Batman becomes a public hero, but simultaneously loses Rachel, who cannot bring herself to love both Bruce and Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly-traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Jim Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant. He shows Batman the new Bat-Signal and mentions a new costumed criminal who leaves Joker cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate, and disappears into the night.

Traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City&apos;s vigilante protector. Bale was cast on September 11, 2003, having expressed interest in playing Batman since Darren Aronofsky was planning his own film adaptation. Some of the early candidates for the Batman/Bruce Wayne role were Billy Crudup, Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Dancy, Joshua Jackson, Eion Bailey, and Cillian Murphy. Bale felt the previous films underused Batman&apos;s character, overplaying the villains instead. To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Director Nolan said of Bale, &quot; He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for. &quot; Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities. Bale described the part as playing four characters: the raging Batman persona; the shallow playboy façade Bruce uses to ward off suspicion; the vengeful young man; and the older, angrier Bruce who is discovering his purpose in life. Bale&apos;s dislike of his costume, which heated up regularly, helped him get into a necessarily foul mood. He said, &quot; Batman&apos;s meant to be fierce, and you become a beast in that suit, as Batman should be – not a man in a suit, but a different creature. &quot; Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in The Machinist, Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. He first went well over the weight required and created concern over whether he would look right for the part. Bale recognized that his large physique was not appropriate for Batman, who relies on speed and strategy. He lost the excess weight by the time filming began. The role of Bruce Wayne at age eight was portrayed by Gus Lewis. Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth The trusted butler to Bruce Wayne&apos;s parents, who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Bruce Wayne&apos;s closest confidant. Nolan felt Caine would effectively portray the foster father element of the character. Although Alfred&apos;s family is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations, Caine created his own backstory, in that before becoming Wayne&apos;s butler, Alfred served in the Special Air Service. After being wounded, he was invited to the position of the Wayne family butler by Thomas Wayne because, &quot; He wanted a butler, but someone a bit tougher than that, you know? &quot; Liam Neeson as Ra&apos;s al Ghul Under the pseudonym Ducard, Ra&apos;s trains Bruce in ninjutsu, a form of martial arts. Writer David Goyer said he felt Ra&apos;s was the most complex of all the Batman villains, comparing him to Osama bin Laden; &quot; He&apos;s not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He&apos;s not bent on revenge; he&apos;s actually trying to heal the world. He&apos;s just doing it by very draconian means. &quot; Christopher Nolan had discussions with his Memento collaborator Guy Pearce about playing the role, but both of them decided that the actor was too young for the part. http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1487 Neeson is commonly cast as a mentor, so the revelation that his character was the main villain was intended to shock viewers. The Journey Begins: Creative Concepts [DVD, 2005] Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane / The Scarecrow A psychopharmacologist who works at Arkham Asylum and has developed fear-inducing toxins. He takes on the persona of the Scarecrow to use during his experiments, in which he uses his patients as human guinea pig s for his toxins. He works with Ra&apos;s al Ghul and Carmine Falcone. Nolan decided against Irish actor Murphy for Batman, before casting him as Scarecrow. Murphy read numerous comics featuring the Scarecrow, and discussed making the character look less theatrical with Nolan. Murphy explained, &quot; I wanted to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look, because he&apos;s not a very physically imposing man – he&apos;s more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do. &quot; Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone The ruler of the Gotham City underworld. He had shared a prison cell with Joe Chill after Joe murdered Wayne&apos;s parents. He had Chill murdered when he decided to testify against Falcone. He goes into business with Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra&apos;s al Ghul by smuggling in Crane&apos;s fear toxins through his drug shipments over the course of several months so that they can be mixed in with the city&apos;s water supply. Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes Bruce&apos;s childhood friend who serves as Gotham City&apos;s assistant district attorney, fighting against the corruption in the city. Nolan found a &quot; tremendous warmth and great emotional appeal &quot; in Holmes, and also felt &quot; she has a maturity beyond her years that comes across in the film and is essential to the idea that Rachel is something of a moral conscience for Bruce &quot;. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rachel McAdams were in the running for the role. Emma Lockhart portrays the young Rachel Dawes. Gary Oldman as Sgt. James Gordon One of the few uncorrupted Gotham City police officers. He was the officer on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne&apos;s parents. In this way, he shares a special bond with the adult Bruce and thus with Batman. Nolan originally wanted to cast Oldman as a villain, but when Chris Cooper turned down the role of Gordon to spend time with his family he decided that it would be refreshing for Oldman to play the role instead. &quot; I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice, &quot; Oldman said of his character. Oldman filmed most of his scenes in Britain. Goyer said Oldman heavily resembled Gordon as drawn by David Mazzucchelli in Batman: Year One. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox A high-ranking Wayne Enterprises employee who was demoted to working in the company&apos;s Applied Science Division, where he conducts advanced studies in biochemistry and mechanical engineering. Fox supplies Bruce with much of the gear necessary to carry out Batman&apos;s mission and is promoted to CEO when Bruce repossesses the company by the end of the film. Freeman was Goyer&apos;s first and only choice for the role. Other cast members include Rutger Hauer as William Earle, the CEO of Wayne Enterprises who takes the company public in the long-term absence of Bruce Wayne; Mark Boone Junior as Gordon&apos;s corrupt partner Detective Arnold Flass; Ken Watanabe as Ra&apos;s al Ghul&apos;s decoy; Larry Holden as district attorney Carl Finch; Colin McFarlane as Police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb; Linus Roache and Sara Stewart as Thomas and Martha Wayne, Bruce&apos;s parents; Richard Brake as Joe Chill, the Waynes&apos; killer; Gerard Murphy as the corrupt High Court Judge Faden; Tim Booth as Victor Zsasz; Rade Šerbedžija as a homeless man, who is the last person to meet Bruce when he leaves Gotham, and the first civilian to see Batman, and Andrew Pleavin as a uniformed policeman. Actors John Foo, Joey Ansah, Spencer Wilding, Dave Legeno, Khan Bonfils, Rodney Ryan, Dean Alexandrou, James Embree, Emil Martirossian, Mark Strange and Chuen Tsou appear as members of the League of Shadows Warriors.

Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film, and that &quot; the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [It] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises. &quot; Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. [ Marc Graser Dunkley, Cathy http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117899714.html The bat and the beautiful Variety February 8, 2004 November 2, 2006 ] Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner &apos;s 1978 film Superman, in its focus on depicting the character&apos;s growth. Also similar to Superman, Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for Batman Begins to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story. Nolan&apos;s personal &quot; jumping off point &quot; of inspiration was &quot; Batman: The Man Who Falls &quot;, a short story by Denny O&apos;Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce&apos;s travels throughout the world. The early scene in Batman Begins of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from &quot; The Man Who Falls &quot;. [ DiDio, Dan (Vice President of DC Comics), Goyer, David S.

[ Stax http://comics.ign.com/articles/593/593571p1.html The Influences of Batman Begins IGN September 24, 2004 December 13, 2006 ] In addition, the film&apos;s Sergeant James Gordon was based on his comic book incarnation as seen in Year One. The writers of Batman Begins also used Frank Miller&apos;s Year One plot device, which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and Gotham City &apos;s need for Batman. A common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan explained that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman&apos;s first appearances – it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne&apos;s reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.

Filming began in March 2004 in the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland (standing in for Bhutan ). The crew built a village and the front doors to Ra&apos;s temple, as well as a road to access the remote area. The weather was problematic, with [ 75 mph ] winds, rain, and a lack of snow. A shot Wally Pfister had planned with a crane had to be done with a handheld camera. In seeking inspiration from Superman and other blockbuster films of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Nolan based most of the production in England, specifically Shepperton Studios. [ `Batman Begins&apos; goes to the source The Kansas City Star June 25, 2004 ] A Batcave set was built there and measured [ 250 ft ] long, [ 120 ft ] wide, and [ 40 ft ] high.

Mentmore Towers was chosen from twenty different locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, which gave the impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne&apos;s parents.

Despite the film&apos;s darkness, Nolan wanted to make the film appeal to a wide age range. &quot; Not the youngest kids obviously, I think what we&apos;ve done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn&apos;t want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I would have loved to have seen a movie like this. &quot; Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed. [ July 13, 2008 http://www.timeout.com/film/news/488/ &apos;Batman Begins&apos; press conference, part two Time Out London June 16, 2005 ] [ Design ] Nolan used the 1982 cult science fiction film Blade Runner as a source of inspiration for Batman Begins. He screened Blade Runner to cinematographer Wally Pfister and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film&apos;s world as &quot; an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn&apos;t appear to have any boundaries &quot;, a lesson that he applied to the production of Batman Begins. [ Pat Jankiewicz Dark Knight Resurrected Starlog August 2005 ] Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of Gotham City. Crowley built a model of the city that filled Nolan&apos;s garage. { Gotham City Rises [DVD, 2005] } Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the slum mish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong. [ Jeff Otto http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html Interview: Christopher Nolan IGN June 5, 2006 November 6, 2006 ] [ Batmobile ] [ Batmobile ] { Batmobile used in &apos;&apos;Batman Begins&apos;&apos; } { alt=A black vehicle sits on wooden planks in the center of a public square. } Crowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler&apos;s turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months. [ Marshall Brain http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/comic-books/batmobile.htm How the Batmobile Works HowStuffWorks April 23, 2010 ] The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel &quot; test frame &quot;, which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over [ 100 mph ], go from 0 to [ 60 mph ] in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to [ 30 ft m ]. On the first jump test, the Tumbler&apos;s front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 8.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by Hoosier (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), rear 4×4 mud tires by Interco and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars. alt=The rear of a vehicle, with two wheels on each side. With the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film&apos;s scenes. The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was over-sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:5 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence. [ Batsuit ] alt=A man in a batsuit, with a cowl on his head, a utility belt, and a cape flowing behind him. The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement. Costume design er Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed &quot; Cape Town &quot;, a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit&apos;s basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam&apos;s durability. [ http://www2.warnerbros.com/batmanbegins/productionnotes/ Batman BeginsProduction Notes – The Batsuit &amp; Gadgetry Warner Bros. November 6, 2006 ] [ March 2012 ] For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a &quot; flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels &quot;. Hemming&apos;s team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show &quot; a man who has angst &quot;, so his character would be revealed through the mask. [ Special effects ] For Batman Begins, Nolan preferred traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale model s were used to represent the Narrows and Ra&apos;s al Ghul&apos;s temple. { Journey to Discovery [DVD, 2005] } There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham&apos;s skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, and some of the exterior monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI. { Saving Gotham City [DVD, 2005] } The bats were entirely digital (except in shots containing only one or two bats), as it was decided directing larger amounts of real bats on set would be problematic. Dead bats were scanned to create digital models. Locations and sets were recreated on the computer so the flying bats would not be superfluous once incorporated into the finished film. [ Soundtrack ] [ Batman Begins (soundtrack) Batman Begins soundtrack ] The score for Batman Begins was composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the music, and Zimmer asked Nolan if he could invite Howard to compose as well, as they had always planned a collaboration. [ Graydon, Danny A Little Knight Music Empire July 2005 87 ] The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the &quot; split personality &quot; of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in Los Angeles and moved to London where they stayed for twelve weeks to complete most of their writing.

Hans Zimmer &amp; James Newton Howard Part 1 IGN June 10, 2005 December 1, 2006 ] Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by visiting the Batman Begins sets. [ D., Spence http://music.ign.com/articles/624/624641p1.html Batman Vs. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard Part 2 IGN June 13, 2005 December 1, 2006 ] Zimmer wanted to avoid writing music that had been done in earlier Batman films, so the score became an amalgamation of orchestra and electronic music. The film&apos;s ninety-piece orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of film&apos;s scenes where Bruce Wayne&apos;s parents tragic memories are involved. &quot; He&apos;s singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it&apos;s like froze, arrested development, &quot; said Zimmer. He also attempted to add human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as &quot; psychotic &quot;, through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film. Zimmer composed the action sequences, while Howard focused on the film&apos;s drama. [ Themes ] Comic book writer and author Danny Fingeroth argues that a strong theme in the film is Bruce&apos;s search for a father figure, saying &quot; [Alfred] is the good father that Bruce comes to depend on. Bruce&apos;s real father died before they could establish an adult relationship, and Liam Neeson &apos;s Ducard is stern and demanding, didactic and challenging, but not a father figure with any sympathy. If Bruce is anyone&apos;s son, it is Alfred&apos;s. [Morgan] Freeman&apos;s Lucius is cool and imperturbable, another steady anchor in Bruce&apos;s life. &quot; [ Fingeroth, Danny Batman Begins: Redefining the Dark Knight Animation World Network June 15, 2005 http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/ibatman-beginsi-redefining-dark-knight April 23, 2010 ] Blogger Mark Fisher states that Bruce&apos;s search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure, with Thomas Wayne and Ra&apos;s al Ghul being the two counterpoints. Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love, despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce&apos;s life. [ Fisher, Mark Gothic Oedipus: subjectivity and Capitalism in Christopher Nolan&apos;s Batman Begins Department of English at the University of Florida 2006 http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/fisher/#13 October 13, 2007 ] Fingeroth also argues that a major theme in the film is fear, which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was &quot; a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it &quot;. Fingeroth referred to this film&apos;s depiction as &quot; the man with fear—but who rises above it &quot;. The theme of fear is further personified by the choice of antagonist, the Scarecrow. The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce&apos;s conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow&apos;s toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.

It strays away from the lighter fare of } { Joel Schumacher &apos;s 1997 Batman film, } { Batman &amp; Robin, which contained } { camp one-liners throughout. The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard, which also &quot; eschews traditional heroic themes &quot;. Also contrary to previous Batman films, a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne&apos;s split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon. Orndorf noted that Bruce is a &quot; character constantly striving to do the right thing, not worn down by incessant reexamination &quot;. } [ Reception ] [ Critical response ] Batman Begins has received widespread critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 85% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 260 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10, making the film a &quot; Certified Fresh &quot; on the website&apos;s rating system.

[ http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-begins Batman Begins Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic Metacritic February 13, 2012 ] James Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer&apos;s work creating more understanding into &quot; who [Batman] is and what motivates him &quot;, something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton&apos;s film lacked; at the same time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder ( Superman ), or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst ( Spider-Man ) shared in their respective roles. [ Berardinelli, James http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman_begins.html Batman Begins ReelViews August 28, 2007 James Berardinelli ] According to Total Film, Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to &quot; the frisson of two people talking &quot;, and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale&apos;s romantic subplot has a spark &quot; refreshingly free of Peter Parker / Mary Jane -style whining &quot;. [ http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/batman-begins Batman Begins – Film Review Total Film April 23, 2010 ] Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan, who felt the film began slowly, stated that the &quot; story, psychology and reality, not special effects &quot;, assisted the darkness behind Batman&apos;s arsenal; he noted that Neeson and Holmes, unlike Bale&apos;s ability to &quot; feel his role in his bones &quot;, do not appear to fit their respective characters in &quot; being both comic-book archetypes and real people &quot;.

He was unimpressed with the film, when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films, and that Christian Bale&apos;s presence was hindered by the &quot; dull earnestness of the screenplay &quot;, the final climax was &quot; cheesy and unexciting &quot;, and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the &quot; fakery &quot; used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences.

When I did Batman twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies. You couldn&apos;t go into that dark side of comics yet.
