This colorless, volatile liquid with a moderately sweet aroma is widely used as a solvent. Although it is not miscible with water, it is miscible with many organic solvent s. { M. Rossberg et al. “Chlorinated Hydrocarbons” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. } [ 10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2 ] [ History ] DCM was first prepared in 1840 by the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault (1810–1878), who isolated it from a mixture of chloromethane and chlorine that had been exposed to sunlight. [ Production ] DCM is produced by treating either methyl chloride or methane with chlorine gas at 400 –500  °C. At these temperatures, both methane and methyl chloride undergo a series of reactions producing progressively more chlorinated products. CH 4 + Cl 2 → CH 3 Cl + HCl CH 3 Cl + Cl 2 → CH 2 Cl 2 + HCl CH 2 Cl 2 + Cl 2 → CHCl 3 + HCl CHCl 3 + Cl 2 → CCl 4 + HCl The output of these processes is a mixture of methyl chloride, dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. These compounds are separated by distillation. [ Uses ] DCM&apos;s volatility and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes it a useful solvent for many chemical processes. Concerns about its health effects have led to a search for alternatives in many of these applications. It is widely used as a paint stripper and a degreaser. In the food industry, it has been used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavoring s. [ Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment California Environmental Protection Agency September 2000 Public Health Goals for Chemicals in Drinking Water Dichloromethane http://www.oehha.ca.gov/water/phg/pdf/dcm.pdf ] Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foam s. [ Specialized uses ] The chemical compound&apos;s low boiling point allows the chemical to function as a heat engine that can extract movement from low grade temperatures. An example of a DCM heat engine is the drinking bird. The toy works at room temperature. DCM chemically welds certain plastics. For example, it is used to seal the casing of electric meters. Often sold as a main component of plastic welding adhesive s, it is also used extensively by model building hobbyists for joining plastic components together — it is commonly referred to as &quot; Di-clo. &quot; It is used in the garment printing industry for removal of heat-sealed garment transfers, and its volatility is exploited in novelty items — bubble light s and jukebox displays. DCM is used in the material testing field of civil engineering; specifically it is used during the testing of bituminous materials as a solvent to separate the binder from the aggregate of an asphalt or macadam to allow the testing of the materials.

In many countries, products containing DCM must carry labels warning of its health risks. In the European Union, the European Parliament voted in 2009 to ban the use of DCM in paint-strippers for consumers and many professionals.
