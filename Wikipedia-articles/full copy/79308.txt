General appearance varies from species to species, from black-and-white to brown or cream colored. Skunks, together with their closest living relatives, the stink badgers, belong to the &quot; skunk family &quot;, the &quot; Mephitidae &quot; [ Don E. Wilson &amp; DeeAnn M. Reeder 2005 Mammal Species of the World.

There are twelve species of Mephistids, which are divided into four genera : Mephitis, the ( hooded and striped skunk s, two species), Spilogale the ( spotted skunk s, four species), the Mydaus or stink badgers, two species), and Conepatus, the ( hog-nosed skunk s, four species). The two stink badgers in the Mydaus genus inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines; while all skunks inhabit the Americas from Canada to central South America. All other known Mephistids are extinct and known only through fossils, many in Eurasia [ December 2011 ]. Skunks had been classified as a subfamily within the Mustelidae, or &quot; weasel family &quot;, which includes ferret s, weasel s, otter s, badger s, stoat s, and wolverine s. However, recent genetic evidence suggests that skunks are not as closely related to the mustelids as previously thought; they are now classified in their own family. The stink badgers had until recently been classified on the basis of physical examination with the other badgers, but genetic testing has proven correct those who believed stink badgers to share a more recent common ancestor with skunks than they do with the weasel family, and so the stink badgers have been transferred from the badger family to the skunk family.

Skunk species vary in size from about [ 15.6 to 37 in cm ] and in weight from about [ 1.1 lb kg ] (spotted skunks) to [ 18 lb kg ] ( hog-nosed skunk s ). They have a moderately elongated body with relatively short, well-muscled legs, and long front claw s for digging. Although the most common fur color is black and white, some skunks are brown or grey, and a few are cream-colored. All skunks are striped, even from birth. They may have a single thick stripe across back and tail, two thinner stripes, or a series of white spots and broken stripes (in the case of the spotted skunk). Some also have stripes on their legs. { Skeleton on Display at } { The Museum of Osteology } [ Diet ] Skunks are omnivorous, eating both plant and animal material and changing their diet as the seasons change. They eat insect s and larva e, earthworm s and grubs, small rodent s, lizard s, salamander s, frog s, snake s, bird s, moles, and eggs. They also commonly eat berries, root s, leaves, grass es, fungi, and nuts. In settled areas, skunks also seek human garbage. Less often, skunks may be found acting as scavenger s, eating bird and rodent carcasses left by cat s or other animals. Pet owners, particularly those of cats, may experience a skunk finding its way into a garage or basement where pet food is kept. Skunks commonly dig holes in lawns in search of grubs and worms. Skunks are one of the primary predators of the honeybee, relying on their thick fur to protect them from stings. The skunk scratches at the front of the beehive and eats the guard bees that come out to investigate. Mother skunks are known to teach this to their young. [ Behavior ] Skunks are crepuscular and are solitary animals when not breeding, though in the colder parts of their range they may gather in communal dens for warmth. During the day, they shelter in burrows that they dig with their powerful front claws, or in other man-made or natural hollows as the opportunity arises. Both genders occupy overlapping home ranges through the greater part of the year; typically [ 2 to 4 km2 mi2 ] for females, up to [ 20 km2 mi2 ] for males. Skunks are not true hibernators in the winter, but do den up for extended periods of time. However, they remain generally inactive and feed rarely, going through a dormant stage. Overwinter multiple (as many as twelve) females huddle together. Males often den alone. The same winter den is often repeatedly used. Although they have excellent senses of smell and hearing – vital attributes in a crepuscular omnivore – they have poor vision. They cannot see, with any clarity, objects more than about [ 3 m ft 1 ] away, making them vulnerable to death by road traffic. They are short-lived animals: Fewer than 10% survive for longer than three years. { ADW: Mephitis mephitis: INFORMATION. Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu. Retrieved on 2012-04-05. } [ Reproduction ] A striped skunk kit Skunks typically mate in early spring and are a polygynous species, meaning that (successful) males usually mate with more than one female. Before giving birth (usually in May), the female will excavate a den to house her litter of four to seven kits. They are placental, with a gestation period of about 66 days. [ http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74118.html Skunks Management Guidelines UC Davis IPM ] When born, skunk kits are blind, deaf, and covered in a soft layer of fur. About three weeks after birth, their eyes open. The kits are weaned about two months after birth, but generally stay with their mother until they are ready to mate, at about one year of age. The mother is very protective of her kits and will often spray at any sign of danger. The male plays no part in raising the young and may even kill them. [ September 2008 ] [ Anal scent glands ] The most notorious feature of skunks is their anal scent glands, which they can use as a defensive weapon. They are similar to, though much more developed than, the glands found in species of the Mustelidae family. Skunks have two glands, one on each side of the anus. These glands produce a mixture of sulfur -containing chemicals such as methyl and butyl thiol s traditionally called mercaptans, which have a highly offensive smell that can be described as a combination of the odors of rotten eggs, garlic, and burnt rubber. The odor of the fluid is strong enough to ward off bears and other potential attackers and can be difficult to remove from clothing. Muscles located next to the scent glands allow them to spray with a high degree of accuracy, as far as [ 3 m 1 ]. { Skunks, Skunk Pictures, Skunk Facts – National Geographic. Animals.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-05. } The smell aside, the spray can cause irritation and even temporary blindness and is sufficiently powerful to be detected by a human nose up to a mile downwind. Their chemical defense, though unusual, is effective, as illustrated by this extract from Charles Darwin &apos;s Voyage of the Beagle : [ Darwin Charles Charles Darwin 1839 Voyage of the Beagle http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3704 June 27, 2006 0-14-043268-X Penguin London, England ] { Western Spotted Skunk also called a zorrillo, which means &apos;little fox&apos; in Spanish. } { Skunks } are reluctant to use this weapon, as they carry just enough of the chemical for five or six uses – about 15 cc – and require some ten days to produce another supply. [ October 2010 ] Their bold black and white coloring however serves to make the skunk&apos;s appearance memorable. Where practical, it is to a skunk&apos;s advantage simply to warn a threatening creature off without expending scent: black and white warning color aside, threatened skunks will go through an elaborate routine of hisses, foot stamping, and tail-high threat postures before resorting to the spray. Interestingly, skunks usually do not spray other skunks, with the exception of males in the mating season. Though they fight over den space in autumn, they do so with teeth and claws. The singular musk- spraying ability of the skunk has not escaped the attention of biologists. The names of the family and the most common genus (Mephitidae, Mephitis) mean &quot; stench, &quot; and Spilogale putorius means &quot; stinking spotted weasel. &quot; The word skunk is borrowed from the Abenaki name for them, segôgw. Most predator y animals of the Americas, such as wolves, fox es and badgers, seldom attack skunks – presumably out of fear of being sprayed. The exception is the great horned owl – the animal&apos;s only serious predator – which, like most birds, has a poor-to-nonexistent sense of smell. Skunks are common in suburban areas. Frequent encounters with dogs and other domestic animals, and the release of the odor when a skunk is run over, have led to many myths about the removal of the skunk odor. Due to the chemical composition of the skunk spray, most of these household remedies are ineffective, { Is it true that tomato sauce will get rid of the smell of a skunk?. Scienceline. Retrieved on 2012-04-05. } with the exception of a peroxide formula or other remedies that break down the thiols. Skunk spray is composed mainly of three low molecular weight thiol compounds, (E)-2-butene-1-thiol, 3-methyl-1-butanethiol, and 2-quinolinemethanethiol, as well as acetate thioesters of these.

When a skunk is kept as a pet, its scent gland is surgically removed. Typical life spans for domesticated skunks are longer than wild skunks. Domesticated skunks can legally be kept as pet s in the UK. However, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 [ http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/pdf/ukpga_20060045_en.pdf December 5, 2009 PDF Animal Welfare Act 2006 ] has made it illegal to remove their scent glands (it is considered to be a cosmetic operation), thus making them impractical as pets.
