He was the youngest of five siblings born to Norwegian immigrants, Peter and Emma Ness. Ness attended Christian Fenger High School in Chicago. He was educated at the University of Chicago, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, graduating in 1925 with a degree in economics. He began his career as an investigator for the Retail Credit Company of Atlanta. He was assigned to the Chicago territory, where he conducted background investigations for the purpose of credit information. He returned to the University to take a course in criminology, eventually earning a Master&apos;s Degree in the field. { &apos;&apos;Eliot Ness: The Real Story&apos;&apos; (Paul W. Heimel, author. Knox Books) } { &apos;&apos;Eliot Ness&apos;&apos;(Ohio Historical Society) } [ Career ] [ 1927–1931 ] In 1926, Ness&apos; brother-in-law, Alexander Jamie, an agent of the Bureau of Investigation (which later became the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935), influenced Ness to enter law enforcement. He joined the U.S. Treasury Department in 1927, working with the 300-strong Bureau of Prohibition, in Chicago. { &apos;&apos;Biography of Eliot Ness&apos;&apos; (Essortment) } Following the election of President Herbert Hoover, U.S. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon was specifically charged with bringing down gangster Al Capone. The federal government approached the problem from two directions: income tax evasion and the Volstead Act. Ness was chosen to head the operations under the Volstead Act, targeting the illegal breweries and supply routes of Capone. With Chicago&apos;s corrupted law-enforcement agents endemic, Ness went through the records of all Prohibition agents to create a reliable team, initially of 50, later reduced to 15 and finally to just eleven men called, &quot; The Untouchables &quot;. Raids against illegal stills and breweries began immediately; within six months Ness claimed to have seized breweries worth over one million dollars. The main source of information for the raids was an extensive wire-tapping operation. An attempt by Capone to bribe Ness&apos; agents was seized on by Ness for publicity, leading to the media nickname, &quot; The Untouchables. &quot; There were a number of assassination attempts on Ness, and one close friend of his was killed. The efforts of Ness and his team had a serious impact on Capone&apos;s operations; the main task of the Untouchables was to deprive Capone of the income sources for the graft payments that were his greatest protection, with an ancillary concern being the maintenance of public awareness of the federal government&apos;s activity against Capone. [ April 2012 ] However, Ness had very little to do with the IRS prosecuting Capone for income tax evasion, which led to Capone&apos;s downfall. [ Okrent Daniel Last Call : The rise and fall of prohibition 2010 Scribner New York 978-0-7432-7704-4 136 &amp; 345 ] In a number of federal grand jury cases in 1931, Capone was charged with 22 counts of tax evasion and also 5,000 violations of the Volstead Act. { &apos;&apos;Searching for Eliot Ness&apos;&apos; (Fedora Chronicles) } On October 17, 1931, Capone was sentenced to 11 years in prison, and following a failed appeal, he began his sentence in 1932. { &apos;&apos;Eliot Ness Biography&apos;&apos; (Who2, LLC) } { &apos;&apos;Eliot Ness 1902-1957&apos;&apos; The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.gov web site) } [ 1931–1957 ] { Lake View Cemetery } Ness was promoted to Chief Investigator of the Prohibition Bureau for Chicago and in 1934 for Ohio. Following the end of Prohibition in 1933, he was assigned as an alcohol tax agent in the &quot; Moonshine Mountains &quot; of southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee; and, in 1934, he was transferred to Cleveland, Ohio. In December 1935, Cleveland mayor Harold Burton hired him as the city&apos;s Safety Director, which put him in charge of both the police and fire departments. He headed a campaign to clean out police corruption and to modernize the fire department. { &apos;&apos;Eliot Ness: The Man Behind the Myth,&apos;&apos; Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. } Billboard for Eliot Ness&apos; 1947 campaign for mayor, seen in 1973 In 1938 Ness&apos;s personal life was completely transformed while his career began to have some ups and downs. He concentrated heavily on his work, which may have contributed to the divorce that year from his first wife Edna (Staley). He declared war on the mob, and his primary targets included &quot; Big &quot; Angelo Lonardo, &quot; Little &quot; Angelo Scirrca, Moe Dalitz, John Angerola, George Angersola, and Charles Pollizi. Ness was also Safety Director at the time of several grisly murders that occurred in the Cleveland area from 1935 to 1938. Unfortunately, what was otherwise a remarkably successful career in Cleveland, withered gradually. Cleveland critics targeted his divorce, his high-profile social drinking, and his conduct in a car accident, but he continued with the next Mayor, Frank Lausche. { Eliot Ness Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. } Ness remarried in 1939, to illustrator Evaline Ness. The Nesses moved to Washington, D.C. in 1942 where he worked for the federal government, directing the battle against prostitution in communities surrounding military bases, where venereal disease was a serious problem. Later he made a number of forays into the corporate world, all of which failed from his lack of business acumen. In 1944, he left to become chairman of the Diebold Corporation, a security safe company based in Ohio. After his second divorce and third marriage, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Cleveland in 1947, after which he was expelled from Diebold. In the aftermath, Ness began drinking more heavily and spending his free time in bars telling (often exaggerated) stories of his law enforcement career. He also spent himself into debt. Ness was forced into taking various odd jobs to earn a living, including as an electronics parts wholesaler, a clerk in a bookstore, and selling frozen hamburger patties to restaurants. By 1953, he came to work for an upstart company called Guaranty Paper Corporation, which specialized in watermarking legal and official documents to prevent counterfeiting. Ness was offered a job because of his expertise in law enforcement. The company soon moved from Cleveland to the quiet rural town of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, where operating costs were lower. He made a decent income from GPC and moved with his wife and adopted son into a modest rental house. Once again, he enjoyed going to local bars and regaling amazed audiences with his tales of crime fighting. He collapsed and died at his home of a massive heart attack on May 16, 1957, at the age of 54. Collaborating with Oscar Fraley in his last years, he co-wrote the book The Untouchables, which was published a month after his death. { &apos;&apos;Whatever happened to Eliot Ness after the trial of Al Capone?&apos;&apos; (Ask Yahoo!) } [ Personal life ] Ness was married to Edna Staley (1900–1988) from 1929 to 1938, illustrator Evaline Ness (1911–1986) from 1939 to 1945, and artist Elisabeth Andersen Seaver (1906–1977) from 1946 until his death. He also had an adopted son Robert (1946–1976). Ness&apos; ashes were scattered in one of the small ponds on the grounds of Lake View Cemetery, in Cleveland. { findagrave } { Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols &amp; Stories. Cleveland, OH: Gray &amp; Company, Publishers. ISBN 978-1-59851-025-6 } [ Legacy ] A number of television programs and feature film s have been made (loosely) based on his life. Some of the best-known of these include the 1950s/1960s TV series titled The Untouchables, which starred Robert Stack as Ness and which Walter Winchell narrated, and Brian De Palma &apos;s Oscar-winning film of the same title, The Untouchables, which starred Kevin Costner as Ness and also featured Sean Connery and Robert De Niro. Tom Amandes portrayed Ness in the short-lived TV remake of The Untouchables, which ran from 1993–94. { DePalma film: &apos;&apos;The Untouchables&apos;&apos; } Ness is also the subject of a series of novels based on actual events during his tenure as Safety Director in Cleveland, and a stage play, Eliot Ness: An Untouchable Life, by Max Allan Collins { Bruner, Jeffrey (August 14, 2005). &quot; Max Collins revives Eliot Ness. &quot; Des Moines Register. }.Ness is also a central character in Cosa Nosferatu, a fantasy novel that imagines Eliot Ness and Al Capone entangled with Randolph Carter and elements of the H.P. Lovecraft mythos.In The Proposal (film) (2009), US immigration officer Mr Gilbertson ( Denis O&apos;Hare ) likens himself to Ness saying &quot; I always get my man &quot; after managing to deport Sandra Bullock &apos;s character from the country.
