Waldheim was the fourth Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981, and the ninth President of Austria, from 1986 to 1992. While running for President in Austria in 1985, his service as an intelligence officer in the Wehrmacht during World War II raised international controversy. [ Early life ] Waldheim was born in Sankt Andrä-Wördern, a village near Vienna, on 21 December 1918. { Former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim dies at 88 - Haaretz - Israel News } His father was a Roman Catholic school inspector of Czech origin named Watzlawick { Kurt Waldheim, } { The Daily Telegraph, 15 June 2007. } (original Czech spelling Václavík) who changed his name that year as the Habsburg monarchy collapsed. Waldheim served in the Austrian Army (1936–37) and attended the Vienna Consular Academy, where he graduated in 1939. Waldheim&apos;s father was active in the Christian Social Party. Waldheim himself was politically unaffiliated during these years at the Academy. Shortly after the German annexation of Austria in 1938, a 20-year old Waldheim applied for membership in the National Socialist German Students&apos; League (NSDStB), a division of the Nazi Party. { Report of the International Historical Commission of 8 February 1988, section on &quot; Membership in National Socialist Organizations &quot;, as cited for example in http://nationalsozialismus.at/Themen/Umgang/waldheim.htm } Shortly thereafter he became a registered member of the mounted corps of the SA. On August 19, 1944, he married Elisabeth Ritschel in Vienna; their first daughter Lieselotte was born the following year. Son Gerhard and daughter Christa followed. [ Military service in World War II ] [ Overview ] In early 1941 Waldheim was drafted into the Wehrmacht and sent to the Eastern Front where he served as a squad leader. In December 1941 he was wounded but later returned to service. His further service in the Wehrmacht from 1942 to 1945 was subject of the international dispute in 1985 and 1986. In 1985, in his autobiography, he stated that he was discharged from further service at the front and for the rest of the war years finished his law degree at the University of Vienna in addition to marrying in 1944. [ Kurt Waldheim: Austrian head of the UN who as president of his country was later tainted by charges of complicity in Nazi atrocities http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1934744.ece The Times News Corporation London 15 June 2007 13 October 2008 ] Documents and witnesses which have since come to light reveal that Waldheim’s military service continued until 1945, and that he rose to the rank of oberleutnant, and confirmed that he married in 1944 and graduated with a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1945. [ Service in Yugoslavia and Greece ] His functions within the staff of German Army Group E from 1942 until 1945, as determined by the International Commission of Historians, { see page 39 of The Waldheim Report. Submitted 8 February 1988 to Federal Chancellor Dr. Franz Vranitzky } were: [ November 2011 ] Interpreter and liaison officer with the 5th Alpine Division (Italy) in April/May 1942, then, O2 officer (communications) with Kampfgruppe West in Bosnia in June/August 1942, Interpreter with the liaison staff attached to the Italian 9th Army in Tirana in early summer 1942, O1 officer in the German liaison staff with the Italian 11th Army and in the staff of the Army Group South in Greece in July/October 1943 and O3 officer on the staff of Army Group E in Arksali, Kosovska Mitrovica and Sarajevo from October 1943 to January/February 1945. By 1943 he was serving in the capacity of an ordnance officer in Army Group E which was headed by General Alexander Löhr. { Walther-Peer Fellgiebel (2000), Die Träger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939-1945. Podzun-Pallas. ISBN 3-7909-0284-5 } In 1986, Waldheim said that he had served only as an interpreter and a clerk and had no knowledge either of reprisals against Serb civilians locally or of massacres in neighboring provinces of Yugoslavia. He said that he had known about some of the things that had happened, and had been horrified, but could not see what else he could have done. Much historical interest has centered on Waldheim&apos;s role in Operation Kozara in 1942. [ The New York Times 15 June 2007 Kurt Waldheim http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/world/europe/15waldheim.html?pagewanted%3D2%26amp%3B_r%3D1 &quot; Waldheim took part in, and was decorated for, Operation Kozara, a large-scale antipartisan operation involving mass reprisals – at the rate of 100 executions for every German killed – and mass deportations of Serb women and children to concentration camps. &quot; Jonathan Kandell 7 May 2010 ] According to one post-war investigator, prisoners were routinely shot within only a few hundred yards of Waldheim&apos;s office, [ Kurt Waldheim: man of mystery. Spokesman Magazine 1 May 2005 Casey, Dennis http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QUY/is_2005_May/ai_n15387360/pg_2/?tag%3Dcontent%3Bcol1 ] and just 35  km away at the Jasenovac concentration camp. Waldheim later stated &quot; that he did not know about the murder of civilians there. &quot; Waldheim&apos;s name appears on the Wehrmacht s &quot; honor list &quot; of those responsible for the militarily successful operation. The Independent State of Croatia awarded Waldheim the Medal of the Crown of King Zvonimir in silver with an oak branches cluster. { Letter from Europe: Vienna, 20 June: The New Yorker } Later, during the lobbying for his election as U.N. Secretary General, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito awarded Waldheim one of the highest Yugoslav orders. [ Wir Österreicher wählen, wen wir wollen German Der Spiegel 14 April 1986 http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13517709.html Staatschef Tito überreichte Waldheim trotzdem einen der höchsten jugoslawischen Orden [Anyhow, Tito awarded Waldheim with one of the highest Yugoslav orders]. ] Waldheim denied that he knew war crimes were taking place in Bosnia at the height of the battles between the Nazis and Tito&apos;s partisans in 1943. [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1554545/Kurt-Waldheim.html The Daily Telegraph London Kurt Waldheim 15 June 2007 7 May 2010 ] According to Eli Rosenbaum, in 1944, Waldheim reviewed and approved a packet of anti-Semitic propaganda leaflets to be dropped behind Soviet lines, one of which ended, &quot; enough of the Jewish war, kill the Jews, come over. &quot; { Rosenbaum, EM with Hoffer W, Betrayal: The Untold Story of the Kurt Waldheim Investigation and Cover-Up St. Martin&apos;s Press, 1993, ISBN 0-312-08219-3, p. 338 } [ Surrender ] In 1945, Waldheim surrendered to British forces in Carinthia, at which point he said he had fled his command post within Army Group E, where he was serving with General Löhr, who was seeking a special deal with the British. [ Diplomatic career ] Waldheim joined the Austrian diplomatic service in 1945, after finishing his studies in law at the University of Vienna. He served as First Secretary of the Legation in Paris from 1948, and in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Vienna from 1951 to 1956. In 1956 he was made Ambassador to Canada, returning to the Ministry in 1960, after which he became the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations in 1964. For two years beginning in 1968, he was the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs in Austria serving for the Austrian People&apos;s Party, before going back as Permanent Representative to the U.N. in 1970. Shortly afterwards, he ran and was defeated in the 1971 Austrian presidential elections. [ United Nations Secretary-General ] After being defeated in his home country&apos;s presidential election, he was elected to succeed U Thant as United Nations Secretary-General the same year. As Secretary-General, Waldheim opened and addressed a number of major international conferences convened under United Nations auspices. These included the third session of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (Santiago, April 1972), the U.N. Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, June 1972), the third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea (Caracas, June 1974), the World Population Conference (Bucharest, August 1974) and the World Food Conference (Rome, November 1974). However, his diplomatic efforts particularly in the Middle East were overshadowed by the diplomacy of then US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. { BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Obituary: Kurt Waldheim } On September 11, 1972, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin sent a telegram to Waldheim, copies of which went to Yasser Arafat and Golda Meir. In the telegram, Amin &quot; applauded the massacre of the Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich and said Germany was the most appropriate locale for this because it was where Hitler burned more than six million Jews. &quot; { Israeli-Ugandan Relations in the Time of Idi Amin by Arye Oded, Jewish Political Studies Review 18:3-4 (Fall 2006) } Amin also called &quot; to expel Israel from the United Nations and to send all the Israelis to Britain, which bore the guilt for creating the Jewish state. &quot; { http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=5 &amp; DBID=1 &amp; LNGID=1 &amp; TMID=111 &amp; FID=625 &amp; PID=1631 &amp; IID=1643 &amp; TTL=Israeli-Ugandan_Relations_in_the_Time_of_Idi_Amin } Among international protest &quot; the UN spokesman said [in his daily press conference] it was not the secretary-general&apos;s practice to comment on telegrams sent him by heads of government. He added that the secretary-general condemned any form of racial discrimination and genocide. &quot; Waldheim was re-elected in 1976 despite some opposition. Waldheim and then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter both prepared written statements for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Record s, now in deep space. { Voyager - Spacecraft - Golden Record } He was the first Secretary-General to visit North Korea, in 1979. { &quot; Discipline and Devotion &quot;, TIME, 28 May 1979 article. Accessed 1 December 2008. } In 1980, Waldheim flew to Iran in an attempt to negotiate the release of the American hostages held in Tehran, but Ayatollah Khomeini refused to see him. While in Tehran, it was announced that an attempt on Waldheim&apos;s life had been foiled. Near the end of his tenure as Secretary-General, Waldheim and Paul McCartney also organized a series of concerts for the People of Kampuchea to help Cambodia recover from the damage done by Pol Pot. { CBC.ca - Arts - Music - Charity Begins } The People&apos;s Republic of China vetoed Waldheim&apos;s candidature for a third term, and he was succeeded by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar of Peru. [ Presidency of Austria ] [ Election and Waldheim Affair ] Waldheim had unsuccessfully sought election as President of Austria in 1971, but his second attempt on 8 June 1986 proved successful. During his campaign for the presidency in 1985, the events started that marked the beginning of what became known internationally as the &quot; Waldheim Affair &quot;. Before the presidential elections, investigative journalist Alfred Worm revealed in the Austrian weekly news magazine Profil that there had been several omissions about Waldheim&apos;s life between 1938 and 1945 in his recently-published autobiography. A short time later, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Waldheim had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the SA, and his time as an ordinance officer for Army Group E in Saloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943 based in files from the United Nations War Crimes Commission. { See Section &quot; Military Service &quot; above } [ Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution 753 Richard S. Levy ABC-CLIO 2005 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DTdn6FFZklkcC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA753 ] Waldheim called the allegations &quot; pure lies and malicious acts &quot;. [ Michael S.

I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed. &quot; He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had &quot; remained confined to a desk &quot;. Former Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, of Jewish origin, denounced the actions of the World Jewish Congress as an &quot; extraordinary infamy &quot; adding that Austrians would not &quot; allow the Jews abroad to... tell us who should be our President. &quot; Part of the reason for the controversy was Austria&apos;s refusal to address its national role in the Holocaust (many including Adolf Hitler were Austrians and Austria became part of the Third Reich ). Austria refused to pay compensation to Nazi victims and from 1970 onwards refused to investigate Austrian citizens who were senior Nazis. { Efraim Zuroff, &quot; Worldwide Investigation and Prosecution of Nazi War Criminals, 2001–2002, &quot; Simon Wiesenthal Center, Jerusalem (April 2002). } Stolen Jewish art remained public property until well after the Waldheim affair. { http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,545392,00.html } Because the revelations leading to the Waldheim affair came shortly before the presidential election, there has been speculation about the background of the affair. Declassified CIA documents show that the CIA had been aware of his wartime past since 1945. { Historical Analysis of 20 Name Files from CIA Records http://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-263-cia-records/rg-263-report.html } Information about Waldheim&apos;s wartime past was also previously published by a pro-German Austrian newspaper, Salzburger Volksblatt, during the 1971 presidential election campaign, including the claim of an SS membership, but the matter was supposedly regarded as unimportant or even advantageous for the candidate at that time. { WSWS obituary } It has been asserted that his wartime past and the discrepancies in his biography, In the Eye of the Storm, must have been well-known to both superpowers before he was elected UN Secretary General, and there were rumours that the KGB had blackmailed him during his UN time. [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kurt-waldheim-453186.html The Independent London Kurt Waldheim 15 June 2007 7 May 2010 ] In 1994, self-proclaimed former Mossad officer Victor Ostrovsky claimed in his book The Other Side of Deception that Mossad doctored the file of the then UN Secretary General to implicate him in Nazi crimes. These allegedly false documents were subsequently &quot; discovered &quot; by Benjamin Netanyahu in the UN file and triggered the &quot; Waldheim Affair &quot;. Ostrovsky says it was motivated by Waldheim&apos;s criticism of Israel&apos;s war in Lebanon. [ The Other Side of Deception: A Rogue Agent Exposes the Mossad&apos;s Secret Agenda Victor Ostrovsky HarperCollins (New York) 1994 ] Controversy surrounds Ostrovsky and his writings and some of his claims are disputed.

Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement in those crimes. Although Waldheim had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the committee cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes. { Simon Wiesenthal &quot; The Waldheim Case &quot; in Contemporary Jewish Writing in Austria edited by Dagmar Lorenz. pp 81-95, University of Nebraska press } In an account of the controversy, Simon Wiesenthal stated that Waldheim was stationed [ 5 mi km ] from Salonika while, over the course of several weeks, the Jewish community which formed one third of the population there, was sent to Auschwitz. Waldheim denied any knowledge of this: I could only reply what the committee of historians likewise made clear in its report: &quot; I cannot believe you. &quot; { Simon Wiesenthal &quot; The Waldheim Case &quot; in Contemporary Jewish Writing in Austria edited by Dagmar Lorenz. page 91, University of Nebraska Press } Wiesenthal stated the committee found no evidence that Waldheim took part in any war crimes but was guilty of lying about his military record. { Kurt Waldheim | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited } The International Committee in February 1988 concluded with that he could not stop what was going on in Yugoslavia and Greece even if he knew: In favour of Waldheim is, that he only had very minor possibilities to act against the injustices happening. Actions against these, depending on which level the resistance occurred, were of very different importance. For a young member of the staff, who did not have any military authority on the army group level, the practical possibilities for resistance were very limited and with a high probability would not have led to any actual results. Resistance would have been limited to a formal protest or on the refusal to serve any longer in the army, which would have seemed to be a courageous act, however would have not led to any practical achievement. { James L. Collins Jr. u.a.: Bericht der internationalen Historikerkommission, Schlussbetrachtung, 8. Februar 1988. (translated from German) } [ Foreign visits ] Throughout his term as President (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed personae non gratae by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the Vatican City.

[ Later years and death ] After his term ended in 1992, Waldheim did not seek re-election. The same year, he was made an honorary member of K.H.V. Welfia Klosterneuburg, a Roman Catholic student fraternity a part of the Austrian &apos;&apos;Cartellverband&apos;&apos;. In 1994, Pope John Paul II awarded Waldheim a knighthood in the Order of Pius IX and his wife a papal honor.

On June 23, his funeral was held at St. Stephen&apos;s Cathedral, Vienna, and he was buried at the Presidential Vault in the Zentralfriedhof ( &quot; central cemetery &quot; ). { &quot; Former Austrian president whose term was marred by wartime service buried &quot;, Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 23 June 2007. } In his speech at the Cathedral, Federal President Heinz Fischer called Waldheim &quot; a great Austrian &quot; who had been wrongfully accused of having committed war crimes. Fischer also praised Waldheim for his efforts to solve international crises and for his contributions to world peace. { http://www.hofburg.at/show_content2.php?s2id=855 Speech of President Heinz Fischer (official text) } At Waldheim&apos;s own request, no foreign heads of states or governments were invited to attend his funeral except Hans-Adam II, the Prince of Liechtenstein. Also present was Luis Durnwalder, governor of the Italian province of South Tyrol. Syria and Japan were the only two countries that laid a wreath. In a two-page letter, published posthumously by the Austrian Press Agency the day after he died, Waldheim admitted making &quot; mistakes &quot; ( &quot; but these were certainly not those of a follower let alone an accomplice of a criminal regime &quot; ) and asked his critics for forgiveness. { http://activepaper.tele.net/vntipps/WaldheimVermaechtnis.pdf } [ Media references ] W.
