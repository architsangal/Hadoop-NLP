With a total landmass of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 sq mi), it is bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. With a population of over 14.8  million, Cambodia is the 68th most populous country in the world. The official religion is Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced by around 95% of the Cambodian population. The country minority groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Cham s and 30 various hill tribes. { Cambodia to celebrate day for indigenous people near Angkor Wat } The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh; the political, economic, and cultural center of Cambodia. The kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with Norodom Sihamoni, a monarch chosen by the Royal Throne Council, as head of state. The head of government is Hun Sen, who is currently the longest serving leader in South East Asia and has ruled Cambodia for over 25 years. In 802 AD Jayavarman II declared himself king which marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire. Successive kings flourished which marked the Khmer empire&apos;s immense power and wealth who dominate much of Southeast Asia for over 600 years. Cambodia was ruled as a vassal between its neighbors, until it was colonized by the French in mid-19th century. Cambodia gained independence in 1953. The Vietnam War extended into Cambodia, giving rise to the Khmer Rouge, which took Phnom Penh in 1975. Cambodia reemerged several years later within a socialistic sphere of influence as the People&apos;s Republic of Kampuchea until 1993. After years of isolation, the war-ravaged nation was reunited under the monarchy in 1993. Rebuilding from decades of civil war, Cambodia has seen rapid progress in the economic and human resource areas. The country has had one of the best economic records in Asia, with economic growth growing an average 6.0% for the last 10 years. Strong textiles, agriculture, construction, garments, and tourism sectors led to foreign investments and international trade. { Cambodia to outgrow LDC status by 2020 | Business | The Phnom Penh Post – Cambodia&apos;s Newspaper of Record.

In Cambodia, some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Angkorian temples, like Baksei Chamkrong. Others were circular earthworks, like Lovea, a few kilometers north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened) and the existence of a social structure and labor organization.

The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia&apos;s largest empire during the 12th century and it remained very powerful. The empire declined yet remained powerful in the region until the 15th century. The empire&apos;s centre of power was Angkor, where a series of capitals was constructed during the empire&apos;s zenith. In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 1,150 square miles.

[ Dark ages of Cambodia ] [ Dark ages of Cambodia ] { Longvek } After a long series of wars with neighboring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown. { Chandler, David P. &quot; The Land and the People of Cambodia &quot;. 1991. HarperCollins. New York, New York. p 77 } { Scientists dig and fly over Angkor in search of answers to golden city&apos;s fall, The Associated Press, June 13, 2004 } This led to a period of economic, social, and cultural stagnation when the kingdom&apos;s internal affairs came increasingly under the control of its neighbors. By this time, the Khmer penchant for monument building had ceased. Older faiths such as Mahayana Buddhism and the Hindu cult of the god-king had been supplanted by Theravada Buddhism for good. The court moved the capital to Longvek where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade. Portuguese and Spanish travelers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and foreign trade. The attempt was short-lived however, as continued wars with the Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese resulted in the loss of more territory and Longvek being conquered in 1594. Not long after the conquer of Siamese, the wall of Longvek broke within three days after the order of King Naresuan the Great of Ayutthaya Kingdom. Shortly after, with the capturing of Longvek by the Siamese, the nation never fully recovered and was under colonization of Siam for long periods of time. During the next three centuries, the Khmer kingdom alternated as a vassal state of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Vietnamese kings, as well as short-lived periods of relative independence. A new Khmer capital was established at Udong south of Longvek, but its monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to vassal relationships with the Siamese and Vietnamese. A renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam for control of Cambodia in the nineteenth century resulted in a period when Vietnamese officials attempted to force the Khmers to adopt Vietnamese customs. This led to several rebellions against the Vietnamese. The Siamese–Vietnamese War (1841–1845) ended with an agreement to place the country under joint suzerainty. This later led to the signing of a treaty for French Protection of Cambodia by King Norodom I. [ French colonization ] Map of French Indochina In 1863 King Norodom, who had been installed by Thailand, [ Chandler D.P. David P. Chandler A history of Cambodia (2nd ed.) Westview Press 1993 Boulder, Colorado ] sought the protection of France from the Thai and Vietnamese after tensions grew between them. In 1867 the Thai king signed a treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Thailand. The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Thailand in 1906. Cambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1863 to 1953, administered as part of the colony of French Indochina, though occupied by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945. Between 1874 and 1962, the total population increased from about 946,000 to 5.7  million. { &quot; Cambodia – Population &quot;. } { Library of Congress Country Studies. } After King Norodom&apos;s death in 1904, France manipulated the choice of king, and Sisowath, Norodom&apos;s brother, was placed on the throne. The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong, Sisowath&apos;s son, and France passed over Monivong&apos;s son, Monireth, feeling he was too independently minded. Instead, Norodom Sihanouk, a maternal grand-son of king Sisowath was enthroned. The French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to control. [ Kamm Henry Henry Kamm Cambodia: report from a stricken land http://books.google.com/?id%3DwtBkD5CoIMkC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3DCambodia%2BReport%2Bfrom%2Ba%2BStricken%2BLand#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D Arcade Publishing 1998 New York 27 1-55970-433-0 ] They were wrong, however, and under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia gained independence from France on November 9, 1953. [ Independence and Vietnam War ] Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk. When French Indochina was given independence, Cambodia lost official control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to Vietnam. [ February 2011 ] The area had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698 with King Chey Chettha II granting Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before. [ Kamm Henry Henry Kamm Cambodia Report from a Stricken Land Arcade Publishing 1998 New York 23 1-55970-507-8 ] In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father in order to participate in politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father&apos;s death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War, although he was widely considered to be sympathetic to the communist cause. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed. { Washington Post, December 29, 1967 } The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson&apos;s emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968. { Stephen J. Morris &quot; Why Vietnam Invaded Cambodia. &quot;. (Stanford University Press. 1999). p. 44 } So the US had no real motivation to overthrow Sihanouk. However members of the government and army, who resented Sihanouk&apos;s ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States, did have such a motivation. While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. There is no evidence of any US role in the coup. However once the coup was completed the new regime, which immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia, gained the political support of the United States. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil war, [ Sihanouk Norodom Norodom Sihanouk My War with the CIA, The Memoirs of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as related to Wilfred Burchett Pantheon Books 1973 0-394-48543-2 ] Soon the Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. However from 1970 until early 1972 the Cambodian conflict was largely one between the government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As they gained control of Cambodian territory the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists we now refer to as the Khmer Rouge. { Stephen J. Morris &quot; Why Vietnam Invaded Cambodia. (Stanford University Press. 1999). pp. 48–51 } So the Vietnamese communists played a vital role in the rise of the Khmer Rouge. { Norodom Sihanouk and } { Mao Tse-Tung in 1956 } Between 1969 and 1973, Republic of Vietnam forces and U.S. forces bombed and briefly invaded Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge. [ Shawcross William William Shawcross Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the destruction of Cambodia Touchstone 1987 United States 0-7012-0944-5 ] Some two million Cambodians were made refugee s by the war and by the terrorist policies of the Khmer Rouge, and fled to Phnom Penh. Estimates of the number of Cambodians killed during the bombing campaigns vary widely, as do views of the effects of the bombing. The U.S. Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city. { Shawcross, Sideshow p. 298. } However, journalist William Shawcross and Cambodia specialists Milton Osborne, David P. Chandler and Ben Kiernan argued that the bombing drove peasants to join the Khmer Rouge. { e.g. Chandler, David P. Pacific Affairs, vol. 56, no. 2, Summer 1983, p. 295. } Cambodia specialist Craig Etcheson argued that the Khmer Rouge &quot; would have won anyway &quot;, even without U.S. intervention driving recruitment. { Etcheson, Craig, The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea, Westview Press, 1984, p. 97 } American diplomat Timothy M. Carney argued that the five reasons why Pol Pot won the war were: support from Sihanouk, massive supplies of military aid from North Vietnam, government corruption, the U.S. cut-off in air support after Watergate, and the determination of the Cambodian Communists. Not one of them in his opinion was the U.S. bombing. { http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/461/8/09_chapter3.pdf } [ Khmer Rouge regime ] [ Democratic Kampuchea Khmer Rouge ] As the Vietnam War ended, a draft USAID report observed that the country faced famine in 1975, with 75% of its draft animals destroyed, and that rice planting for the next harvest would have to be done &quot; by the hard labour of seriously malnourished people &quot;. The report predicted that &quot; Without large-scale external food and equipment assistance there will be widespread starvation between now and next February  ... Slave labour and starvation rations for half the nation&apos;s people (probably heaviest among those who supported the republic) will be a cruel necessity for this year, and general deprivation and suffering will stretch over the next two or three years before Cambodia can get back to rice self-sufficiency &quot;. { Shawcross, Sideshow pp. 374–375. } { Khmer Rouge and } { Democratic Kampuchea } The Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975. The regime, led by Pol Pot, changed the official name of the country to Democratic Kampuchea. The regime modelled itself on Maoist China during the Great Leap Forward. The regime immediately evacuated the cities and sent the entire population on forced marches to rural work projects. They attempted to rebuild the country&apos;s agriculture on the model of the 11th century, discarded Western medicine, and destroyed temples, libraries, and anything considered Western. At least a million Cambodians, out of a total population of 8 million, died from executions, overwork, starvation and disease. Estimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime range from approximately one to three million; the most commonly cited figure is two million (about one-third of the population). { Shawcross, William, The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience, Touchstone, 1985, pp. 115–116. } { Vickery, Michael, Correspondence, Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, vol. 20, no. 1, January–March 1988, p. 73. } This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields, and the prison Tuol Sleng became notorious for its history of mass killing. Hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as half of their population exterminated. { The Cambodian Genocide and International Law, By Dr. Gregory H. Stanton, Presented February 22, 1992 at Yale Law School } In the late 1960s, an estimated 425,000 ethnic Chinese lived in Cambodia, but by 1984, due to Khmer Rouge killings and to emigration, only about 61,400 Chinese remained in the country. { Cambodia the Chinese. } { Library of Congress Country Studies. } Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984. However most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer. Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, were also targeted. According to Robert D. Kaplan, &quot; eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star &quot; as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism. { Kaplan, Robert D., The Ends of the Earth, Vintage, 1996, p. 406. } [ Vietnamese occupation and transition ] [ Modern Cambodia ] { Choeung Ek } In November 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in response to border raids by the Khmer Rouge. { CambodianGenocide.org. &apos;&apos;A Brief History of the Cambodian Genocide&apos;&apos;..

In opposition to the newly-created state, a government-in-exile referred to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed in 1981 from three factions. This consisted of the Khmer Rouge, a royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer People&apos;s National Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognized by the United Nations.

The government is a constitutional monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The Prime Minister of Cambodia, an office held by Hun Sen since 1985, is the head of government, while the King of Cambodia (currently Norodom Sihamoni ) is the head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the advice and with the approval of the National Assembly The prime minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power while legislative power s are shared by the executive and the bicameral Parliament of Cambodia, which consists of a lower house, the National Assembly or Radhsphea and an upper house, the Senate or Sénat. Members of the 123-seat Assembly are elected through a system of proportional representation and serve for a maximum term of five years. The Senate has 58 seats, two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the National Assembly, and the rest elected by the commune councillors from 24 provinces of Cambodia. Senators serve five year terms. On October 14, 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member throne council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week prior. Sihamoni&apos;s selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king&apos;s half brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on October 29, 2004. The Cambodian People&apos;s Party (CPP) is the major ruling party in Cambodia. The CPP controls the lower and upper chambers of parliament, with 73 seats in the National Assembly and 43 seats in the Senate. The opposition Sam Rainsy Party is the second largest party in Cambodia with 26 seats in the National Assembly and 2 in the Senate. { Hun Sen. } [ Military ] [ Royal Cambodian Armed Forces ] { Cambodia-US Maritime Exercise 2011. } The Royal Cambodian Army, Royal Cambodian Navy, Royal Cambodian Air Force and Royal Gendarmerie collectively form the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, under the command of the Ministry of National Defense, presided over by the Prime Minister of Cambodia. His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni is the Supreme Commander of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), and the country&apos;s Prime Minister Hun Sen effectively holds the position of commander-in-chief. The introduction of a revised command structure early in 2000 was a key prelude to the reorganisation of the Cambodian military. This saw the defence ministry form three subordinate general departments responsible for logistics and finance, materials and technical services, and defence services under the High Command Headquarters (HCHQ). The minister of National Defence is General Tea Banh. Banh has served as defence minister since 1979. The Secretaries of State for Defence are Chay Saing Yun and Por Bun Sreu.

The Army Commander is General Meas Sophea and the Army Chief of Staff is Chea Saran. In 2010, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces comprised about 210,000 personnel. Total Cambodian military spending stands at 3% of national GDP. The Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia total more than 7,000 personnel. Its civil duties include providing security and public peace, to investigate and prevent organized crime, terrorism and other violent groups; to protect state and private property; to help and assist civilians and other emergency forces in a case of emergency, natural disaster, civil unrest and armed conflicts.

In recent years, bilateral relations between the United States and Cambodia have strengthened. The U.S. supports efforts in Cambodia to combat terrorism, build democratic institutions, promote human rights, foster economic development, eliminate corruption, achieve the fullest possible accounting for Americans missing from the Vietnam War -era, and to bring to justice those most responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed under the Khmer Rouge regime. China&apos;s geopolitical interest in Cambodia changed significantly with the end of the Cold War. It retains considerable influence, including close links with former King Norodom Sihanouk, senior members of Cambodian Government, and the ethnic Chinese community in Cambodia. There are regular high level exchanges between the two countries. Japan has been a vital contributor to Cambodia’s rehabilitation and reconstruction since the high-profile UN Transitional Authority (UNTAC) mission and elections in 1993. Japan provided some US$1.2  billion in total overseas development assistance (ODA) during the period since 1992 and remains Cambodia’s top donor country. While the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 80s have passed, several border dispute s between Cambodia and its neighbours persist. There are disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries and border areas with Thailand. Both Cambodian and Thai troops have clashed over land immediately adjacent to the Preah Vihear temple, leading to a deterioration in relations. The International Court of Justice in 1962 awarded the temple to Cambodia but was unclear regarding some of the surrounding land. Both countries blamed the other for firing first and denied entering the other&apos;s territory. [ Geography ] [ Geography of Cambodia ] { Phnom Dângrêk in Northern Cambodia } Cambodia has an area of 181,035 square kilometers (69,898  sq  mi) and lies entirely within the tropics, between latitudes 10° and 15°N, and longitudes 102° and 108°E. It borders Thailand to the north and west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a 443-kilometer (275  mi) coastline along the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia’s landscape is characterized by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta. Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level. To the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320  km) from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600 to 1,800 feet (180 to 550 metres). This escarpment marks the southern limit of the Dângrêk Mountains. Flowing south through the country’s eastern regions is the Mekong River. East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland blocks, the Krâvanh Mountains and the Dâmrei Mountains, form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand. In this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia’s highest peak, rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres). The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands. The most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap (Great Lake), measuring about 2,590 square kilometers (1,000  sq  mi) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometers (9,500  sq  mi) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia. Much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve. [ Climate ] [ Climate of Cambodia ] { Sun Bear } Cambodia&apos;s climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia, is dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences. Cambodia has a temperature range from [ 21 to 35 °C °F 1 ] and experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to March. The country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February. Cambodia has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to October, can see temperatures drop to [ 22 °C 1 ] and is generally accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from November to April when temperatures can rise up to [ 40 °C ] around April. Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002, with some degree of flooding almost every year. [ Wildlife ] [ Wildlife of Cambodia ] { Sarus Crane } Cambodia has a wide variety of plants and animals. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 240 reptile species, 850 freshwater fish species (Tonle Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species. Much of this biodiversity is contained around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere. { Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve: perspective 2000, Mekong River Commission (MRC), Mar 1, 2003.

In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. { Complete list of biosphere reserves in pdf, Publication Date: November 3, 2008, retrieved from UNESCO website, December 29, 2008 } Other key habitats include the dry forest of Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri provinces and the Cardamom Mountains ecosystem, including Bokor National Park, Botum-Sakor National Park, and the Phnom Aural and Phnom Samkos wildlife sanctuaries. The rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the world. Cambodia&apos;s primary rainforest cover fell from over 70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. In total, Cambodia lost [ 25000 km2 sqmi -2 ] of forest between 1990 and 2005— [ 3340 km2 sqmi 0 on ] of which was primary forest. Since 2007, less than [ 3220 km2 sqmi 0 on ] of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of Cambodia is under severe threat, with illegal loggers looking to generate revenue.

The Credit Bureau further increases the transparency and stability within the Cambodian Banking Sector as all banks and Micro-finance companies are now required by law to report accurate facts and figures relating to loans performance in the country. One of the largest challenges facing Cambodia is still the fact that the older population often lacks education, particularly in the countryside, which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure.

Based on the classical Indian solar calendar and Theravada Buddhism, the Cambodian New Year is a major holiday that takes place in April. Recent artistic figures include singers Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Sereysothea (and later Meng Keo Pichenda ), who introduced new musical styles to the country. [ Cuisine ] [ Cuisine of Cambodia ] Rice is the staple grain, as in other Southeast Asian countries. Fish from the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers is also an important part of the diet. The supply of fish and fish products for food and trade in 2000 was 20 kilograms per person or 2   ounces per day per person. [ Earthtrends.org Cambodia Country Profile ] Some of the fish can be made into prahok for longer storage. The cuisine of Cambodia contains tropical fruits, soups and noodles. Key ingredients are kaffir lime, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, curry, tamarind, ginger, oyster sauce, coconut milk and black pepper. Some delicacies are(នំបញ្ចុក) (Num Bunhjok), (អាមុក) (Amok), (អាពីង) (Ah Ping). French influence on Cambodian cuisine includes the Cambodian red curry with toasted baguette bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped in the curry and eaten. Cambodian red curry is also eaten with rice and rice vermicelli noodles. Probably the most popular dine out dish, ka tieu, is a pork broth rice noodle soup with fried garlic, scallions, green onions that may also contain various toppings such as beef balls, shrimp, pork liver or lettuce. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbours Thailand and Vietnam. &apos;&apos;Amok&apos;&apos;, a popular Khmer dish [ Sports ] Football is one of the more popular sports, although professional organized sports are not as prevalent in Cambodia as in western countries because of the economic conditions. Football was brought to Cambodia by the French and became popular with the locals. { &apos;&apos;AFF- The official site of the ASEAN Football Federation&apos;&apos;. Retrieved February 20, 2009. } The Cambodia national football team managed fourth in the 1972 Asian Cup, but development has slowed since the civil war. Western sports such as volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey, rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining popularity. Native sports include traditional boat racing,buffalo racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional wrestling and Bokator. Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during the 1956 Summer Olympic Games sending equestrian riders. Cambodia also hosted the GANEFO Games, the alternative to the Olympics, in the 1960s. { Sinn Sisamouth } [ Dance ] [ Dance in Cambodia ] [ March 2012 ] Cambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer classical dance, folk dance, and social dances. { Chhim Sothy&apos;s painting &quot; Please let there be peace &quot; } [ Music ] [ Music of Cambodia ] Traditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the Khmer Empire. Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the Cambodian culture. Popular types of dances are Romvong, commonly danced at festivals. The Classic Music Era of Cambodia was during the 1960s to the 1970s featuring notable singers Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Sereysothea. However, during the Khmer Rouge Revolution many classic and popular singers of the 60s and 70s died of execution, starvation, or overwork [ September 2010 ]. [ Internet ] As Cambodia continues to grow, so does its connection to the world. There are numerous places where internet is available for public use, such as coffee shops, bars, restaurants and petrol stations. Through the use of USB modems and internet capabilities on cell phones, many Cambodians are connecting with the outside world. The Internet connection in both metropolitan and rural areas of Cambodia is still quite expensive when compared to developed countries such as the US or Australia. A basic connection of 512 kbit/s can cost upwards of $100 per month with line and modem rental. {. Ezecom. Retrieved on Dec 13, 2011. } These connections are considered as &quot; premium &quot; in Cambodia but would be considered out of date in more technologically advanced countries. The increased connection to the internet has created the desire for more websites focused on Cambodia. Because of the literacy rate in Cambodia, the issue arises of whether Cambodia-focused sites need to be in English or Khmer. English is the predominant language of the internet, and the majority of internet users in Cambodia are able to understand English, but with the use of Khmer Unicode more sites have the capability to provide Khmer language versions. [ Transport ] [ Transport in Cambodia ] National Highway 4 { Siem Reap International Airport } The civil war and neglect severely damaged Cambodia&apos;s transport system, but with assistance and equipment from other countries Cambodia has been upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved. Cambodia has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometers (380  mi) of single, one  meter  gauge track. [ http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2187.html CountryData.com CountryData.com June 27, 2010 ] The lines run from the capital to Sihanoukville on the southern coast, and from Phnom Penh to Sisophon (although trains often run only as far as Battambang ). Currently only one passenger train per week operates between Phnom Penh and Battambang. Besides the main interprovincial traffic artery connecting Phnom Penh with Sihanoukville, resurfacing a former dirt road with concrete / asphalt and implementation of 5 major river crossings by means of bridges have now permanently connected Phnom Penh with Koh Kong, and hence there is now uninterrupted road access to neighboring Thailand and their vast road system. Cambodia&apos;s road traffic accident rate is high by world standards. In 2004, the number of road fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was ten times higher in Cambodia than in the developed world, and the number of road deaths had doubled in the preceding three years. { Cambodia Road Traffic Accident and Victim Information System. (PDF). Retrieved on June 20, 2011. } { Cambodia Angkor Air Airbus A321. } The nation&apos;s extensive inland waterways were important historically in international trade. The Mekong and the Tonle Sap River, their numerous tributaries, and the Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers (2,300  mi) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters (2  ft) and another 282 kilometers (175  mi) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters (6  ft). Cambodia has two major ports, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, located at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000- ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season.With increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile and motorcycle use, though bicycles still predominate. { &quot; Picking Up Speed: As Cambodia&apos;s Traffic Levels Increase, So Too Does the Road Death Toll &quot;, The Cambodia Daily, Saturday, March 9–10, 2002. &quot; } &quot; Cyclo &quot; (as hand-me-down French) or Cycle rickshaw s are an additional option often used by visitors. These kind of rickshaws are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist is situated behind the passenger(s) seat, { Cyclo – Transport in Cambodia. About.com. Retrieved on Dec 13, 2011. } as opposed to Cycle rickshaws in neighbouring countries where the cyclist is at the front and &quot; pulls &quot; the carriage. The country has four commercial airports. Phnom Penh International Airport (Pochentong) in Phnom Penh is the second largest in Cambodia. Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is the largest and serves the most international flights in and out of Cambodia. The other airports are in Sihanoukville and Battambang.
