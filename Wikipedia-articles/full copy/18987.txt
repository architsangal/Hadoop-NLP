[ History of Mexico City ] [ History of Mexico City ] [ Aztec period ] [ Tenochtitlan ] { Diego Rivera } The city currently known as Mexico City was founded by the Mexica people, later known as the Aztec s, in 1325. The old Mexica city is now referred to as Tenochtitlan. The Mexica were one of the last of the Nahuatl -speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the Valley of Mexico after the fall of the Toltec Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already in the valley, but the Mexica were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Mexica themselves had a story about how their city was founded, after being led to the island by their principal god, Huitzilopochtli. According to the story, the god indicated the site where they were to build their home with a sign - an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Scholars estimate that between 200,000 and 250,000 people lived in Tenochtitlan in 1500, more than four times the population of London at that time. [ Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlán ] After landing in Veracruz, Hernán Cortés heard about the great city and the long-standing rivalries and grievances against it. Although Cortés came to Mexico with a very small army, he was able to persuade many of the other native peoples to help him destroy Tenochtitlan.

Although Montezuma came out from the center of Tenochtitlán to greet them and exchange gifts, the camaraderie did not last long.

[ http://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_g00.html Conquistadors – Cortés. June 1520 – Massacre at Tenochtitlán PBS April 17, 2011 ] Cortés regrouped at Tlaxcala.

[ The rebuilding of the city as Mexico City ] Mexico City painting of 1628 The Spaniards practically razed Tenochtitlán. Cortés first settled in Coyoacán, but decided to rebuild the Aztec site to erase all traces of the old order. Cortés did not establish an independent, conquered territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the Spanish crown. The first viceroy of the new domain arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. By that time, the city had again become a city-state, having power that extended far beyond the city&apos;s established borders. [ Alvarez Jose Rogelio Enciclopedia de Mexico Spanish Mexico, Ciudad de 2000 Encyclopædia Britannica 9 5242–5260 ] Although the Spanish preserved Tenochtitlán&apos;s basic layout, they built Catholic churches over the old Aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves. Tenochtitlán was renamed &quot; Mexico &quot;, its alternative form name, only because the Spanish found this easier to say. [ Growth of the colonial city ] { Ángel de la Independencia &apos;&apos; was built to celebrate Mexico&apos;s independence centennial } Colonial style architecture in the historic center of Mexico City. The city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake&apos;s waters. The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center. Economically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success. [ Concise History of Mexico. Hamnett Brian R. 1998 Cambridge University Press Port Chester, New York, USA 978-0-521-58120-2 ] The concept of nobility flourished in New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. In the ensuing centuries, a noble title in Mexico did not mean one exercised great political power as one&apos;s power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not. [ Artes deMexico Palacios de la Nueva España The Mexican Nobility Ladd Doris M 1998 Artes de Mexico y del Mundo Mexico City 978-968-6533-61-3 84–86 ] The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. The craze to build the most opulent home possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Many of these homes can still be seen today, leading to Mexico City&apos;s nickname of &quot; The city of palaces &quot; given by Alexander Von Humboldt. The Grito de Dolores ( &quot; Cry of Dolores &quot; ) also known as El Grito de la Independencia ( &quot; Cry of Independence &quot; ), uttered from the small town of Dolores near Guanajuato on September 16, 1810, is the event that marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence and is the most important national holiday observed in Mexico. The &quot; Grito &quot; was the battle cry of the Mexican War of Independence by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Roman Catholic priest. Hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the Spanish colonial government, and the plotters were betrayed. Fearing his arrest,[1] Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro-independence inmates there on the night of September 15. They managed to set eighty free.[2] Around 6:00  am September 16, 1810, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Allende and Juan Aldama, he addressed the people in front of his church, encouraging them to revolt.The Battle of Guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred four days later. Mexico&apos;s independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 27, 1821, after a decade of war.

During this time, the city developed a modern infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation, and communication systems. However, the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest languished in poverty. [ Revolution ] A Mexico City street in 1890 Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata entering Mexico City (1914) Fast modern development eventually led to the Mexican Revolution. The most significant episode of this period for the city was the La decena trágica ( &quot; The Ten Tragic Days &quot; ), a coup against President Francisco I. Madero and his vice president, José María Pino Suárez. Victoriano Huerta, chief general of the Federal Army saw a chance to take power, forcing Madero and Pino Suarez to sign resignations. The two were murdered later while on their way to prison.

In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000. [ Atlas and Survey of Latin American History. LaRosa Michael J.(Editor) 2005 M. E. Sharpe, Inc. Armonk, New York, USA 118–125 978-0-7656-1597-8 ] The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century and then began to grow upwards in the 1950s, with the Torre Latinoamericana becoming the city&apos;s first skyscraper. The 1968 Olympic Games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities. In 1969, the Metro system was inaugurated. Explosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city&apos;s population more than doubled to 8,831,079. In 1980, half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city&apos;s problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles. This caused serious air pollution in Mexico City and water pollution problems, as well as a sinking city due to overextraction of groundwater, groundwater-related subsidence. [ Mexico City&apos;s Water Supply: Improving the Outlook for Sustainability. National Research Council Staff. 1995 National Academies Press Washington, D.C., USA 4 ] Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation. The autocratic government that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated, mostly because of the continued economic expansion since World War II. This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco. Three years later, a demonstration in the Maestros avenue, organized by former members of the 1968 student movement, was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called &quot; Los Halcones &quot;, composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the U.S. On Thursday, September 19, 1985, at 7:19  am local time, Mexico City was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 [ Yunnven Campus A 20 años del sismo del 85 http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/terremoto/475688.html Televisa Mexico City September 19, 2005 October 4, 2008 Spanish ] on the Richter scale. Although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America, [ Moreno Murillo Juan Manuel 1995 The 1985 Mexico Earchquake Geofisica Coumbia Universidad Nacional de Colombia 3 5–19 0121-2974 ] it proved to be a disaster politically for the one-party government. The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well. [ Haber Paul Lawrence Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico Earthquake of 1985 1995 Taylor &amp; Frances Ltd. 179–184 ] However, the last straw may have been the controverted elections of 1988. That year, the presidency was set between the P.R.I.&apos;s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and a coalition of left-wing parties led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, son of the former president Lázaro Cárdenas. The counting system &quot; fell &quot; because coincidentally the light went out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was Salinas, even though Cárdenas had the upper hand. As a result of the fraudulent election, Cárdenas became a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. Discontent over the election eventually led Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas to become the first elected mayor of Mexico City in 1997. Cárdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency.

Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed&apos;s heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called groundwater-related subsidence. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the city has sunk as much as nine meters in some areas. This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the rainy season.

Situated in a valley, and relying heavily on automobiles, the city suffers from poor air quality Originally, much of the valley laid beneath the waters of Lake Texcoco, a system of interconnected saline and freshwater lakes. The Aztec s built dikes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in chinampa s and to prevent recurrent floods. These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan, and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods. Only a small section of the original lake remains, located outside the Federal District, in the municipality of Atenco, State of Mexico. In recent years, architects Teodoro González de León and Alberto Kalach, along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists, have developed the project plan for Recovering the City of Lakes. The project, if approved by the government, will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the Valley of Mexico, the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning. The federal and local governments have implemented numerous plans to alleviate the problem of air pollution (such as carbon monoxide), including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxide s. [ http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28391130/wid/18298287/page/2/ Mexico City cleans up its reputation for smog December 26, 2008 ] If the levels of these two pollutants reach critical levels, contingency actions are implemented which may include closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the A day without a car program to two days of the week. To control air pollution, the government has instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuel s. Data from the city&apos;s 36 air-quality monitoring stations show lead levels down 95 percent since 1990, while sulfur dioxide has fallen 86 percent, carbon monoxide 74 percent, and peak ozone levels 57 percent since 1991. In 1990, Patricia Saad Sotomayor reported in the Mexico City daily Excélsior that &quot; 100,000 children die every year as a result of pollution in the Mexico City metropolitan area, 250,000 people suffer from eye diseases..and life expectancy has been reduced by up to ten years, according to the National Environmentalist Groups. &quot; in a report to President Salinas. At the time, according to the United Nations pollution scale &quot; which set 100 as the maximum level before grave health problems begin &quot;, Mexico City&apos;s level was 97.5, compared to 4.5 for New York City, and 2.5 for Milan, Turin, and Los Angeles. { Pollution Kills 100,000 Children In Mexico City Each Year, by Patricia Saad Sotomayor, Excélsior } In 1986, the non-urban forest areas of the southern boroughs were declared National Ecological Reserves by president Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado. Other areas of the Federal District became protected over the following years. [ Politics ] [ Federal District ] Large urban upper middle class neighborhoods are common throughout the northern and western area. { Colonia Roma } Santa Fe in the rainy season The Acta Constitutiva de la Federación of January 31, 1824 and the Federal Constitution of October 4, 1824 [ http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States (1824) ] fixed the political and administrative organization of the United Mexican States after the Mexican War of Independence. In addition, Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave the new Congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located. This location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and Querétaro. [ January 2010 ] However, due in large part to the persuasion of representative Servando Teresa de Mier, Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country&apos;s population and history, even though Querétaro was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on November 18, 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 ac) centered on the Zocalo. This area was then separated from the State of Mexico, forcing that state&apos;s government to move from the Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine) in the city to Texcoco. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of Coyoacán, Xochimilco, Mexicaltzingo and Tlalpan, all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico. [ Alvarez Jose Rogelio Enciclopedia de Mexico Distrito Federal 2003 Sabeco International Investment Corp. IV Spanish 978-1-56409-063-8 2293–2314 ] In 1854, president Antonio López de Santa Anna, enlarged the area of the Federal District almost eightfold from the original [ 220 sqkm sqmi -1 on ] to [ 1700 sqkm sqmi -1 on ], annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (The Mexican-American War had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of the Federal District were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current [ 1479 sqkm sqmi 0 on ] by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of municipalities within the Federal District was twenty-two. While the Federal District was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor, the municipalities within it were autonomous, and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century. In 1903 already, Porfirio Díaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the Federal District. Eventually, in December 1928, the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the Federal District. In place of the municipalities, the Federal District was divided into one &quot; Central Department &quot; and 13 delegaciones (boroughs) administered directly by the government of the Federal District. The Central Department was integrated by the former municipalities of Mexico City, Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mixcoac. In 1941, the General Anaya borough was merged to the Central Department, which was then renamed &quot; Mexico City &quot; (thus reviving the name, but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District was comprised by 12 delegaciones and Mexico City. In 1970 Mexico City was split into four different delegaciones: Cuauhtémoc, Miguel Hidalgo, Venustiano Carranza and Benito Juárez, increasing the number of delegaciones to sixteen. Since then, in a de facto manner, the whole Federal District, whose delegaciones had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered a synonym of Mexico City. However, the lack of a de jure stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993 this situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the Constitution whereby Mexico City and the Federal District were set to be the same entity. This amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District. { Statute of Government of the Federal District } [ http://www.df.gob.mx/leyes/normatividad.html?materia%3D1%26amp%3Bapartado%3D15%26amp%3Bdisp%3D140 20080313061806 ] [ Political structure ] The National Palace of Mexico. Offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Interior of the Mexico City Hall. Mexico City, being the seat of the powers of the Union, did not belong to any particular state but to all. Therefore, it was the president, representing the federation, who used to designate the head of government of the Federal District, a position which is sometimes presented outside Mexico as the &quot; Mayor &quot; of Mexico City. [ December 2008 ] In the 1980s, given the dramatic increase in population of the previous decades, the inherent political inconsistencies of the system, as well as the dissatisfaction with the inadequate response of the federal government after the 1985 earthquake, residents began to request political and administrative autonomy to manage their local affairs. [ December 2008 ] Some political groups even proposed that the Federal District be converted into the 32nd state of the federation. In response to the demands, in 1987 the Federal District received a greater degree of autonomy, with the elaboration the first Statute of Government (Estatuto de Gobierno), and the creation of an Assembly of Representatives. [ December 2008 ] In the 1990s, this autonomy was further expanded and, starting from 1997, residents can directly elect the head of government of the Federal District and the representatives of a unicameral Legislative Assembly (which succeeded the previous Assembly) by popular vote. The first elected head of government was Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas. Cárdenas resigned in 1999 to run in the 2000 presidential elections and designated Rosario Robles to succeed him, who became the first woman (elected or otherwise) to govern Mexico City. In 2000 Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected, and resigned in 2005 to run in the 2006 presidential elections, Alejandro Encinas Rodríguez being designated by the Legislative Assembly to finish the term. In 2006, Marcelo Ebrard Casaubon was elected for the 2006–2012 period. The Federal District does not have a constitution, like the states of the Union, but rather a Statute of Government. As part of its recent changes in autonomy, the budget is administered locally; it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Nonetheless, it is the Congress of the Union that sets the ceiling to internal and external public debt issued by the Federal District. [ http://www.finanzas.df.gob.mx/documentos/CodigoFinanciero_2007.pdf Codigo Financiero Del Distrito Federal* PDF April 17, 2010 ] According to the 44th article of the Mexican Constitution, in case the powers of the Union move to another city, the Federal District will be transformed into a new state, which will be called &quot; State of the Valley of Mexico &quot;, with the new limits set by the Congress of the Union. Government offices in the Zocalo [ Elections and government ] { Head of Government } { Marcelo Ebrard. } In 2006, elections were held for the post of head of government and the representatives of the Legislative Assembly. The elected and incumbent head of government is now Marcelo Ebrard Casaubon, candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Heads of government are elected for a 6-year period without the possibility of reelection. Traditionally, this position has been considered as the second most important executive office in the country. { Hamnett, Brian (1999) A Concise History of Mexico } { Cambridge University Press; } { Cambridge, UK, p. 293 } The Legislative Assembly of the Federal District is formed, as it is the case in all legislatures in Mexico, by both single-seat and proportional seats, making it a system of parallel voting. The Federal District is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by first-past-the-post plurality (FPP), locally called &quot; uninominal deputies &quot;. The Federal District as a whole constitutes a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives by proportionality (PR) with open-party lists, locally called &quot; plurinominal deputies &quot;. Even though proportionality is only confined to the proportional seats, to prevent a part from being overrepresented, several restrictions apply in the assignation of the seats; namely, that no party can have more than 63% of all seats, both uninominal and plurinominal. In the 2006 elections leftist PRD got the absolute majority in the direct uninominal elections, securing 34 of the 40 FPP seats. As such, PRD was not assigned any plurinominal seat to comply with the law that prevents overrepresentation. The overall composition of the Legislative Assembly is: Political party FPP PR Total 18px Party of the Democratic Revolution 31 3 34 18px National Action Party 9 6 15 18px Institutional Revolutionary Party 8 8 18px Labour Party 5 5 18px Ecologist Green Party of Mexico 3 3 18px New Alliance Party 1 1 Total 40 26 66 The politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country, whether with the support of the federal government—as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s—or through laws recently approved by the Legislative Assembly. In April of the same year, the Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it regardless of the reason should the mother request it before the twelfth week of pregnancy. [ http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/420927.html Aprueba ALDF en lo general reforma sobre el aborto El Universal April 24, 2007 April 25, 2007 ] In December 2009, the Federal District became the first city in Latin America, and one of very few in the world, to legalize same-sex marriage. [ Boroughs ] [ Mexico City&apos;s boroughs Colonias of Mexico City ] The 16 boroughs of Mexico City For administrative purposes, the Federal District is divided into 16 &quot; delegaciones &quot; or boroughs. While not fully equivalent to a municipality, the 16 boroughs have gained significant autonomy, and since 2000 their heads of government are elected directly by plurality (they were previously appointed by the head of government of the Federal District). Given that Mexico City is organized entirely as a Federal District, most of the city services are provided or organized by the Government of the Federal District and not by the boroughs themselves, while in the constituent state s these services would be provided by the municipalities. The 16 boroughs of the Federal District are: 1. Álvaro Obregón 2. Azcapotzalco 3. Benito Juárez 4. Coyoacán 5. Cuajimalpa 6. Cuauhtémoc 7. Gustavo A. Madero 8. Iztacalco 9. Iztapalapa 10. Magdalena Contreras 11. Miguel Hidalgo 12. Milpa Alta 13. Tláhuac 14. Tlalpan 15. Venustiano Carranza 16. Xochimilco The boroughs are composed by hundreds of colonias or neighborhoods, which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation. It is plausible that the name, which literally means colony, arose in the late 19th, early 20th centuries, when one of the first urban developments outside the city&apos;s core was inhabited by a French colony in the city. Some colonias have identifiable attributes: Historic Center is the oldest quarter in the city, some of the buildings dating back to the 16th century [ December 2008 ]; Condesa is known for its Art Deco architecture, and for being the newest artistic center of the city; Santa Fe is a growing business and financial district (built over old landfill s ); Roma is a beaux arts neighborhood and probably one of the oldest in the city; Polanco is an important commercial and economic center known for its large Jewish community, and Tepito and La Lagunilla are known for its large flea market. [ December 2008 ] [ Health ] Visible smog on a sunrise at 7 am, May 28, 2005 Mexico City is home to some of the best private hospitals in the country; Hospital Ángeles, Hospital ABC and Médica Sur to name a few. The national public healthcare institution for private-sector employees IMSS, has its largest facilities in Mexico City, including the National Medical Center and the La Raza Medical Center, and has an annual budget of over 6  billion pesos. The IMSS and other public health institutions, including the ISSSTE (Public Sector Employees&apos; Social Security Institute) and the National Health Ministry (SSA) maintain large specialty facilities in the city. These include the National Institutes of Cardiology, Nutrition, Psychiatry, Oncology, Pediatrics, Rehabilitation, among others. The World Bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter, which reduce the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion. Today it has over [ 201 km 0 on ] of track and carries over 5 million people every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hour s the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women.Due to these initiatives and others, the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve, with the air becoming cleaner since 1991, when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year. [ Economy ] { Mexican Stock Exchange in } { Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City } { zona marginal (marginal zone). } Mexico City is one of the most important economic hubs in Latin America.

[ March 2011 ] The top twenty-five percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US $98,517 in 2007. [ March 2011 ] The extremely high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants, [ March 2011 ] makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury good s. The combined personal wealth of privately held income of citizens of the entire federal district is estimated to be $536.95  billion USD, [ March 2011 ] $146  billion larger than the city&apos;s GDP of $390  billion, [ March 2011 ] which only takes into account the combined net worth of goods, services and corporately held assets. The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to the decentralization and a shift in Mexico City&apos;s economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city. Historically Mexico City has had large slums and shanty towns on the periphery of the city although programs and government policies enacted between the 1980s and the present have significantly reduced the number of informal shanty towns in the city to near non existence and transformed many of the slums into modernized boroughs part of the city structure. Despite the elimination of most shanty towns and slums, the boroughs replacing them still suffer from many of the same problems the communities before them did. While modern Mexico City lacks slums in the classical definition of the word, the city does have large districts in which slum like characteristics such as high rates of poverty and crime are prevalent. Although these districts face many of the same problems as classical slums seen in Brazil and India do, they typically have water, sewage, electrical, transportation, school and sanitation services differentiating them from proper slums. These semi-slum, semi-developed areas are known as Zonas Marginales in Mexico or &quot; Marginal Zones &quot;. In Mexico as a whole these Marginal Zones are characterized by their winding unplanned roads, and seemingly endless sprawls of cinder block buildings spanning over tens of square miles. Some well known Marginal Zones in Mexico City are Cuautepec, Tepito and Nezahualcoyotl. While Mexico City itself has no settlements that fit the classical definition of a slum, the neighboring state of Mexico has several such settlements. [ Demographics ] Apartment blocks in Santa Fe. Reforma Avenue, one of the most important streets in the city. Greater Mexico City, extending to the states of Mexico and Hidalgo Historically, and since pre-Hispanic times, the valley of Anáhuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today&apos;s Cuauhtémoc borough. [ December 2008 ] At the beginning of the 20th century, the elites began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation.

Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico, { Síntesis de Resultados del Conteo 2005 INEGI } a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization.

(The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables.) The most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence, found on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. This avenue was designed over Americas&apos; oldest passage in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange as several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends [ 28.8 km mi on ] and is one of the longest single avenues in the world. The Chapultepec park houses the Castle of Chapultepec, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone ). Another magnificent piece of architecture is the Fine Arts Palace, a stunning white marble theatre/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below. Its construction began during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz and ended in 1934, after being interrupted by the Mexican Revolution in the 1920s. The Plaza of the Three Cultures in the Tlatelolco neighbourhood, and the shrine and Basilica s of Our Lady of Guadalupe are also important sites. There is a double-decker bus, known as the &quot; Turibus &quot;, that circles most of these sites, and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed. { Mexico City Cathedral } { Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe } In addition, the city has around 160 museums, over 100 art galleries, and some 30 concert halls, all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year.

[ http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm MTA NYC Transit – Info Mta.info October 27, 1904 May 5, 2009 ] It is heavily subsidized, and has the lowest fares in the world, each trip costing 3.00 Mex$ and taking each passenger to almost any place in the mega city from 05:00  am to midnight. Several stations display pre-Columbian artifacts and architecture that were discovered during the metro&apos;s construction. [ December 2008 ] However, the Metro does not extend over more than half of the urban area, for which an extensive network of bus routes exists. These routes are mostly managed by private companies which are allowed to operate buses as long as they adhere to certain minimal service quality standards. The city government also operates a network of large buses, in contrast with the privately operated microbuses (peseros), with fares barely exceeding that of the metro. Electric transport other than the metro also exists, in the form of several Mexico City trolleybus routes and the Xochimilco Light Rail line, both of which are operated by Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos. The central area&apos;s last streetcar line (tramway, or tranvía ) closed in 1979, but the reintroduction of streetcars to the historic city center is planned. { Tramways &amp; Urban Transit magazine (UK), April 2010, p. 150. } { Light Rail Transit Association. } The city&apos;s first bus rapid transit line, the Metrobús, began operation in June 2005, along Avenida Insurgentes. A second line was constructed along Eje 4 Sur, opening in December 2008, [ Gómez Flores Laura Con retraso de siete meses inicia línea 2 del Metrobús Spanish December 16, 2008 La Jornada http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/12/16/index.php?section%3Dcapital%26amp%3Barticle%3D037n2cap June 7, 2010 ] and a third line opened in February 2011, serving Eje 1 Poniente between Tenayuca and Metro Etiopía. [ Gómez Flores Laura Pretenden entregar antes la línea 3 del Metrobús Spanish May 31, 2010 La Jornada http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/05/31/index.php?section%3Dcapital%26amp%3Barticle%3D038n2cap June 7, 2010 ] As the microbuses were removed from its route, it was hoped that the Metrobús could reduce pollution and decrease transit time for passengers. Also, since late 2002, the white and green taxis have been joined by red and white ones as part of a program to replace older vehicles with new ones. [ Roads ] Aerial view of the elevated freeway running from the northern area of the city to the southern area In the late 1970s many arterial roads were redesigned as ejes viales; high-volume one-way roads that cross, in theory, Mexico City proper from side to side. The eje vial network is based on a quasi- Cartesian grid, with the ejes themselves being called Eje 1 Poniente, Eje Central, and Eje 1 Oriente, for example, for the north-south roads, and Eje 2 Sur and Eje 3 Norte, for example, for east-west roads. Two freeway ring-roads serve to connect points within the city and the metropolitan area: Circuito Interior (the inner ring) and Periférico, which connect to one straight freeway: the Viaducto (Viaduct) (connecting west with east, from Observatorio to the Airport). Traffic in this system is so dense that an elevated highway that runs on top and parallel to a part of the Periférico, had to be constructed and finished in 2003. This elevated highway is colloquially called segundo piso ( &quot; second level &quot; ) of the Periférico. There is an environmental program, called Hoy No Circula ( &quot; Today Does Not Run &quot;, or &quot; One Day without a Car &quot; ), whereby only vehicles with certain ending numbers on their license plates are allowed to circulate on certain days, in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion. [ December 2008 ] [ Cycling ] The local government continuously strives for a reduction of massive traffic congestion, and has increased incentives for making a bicycle-friendly city. A bicycle lending program was created in the Centro Historico, in which a citizen or tourist can rent a bicycle for 3 hours, by filling out a simple form and presenting a valid ID, the so-called Cicloestaciones are located primarily by the Paseo de la Reforma. [ http://www.sma.df.gob.mx/sma/index.php?opcion%3D26%26amp%3Bid%3D607 :: Secretaría del Medio Ambiente del Gobierno del Distrito Federal :: Sma.df.gob.mx September 24, 2009 April 17, 2011 ] There is also a service called Ecobici, in which registered residents can get bicycles for 45  minutes with a pre-paid subscription of 300 pesos a year, there are a total of 90 stations scattered along the Roma - Condesa, Centro, Juárez neighborhoods within 300  meters from each other and are fully automatic only serving one bicycle per person using a transponder based card. [ https://www.ecobici.df.gob.mx/home/home.php Ecobici Ecobici.df.gob.mx April 17, 2011 ] [ August 2011 ] Both bicycle service users have access to several permanent Ciclovía s in the city, the most important runs 59  kilometers from Polanco to Fierro del Toro, which is located south of Cumbres del Ajusco National Park, near the Morelos state line. The city&apos;s initiative is inspired by forward thinking examples, such as Denmark &apos;s Copenhagenization. [ Buses ] Retail center in the waiting area of the TAPO bus terminal. The city has four major bus stations (North, South, Observatorio, TAPO), which comprise one of the world&apos;s largest transportation agglomerations, with bus service to many cities across the country and international connections. The city has one train station, used for commercial and industrial purposes (interstate passenger trains are now virtually non-existent in Mexico). A suburban rail system, the Tren Suburbano serves the metropolitan area, beyond the city limits of the metro, to municipalities such as Tlalnepantla and Cuautitlán Izcalli, with future extensions to Chalco and La Paz. [ Airports ] Departures waiting area in Terminal 2 of the Mexico City airport. Mexico City is served by Mexico City International Airport ( IATA Airport Code : MEX). This airport is Latin America&apos;s busiest and largest in traffic, with daily flights to United States and Canadá, mainland Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia. Aeroméxico ( Skyteam ) and Mexicana ( Oneworld ) are based at this airport, and provide codeshare agreements with non-Mexican airlines that span the entire globe. It is used by over 26 million passengers per year. { Aeropuertos Mexico } [ http://www.aeropuertosmexico.com/DF/aptoDFes.htm 20090227034956 ] This traffic exceeds the current capacity of the airport, which has historically centralized the majority of air traffic in the country. An alternate option is Lic. Adolfo López Mateos International Airport ( IATA Airport Code : TLC) located in the nearby Toluca, State of Mexico with about 4.5  million passengers transported last year. In 2008, about 31 million people went through the city&apos;s airports. The government engaged in an extensive restructuring program that includes the new second adjacent terminal, which began operations in 2007, and the enlargement of four other airports (at the nearby cities of Toluca, Querétaro, Puebla and Cuernavaca ) that, along with Mexico City&apos;s airport, comprise the Grupo Aeroportuario del Valle de México, distributing traffic to different regions in Mexico. The city of Pachuca will also provide additional expansion to central Mexico&apos;s airport network. Mexico City&apos;s airport is the main hub for 11 of the 21 national airline companies. [ Culture ] [ Art ] Palace of fine arts { Museo Nacional de Arte } { Porfirian architecture is common in the city center. } { Museo Nacional de Antropología. } Mexico City is one of the most important cultural centers in the world, boasting more museums than any other city. [ Emporis http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav%3Dcity%26amp%3Blng%3D3%26amp%3Bid%3D101008 Mexico City – Emporis Emporis March 5, 2010 ] It also comes third in the number of theaters in the world, just after London and New York. Having been the capital of a vast pre-Hispanic empire, and also the capital of richest viceroyalty within the Spanish Empire (ruling over a vast territory in the Americas and Spanish East Indies ), and, finally, the capital of the Mexican federation, Mexico City has a rich history of artistic expression. Since the mesoamerican pre-Classical period the inhabitants of the settlements around Lake Texcoco produced many works of art and complex craftsmanship, some of which are today displayed at the world-renown National Museum of Anthropology and the Templo Mayor museum. While many pieces of pottery and stone-engraving have survived, the great majority of the Amerindian iconography was destroyed during the Conquest of Mexico. During colonial times the first art produced was that of the codices generated to preserve or recuperate Amerindian iconography and history. From then, artistic expressions in Mexico were mostly religious in theme. The Metropolitan Cathedral still displays works by Juan de Rojas, Juan Correa and an oil painting whose authorship has been attributed to Murillo. Secular works of art of this period include the equestrian sculpture of Charles IV of Spain, locally known as El Caballito ( &quot; The little horse &quot; ). This piece, in bronze, was the work of Manuel Tolsá and it has been placed at the Plaza Tolsá, in front of the Palacio de Minería (Mining Palace). Directly in front of this building is the beautiful Museo Nacional de Arte (Munal) (the National Museum of Art). During the 19th century, an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ( San Carlos Art Academy ), founded during colonial times, and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (the National School of Visual Arts ), which is currently one of the art school s of UNAM. Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ( National Museum of San Carlos ). One of the students, José María Velasco, is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. It was during Porfirio Díaz &apos;s regime that the government sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. In spite of that, popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished like those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla. The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt, Velázquez, Murillo, and Rubens. After the Mexican Revolution, an avant-garde artistic movement originated in Mexico City: mural ism. Many of the works of muralists José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera are displayed in numerous buildings in the city, most notably at the National Palace and the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Frida Kahlo, wife of Rivera, with a strong nationalist expression, was also one of the most renowned of Mexican painters. Her house has become a museum that displays many of her works. The former home of Rivera muse Dolores Olmedo house the namesake museum. The facility lies in the Xochimilco precinct in the southern part of the city and includes several buildings surrounded by sprawling manicured lawns. It houses a large collection of Rivera and Kahlo paintings and drawings, as well as living Xoloizcuintles ( Mexican Hairless Dog ). It also regularly hosts small but important temporary exhibits of classical and modern art (e.g. Venetian Masters and Contemporary New York artists). During the 20th century, many artists immigrated to Mexico City from different regions of Mexico, like Leopoldo Méndez, an engraver from Veracruz, who supported the creation of the socialist Taller de la Gráfica Popular ( Popular Graphics Workshop ), designed to help blue-collar workers find a venue to express their art. Other painters came from abroad, like Catalan painter Remedios Varo and other Spanish and Jewish exiles. It was in the second half of the 20th century that the artistic movement began to drift apart from the Revolutionary theme. José Luis Cuevas opted for a modernist style in contrast to the muralist movement associated with social politics. [ Museums ] { Museo Soumaya in Polanco. } { Chapultepec Castle } Mexico City has numerous museums dedicated to art, including Mexican colonial, modern and contemporary art, and international art. The Museo Tamayo was opened in the mid-1980s to house the collection of international contemporary art donated by famed Mexican (born in the state of Oaxaca) painter Rufino Tamayo. The collection includes pieces by Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others, though most of the collection is stored while visiting exhibits are shown. The Museo de Arte Moderno ( Museum of Modern Art ) is a repository of Mexican artists from the 20th century, including Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Kahlo, Gerzso, Carrington, Tamayo, among others, and also regularly hosts temporary exhibits of international modern art. In southern Mexico City, the Museo Carrillo Gil ( Carrillo Gil Museum ) showcases avant-garde artists, as does the University Museum/Contemporary Art (Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo – or MUAC), designed by famed Mexican architect Teodoro González de León, inaugurated in late 2008. The Museo Soumaya, named after the wife of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, has the largest private collection of original Rodin sculptures outside Paris. It also has a large collection of Dalí sculptures, and recently began showing pieces in its masters collection including El Greco, Velázquez, Picasso and Canaletto. The museum inaugurated a new futuristic-design facility in 2011 just north of Polanco, while maintaining a smaller facility in Plaza Loreto in southern Mexico City. The Colección Jumex is a contemporary art museum located on the sprawling grounds of the Jumex juice company in the northern industrial suburb of Ecatepec. It is said to have the largest private contemporarry art collection in Latin America and hosts pieces from its permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits by leading contemporary artists. The Museo de San Ildefonso, housed in the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City&apos;s historic downtwon district is a 17th century colonnaded palace housing an art museum that regularly hosts world-class exhbitis of Mexican and international art. Recent exhibits have included those on David LaChapelle, Antony Gormley and Ron Mueck.The National Museum of Art (Museo Nacional de Arte) is also located in a former palace in the historic center. It houses a large collection of pieces by all major Mexican artists of the last 400 years and also hosts visiting exhibits. Jack Kerouac, the noted American author, spent extended periods of time in the city, and wrote his masterpiece volume of poetry Mexico City Blues here. Another American author, William S. Burroughs, also lived in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of the city for some time. It was here that he accidentally shot his wife. There are more than 150 museums in Mexico City. Most of the museums can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday from 10  am to 5  pm, although some of them have extended schedules, such as the Museum of Anthropology and History, which is open up to 7  pm. In addition to this, entrance to most museums is for free on Sundays. However, in some cases a modest fee may be charged.

The brainchild of two young Mexican women as a holocaust museum, the idea morphed into a unique museum dedicated to showcasing all major historical events of discrimination and genocide. Permanent exhibits include those on the holocaust and other humanitarian atrocities in history among others. It also houses temporary exhibits, including a recent one on Tibet which was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011.

Mexico City was traditionally known as La Ciudad de los Palacios ( &quot; the City of the Palaces &quot; ), a nickname attributed to Baron Alexander von Humboldt when visiting the city in the 19th century who sending a letter back to Europe said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe. During López Obrador &apos;s administration a political slogan was introduced: la Ciudad de la Esperanza ( &quot; The City of Hope &quot; ). This slogan was quickly adopted as a nickname to the city under López Obrador&apos;s term, although it has lost popularity since the new slogan Capital en Movimiento ( &quot; Capital in Movement &quot; ) was adopted by the recently elected administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard Casaubon; the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. The city is colloquially known as Chilangolandia after the locals&apos; nickname chilango s, which is used either as a pejorative term by people living outside Mexico City or as a proud adjective by Mexico City&apos;s dwellers. { 1994 Oxford Spanish-English Dictionary } Residents of Mexico City are more formally called capitalinos (in reference to the city being the capital of the country) or, more recently defeños (a word which derives from the postal abbreviation of the Federal District in Spanish: D.F., which is read &quot; De-Efe &quot;.)
