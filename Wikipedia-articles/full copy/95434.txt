[ History ] Established in December 1800, Clermont County is the eighth oldest of Ohio&apos;s 88 counties, and is the eleventh oldest county in the Northwest Territory. Clermont is a French word meaning &quot; clear mountain, &quot; which described the area when it was first viewed by French explorers in the 1600s. A number of Native American tribes called this area home, including the Shawnee, Miami, Delaware, Mingo, Ottawa, Cherokee, and Wyandot. The last Native American village in the county was located two miles south of Marathon in Jackson Township, along the mouth of Grassy Run on the East Fork of the Little Miami River. The Wyandot lived there until 1811. That location was the site of the largest frontier battle in Clermont County, the Battle of Grassy Run, where pioneer Simon Kenton clashed with Native American warrior, Tecumseh, on April 10, 1792. The first village and the first Clermont County seat, was the Village of Williamsburg, established in 1796. In 1823, New Richmond became the county seat, and in 1824, it moved to Batavia, which remains the county seat today. Clermont County was home to President and military hero, General Ulysses S. Grant, born in Point Pleasant on April 27, 1822. He became commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army during the Civil War, and was the eighteenth president of our country. His birthplace in Point Pleasant (originally a one room cabin) continues to welcome visitors today. In 1890, General Grant&apos;s birthplace was removed from its original location, and traveled by boat to be viewed by citizens, along various waterways. It was also taken to the Chicago Worlds Fair, before making its way back to Clermont County. In 1900, a group of clergy from numerous Protestant congregations and the Catholic Church gathered to create a list of ten places on Earth where the Garden of Eden could have been located. Among the locations named were places in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. Also on the list was Clermont County, Ohio -- listed for its many fruiting trees and the early influence of American Indians who built earthen mounds in the form of serpents. Subsequently, prominent men from Hamilton County dedicated Eden Park (Cincinnati) in eastern Cincinnati facing Clermont County to honor the distinction. In 1905, Democrat John M. Pattison of Owensville, became the first Clermont Countian to be elected governor of Ohio. Pattison lived in Milford, residing in a mansion that is known as Promont, which he used as the official governor&apos;s mansion. That structure is now a museum that houses a library and other historical memorabilia. It is located at 906 Main Street in Milford. Among other notable Clermont County citizens is Hugh Nichols of Batavia who was the first Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1914. A stone dairy house, built in 1800, is thought to be the oldest standing structure in Clermont County. It is located beside Harmony Hill on South Third Street in Williamsburg. Harmony Hill (one of the areas first farms) was built by William Lytle, who was one of the first surveyors of the county. The last covered bridge in Clermont County stands on Stonelick Williams Corner Road, near US 50; it was built in 1878. The Bullskin Trail (once a major pathway for Native Americans) runs north and south through the county along State Route 133, and was also used by frontiersmen Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone on hunting and warfare expeditions. John Hunt Morgan and his Confederate raiders invaded the county in 1863. George Washington once owned three parcels of land in Clermont County.

[ Government and politics ] Seal of the Clermont County Clerk of Courts { Clermont County Courthouse. } Clermont County possesses one of Ohio&apos;s most diverse and storied political atmospheres. Clermont traces its roots to when it was named for the Clermont region of France. It was reserved by the State of Virginia to reward its military veterans with land bounties. At its beginning, it included 23 Ohio counties and about 4.2 million acres of densely forested land. The first deed was issued on 20 February 1796. The county&apos;s Moscow area became the exiled home of French royalty during the early 1800s, including the exiled King of France Louis-Philippe in 1815, and Marquis de Lafayette in 1825. { Spate House of Moscow, Ohio. Retrieved 18 April 2012. http://www.forgottenoh.com/Counties/Clermont/spate.html } In 1844, Clermont became the site of the village of Utopia, a enclave for Puritan socialist dissidents who espoused the doctrines of François Marie Charles Fourier. { The Ohio Politics Almanac, Second Edition. Michael F. Curtin. Retrieved 18 April 2012. } Clermont County was the birthplace of Ohio&apos;s first Democratic governor of the 20th century in 1847, John Pattison of Milford. During the 1800s, antislavery sentiment remained strong. The county&apos;s progressive history created a climate of political independence. Despite recent Republican dominance at the local office level, Clermont has seen heavy union and non-partisan influence in its politics. Its growing suburbanization, as well as resurgent environmental conservationism, has contributed to this climate. As of March 2012, the Clermont County Commissioners are Republicans Bob Proud, Ed Humphrey, and David Uible. Previous commissioners include Republicans Mary Walker, who was forced to resign after using millions of public dollars to benefit her family business; Scott Croswell, the owner of Croswell Bus Company; and Archie Wilson, who resigned after illegal drug use and relations with a prostitute in northern Kentucky. The 2012 State Representative race for the 65th Ohio House district features Steve Myers of Milford, the Democratic nominee, and John Becker of Union Township, the Republican nominee. Myers is a lifelong resident of the district and professional recruiter who maintains an independent record. Becker, a private school treasurer originally from Kentucky, is a Ohio GOP central committeeman who defeated Liberty PAC-sponsored Michael Brem in the March primary. The 66th district, which spans southern Clermont County and all of Brown County, features a race between Democrat Ken McNeeley and Republican Doug Green. The county is represented in the State Senate by Tom Niehaus, who is term-limited. State Rep. Joe Uecker is the 2012 Republican nominee and faces no opposition. In Congress, Clermont is part of Ohio&apos;s 2nd congressional district and is represented by Jean Schmidt.
