[ http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/bubble-bobble-games Bubble Bobble Games mobygames.com 2009-10-04 ] The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons [ Bub(Bubblun) バブルン Baburun ] and [ Bob(Bobblun) ボブルン Boburun ], is an action-platform game in which players travel through one hundred different stages, blowing and bursting bubbles, avoiding enemies and collecting a variety of items. The game became very popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob&apos;s girlfriends from big wind-up toasters, among other enemies. It is also notable for being an early example of a game with multiple endings, which depended on the player&apos;s skill and discovering secrets. [ December 2011 ] [ Game mechanics ] In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob (a.k.a. Bubby and Bobby). The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games. The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player&apos;s spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected throughout the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000, and 4000 points, and so on) which results in more lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated. Enemies turn &quot; angry &quot;  – becoming pink-colored and moving faster  – if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen. However, this is a rare occurrence. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player&apos;s life is lost. Contact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life. The game&apos;s music was written by Japanese team Zuntata. Peter Clarke, Tim Follin and David Whittaker converted the music for the home computer ports (some versions feature the ending sequence track for the title screen music, such as on the Commodore Amiga version by David Whittaker). [ Ports ] [ section April 2010 ] The popularity of Bubble Bobble led Taito (or its licensees) to port to many home computer s and video game console s.
