[ http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0774113.html 1998 Academy Awards Info Please 2009-03-08 ] The film features reconstructions of the filming of Bride of Frankenstein, a movie Whale directed. The title comes from a line in Bride of Frankenstein, in which the character Dr. Pretorius toasts Dr. Frankenstein, &quot; To a new world of gods and monsters. &quot; [ Plot ] The story opens in the 1950s, after the Korean War. It has been more than a decade since James Whale ( Ian McKellen ), director of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, has retired. He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna ( Lynn Redgrave ), who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also tormenting a starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and a former Marine, Clayton Boone ( Brendan Fraser ) and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale&apos;s sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale&apos;s spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale&apos;s fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale&apos;s intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest. But Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such &quot; locker room &quot; discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret (Cornelia Hayes O&apos;Herlihy). There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with &quot; his Monsters &quot; : Boris Karloff ( Jack Betts ) and Elsa Lanchester ( Rosalind Ayres ) from &quot; ancient &quot; movie fame. This event exacerbates his depression. A sudden rain storm becomes an excuse to leave. Back at Whale&apos;s home, Boone needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Boone wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Boone one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Boone, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. Boone drops his towel to pose nude. Whale uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Boone. Boone becomes enraged and attacks Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Boone to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Boone refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she can&apos;t find Whale, prompting a search by Boone and Hanna. Boone finds Whale floating dead in the pool, as a distraught Hanna runs out clutching a suicide note. Boone and Hanna agree that Boone should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal. The film closes roughly a decade later as Boone and his young son ( Jesse James ) watch The Bride of Frankenstein on television. The son is skeptical of the claim that his father knew Whale. His dad produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, &quot; To Clayton. Friend? &quot; &quot; Friend? &quot;, being a plea from the original, misfit, Frankenstein&apos;s monster, and disclosing Whale&apos;s true intentions. [ Cast ] Ian McKellen as James Whale Brendan Fraser as Clayton Boone Lynn Redgrave as Hanna Matt McKenzie as Colin Clive David Dukes as David Lewis Lolita Davidovich as Betty Rosalind Ayres as Elsa Lanchester Jack Betts as Boris Karloff Cornelia Hayes O&apos;Herlihy as Princess Margaret Jesse James as Michael Boone [ Reception ] Gods and Monsters received overwhelmingly positive reviews with McKellen&apos;s and Redgrave&apos;s performances singled out for particular praise. Time Out called it &quot; not a complicated film, but warm and clever &quot;. { Time Out Retrieved 20 May 2010 } The film currently has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 74 metascore on Metacritic. [ Real life basis ] James Whale did have several men (and women) pose nude for him, and some of these are shown in the making-of featurette. Several of his paintings were bought by a collector and loaned to the studio for the making of this film. Whale did suffer from strokes towards the end of his life, which affected his mental abilities, and was found dead in his pool. [ James Whale  — Directing &quot; Horror &quot; With Style http://www.pictureshowman.com/articles_personalities_whale.cfm The Picture Showman 2009-03-07 ] There were rumours that this was a homicide, but the evidence only pointed at suicide. [ James Whale http://eric.b.olsen.tripod.com/whale.html Eric B Olsen 2009-03-07 ] It is a matter of speculation if Whale had any assistance in his suicide. Whale&apos;s household might have hired a male gardener, but what sort of relationship he had with his employer is in the realm of speculation. In the documentary included on the DVD and in interviews, novelist Christopher Bram explains that the character of Clayton Boone is completely fictitious.
