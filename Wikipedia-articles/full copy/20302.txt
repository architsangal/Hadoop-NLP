XC68020, a prototype of the 68020 The Motorola 68020 is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola, released in 1984. It is the successor to the Motorola 68010 and is succeeded by the Motorola 68030. A lower cost version was also made available, known as the 68EC020. In keeping with naming practices common to Motorola designs, the 68020 is usually referred to as the &apos;020, pronounced oh-two-oh or &apos;&apos;oh-twenty &quot;. [ Description ] Motorola 68020 The 68020 had 32-bit internal and external data and address buses, compared to the early models with 16-bit data and 23-bit address busses. Newer packaging methods allowed the &apos;020 to feature more external pins without the large size that the earlier dual in-line package method required. The 68EC020 lowered cost through a 24-bit address bus. The 68020 was produced at speeds ranging from 12  MHz to 33  MHz. [ Improvements over 68010 ] The 68020 added many improvements to the 68010 including a 32-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), external data bus and address bus, and new instructions and addressing modes. The 68020 (and 68030) had a proper three-stage pipeline. Though 68010 had a &quot; loop mode &quot;, which sped loops through what was effectively a tiny instruction cache, it had only two memory location and was thus little used. The 68020 replaced this with a proper instruction cache of 256 bytes, the first 68k series processor to feature true onboard cache memory. The previous 68000 and 68010 processors could only access word (16 bit) and longword (32 bit) data if it were word-aligned (located at an address that is evenly divisible by 2). The 68020 had no alignment restrictions on data access. However, unaligned longword accesses were often much slower than aligned accesses. [ Coprocessor support ] The 68020 has a coprocessor interface supporting up to eight coprocessors. The main CPU recognizes &quot; F-line &quot; instructions (with the four most significant opcode bits all one), and uses special bus cycles to interact with a coprocessor to execute these instructions. Two types of coprocessors were defined, the floating point unit ( MC68881 or MC68882 FPU) and the paged memory management unit ( MC68851 PMMU). Only one PMMU can be used with a CPU. In principle multiple FPUs could be used with a CPU, but it was not commonly done. The coprocessor interface is asynchronous, so it is possible to run the coprocessors at a different clock rate than the CPU. [ Multiprocessing features ] Multiprocessing support was implemented externally by the use of a RMC pin [ http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA245775 MC68020 Signal Description, Appendix A, page 84 2010-01-17 ] to indicate an indivisible read-modify-write cycle in progress. All other processors had to hold off memory accesses until the cycle was complete.

In a multiprocessor system, coprocessors could not be shared between CPUs. To avoid problems with returns from coprocessor, bus error, and address error exceptions, it was generally necessary in a multiprocessor system for all CPUs to be the same model, and for all FPUs to be the same model as well. [ Instruction set ] The new instructions included some minor improvements and extensions to the supervisor state, several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), some support for high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32×32→64 bits) and divide (64÷32→32 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations. While the 68000 had &apos;supervisor mode&apos;, it did not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements due to the single instruction &apos;MOVE from SR&apos; being unprivileged but sensitive. Under the 68010 and later, this was made privileged, to better support virtualization software. [ Addressing modes ] The new addressing modes added scaled indexing and another level of indirection to many of the pre-existing modes, and added quite a bit of flexibility to various indexing modes and operations. Though it was not intended, these new modes made the 68020 very suitable for page printing; most laser printers in the early &apos;90s had a 68EC020 at their core. The 68020 had a minimal 256 byte direct-mapped instruction cache, arranged as 64 four-byte entries. Although small, it still made a significant difference in the performance of many applications. The resulting decrease in bus traffic was particularly important in systems relying heavily on DMA. bottom view of a Motorola XC68020 [ Usage ] The 68020 was used in the Apple Macintosh II and Macintosh LC personal computer s, as well as Sun 3 workstations and the Hewlett Packard 8711 Series Network Analyzers, and the Alpha Microsystems AM-2000. It is also the processor used on board TGV trains to decode signalling information which is sent to the trains through the rails. It is further being used in the flight control systems of the Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft. For more information on the instructions and architecture see Motorola 68000. [ Variant ] Motorola MC68EC020. The 68EC020 is a microprocessor from Motorola. It is a lower cost version of the Motorola 68020. The main difference between the two is that the 68EC020 only has a 24-bit address bus, rather than the 32-bit address bus of the full 68020, and thus is only able to address 16 MB of RAM. The Commodore Amiga 1200 computer and the Amiga CD32 games console used the cost-reduced 68EC020; the Namco System 22 arcade board has also used this processor. It also found use in laser printers. Apple used it in the QMS PS 410 and the LaserWriter II-NTX. Kodak used it in the Ektaplus 7016PS, and Dataproducts used it in the LZR 1260.
