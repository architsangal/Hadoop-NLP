Hematology includes the study of etiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of blood diseases. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist. Hematologists physicians also very frequently do further study in oncology - the medical treatment of cancer. Blood diseases affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, the mechanism of coagulation, etc. Physicians specialized in hematology are known as hematologists. Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with hematological diseases, although some may also work at the hematology laboratory viewing blood film s and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various hematological test results. In some institutions, hematologists also manage the hematology laboratory. Physicians who work in hematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of hematological diseases, referred to as hematopathologists. Hematologists and hematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed. Hematology is a distinct subspecialty of internal medicine, separate from but overlapping with the subspecialty of medical oncology. Hematologists may specialize further or have special interests, for example in: treating bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura treating hematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia treating hemoglobinopathies in the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank in bone marrow and stem cell transplantation [ Hematology as basic medical science ] Venous blood Venipuncture Hematopoiesis Blood tests Cord blood { Red blood cell s } Erythropoiesis Erythropoietin Iron metabolism Hemoglobin Glycolysis Pentose phosphate pathway { White blood cell s } { Platelet s } { Reticuloendothelial system } Bone marrow Spleen Liver { Lymphatic system } { Blood transfusion } Blood plasma Blood bank Blood donor s Blood groups { Hemostasis } Coagulation Vitamin K { Complement system } Immunoglobulins (abnormality of the hemoglobin molecule or of the rate of hemoglobin synthesis) Anemia s (lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin) Hematological malignancies Coagulopathies (disorders of bleeding and coagulation )...
