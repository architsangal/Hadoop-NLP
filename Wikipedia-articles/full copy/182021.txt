Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem&apos;s discovery by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself. The lyrical content, written from the perspective of the rapper&apos;s alter ego Slim Shady, is noted for its over-the-top depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.

[ Background ] Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album Infinite, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent label Web Entertainment. [ Bozza 2003 15 ] Early in his career, Eminem collaborated with fellow Detroit MC Royce da 5&apos;9 &quot; under the stage name Bad Meets Evil. [ Anziri Jon Royce da 5&apos;9 – Biography AllMusic Rovi Corporation 2002 2008-01-30 ] Infinite achieved little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: &quot; After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, &apos;You&apos;re a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don&apos;t you go into rock &amp; roll?&apos; All that type of shit started pissing me off. &quot; After the release of Infinite, Eminem&apos;s personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. [ Erlewine Stephen Thomas Eminem – Biography http://allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography AllMusic Rovi Corporation November 29, 2011 ] The disappointment of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: &quot; Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it &quot;. Slim Shady served as Eminem&apos;s vent for his frustrations. In the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play The Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of The Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Lovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, &quot; In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, &apos;Find him. Now.&apos; &quot; Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on his major label debut album. [ Recording ] Eminem had idolized &apos;&apos;The Slim Shady LP&apos;&apos; co-producer Dr. Dre (pictured in 2008) since he was a child. The Slim Shady LP was recorded at Studio 8 at 480 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan.

I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre. &quot; { Bozza, 2003. p. 24 } Much of the album was recorded when Eminem was under the influence of ecstasy; Dr. Dre described the experience by saying &quot; We get in there, get bugged out, stay in the studio for fuckin&apos; two days. Then you&apos;re dead for three days. Then you wake up, pop the tape in, like, &apos;Let me see what I&apos;ve done.&apos; &quot; On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished &quot; My Name Is &quot; in an hour. Three other songs, including &quot; Role Model &quot;, were also recorded that day. &quot; &apos;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde &quot;, which was formerly featured on The Slim Shady EP as &quot; Just the Two of Us &quot;, was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie&apos;s vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend&apos;s body, Eminem was uncomfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s. He explained, &quot; When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song, and she bugged the fuck out. &quot; &quot; Ken Kaniff &quot;, a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem&apos;s breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. { Bozza, 2003. p. 43 } [ Music ] [ Lyrics ] Many of the songs from The Slim Shady LP are written from the perspective of Eminem&apos;s alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as &quot; made-up tales of trailer-park stuff &quot;. [ Bite me Verrico Lisa The Times News Corporation May 20, 2000 ] The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: &quot; Why can&apos;t people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren&apos;t on a screen. &quot; [ http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/entertainment/ca-29770 Has He No Shame? Hilburn Robert The Los Angeles Times Tribune Company May 14, 2000 March 11, 2012 ] Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. [ Cover story: Emma Brockes meets Eminem Brockes Emma November 12, 1999 The Guardian Guardian Media Group ] Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, &quot; I have a fairly salty relationship with women...But most of the time, when I&apos;m saying shit about women, when I&apos;m saying `bitches&apos; and `hoes&apos;, its so ridiculous that I&apos;m taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don&apos;t hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.&apos; &quot; Despite the record&apos;s explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word &quot; nigger &quot; on the album, with the rapper noting, &quot; It&apos;s not in my vocabulary. &quot; The Slim Shady LP begins with a &quot; Public Service Announcement &quot; introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album&apos;s explicit lyrical content.

The song focuses on a character who is faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the &quot; angel &quot; and &quot; devil &quot; sides of the character&apos;s conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon&apos;s Animal House, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in &quot; Guilty Conscience &quot;, the outcome is unclear. On &quot; My Fault &quot;, Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. { Bozza, 2003. p. 49 } &quot; &apos;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde &quot; features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife&apos;s corpse. It is a epilogue to the song &quot; Kim &quot;, although &quot; &apos;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde &quot; was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that his girlfriend was keeping him from seeing his daughter. A skit called &quot; Paul &quot; features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to eminem telling him to tone down his lyrics, for he has so much to explain. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that &quot; There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it&apos;s not because of what it describes, it&apos;s how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words. &quot; On the song &quot; Brain Damage &quot;, Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school. [ http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451396/alleged-bully-sues-eminem-1-million.jhtml Alleged Bully From Eminem&apos;s &apos;Brain Damage&apos; Files $1 Million Suit Wiederhorn Jon December 10, 2001 February 16, 2012 MTV News Viacom ] Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem&apos;s frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as &quot; probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks. &quot; [ http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105 Eminem Blows Up Bozza Anthony November 5, 2009 February 16, 2012 Rolling Stone Jann Wenner ] Eminem was inspired to write &quot; Rock Bottom &quot; after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter&apos;s birthday. [ Clean Version ] The clean version is not completely censored, because words like &quot; ass &quot;, &quot; shit &quot;, and &quot; bitch &quot; are not censored. Also, because profanity is censored through backmasking, some of it is understandable. Only words like &quot; fuck &quot;, &quot; slut &quot;, &quot; kill &quot;, &quot; asshole &quot;, &quot; drugs &quot;, names of some drugs, and sometimes &quot; bitch &quot; are censored. &quot; My Name Is &quot; has its lyrics completely edited due to containing so much depiction of violence and inappropriate lyrics. [ Production ] The album&apos;s production was handled primarily by Dr. Dre, Eminem, and the Bass Brothers.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper&apos;s &quot; expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination &quot;, adding that &quot; Years later, as the shock has faded, it&apos;s those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they&apos;re what make The Slim Shady LP one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music. &quot; David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album&apos;s &quot; unapologetic outrageousness &quot; as a reaction to the &quot; soul positivity &quot; of conscious hip hop, noting that &quot; The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes...Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch. &quot; [ http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C274722%2C00.html Review - The Slim Shady LP Browne David March 12, 1999 February 16, 2012 Entertainment Weekly Time Warner ] Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that &quot; He isn&apos;t afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it&apos;s a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time &quot; but lamented the &quot; sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem&apos;s verbal mayhem. &quot; Many reviewers commented on the album&apos;s lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, &quot; Eminem&apos;s music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn&apos;t help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away. &quot; [ Rodman Gilbert And Other Four Letter Words: Eminem And The Cultural Politics Of Authenticity Popular Communications 2006 100 ] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record&apos;s comedic nature, writing &quot; Simply put: Eminem will crack you up &quot;, but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that &quot; the wife-killing jokes of &quot; 97 Bonnie and Clyde&apos; aren&apos;t any funnier than Garth Brooks &apos;, and &apos;My Fault&apos; belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record. &quot; Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is &quot; sophomoric and uninspired &quot; at times, Eminem&apos;s &quot; surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that&apos;s despairingly low on new ideas. &quot; [ http://www.avclub.com/articles/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp%2C20723/ Eminem: The Slim Shady LP - Review Rabin Nathan The A.V.

Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a &quot; lawsuit queen &quot;, and alleging that &quot; That&apos;s how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don&apos;t remember her working a day in her life. &quot; She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed. In December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor who lives in Roseville, Michigan and is the subject of the song &quot; Brain Damage &quot; in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey&apos;s attorney stated &quot; Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a &apos;pretender&apos; in the industry...Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism. &quot; In 1982, Eminem&apos;s mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior.
