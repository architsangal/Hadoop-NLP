Soon after meeting Kate, Dexter is fired by Ron. After being rejected for a role in a new Steven Berkoff play for &quot; lacking anger &quot;, Dexter wins the title role in a new Royal Shakespeare Company musical based on The Elephant Man.

On the new musical&apos;s opening night, Kate puts together evidence of the affair from a few subtle clues, and leaves Dexter without further ado.

With Ron&apos;s involuntary help (Dexter ties him up in his dressing room and steals his car), Dexter presents his case to Kate in a busy hospital ward. Kate agrees to give him another chance.

It also identified several tropes from The Tall Guy that would be utilized in his subsequent romantic comedies, ( Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually ): romantic lightning strikes that &quot; Curtis seems to believe in as much as any figure in history apart from Cupid &quot;; the &quot; willingness to sacrifice realism to a gag &quot; (e.g. turning cartwheels in front of a giant moon to show that Dexter is in love); the &quot; wacky but wise &quot; flatmate; the use of eccentric obscenities (e.g. Ron&apos;s question &quot; What in the name of Judas Iscariot&apos;s bumboy is going on? &quot; ). [ Soundtrack ] The score is by Peter Brewis. The soundtrack also includes Labi Siffre &apos;s &quot; It Must Be Love &quot;, performed by Madness. The film features a montage in which various characters sing along to this song, and which includes a cameo by Madness frontman Suggs.
