[ This article is about the Greek mythological character; for the plant see Daphne (plant); other uses see Daphne (disambiguation) ] { Apollo and Daphne transformed in laurel (France, 15th century). } { Apollo and Daphne&apos;&apos; by } { Antonio del Pollaiolo, c.  1470–80 ( } { National Gallery, London ) } { Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, c.  1744–45 ( } { Louvre ). } In Greek Mythology, Daphne ( [ icon ˈ d æ f n iː ]; [ Δάφνη ], meaning &quot; laurel &quot; ) was a female minor nature deity. Pursued by Apollo, she fled and was chased. Daphne begged the gods for help, who then transformed her into the laurel. [ Overview ] According to Greek myth, Apollo chased the nymph Daphne, daughter either of Peneus and Creusa in Thessaly, { Hyginus Fabulae 203. } or of the river Ladon in Arcadia. { Pausanias viii.20.1 and x.7.8; Statius, Thebaid iv.289f; } { Johannes Tzetzes Ad Lycophron 6; } { Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana i. 16; } { First Vatican Mythographer ii.216; none of these citations are earlier than Parthenius&apos; source Phylarchus. } The pursuit of a local nymph by an Olympian god, part of the archaic adjustment of religious cult in Greece, was given an arch anecdotal turn in Ovid &apos;s Metamorphoses, { Ovid, } { Metamorphoses i. 452; the treatment is commonly viewed as an Ovidian invention: see H. Fränkel, Ovid: A Poet Between Two Worlds (1945) p 79, or E. Doblhofer, &quot; &quot; Ovidius Urbanus: eine Studie zum Humor in Ovids Metamorphosen &quot; Philologus 104 (1960), p. 79ff; for the episode as a witty transposition of } { Calvus &apos; Io, see B. Otis, Ovid as an Epic Poet 2nd ed. 1970, p. 102 } where the god&apos;s infatuation was caused by an arrow from Eros, who wanted to make Apollo pay for making fun of his archery skills and to demonstrate the power of love&apos;s arrow. Ovid treats the encounter, Apollo&apos;s lapse of majesty, in the mode of elegiac lovers, { W.S.M. Nicoll, &quot; Cupid, Apollo, and Daphne (Ovid, Met. 1. 452 ff.) &quot; The Classical Quarterly, New Series, 30.1 (1980; 174–182). } and expands the pursuit into a series of speeches. According to the rendering Daphne prays for help either to the river god Peneus or to Gaia, and is transformed into a laurel ( Laurus nobilis ): &quot; a heavy numbness seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breasts, her hair turned into leaves, her arms into branches, her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast in slow-growing roots, her face was lost in the canopy. Only her shining beauty was left. &quot; { Translation by } { A. S. Kline, 2000. } &quot; Why should she wish to escape? Because she is Artemis Daphnaia, the god&apos;s sister, &quot; observed the Freudian anthropologist Géza Róheim, { Róheim, Animism, Magic and the Divine King, (London 1930:308) } and Joseph Fontenrose concurs; { Fontenrose, The Delphic oracle: its responses and operations 1981:49. } boldly stating such a one-to-one identity doubtless oversimplifies the picture: &quot; the equation of Artemis and Daphne in the transformation myth itself clearly cannot work &quot;, observes Lightfoot. { lightfoot p. 474. } The laurel became sacred to Apollo, and crowned the victors at the Pythian Games. { Pausanias, x.7.8. } Most artistic impressions of the myth focus on the moment of transformation. A version of the attempt on Daphne&apos;s sworn virginity that has been less familiar since the Renaissance was narrated by the Hellenistic poet Parthenius, in his Erotica Pathemata, &quot; The Sorrows of Love &quot;. { J. L. Lightfoot, tr. Parthenius of Nicaea: the poetical fragments and the Erōtika pathēmata 1999,notes to XV, Περὶ Δάφνης pp 471ff. } Parthenius&apos; tale, based on the Hellenistic historian Phylarchus, was known to Pausanias, who recounted it in his Description of Greece (2nd century AD). { Pausanias viii.20.2. } In this, which is the earliest written account, Daphne is a mortal (person) girl fond of hunting and determined to remain a virgin; she is pursued by the lad Leucippos ( &quot; white stallion &quot; ), who assumes girl&apos;s outfits in order to join her band of huntresses. He is so successful in gaining her innocent affection, that Apollo is jealous and puts it into the girl&apos;s mind to stop to bathe in the river Ladon; there, as all strip naked, the ruse is revealed, as in the myth of Callisto, and the huntresses plunge their spears into Leucippos. At this moment Apollo&apos;s attention becomes engaged, and he begins his own pursuit; Parthenius&apos; modern editor remarks on the rather awkward transition, linking two narratives. { Lightfoot, p. 471. } A famous rendition of the subject is Gian Lorenzo Bernini &apos;s sculpture &apos;&apos;Apollo and Daphne&apos;&apos;. In music, the German composer Richard Strauss composed a one-act opera about the legend based on accounts by both Ovid and Euripides. [ Artemis Daphnaia ] Artemis Daphnaia, who had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi { G. Shipley, &quot; The Extent of Spartan Territory in the Late Classical and Hellenistic Periods &quot;, The Annual of the British School at Athens, 2000. } in Antiquity, on the slopes of Mount Cnacadion near the Spartan frontier, { Pausanias, 3.24.8 ( on-line text ); Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus, Historiae Deorum Gentilium, Basel, 1548, Syntagma 10, is noted in this connection in Benjamin Hederich, &apos;&apos;Gründliches mythologisches Lexikon&apos;&apos;, 1770 } had her own sacred laurel trees. { Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks, 1951:141 } [ Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros, Eretria ] At Eretria the identity of an excavated 7th and 6th century temple { Built over 8th century walls and apsidal building beneath the } { naos, all betokening a } { Geometric date for the sanctuary. } to Apollo Daphnephoros, &quot; Apollo, laurel-bearer &quot;, or &quot; carrying off Daphne &quot;, a &quot; place where the citizens are to take the oath &quot;, is identified in inscriptions. { Rufus B.
