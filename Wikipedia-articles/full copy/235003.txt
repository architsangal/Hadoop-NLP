In 1516 the settlement was destroyed by fire, and was immediately rebuilt. This was the starting point of the expeditions led by Juan de Grijalba and Hernán Cortés to the coasts of Mexico in 1518, and in 1538 by Hernando de Soto &apos;s expedition to Florida. The first cathedral was built in the city in 1528. From 1522 until 1589 Santiago was the capital of the Spanish colony of Cuba. The city was plundered by French forces in 1553, and by British forces under Christopher Myngs in 1662. The city experienced an influx of French immigrants in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many coming from Haiti after the Haitian slave revolt of 1791. This added to the city&apos;s eclectic cultural mix, already rich with Spanish and African culture. It was also the location where Spanish troops faced their main defeat at San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898, during the Spanish-American War. Spain later surrendered to the United States after the destruction of its Atlantic fleet just outside Santiago&apos;s harbor. { http://www.abmc.gov/memorials/memorials/sst.php } Cuban poet, writer, and national hero, José Martí, is buried in Cementerio Santa Efigenia. [ Role in the Cuban Revolution ] Santiago was also the home of the revolutionary hero, Frank País. On July 26, 1953, the Cuban Revolution began with an ill-prepared armed attack on the Moncada Barracks by a small contingent of rebels led by Fidel Castro. Shortly after this disastrous incident, País began talking with students and young working people informally, drawing around him what became an extremely effective urban revolutionary alliance. This developed into highly organized cells coordinating a large scale urban resistance that became instrumental in the success of the Cuban Revolution. [ Cannon Terrance 1981 http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm Frank País and the Underground Movement in the cities historyofcuba.com May 21, 2006 ] País&apos; group prepared carefully, accruing weapons, collecting money, collecting medical supplies. They published a cheap newsletter that reported news that criticized the government, attempting to counter Batista&apos;s censorship. [ Terrence Cannon 1981 http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm Who was Frank Pais? historyofcuba.com May 21, 2006 ] In the summer of 1955, País’ organization merged with Castro&apos;s July 26 Movement. País became the leader of the new organization in Oriente province. On January 1, 1959, Fidel Castro proclaimed the victory of the Cuban Revolution from a balcony on Santiago de Cuba&apos;s city hall.
