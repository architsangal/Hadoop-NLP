The term was coined during the English Reformation to denote a person whose loyalties were to the Pope, rather than to the Church of England. Over time, however, the term came to mean one who supported Papal authority over all Christians; it thus entered widespread use, especially among Anglican s and Presbyterian s. [ November 2011 ] The word, dating from 1534, derives (through Middle French ) from Latin papa, meaning &quot; Pope &quot;. { papist, Merriam Webster Online } The word was in common use until the mid-nineteenth century, as shown by its frequent appearance in Thomas Macaulay &apos;s History of England from the Accession of James II and in other historical or controversial works of that period. It also appeared frequently in the compound form &quot; Crypto-Papist &quot;. { Walter Walsh, The Secret History of the Oxford Movement (C.J. Thynnes, 1898), pp. 8 and 187 } { The American National Preacher, August 1851, Sermon DLIII, p. 190 } { Alexis Khomiakhov, a Russian } { lay theologian of the nineteenth century, wrote, &quot; All Protestants are Crypto-Papists &quot; ( Bradley Nassif, Stanley N. Gundry, James J. Stamoolis, Three views on Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelicalism, p. 20). } { King George III exclaiming &quot; what! what! bring in the Papists! &quot;. } { James Gillray, 1807. } The word is found in certain surviving statutes of the United Kingdom, for example in the English Bill of Rights of 1688 and the Scottish Claim of Right of 1689. Under the Act of Settlement of 1701, no one who professes &quot; the popish religion &quot; or marries &quot; a papist &quot; may succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom. Fears that Catholic secular leaders would be anti-Protestant arose during the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church in England during the reign of Henry VIII.A similar term, &quot; papalism &quot;, is sometimes used. { Dr J. J. Overbeck and His Scheme for the Re-establishment of the Orthodox Church in the West } Jonathan Swift (1667â€“1745), author of Gulliver&apos;s Travels, employed the term throughout in his satirical A Modest Proposal, in which he proposed selling Irish children to be eaten by wealthy English landlords. During the 1928 American presidential election, Democratic Party nominee Al Smith was accused of being a papist. He was the first Catholic to ever receive presidential nomination from a major party and this led to fears that, if he were elected, the United States would be ruled by the Vatican. { Michael O&apos;Brien, John F. Kennedy: A Biography, Thomas Dunne Books, 2005, p. 414. } So far, only once, with the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, has a Roman Catholic become President of the United States. Although the term is not as common today as in the past, some continue to use it. { Vladimir Moss, &apos;&apos;Letter to a Papist&apos;&apos; } { Ian Paisley, &apos;&apos;Papist Doctrine of Oaths&apos;&apos; } [ See also ] Anti-Catholicism Anti-clericalism Mackerel Snapper Popish Plot Romanism [ References ] Category:History of Roman Catholicism in Great Britain Category:Anti-Catholicism Category:Pejorative terms for people Category:Ethnic and religious slurs Category:Christian terms da:Papisme de:Papist es:Papismo fr:Papisme ia:Papista nl:Papisme no:Papist pl:Papizm pt:Papismo sq:Papist sv:Papism
