[ Dental click (plain) ǀ ʇ 177 448 Xsampa-barslash.png |\ t! dental click.ogg ] [ Voiced dental click ǀ̬ ʇ̬ ᶢǀ ᵈǀ ᶢʇ d! no ] [ Dental nasal click ǀ̃ ʇ̃ ᵑǀ ⁿǀ ᵑʇ n! no ] Dental clicks are a family of click consonant s found, as constituents of words, only in Africa and in the Damin ritual jargon of Australia. The tut-tut! (British spelling) or tsk! tsk! (American spelling) sound used to express disapproval or pity is a dental click, although it isn&apos;t a speech sound in that context. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is ⟨ [ ǀ ] ⟩, a pipe. Prior to 1989, ⟨ [ ʇ ] ⟩ was the IPA letter for the dental clicks. It is still occasionally used where the symbol ⟨ [ ǀ ] ⟩ would be confounded with other symbols, such as prosody marks, or simply because in many fonts the pipe is indistinguishable from an el or capital i. { John Wells, 2011. Vertical lines. Compare the pipe, ⟨ } [ ǀ ] { ⟩, with ⟨ } [ | ] { ⟩, ⟨ } [ l ] { ⟩, and ⟨ } [ I ] { ⟩ (unformatted ⟨ǀ⟩, ⟨|⟩, ⟨l⟩, ⟨I⟩). } Either letter may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks, and increasingly a diacritic is used instead. Common dental clicks are: [ ǀ ] [ ʇ ] [ ǀʰ ] [ ʇʰ ] [ ǀ̬ ] [ ʇ̬ ] [ ᶢǀ ] [ ᶢʇ ] [ ǀ̃ ] [ ʇ̃ ] [ ᵑǀ ] [ ᵑʇ ] [ ǀ̥̃ʰ ] [ ʇ̥̃ʰ ] [ ᵑ̊ǀʰ ] [ ᵑ̊ʇʰ ] [ ǀ̃ˀ ] [ ʇ̃ˀ ] [ ᵑǀˀ ] [ ᵑʇˀ ] IPA I IPA II Description ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ tenuis dental click ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ aspirated dental click ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ voiced dental click ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ dental nasal click ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ aspirated dental nasal click ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩ or ⟨ ⟩ glottalized dental nasal click The last is what is heard in the sound sample at right, as non-native speakers tend to glottalize clicks to avoid nasalizing them. In the orthographies of individual languages, the letters and digraphs for dental clicks may be based on either the pipe symbol of the IPA, ⟨ [ ǀ ] ⟩, or on the Latin ⟨c⟩ of Bantu convention. Nama and most Saan languages use the former; Naro, Sandawe, and Zulu use the latter. [ Features ] Features of dental clicks: The forward place of articulation is typically dental (or denti-alveolar ) and laminal, which means it is articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge or the upper teeth, but depending on the language may be interdental or even apical. The release is a noisy, affricate -like sound. [ Occurrence ] Dental clicks are common in Khoisan languages and the neighboring Nguni languages, such as Zulu and Xhosa. In the Nguni languages, the tenuis click is denoted by the letter c, the murmured click by gc, the aspirated click by ch, and the nasal click by nc. The prenasalized clicks are written ngc and nkc. The Cushitic language Dahalo has four clicks, all of them nasalized: [ [ᵑ̊ʇ, ᵑʇ, ᵑ̊ʇʷ, ᵑʇʷ] ]. Dental clicks may also be used used para-linguistically. For example, English speakers use a plain dental click, usually written tsk or tut (and often reduplicated tsk-tsk or tut-tut; these spellings often lead to spelling pronunciation s [ /tɪsk/ ] or [ /tʌt/ ] ), as an interjection to express commiseration, disapproval, irritation, or to call a small animal. German (ts or tss), Hungarian (cöccögés), Portuguese (tsc) and French (tut-tut) speakers use the dental click in exactly the same way as English. The dental click is also used para-linguistically Middle-East ern languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Pashto, and Persian where it is transcribed as &apos;نچ&apos;/&apos;noch&apos; (including Dari and Tajiki ). It is also used some languages spoken in regions closer to, or in, Europe, such as Greek, Bulgarian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian or Serbian to denote a negative response to a &quot; yes or no &quot; question. The dental click is sometimes accompanied by an upward motion of the head.
