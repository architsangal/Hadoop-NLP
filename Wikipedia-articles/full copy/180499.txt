United Kingdom ITV Studios ( Granada Television Manchester ) College Bowl University Challenge: The Professionals University Challenge India ] University Challenge is a British quiz programme that has aired since 1962. The format is based on the American show College Bowl, which ran on NBC radio from 1953 to 1957, and on NBC television from 1959 to 1970. Produced by Granada Television and filmed at Granada Studios in Manchester since its inception, University Challenge aired for 913 episodes on ITV from 1962 to 1987, presented by quiz master Bamber Gascoigne. The BBC revived the programme in 1994 under quiz master Jeremy Paxman, transmitting it on BBC Two. Series 41 began on 4 July 2011. [ History ] At its inception in 1962, University Challenge was hosted by Bamber Gascoigne. The show was a cult favourite with a small but loyal core audience, and was one of a select few ITV shows which was transmitted without any advertising breaks. This meant that the show was relegated to irregular timeslots by the various ITV regional companies, such as Sunday afternoons, weekday mornings, weekday afternoons and, in some regions, late at night. In the absence of a regular networked slot, audience figures would often fall, leading the producers to make changes to the long-standing format of the programme. For example, in the 1985 season, initial games were staged over two legs; the first in the classic format and the second played as a relay, where contestants selected questions from specific categories such as sport, literature and science, passing a baton between players whenever a &quot; lap &quot; of two correct answers was scored. This added complexity did little to halt declining viewer figures, and after ITV regions started to drop the programme altogether (the final season was not screened at all by LWT ) it was taken off the air in 1987. It was eventually revived in 1994 by the BBC, although still produced by Granada Television, using the original format with minor differences and presented by Jeremy Paxman. During the show&apos;s hiatus, a special edition of the show was made, not in fact by Granada but by BBC Television, as part of a themed evening of programmes dedicated to Granada Television. It was presented by Bamber Gascoigne, and screened on BBC2 on 28 December 1992. The teams included one made up of students from Keble College, Oxford, which had fielded the winning team from the final 1987 season; and a graduates team made up of celebrity alumni who had previously starred on the programme as students, including journalist John Simpson and actor Stephen Fry. This show was preceded by a short documentary about the show&apos;s history. Bamber Gascoigne&apos;s final appearance as host was in Universe Challenge in 1998 (see below). The original announcer was Don Murray-Henderson, who was with the programme until his death in 1971. Jim Pope took over and stayed with the programme until his death in 2001. Since then, the announcer has been voiceover and broadcaster Roger Tilling. The theme tune is called &quot; College Boy &quot; and was composed by Derek New. The original, jauntier version from the Bamber Gascoigne era is no longer used, and has been replaced by a version recorded by The Balanescu Quartet. [ Format ] An episode of &apos;&apos;University Challenge&apos;&apos; in 1994 The current tournament format used for each series is that of a direct knockout tournament starting with 28 teams. The 14 first-round winners progress directly to the last 16. Two matches, involving the four highest scoring losing teams from the first round, whose losing scores often exceed winning scores in other first-round matches, fill the remaining places in the last 16. The pairings for matches are often chosen in order to keep stronger teams apart. [ On University Challenge (Illustrated) http://lystellion.livejournal.com/84288.html Jacob Funnell 2009-07-15 ] {. } Teams consist of four members and represent either a single university or a college of the universities which teach under a collegiate system (as in the case of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Wales or London ) &quot; Starter &quot; questions are answered individually &quot; on the buzzer &quot; without conferring and are worth 10 points. &quot; Your starter for 10 &quot; became the programme&apos;s most famous catchphrase and inspired David Nicholls &apos; 2003 novel Starter for Ten and the 2006 film based on it starring James McAvoy. The team answering a starter correctly gets a set of three &quot; bonus &quot; questions worth a potential 15 points over which they can confer. Sets of bonus questions are thematically linked, although, apart from Picture and Music bonus questions, they rarely share a connection with the preceding starter question. Generally there are three separate bonus questions worth 5 points each, but occasionally a bonus will require the enumeration of a given list with 5, 10 or 15 points given for correctly giving a certain number of items from the list (e.g., &quot; there are seven fundamental SI units. Give 5 for 5 points, 6 for 10 points or all 7 for 15 points &quot; ). An incorrect interruption of a starter results in a 5-point penalty. It is the team captain&apos;s responsibility to give the answer to the bonus questions unless another member of the team is specified with the phrase &quot; Nominate [name] &quot;. The team member so named may then give the answer instead. In the course of a game there are two &quot; picture rounds &quot; (occurring roughly one quarter and three quarters of the way through) and one &quot; music round &quot; (at the halfway point), where the subsequent bonuses are connected thematically to the starter; if a picture or music starter is not correctly answered, the accompanying bonus questions are held back until a normal starter is correctly answered. The 2010 Manchester University team included a visually impaired student, and the picture rounds in episodes involving the team were word puzzle s for which she was provided with Braille transcriptions. [ http://www.southmanchesterreporter.co.uk/news/s/1191481_blind_rachaels_new_challenge Blind Rachael’s new Challenge Bentley Paul Kathryn Faulkner 4 February 2010 South Manchester Reporter 10 March 2010 ] Pieces of music played for the music round may be classical or popular - for example, on 25 July 2011, the pieces played were winners of the Eurovision Song Contest. The pace of questioning gradually increases through the show, becoming almost frantic in the last minute or so before the &quot; gong &quot; which signals the end of the game. At this point, the game immediately ends, even if Jeremy is halfway through asking a question. In the event of a tied score at the sound of the gong, a &quot; sudden death &quot; question is asked, the first team to answer correctly being deemed the winner; this is repeated until one or other of the teams answer correctly, or a team loses by giving an incorrect interruption. The ending of the programme is signified with Jeremy Paxman saying &quot; It&apos;s goodbye from (name of losing team, who wave and say goodbye), it&apos;s goodbye from (winning team, likewise), and it&apos;s goodbye from me: goodbye! &quot; While the starter questions are being read out, the teams are shown on screen one above the other by means of a split-screen effect. When a player buzzes in, the shot zooms in to that player, accompanied by a voiceover identifying the player by team and surname, for example &quot; Nottingham, Smith &quot;. The voiceovers are performed live in the studio by Roger Tilling and become noticeably more energetic towards the end of the programme. The 1985 season experimented with an actual two-tier set, which was discontinued the following season. [ Controversies ] [ Participation of individual Oxbridge colleges ] The fact that the universities of Oxford and Cambridge can each enter up to five of their colleges as separate teams despite these colleges not being universities in the conventional sense was the ostensible inspiration for an unusual 1975 protest, despite the fact that Oxbridge colleges have vastly smaller student bodies (numbering in the hundreds rather than tens-of-thousands) than entire universities. A team from the Victoria University of Manchester (which included David Aaronovitch ) who were appearing on the show answered every question &quot; Che Guevara &quot;, &quot; Marx &quot;, &quot; Trotsky &quot; or &quot; Lenin &quot;, possibly in the hope of making the resulting show unbroadcastable.

In 2003, the former was won by the 1979 team from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, the latter by a team from the Inland Revenue.
