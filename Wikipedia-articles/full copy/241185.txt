The World Council elects ICC’s highest officers, including the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, each of whom serves a two-year term. The Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the Honorary Chairman (the immediate past Chairman) provide the organization with high-level world leadership.They play an important role in ICC section. [ Executive Board ] Strategic direction for ICC is provided by its Executive Board, consisting of up to 30 business leaders and ex-officio members. It is elected by the World Council on the recommendation of the Chairmanship. Meeting three times a year, the Executive Board oversees the establishment of ICC’s strategic priorities and the implementation of its policies. [ International Secretariat ] The ICC International Secretariat, based in Paris, is the operational arm of ICC. It develops and carries out ICC’s work programme, feeding business views into intergovernmental organizations on issues that directly affect business operations. The International Secretariat is led by the Secretary General, who is appointed by the World Council. [ National Committees ] In 90 of the world’s nations, members have established formal ICC structures called national committees. In countries where there is no national committee, companies and organizations such as chambers of commerce and professional associations can become direct members. [ Finance Committee ] The Finance Committee advises the Executive Board on all financial matters. On behalf of the Executive Board, it prepares the budget and regularly reports to the board. It reviews the financial implications of ICC activities and supervises the flow of revenues and expenses of the organization. [ Dispute Resolution Services ] ICC International Court of Arbitration has received 15,000 cases since its inception in 1923. { ICC Booklet &quot; Rules of Arbitration and Rules for a Pre-Arbitral Referee Procedure &quot;, P. 7, France 2005 } Over the past decade, the Court&apos;s workload has considerably expanded. The Court&apos;s membership has also grown and now covers 86 countries. With representatives in North America, Latin and Central America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, the ICC Court has significantly increased its training activities on all continents and in all major languages used in international trade. ICC Dispute Resolution Services exist in many forms: Amicable dispute resolution offers a framework for the settlement of disputes with the assistance of a neutral. Parties choose the settlement technique, such as negotiation or a mini-trial. Dispute boards are independent bodies designed to help resolve disagreements arising during the course of a contract. Expertise is a way of finding the right person to make an independent assessment on any subject relevant to business operations. DOCDEX provides expert decisions to resolve disputes related to documentary credits, collections and demand guarantees, incorporating ICC banking rules. [ Policy and business practices ] ICC policies, rules and standards are prepared by specialized working bodies. Normal procedure requires policy statements first to be adopted by a commission, in consultation with national committees, and then approved by the Executive Board, before they can be regarded as official and public ICC positions. Commissions examine major policy issues of interest to world business. Each national committee (NC) or group may appoint delegates to represent it at meetings. Officers are appointed by the Chairman and Secretary General in consultation with NCs. Meetings of commissions are normally held twice a year. Task forces are constituted under the various commissions for a limited period to undertake specific projects and report back to their parent commission. Some task forces may include representatives of more than one commission. { http://www.iccwbo.org/policy/id3237/index.html ICC Policy and Rules } [ Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice ] In September, 2011, the International Chamber of Commerce introduced the newly revised consolidated ICC Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice, along with a dedicated website, www.codescentre.com, to guide advertising and marketing professionals around the globe.

Developed by experts from all sectors of industry and all regions of the world, the code’s purpose is to protect consumers by clearly setting out guidelines for responsible marketing. The Code is structured in two main sections—General Provisions and Chapters. The General Provisions section contains fundamental principles and other broad concepts that apply to all marketing in all media.

Governments and other actors are demanding a far greater voice in how these technologies are managed. Sharing experiences and pooling the expertise of governments, business and civil society is crucial to building understanding on these issues. Through the networks of ICC, BASIS ensures that business perspectives are taken into account. BASIS speaks out on a wide range of critical issues, including: Internet governance matters such as data protection, privacy, security, and the technical management and coordination of the Internet liberalization of the telecoms market entrepreneurship innovation ICTs as tools for development { http://www.iccwbo.org/basis/ BASIS } [ ICC Research Foundation ] The ICC Research Foundation (ICCRF) was established in 2009 by ICC to commission independent research that contributes to public knowledge, education and debate on the benefits of global trade and investment. The research projects funded by the ICCRF and conducted by leading international researchers and organizations, contribute to the following aims: Demonstrate how employment and growth flow from an expansion of international trade and investment Establish that a multilateral approach is particularly beneficial to that end Document how protectionism works against the public interest by eroding employment, sustainable growth and the market economy Promote a deeper understanding by policymakers, the media and the public at large of the benefits of global trade and investment { http://www.iccwbo.org/iccrf/id30984/index.html ICC Research Foundation } [ Funding ] [ Membership Subscriptions ] National committees pay an annual subscription to ICC&apos;s International Secretariat in Paris to meet the organization&apos;s administrative expenses. The rate is proportionate to the economic importance of the country they represent. National committees are financially independent of the central body and are free to establish the level of their own membership subscriptions. Direct members fall into two categories with their annual dues as follows: - 1500 EUR (approximately US$2250) per year for &apos;local&apos; members, i.e. local chambers of commerce, local companies, professional individuals; - 3000 EUR (approximately US$4500) per year for &apos;national&apos; members, i.e. national chambers of commerce, national trade associations, national business organizations, as well as companies with a predominant international activity, and occupying a leading position in the country. { What is the cost of ICC membership?, accessed Jan 27, 2011 on http://www.iccwbo.org/id19698/index.html } [ See also ] Islamabad Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry London Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry www.codescentre.com [ References ] [ External links ] [ http://www.iccwbo.org ] Category:International nongovernmental organizations Category:International trade Category:Chambers of commerce Category:Arbitration organizations ar:غرفة التجارة الدولية be:Міжнародная гандлёвая палата bg:Международна търговска палата cs:Mezinárodní obchodní komora de:Internationale Handelskammer es:Cámara de Comercio Internacional eo:Internacia Komerca Ĉambro fa:اتاق بازرگانی بین‌المللی fr:Chambre de commerce internationale ko:국제 상업 회의소 id:International Chamber of Commerce he:לשכת המסחר הבינלאומית ja:国際商業会議所 pl:Międzynarodowa Izba Handlowa pt:Câmara Internacional de Comércio ru:Международная торговая палата sk:Medzinárodná obchodná komora sv:International Chamber of Commerce tt:Халыкара сәүдә палатасы uk:Міжнародна торгова палата vi:Phòng Thương mại Quốc tế
