Substance P and its closely related neuropeptide neurokinin A (NKA) are produced from a polyprotein precursor after differential splicing of the preprotachykinin A gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of substance P is as follows { Campbell, Neil A, and Jane B Reece. Biology. 7th ed. San Francisco: Pearson Education, Inc., n.d.Print. } : Arg Pro Lys Pro Gln Gln Phe Phe Gly Leu Met Substance P is released from the terminals of specific sensory nerves, it is found in the brain and spinal cord, and is associated with inflammatory processes and pain. [ Discovery ] Substance P was originally discovered in 1931 by Ulf von Euler and John H. Gaddum as a tissue extract that caused intestinal contraction in vitro. [ V Euler US, Gaddum JH An unidentified depressor substance in certain tissue extracts The Journal of Physiology 72 1 74–87 1931 June 16994201 1403098 http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D16994201 ] Its tissue distribution and biologic actions were further investigated over the following decades. In 1983, NKA (previously known as substance K or neuromedin L) was isolated from porcine spinal cord and was also found to stimulate intestinal contraction.

Amino acid residues that are responsible for the binding of SP and its antagonists are present in the extracellular loops and transmembrane regions of NK-1. Binding of SP to NK-1 results in internalization by the clathrin -dependent mechanism to the acidified endosome s where the complex disassociates. SP is subsequently degraded and NK-1 is re-expressed on the cell surface.

Because these regions are related to complexed signal transduction pathways mediated by cytokines, it has been proposed that cytokines and neurotropic factors can induce NK-1. SP can also induce the cytokines that are capable of inducing NK-1 transcription factors.

The sensory function of substance P is thought to be related to the transmission of pain information into the central nervous system. Substance P coexists with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in primary afferents that respond to painful stimulation. Substance P has been associated with the regulation of mood disorders, anxiety, stress, [ Ebner K, Singewald N The role of substance P in stress and anxiety responses Amino Acids 31 3 251–72 2006 October 16820980 10.1007/s00726-006-0335-9 ] reinforcement, [ Huston JP, Hasenöhrl RU, Boix F, Gerhardt P, Schwarting RK Sequence-specific effects of neurokinin substance P on memory, reinforcement, and brain dopamine activity Psychopharmacology 112 2-3 147–62 1993 7532865 10.1007/BF02244906 ] neurogenesis, [ Park SW, Yan YP, Satriotomo I, Vemuganti R, Dempsey RJ Substance P is a promoter of adult neural progenitor cell proliferation under normal and ischemic conditions Journal of neurosurgery 107 3 593–9 2007 September 17886560 10.3171/JNS-07/09/0593 ] respiratory rhythm, [ Bonham AC Neurotransmitters in the CNS control of breathing Respiration physiology 101 3 219–30 1995 September 8606995 10.1016/0034-5687(95)00045-F ] neurotoxicity, nausea / emesis, [ Hesketh PJ Potential role of the NK1 receptor antagonists in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer 9 5 350–4 2001 July 11497388 10.1007/s005200000199 ] pain and nociception. [ Zubrzycka M, Janecka A Substance P: transmitter of nociception (Minireview) Endocrine regulations 34 4 195–201 2000 December 11137976 ] Substance P and other sensory neuropeptides can be released from the peripheral terminals of sensory nerve fibers in the skin, muscle and joints. It is proposed that this release is involved in neurogenic inflammation, which is a local inflammatory response to certain types of infection or injury. [ Donkin JJ, Turner RJ, Hassan I, Vink R Substance P in traumatic brain injury Progress in brain research 161 97–109 2007 17618972 10.1016/S0079-6123(06)61007-8 ] The regulatory function of SP also involves the regulation of its high-affinity receptor, NK-1. Substance P receptor antagonists may have important therapeutic applications in the treatment of a variety of stress-related illnesses, in addition to their potential as analgesics. [ Vomiting ] The vomiting center in the medulla contains high concentrations of substance P and its receptor, in addition to other neurotransmitters such as choline, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, and opioid s. Their activation stimulates the vomiting reflex. Different emetic pathways exist, and substance P/NK1R appears to be within the final common pathway to regulate vomiting. [ Hornby PJ Central neurocircuitry associated with emesis The American Journal of Medicine Suppl 8A 8 106S–112S 111 2001 December 11749934 10.1016/S0002-9343(01)00849-X ] Substance P antagonist (SPA) aprepitant is available in the market in the treatment of chemotherapy -induced nausea/emesis. [ Pain ] Substance P is involved in nociception, transmitting information about tissue damage from peripheral receptors to the central nervous system to be converted to the sensation of pain. It has been theorized that it plays a part in fibromyalgia. Capsaicin has been shown to reduce the levels of substance P, it is presumed, by reducing the number of C-fibre nerves or causing these nerves to be more tolerant. Thus, Capsaicin is clinically used as an analgesic and an inflammatory agent to reduce pain associated with arthritis and many types of neuralgia. A role of substance P and NKA in nociception is suggested by the reduction in response thresholds to noxious stimuli by central administration of K2 and K3 agonists. Based on recent studies, it was proposed that NK1, and possibly the NK2 receptor antagonist s, could be developed as analgesic drugs.It has been studied that the mice carrying a disruption of the gene encoding SP/NKA show severely reduced nociceptive pain responses when the stimuli are moderate to intense. Pain behaviors induced by mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimulation of somatic and visceral tissues were reduced in the mutant mice lacking SP/NKA. However, it has been proposed that the importance of SP and NKA in animal&apos;s pain response apply only to a certain &apos;window&apos; of pain intensities, and, when the intensity of the pain stimuli is further increased, the responses of the knockout mice is not severely different from the wild-type mice.

Substance P-induced vasodilatation is dependent on nitric oxide release.

It has been shown that vasodilatation to substance P is dependent on the NK1 receptor located on the endothelium. In contrast to other neuropeptides studied in human skin, substance P-induced vasodilatation has been found to decline during continuous infusion. This possibly suggest an internalization of neurokinin-1 (NK1).

This, ultimately, leads to a condition known as Denervation Supersensitivity as the post-synaptic nerves will become hypersensitive to any invasion of substance P into the synaptic cleft. [ Deficiency ] Naked mole rat s lack cutaneous C fibers reactive to substance P (SP) and many small neurons that are normally SP-positive.
