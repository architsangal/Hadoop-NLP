[ April 2012 ] [ yes 1788 ] [ yes 1856 ] Sir William Henry Sleeman (8 August 1788 – 10 February 1856) was a British soldier and administrator in British India. A great admirer of India&apos;s rich natural beauty, he was born in Stratton, Cornwall, the son of Philip Sleeman, a yeoman and supervisor of excise of St Tudy. { Genealogy of the Sleeman family } In 1809 William joined the Bengal Army, served in the Nepal War (1814–1816), and in 1820 became assistant to the Governor-General &apos;s agent in the Saugor and Nerbudda territories. He is best known for his suppression of the Thuggee secret society. He had captured &quot; Feringhea &quot; (also called Syeed Amir Ali, on whom the novel Confessions of a Thug is based) and got him to turn King&apos;s evidence. He took Sleeman to a grave with a hundred bodies, told the circumstances of the killings, and named the Thugs who had done it.

During these operations, more than 1400 Thugs were hanged or transported for life. One of them, Bahram, confessed to have strangled 931 persons with his turban. Detection was only possible by means of informers, for whose protection from the vengeance of their associates a special prison was established at Jabalpur (at the time Jubbulpore). Sleeman had a Government Report made in 1889. Sleeman was also the earliest discoverer of dinosaur fossil s in Asia. In 1828, serving as a Captain in the Narmada valley region, he noticed several basalt ic formations which he identified as having been &quot; raised above the waters &quot;. By digging around in the Bara Simla Hills, part of the Lameta formation near Jabalpur, he unearthed several petrified trees, as well as some fragmentary dinosaur fossil specimens. { William Sleeman, from Rambles and Recollections of an Indian official,, p. 127 (pdf) } Subsequently he sent these specimens to London [ Sahni, Ashok Dinosaurs of India National Book Trust, New Delhi 2001 81-237-3109-4 ] and to the Indian Museum in Calcutta. { Background } In 1877 the genus was named Titanosaurus Indicus by Richard Lydekker, { http://www.dinodata.org/index2.php?option=com_content &amp; do_pdf=1 &amp; id=7639 } but the identification has been doubted. Sleeman also took an interest in phrenology and believed that the measurements of the skulls could help him identify criminal ethnic groups.

He was opposed to the annexation of Oudh by Lord Dalhousie, but his advice was disregarded. He died at sea near Sri Lanka on a recovery trip to Britain in 1856. The village Sleemanabad in Madhya Pradesh, India was named in his honour. { Dash, Mike Thug: the true story of India&apos;s murderous cult ISBN 1-86207-604-9, 2005, page ? } [ References ] [ External links ] [ Sleeman+William William Henry Sleeman ] Sleeman, H.
