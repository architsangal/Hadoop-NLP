[ Views ] [ The Soviet Union ] According to the KPU, the millions of deaths and destruction of the 1917 revolution and the world wars affected the development of socialism in the Soviet Union and the massive allocation of resources to the defense/military sector held back the development of consumerist goods, compared to the advanced capitalist west, and the inability to handle these issues resulted in the final collapse of the USSR. The party also criticizes the Soviet degradation of Leninist norms and party principles - democratic centralism and collective leadership. This ultimately led to the party being infected with careerist, proponents of bourgeois ideology and morals, the degeneration of leading cadres, their separation from the workers, and most of all, the distortion of the principles of socialism. The party overall stands positive towards the former Soviet Union and the highlights the rapid development of Ukrainian culture, science and welfare during its existence. {, additional text. } [ Party&apos;s electoral results ] At the parliamentary elections on 29 March 1998, the party gained 24.65% of the vote and 123 seats, becoming the largest party in Parliament.
