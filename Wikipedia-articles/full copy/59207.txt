He was the third and last Bishop of Rome of Berber origin [ February 2012 ] in the Catholic Church. Gelasius was a prolific writer whose style placed him on the cusp between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. { The title of his biography by Walter Ullmann expresses this:Gelasius I. (492–496): Das Papsttum an der Wende der Spätantike zum Mittelalter (Stuttgart) 1981. } Gelasius had been closely employed by his predecessor Felix III, especially in drafting papal documents. His reign was characterized by a call for strict orthodoxy, a more assertive push for papal authority, and increasing tension between the churches in the West and the East. [ Struggle with Anastasius I and Acacius ] Gelasius&apos; election on 1 March 492 was a gesture for continuity: Gelasius inherited Felix&apos;s struggles with Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius I and the patriarch of Constantinople and exacerbated them by insisting on the removal of the name of the late Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, from the diptych s, in spite of every ecumenical gesture by the current, otherwise quite orthodox patriarch Euphemius (q.v. for details of the Acacian schism ). The split with the emperor and the patriarch of Constantinople was inevitable, from the western point of view, because they had embraced a view of a single, Divine ( &quot; Monophysite &quot; ) nature of Christ, which was a Christian heresy. Gelasius&apos; book De duabus in Christo naturis ( &quot; On the dual nature of Christ &quot; ) delineated the Western view. Thus Gelasius, for all the conservative Latinity of his writing style, stood on the cusp of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. [ Powers of Church and State ] During the Acacian schism, Gelasius affirmed the primacy of Rome over the entire Church, East and West, and he presented this doctrine in terms that set the model for subsequent popes asserting the claims of papal supremacy, due to the succession of the Roman Popes from the Apostle Peter. In 494, Gelasius wrote a very influential letter, known as Duo sunt, to Anastasius on the topic of Church-State relations, whose political impact was felt for almost a millennium. { Medieval Sourcebook: Gelasius I on Spiritual and Temporal Power } [ Suppression of pagan rites and heretics ] Closer to home, Gelasius finally suppressed the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia after a long contest. Gelasius&apos; letter to Andromachus, the senator, covers the main lines of the controversy and incidentally offers some details of this festival combining fertility and purification that might have been lost otherwise. Significantly, this festival of purification, which had given its name— dies februatus, from februare, &quot; to purify &quot; — to the month of February, was replaced with a Christian festival celebrating the purification of the Virgin Mary instead: Candlemas, observed forty days after Christmas, on 2 February. [ Death ] After a brief but dynamic reign, his death occurred on 21 November 496. [ Writings ] Gelasius was the most prolific writer of the early Roman bishops. A great mass of correspondence of Gelasius has survived: forty-two letters according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, thirty-seven according to Father Bagan { Rev. Philip V. Bagan, The Syntax of the Letters of Pope Gelasius I (Catholic University Press) 1945. } and fragments of forty-nine others, carefully archived in the Vatican, expounding to Eastern bishops the primacy of the see of Rome. There are extant besides six treatises that carry the name of Gelasius. According to Cassiodorus, the reputation of Gelasius attracted to his name other works not by him. [ Decretum Gelasianum ] The most famous of pseudo-Gelasian works is the list de libris recipiendis et non recipiendis ( &quot; books to be received and not to be received &quot; ), the so-called Decretum Gelasianum, which is believed to be connected to the pressures for orthodoxy during his pontificate and intended to be read as a decretal by Gelasius on the canonical and apocryphal books, which internal evidence reveals to be of later date. Thus the fixing of the canon of scripture has traditionally been attributed to Gelasius, { F.C.Burkitt, Review of The decretum Gelasianum &quot;, &apos;&apos;Journal of Theological Studies&apos;&apos;, 14 (1913) pp. 469–471 (Online copy at Tertullian.com) } and a non-historical Roman synod of 494 has been invented as the supposed occasion. [ The &quot; Gelasian Sacramentary &quot; ] [ Gelasian Sacramentary ] In the Catholic tradition, the so-called &quot; Gelasian Sacramentary &quot;, actually the Liber sacramentorum Romanae ecclesiae ( &quot; Book of Sacraments of the Church of Rome &quot; ) is a book of liturgy that was actually composed in Merovingian times. An old tradition linked the book to Pope Gelasius, apparently based on Walafrid Strabo &apos;s ascription to him of what is evidently this book. Most of its liturgy reflects the mix of Roman and Gallican practice inherited from the Merovingian church.
