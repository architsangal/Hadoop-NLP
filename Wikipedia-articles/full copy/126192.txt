[ conservatism as a political and social philosophy Conservatism (disambiguation) ] [ January 2011 ] [ February 2011 ] &apos;One nation&apos;, &apos;one nation conservatism&apos;, and &apos;Tory democracy&apos; are terms used in political debate in the United Kingdom to refer to a certain wing of the Conservative Party that identifies ideologically with liberal conservatism. The term denotes a political stance aspiring towards unity of the citizenry in the nation, as well as harmony between divergent classes and interest groups, as opposed to the social polarisation seen in both militant socialism and Thatcherism. The term derives indirectly from one of Benjamin Disraeli &apos;s political novels, Sybil, or the Two Nations, in which he described Britain as &quot; Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other&apos;s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets: the rich and the poor. &quot; Lord Randolph Churchill would also use the term &quot; Tory democracy &quot; in this Disraelian sense in the late-Victorian era. British prime ministers Stanley Baldwin, Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath, as well as leading politicians such as Rab Butler, were leading figures of One nation conservatism. [ One nation conservatives and Thatcher ] One nation conservatism fell into disfavour in the mid 1970s. The rising generation of Conservative politicians, represented by such figures as Margaret Thatcher, Sir Keith Joseph, and John Nott, felt that the old model of one nation Tory paternalism, as practised by Macmillan and Heath, had, by 1979, failed. Its political failure had been evident in the Conservatives losing four out of the past five general elections, and its socio-economic failure was manifest in the relatively high levels of unemployment and inflation of the UK of the 1970s. The new breed (referred to as the &quot; dries &quot;, as opposed to the one nation &quot; wets &quot; ) believed that one nation conservatism had been mistaken in not challenging the post-war consensus and that a radical new approach to governing was necessary if the United Kingdom was to ever break out of the pattern of decline that had come to a head in the Winter of Discontent of 1978 and early 1979. However, whilst inflation came under control during the Thatcher years, although it was higher in 1990 than in 1979, unemployment reached as high as 3.6 million. Unsurprisingly, one nation conservatives (such as Ted Heath ) were often the most vocal critics of Thatcher&apos;s policies within the Conservative Party. [ Possible modern revival ] [ February 2011 ] Since their electoral defeat in 1997 some Conservatives have tried to reclaim the &quot; one nation &quot; ideal for their party: ground which many believe to be now occupied by the New Labour agenda. [ February 2007 ] In his 2000 Macmillan Lecture, the Conservative front-bencher Damian Green MP asked &quot; Who Needs One Nation Conservatism? &quot;. He answered: &quot; My answer to the question posed tonight, &apos;Who needs One Nation Conservatism?&apos; is first the Conservative Party, and secondly the British people. &quot; Elsewhere the Conservative Party&apos;s former leader William Hague said, &apos;The Conservative Party I feel at home in is the party of One Nation reflecting the whole nation&apos;. &quot; [ http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/lanc01_.html Review of Mind the Gap London Review of Books 2004-10-21 2010-05-11 ] Ferdinand Mount &apos;s 2004 book Mind the Gap offers a clear articulation of the modern British one nation conservative viewpoint. Upon his election in 2005, Tory leader David Cameron declared the &quot; Nine Principles &quot; of the Conservative Way Forward group to be the basis of the party&apos;s policy formation. Additionally, in 2009, Cameron wrote for the Tory Reform Group &apos;s journal, Reformer, saying that &quot; the TRG has contributed greatly to the Conservative Party over the last 30 years and is central to where we need to be in the future. &quot; [ http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2009/02/riseoftheredtories/ Rise of the red Tories Prospect magazine 2009-02-28 2010-05-11 ] [ John Harris http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2009/aug/08/phillip-blond-conservatives-david-cameron Phillip Blond: The man who wrote Cameron&apos;s mood music 2009-08-08 The Guardian 2010-05-11 ] Phillip Blond, advocate of communitarian conservatism (outlined in his &quot; Rise of the red Tories &quot; article ), is said to have Mr Cameron&apos;s ear. [ July 2011 ] Despite his Thatcherite and traditional conservative stance, Iain Duncan-Smith &apos;s work with the Centre for Social Justice has been cited by some academics as the best example of British Tory Democracy&apos;s revival. In the Conservative manifesto for the 2010 general election, &quot; One World Conservatism &quot; was promoted, in support of an increase of Britain&apos;s foreign aid to poor countries. Invitation to Join the Government of Britain, Conservative Manifesto 2010 After the 2010 election returning a &apos;hung&apos; result, Kenneth Clarke (as Lord Chancellor) and Sir George Young (as Leader of the House)—president and a patron of the Tory Reform Group respectively—were part of Cameron&apos;s first Cabinet. They were joined by Iain Duncan-Smith —an ardent Eurosceptic and Thatcherite —found himself taking up the position of Pensions Secretary in the new coalition government ( David Davis however did not). Damian Green —another prominent TRG member—joined them in moving over to the government front benches, becoming Immigration Minister; a position he had shadowed in opposition since 2005. [ Canada ] Canada &apos;s first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, was heavily influenced by the ideals of the &apos;one nation&apos; movement. Gad Horowitz would trace the ideological development in Canada, and would coin the term Red Tory to describe it. Canadian philosopher George Grant stated that, &quot; One cannot understand the Conservatism of Canada without thinking of Disraeli. &quot; &quot; One nation &quot; was also used in the Progressive Conservative Party in opposition to the proposed deux nations policy.
