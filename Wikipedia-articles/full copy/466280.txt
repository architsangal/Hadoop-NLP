This is a list of metropolitan counties, non-metropolitan counties and unitary authorities of England by population. It includes those non-metropolitan counties (also known as shire counties ) with a two-tier county council structure, metropolitan counties and unitary authorities. In cases where a unitary authority has been detached from a county, the population of the unitary authority is shown separately. For example, Peterborough is shown separately from the population figure for Cambridgeshire. Figures are mid-year estimates for 2010 from the Office for National Statistics.
