[ History ] Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the founder of the Guadalajara Cartel was arrested in 1989. While incarcerated, he remained one of Mexico&apos;s major traffickers, maintaining his organization via mobile phone until he was transferred to a new maximum security prison in the 1990s. At that point, his old organization broke up into two factions: the Tijuana Cartel led by his nephews, the Arellano Félix brothers, and the Sinaloa Cartel, run by former lieutenants Héctor Luis Palma Salazar and Joaquín Guzmán Loera, a.k.a. El Chapo. Currently, the majority of Mexico&apos;s smuggling routes are controlled by three key cartels: Gulf, Sinaloa and Tijuana —though Tijuana is the least powerful. The Tijuana cartel was further weakened in August 2006 when its chief, Javier Arellano Félix, was arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard on a boat off the coast of Baja California. Mexican army troops also were sent to Tijuana in January 2007 in an operation to restore order to the border city and root out corrupt police officers, who mostly were cooperating with the Tijuana cartel. As a result of these efforts, the Tijuana cartel is unable to project much power outside of its base in Tijuana. [ Fred Burton Mexico: The Price of Peace in the Cartel Wars May 2, 2007 The Stratfor Global Intelligence http://www.stratfor.com/mexico_price_peace_cartel_wars 2009-08-16 ] Much of the violence that emerged in 2008 in Tijuana was a result of conflicts within the Tijuana cartel; on one side, the faction led by Teodoro García Simental (a.k.a. El Teo) favored kidnappings. The other faction, led by Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano (a.k.a. El Ingeniero), focused primarily on drug trafficking.

Nonetheless, most of the victims in Tijuana were white-collar entrepreneurs, and the kidnappings were bringing &quot; too much heat on organized crime &quot; and disrupting the criminal enterprises and interests of the cartel. [ Marosi Richard Diagnosis: irony http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/03/local/me-tijuana3/2 26 May 2012 Los Angeles Times 3 May 2008 ] The Mexican federal government responded by implementing &quot; Operation Tijuana, &quot; a coordination carried out between the Mexican military and the municipal police forces in the area. To put down the violence, InSight Crime states that a pact was probably created between military officials and members of the Sánchez Arellano faction to eliminate Simental&apos;s group. The U.S. authorities speculated through WikiLeaks in 2009 that Tijuana&apos;s former police boss, Julián Leyzaola, had made agreements with Sánchez Arellano to bring relative peace in Tijuana. [ Petrich Blanche Leyzaola pactó con los rivales de El Teo http://wikileaks.jornada.com.mx/notas/secretario-de-seguridad-publica-de-tijuana-hizo-acuerdo-con-cartel 26 May 2012 La Jornada 16 March 2011 ] With the arrest of El Teo in January 2010, much of his faction was eliminated from the city of Tijuana; some of its remains went off and joined with the Sinaloa Cartel. But much of the efforts done between 2008 and 2010 in Tijuana would not have been possible without the coordination of local police forces and the Mexican military – and possibly with a cartel truce – to put down the violence. The relative peace in the city of Tijuana in 2010–2012 has raised speculations of a possible agreement between the Tijuana Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel to maintain peace in the area. [ Dudley Steven Who Controls Tijuana? http://www.insightcrime.org/investigations/insight-exclusives/item/839-who-controls-tijuana? 24 April 2012 InSight Crime 3 May 2011 ] According to Mexican and U.S. authorities, most of Tijuana is under the dominance of the Sinaloa cartel, while Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano of the Tijuana cartel remains the &quot; head of that puppet empire. &quot; To be exact, experts told InSight Crime that the peace exists because Joaquín Guzmán Loera wants it that way, and argued that his organization—the Sinaloa Cartel—has spread too thin with its wars with Los Zetas and the Juárez Cartel that opening a third war would be inconvenient. The Tijuana cartel, however, has something their rivals do not have: a long-time family with business and political connections throughout the city. InSight Crime believes that this could explain why the Sinaloa cartel has left Sánchez Arellano as the figurehead, since it might be too costly for El Chapo financially and politically to make a final push. [ Organization ] The Arellano Félix family was initially composed of seven brothers and four sisters, who inherited the organization from Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo upon his incarceration in Mexico in 1989 for his complicity in the murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique Camarena. Although the subsequent brothers&apos; arrest in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) are blows to the Arellano Felix cartel, it did not dismantle the organization which currently is led by the Arellano&apos;s nephew, Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano.

After the death in 1997 of the Juárez Cartel&apos;s Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the Tijuana Cartel attempted to gain a foothold in Sonora. The Oaxaca Cartel reportedly joined forces with the Tijuana Cartel in 2003. Fourteen Mexican drug gang members were killed and eight others were injured in a gun battle in Tijuana near the U.S. border on Saturday, April 26, 2008 that was one of the bloodiest shootouts in the narco-war between the Tijuana Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel. On December 1, 2011, William R.

It was also reported that the cartel had lost their former Tijuana hotbed to the Sinaloa Cartel. The clan of the Arellano Felix continues, although diminished after the capture of their leaders. [ Captures and trial ] In October 1997, a retired U.S. Air Force C-130A that was sold to the airline Aeropostal Cargo de México was seized by Mexican federal officials, who alleged that the aircraft had been used to haul drugs for the cartel up from Central and South America, as well as around the Mexican interior. Investigators had linked the airline&apos;s owner, Jesús Villegas Covallos, to Ramón Arellano Félix. On August 14, 2006, Francisco Javier Arellano Félix was apprehended by the United States Coast Guard off the coast of Baja California Sur.
