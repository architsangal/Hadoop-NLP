Common names include the rainbow boa, [ 209561 Epicrates cenchria 10 July 2008 ] and slender boa. A terrestrial species, it is known for its attractive iridescent sheen. Nine subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. [ Geographic range ] Found in lower Central America in Costa Rica and Panama. In South America it occurs east of the Andes in Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina (in the provinces of Chaco, Córdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán ). The type locality given is &quot; Surinami. &quot; { McDiarmid RW, Campbell JA, Touré T. 1999. Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, vol. 1. Herpetologists&apos; League. 511 pp. ISBN 1-893777-00-6 (series). ISBN 1-893777-01-4 (volume). } [ Captivity ] Despite requiring very specific humidity and heat this species is commonly found in the pet trade. During the 1980s and early 1990s, substantial numbers were exported from Suriname. Today, however, far fewer are exported and most offered for sale are captive bred. { Brazilian Rainbow Boa at Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Accessed 12 November 2008. } Due to their requirements of high humidity in a captive environment they should be considered of intermediate difficulty for snake owners, but once these requirements have been met they generally thrive in captivity. Younger specimens will often bite, but tend to calm down as they become more used to handling.
