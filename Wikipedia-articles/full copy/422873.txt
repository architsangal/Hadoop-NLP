[ February 2010 ] [ May 2012 ] [ Olive oil from Oneglia.jpg Olive oil ] Cooking oil is plant, animal or synthetic fat used in frying, baking and other types of cooking. It&apos;s also used in food preparation and flavoring that doesn&apos;t involve heat, such as salad dressings and bread dips, and in this sense might be more accurately termed edible oil. Cooking oil is typically a liquid, although some oils that contain saturated fat, such as coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil, are solid at room temperature. [ Dietary fats explained http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000104.htm May 4, 2012 ] Types of cooking oil include: ghee, olive oil, palm oil, soybean oil, canola oil, pumpkin seed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, grape seed oil, sesame oil, argan oil, rice bran oil and other vegetable oil s. Oil can be flavoured with aromatic foodstuffs such as herbs, chillies or garlic. [ Health and nutrition ] Olive oil Italian olive oil { Sunflowerseed oil } The appropriate amount of fat as a component of daily food consumption is the topic of some controversy. Some fat is required in the diet, and fat (in the form of oil) is also essential in many types of cooking. The FDA recommends that 30% or fewer of calories consumed daily should be from fat. [ FDA Consumer The Food Pyramid 2006-09-18 http://web.archive.org/web/20060822160207/http%3A//www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/fdpyrmid.html 2006-08-22 ] Other nutritionists recommend that no more than 10% of a person&apos;s daily calories come from fat. { Dean Ornish, MD, Lifestyle Program } In extremely cold environments, a diet that is up to two-thirds fat is acceptable and can, in fact, be critical to survival. [ February 2010 ] [ June 2010 ] While consumption of small amounts of saturated fat s is essential, initial meta-analyses (1997, 2003) found a high correlation between high consumption of such fats and coronary heart disease.

Mayo Clinic has highlighted oils that are high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Those of lower amounts of saturated fats, and higher levels of unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocado, safflower, corn, sunflower, soy, mustard and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. { Dietary fats: Know which types to choose Mayo Clinic website } The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute { Choose foods low in saturated fat National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH Publication No. 97-4064. 1997. } and World Heart Federation [ January 2012 ] { Diet &amp; cardiovascular disease World Heart Federation website } have urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The health body lists olive and canola oils as sources of monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils are rich with polyunsaturated fat. Results of research carried out in Costa Rica in 2005 suggest that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil.

In fact, one study in Brazil compared the effects of soybean oil to coconut oil (a highly saturated fat) and found that while both groups showed a drop in BMI, the soybean oil group showed an increase in overall cholesterol (including a drop in HDL, the good cholesterol). The coconut oil group actually showed an increase in the HDL:LDL ratio (meaning there was more of the good cholesterol), as well as smaller waist sizes (something that was not shown in the soybean oil group.

Hayes and Pramod Khosla of Brandeis University and Wayne State University indicated that the focus of current research has shifted from saturated fats to individual fats and percentage of fatty acids (saturates, monounsaturates, polyunsaturates) in the diet. An adequate intake of both polyunsaturated and saturated fats is needed for the ideal LDL/HDL ratio in blood, as both contribute to the regulatory balance in lipoprotein metabolism.

Prolonged consumption of burnt oils led to atherosclerosis, inflammatory joint disease, and development of birth defects. The scientists also questioned global health authorities&apos; recommendation that large amounts of polyunsaturated fats be incorporated into the human diet without accompanying measures to ensure the protection of these fatty acids against heat- and oxidative-degradation. Palm oil contains more saturated fats than canola oil, corn oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand the high heat of deep frying and is resistant to oxidation compared to highly unsaturated vegetable oils.

[ July 2010 ] [ Storing and keeping oil ] Whether refined or not, all oils are sensitive to heat, light, and exposure to oxygen. Rancid oil has an unpleasant aroma and acrid taste, and its nutrient value is greatly diminished. [ July 2010 ] To delay the development of rancid oil, a blanket of an inert gas, usually nitrogen, is applied to the vapor space in the storage container immediately after production. This is referred to as tank blanketing. Vitamin E oil is a natural antioxidant that can also be added to cooking oils to prevent rancidification. All oils should be kept in a cool, dry place. Oils may thicken, but they will soon return to liquid if they stand at room temperature. To prevent negative effects of heat and light, oils should be removed from cold storage just long enough for use. Refined oils high in monounsaturated fats keep up to a year (olive oil will keep up to a few years), while those high in polyunsaturated fats keep about six months. Extra-virgin and virgin olive oils keep at least 9 months after opening. Other monounsaturated oils keep well up to eight months, while unrefined polyunsaturated oils will keep only about half as long. [ January 2011 ] In contrast, saturated oils, such as coconut oil and palm oil, have much longer shelf lives and can be safely stored at room temperature. { Coconutoil.com } Their lack of polyunsaturated content causes them to be more stable. { Articledashboard.com } [ Types of oils and their characteristics ] [ May 2008 ] Lighter, more refined oils tend to have higher smoke point s. Experience using an oil is generally a sufficiently reliable guide. Although outcomes of empirical tests are sensitive to the qualities of particular samples (brand, composition, refinement, process), the data below should be helpful in comparing the properties of different oils. [ January 2011 ] Smoking oil indicates a risk of combustion, and left unchecked can also set off a fire alarm. When using any cooking oil, should it begin to smoke, heat should be reduced immediately. Generally, one should be fully prepared to extinguish a burning oil fire before heating, typically by having on hand the lid to place on the pan, or (for the worst case) having on hand the proper fire extinguisher.

Extraction first removes the oil, typically from a seed, nut or fruit. Refinement then alters the appearance, texture, taste, smell, or stability of the oil to meet buyer expectations. [ Extraction ] There are three broad types of oil extraction: Chemical solvent extraction, most commonly using hexane. Pressing, using an expeller press or cold press (pressing at low temperatures to prevent oil heating). Decanter centrifuge. In large-scale industrial oil extraction you will often see some combination of pressing, chemical extraction and/or centrifuging in order to extract the maximum amount of oil possible. [ How cooking oil is made http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Cooking-Oil.html May 18, 2012 ] Cooking oil producers targeting the health food market often use cold press extraction only, as it provides an extraction process free of chemical solvents and high temperatures. [ Refinement ] Cooking oil can either be unrefined, or refined using one or more of the following refinement processes (in any combination): Distilling, which heats the oil to evaporate off chemical solvents from the extraction process. Degumming, by passing hot water through the oil to precipitate out gums and proteins that are soluble in oil but not in water, then discarding the water along with the impurities. Neutralization, or deacidification, which treats the oil with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate to pull out free fatty acids, phospholipids, pigments, and waxes. Bleaching, which removes &quot; off-colored &quot; components by treatment with fuller&apos;s earth, activated carbon, or activated clays, followed by heating, filtering, then drying to recoup the oil. Dewaxing, or winterizing, improves clarity of oils intended for refrigeration by dropping them to low tempuratures and removing any solids that form. Deodorizing, by treating with high-heat pressurized steam to evaporate less stable compounds that might cause &quot; unusual &quot; odors or tastes. Preservative addition, such as BHA and BHT to help preserve oils that have been made less stable due to high-temperature processing. Filtering, a non-chemical process which screens out larger particles, could be considered a step in refinement, although it doesn&apos;t alter the state of the oil. Most large-scale commercial cooking oil refinement will involve all of these steps in order to achieve a product that&apos;s uniform in taste, smell and appearance, and has a longer shelf life.

[ Waste cooking oil ] { Austin, Texas, } { USA, managed by a recycling company. } Proper disposal of used cooking oil is an important waste-management concern.
