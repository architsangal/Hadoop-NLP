[ the feeling the feast day Epiphany (holiday) ] { Arthur Fry, inventor of the } { Post-it note, with one on his forehead with a picture of a lightbulb } An epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, epiphaneia, &quot; manifestation, striking appearance &quot; ) is the sudden realization or comprehension of the (larger) essence or meaning of something. The term is used in either a philosophical or literal sense to signify that the claimant has &quot; found the last piece of the puzzle and now sees the whole picture, &quot; or has new information or experience, often insignificant by itself, that illuminates a deeper or numinous foundational frame of reference. This concept is studied by psychologist s and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation. Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, following the process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension have also made possible leaps in technology and the science s. Though famous individuals like Archimedes and Isaac Newton might have had epiphanies, they were almost certainly the result of a long and intensive period of study those individuals have undertaken, not a sudden, out-of-the-blue, flash of inspiration on an issue they had not thought about previously. [ History ] The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the divine. Today, this concept is used much more often and without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is supernatural, as the discovery comes suddenly from the outside. The word&apos;s secular usage may owe some of its popularity to James Joyce, who expounded on its meaning in the fragment Stephen Hero and the novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). Referring to those times in his life when something became manifest, a deep realization, he would then attempt to write this epiphanic realization in a fragment. Joyce also used epiphany as a literary device within each short story of his collection Dubliners (1914) as his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves or their social condition and often sparking a reversal or change of heart. For the philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another&apos;s face (see face-to-face ). From &quot; L&apos;atmosphere &quot; book of 1888 In traditional and pre-modern cultures, initiation rites and mystery religion s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The Greek dramatists and poets, would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of catharsis or kenosis, respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of William Burroughs &apos; Naked Lunch, a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, &quot; a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork. &quot; Both the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and the Pop Art ist Andy Warhol would invert expectations by presenting commonplace object s or graphics as works of fine art, simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of &quot; what art is &quot; or is not. [ Process ] Despite its popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process. The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one&apos;s labour will bear fruit, and our subconsciousness can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort. [ Myth ] A common myth predicts that most if not all innovation occur through epiphanies. Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that &quot; the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems &quot;. Few innovations in the history of humanity occurred with no claims of epiphany. Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled. Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension have also made possible leaps in technology and the science s. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes &apos; realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout &quot; Eureka ! &quot; ( &quot; I have found it! &quot; ). The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. A similar flash of holistic understanding in a prepared mind was said to give Charles Darwin &apos;s &quot; hunch &quot; (about natural selection ) during The Voyage of the Beagle. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton &apos;s apple story. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the end result of a long and intensive period of study those individuals have undertaken, not a sudden, out-of-the-blue, flash of inspiration on an issue they have not thought about previously. Epiphany can be distinguished by a (usually spiritual) vision, as epiphanies are often triggered by irrelevant incidents or objects. [ In religion ] [ Epiphany (holiday) theophany hierophany ] In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the Adoration of the Magi as the Incarnation of the infant Christ, and commemorate the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches celebrated Epiphany (or Theophany ) in conjunction with Christ&apos;s baptism by John the Baptist and celebrated it on January 19; however, many have begun to adopt the Western custom of celebrating it on January 6, the twelfth day of Christmas. Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until Ash Wednesday. In more general terms the phrase religious epiphany is used when a person realizes his faith or when he is convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of his faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to the realization of Arjuna that Krishna (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the &quot; Bhagavad Gita &quot; ) is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be /bodhodaya/, from Sanskrit /bodha/ &apos;wisdom&apos; and /udaya/ &apos;rising&apos;. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining Nirvana. The Zen term kensho also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a koan.
