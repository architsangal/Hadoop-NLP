[ Early comics career ] Some of his earliest work is for DC Comics &apos;s House of Secrets and a run on Swamp Thing (#14-18, 21 and 22), which was illustrated by Nestor Redondo. { David Michelinie at the } { Grand Comics Database } Michelinie and artist Ernie Chan created Claw the Unconquered in 1975. [ McAvennie Michael Dolan Hannah, ed. 1970s DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle Dorling Kindersley 2010 978-0-7566-6742-9 163 David Michelinie&apos;s pen and Ernie Chan&apos;s pencils and inks provided the magic for this fantasy series that introduced Claw the Unconquered, a barbaric outlander with a deformed claw-like right hand. ] Michelinie did a run on Aquaman in Adventure Comics which led to the revival of the Sea King&apos;s own title in 1977. { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 175: &quot; The Sea King&apos;s fans were thrilled to see their hero resurface in his own title...Scribe David Michelinie and artist Jim Aparo chronicled Aquaman&apos;s [adventures]. &quot; } In the Aquaman story in Adventure Comics #452, Black Manta killed Aquaman&apos;s son, Arthur Curry Jr. by suffocation. The infant&apos;s death has affected the character ever since. While writing the Karate Kid series, Michelinie used the name &quot; Barry Jameson &quot; as a pseudonym. { Kid&apos;&apos; #2 (May–June 1976) at the } { Grand Comics Database } With artist Ed Davis, he created Gravedigger in Men of War #1 (Aug. 1977). { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 174: &quot; Writer David Michelinie and artist Ed Davis presented an atypical war hero in Ulysses Hazard. &quot; } The Star Hunters were created by Michelinie with artists Don Newton and Bob Layton in DC Super Stars #16 (Sept.-Oct. 1977) and the characters were featured in their own short-lived series. The original storyline for Madame Xanadu in Doorway to Nightmare #1 (Feb. 1978) was developed by Michelinie and Val Mayerik. { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 176: &quot; Writer David Michelinie and artist Val Mayerik introduced Madame Xanadu. &quot; } [ Marvel Comics ] His most famous works include two runs on the Iron Man series, with co-writer (and inker) Bob Layton, in the late 1970s and early 1980s which introduced the character&apos;s serious problem with alcoholism, his specialized power armor variants and his new enmities with Justin Hammer and Doctor Doom. He introduced one of Stark&apos;s closest comrades, the fearless pilot, Jim Rhodes. His most noted cliffhanger was when Tony Stark was thrown out of S.H.I.E.L.D. &apos;s helicarrier and had to don his armor completely to use its flight function before he hit the ground. After leaving the title in 1981, Michelenie reunited with Layton on the book late in 1986, and along with penciller M. D. Bright, closed out preceding writer Dennis O&apos;Neil &apos;s Advanced Idea Mechanics arc and launched the Armor Wars. Michelenie left Iron Man again after issue 250, closing his second collaboration with Layton with a sequel to their Iron Man-Doctor Doom time travel episode from issues 149-150. From 1987 to 1994, Michelinie wrote the Amazing Spider-Man series which featured the art of Todd McFarlane, Erik Larsen, Mark Bagley and introduced the supervillain Venom. Michelinie had planned to introduce Venom earlier and included a &quot; teaser &quot; scene in Web of Spider-Man #18, in which Peter Parker is pushed by an offscreen Venom into the path of an oncoming train, the symbiote being immune to Spider-Man&apos;s &quot; spider sense &quot; that would have normally warned him of the attack. This was the first of what was to be several clues leading to the reveal of Venom. Michelinie left Web of Spider-Man shortly after and was not able to continue the introduction of Venom until his time of writing The Amazing Spider-Man. [ Later career ] He began working for DC again with the launch of the Justice League Task Force series in 1993 with artist Sal Velluto. { Manning, Matthew K. &quot; 1990s &quot; in Dolan, p. 259: &quot; Writer David Michelinie and artist Sal Velluto introduced a different type of Justice League in their new ongoing series Justice League Task Force&apos;&apos;. &quot; } In 1994, Michelinie became the writer of Action Comics. He also worked at Valiant Comics on the titles Rai, H.A.R.D. Corps and Turok : Dinosaur Hunter. Michelinie and artist Paul Ryan are the only comic book creators to have contributed to the wedding issues of both Spider-Man (Peter Parker marrying Mary Jane Watson in Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21, 1987), { &apos;&apos;Amazing Spider-Man Annual&apos;&apos; #21 at the } { Grand Comics Database } and Superman ( Clark Kent ) marrying Lois Lane in Superman: The Wedding Album (Dec. 1996) { Manning &quot; 1990s &quot; in Dolan, p. 275: &quot; The behind-the-scenes talent on the monumental issue appropriately spanned several generations of the Man of Tomorrow&apos;s career. Written by Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, David Michelinie, Louise Simonson, and Roger Stern, the one-shot featured the pencils of John Byrne, Gil Kane, Stuart Immonen, Paul Ryan, Jon Bogdanove, Kieron Dwyer, Tom Grummett, Dick Giordano, Jim Mooney, Curt Swan, Nick Cardy, Al Plastino, Barry Kitson, Ron Frenz, and Dan Jurgens. &quot; } Michelinie returned to creating comics by teaming-up with Bob Layton and Dick Giordano to form Future Comics. The company closed in 2004. In 2008, he and Layton collaborated again for a four-issue Iron Man : Legacy of Doom miniseries and Iron Man: The End #1 one-shot for Marvel Comics. In the credits of numerous comics, his name is misspelled as &quot; David Micheline &quot;.
