He has won a record eight European Tour Order of Merit titles, including a streak of seven consecutively from 1993 to 1999, and 31 European Tour events, placing him fourth on the all time list. He has not, to date, won a major championship, after finishing runner-up on five occasions, or an official tournament on PGA Tour. His career high world ranking is second. { Week 45 2008 news Official World Golf Ranking site. } [ Early life ] Although Scottish by birth and ethnicity, he was raised in Yorkshire, England, where his father, James Montgomerie, was Managing Director of Fox&apos;s Biscuits. { &apos;&apos;The Scotsman&apos;&apos; article on Montgomerie } He spent a number of years with the Ilkley Golf Club, where he was tutored by the past professional Bill Ferguson. He was educated at both Leeds Grammar School and Strathallan School, Perthshire. During his time in Leeds, he became a supporter of [ Leeds United ], { Monty&apos;s Backing, LeedsUnited.com, 8 April 2008, Accessed 8 April 2008 } but still remains a loyal supporter of Glasgow Rangers. His father later became the secretary of Royal Troon Golf Club, one of Scotland&apos;s most famous clubs. Montgomerie became one of the first British golfers to go to a United States college, attending Houston Baptist University, where he played on the golf team and became its top player. He won three important Scottish amateur tournaments – the 1983 Scottish Youths Championship, the 1985 Scottish Stroke Play Championship, and the 1987 Scottish Amateur Championship. He also played for Scotland twice in the Eisenhower Trophy (1984 and 1986) and for Great Britain and Ireland in the Walker Cup twice (1985 and 1987). Between 1988–91, Montgomerie completed a degree in Accountancy at the University of Stirling. [ Career outline ] Montgomerie turned professional in 1988, and was named the Rookie of the Year on the European Tour that season. He quickly developed into one of Europe&apos;s top pros, winning his first event at the 1989 Portuguese Open by eight shots, and making his Ryder Cup debut in 1991. He finished first on the European Tour Order of Merit every year from 1993 to 1999 (a record for most consecutive Orders of Merit), and has 31 victories on the tour, including the 1998, 1999, and 2000 European PGA Championships. He first reached the top-10 in the Official World Golf Rankings in 1994, and spent almost 400 weeks in the top-10. { 69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking } His highest ranking was number two. In his prime Montgomerie was considered one of the best drivers of the golf ball in the world and became a very precise iron player, often able to judge the distance he hit the ball exactly from long range. His form fell away gradually in the new millennium, partly due to marriage problems, and his ranking slumped to 82nd in the world, but he came back strongly in 2005, winning a record eighth European Tour Order of Merit and returning to the top ten in the World Rankings. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4498444.stm BBC News Montgomerie back in world top 10 5 December 2005 30 April 2010 ] Late in 2005 he became the first man to win 20 million Euros on the European Tour—topping the European Tour&apos;s all-time highest earners list. He remained the leader in career earnings on the European Tour until 2010, when he was surpassed by Ernie Els. [ OBE ] At the end of 2004, Montgomerie was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year&apos;s Honours. He represents the Turnberry resort in Scotland, where there is a Colin Montgomerie Golf Academy. [ Current form ] After re-forming his partnership with caddie Alastair McLean in 2004, the pair split again on 10 June, a week before the start of the U.S. Open. Montgomerie managed to win for the first time in nearly two years at the Smurfit Kappa European Open in July 2007, silencing the critics who have asserted he would not win again. In mid-2008 Montgomerie slipped out of the top 100 players in the world ranking system. { Official World Golf Ranking 1 June 2008 } A second place at the French Open in June boosted him back up the rankings, but his good play was short-lived, and as a result Montgomerie failed to qualify for Nick Faldo &apos;s 2008 Ryder Cup team. In March 2009, Montgomerie played in his milestone 500th European Tour event at the Open de Andalucia where he played well and made the cut, but was not a factor on the weekend. After nearly two years without a top-10 finish, Montgomerie produced something like his form of old to post a final round of 68 for a share of 7th place in the 2011 BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. Montgomerie attributed his resurgence to improved driving accuracy and commented that he could contend more often if this were to continue. [ May 2011 ] [ Form at major championships ] Montgomerie is generally considered to be one of the best golfers never to have won a major championship, after finishing in second place on five separate occasions. During what most consider to be his best years in the 1990s Montgomerie had several close shaves. A third place at the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links was the first of these. He was prematurely congratulated by Jack Nicklaus who said &quot; Congratulations on your first U.S. Open victory &quot; to Monty after he finished the 18th hole on Sunday. [ http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/22/sports/golf-kite-beats-the-elements-but-it-isn-t-a-breeze.html?scp%3D1%26amp%3Bsq%3DColin%2BMontgomerie%2BJack%2BNicklaus%26amp%3Bst%3Dnyt The New York Times GOLF; Kite Beats the Elements, but It Isn&apos;t a Breeze Jaime Diaz 22 June 1992 30 April 2010 ] Tom Kite, who was still on the golf course when Montgomerie finished, wound up winning the championship. At the 1994 U.S. Open, played at Oakmont Country Club, Montgomerie lost in a three-man playoff to Ernie Els (a playoff which also included Loren Roberts). Famously, Montgomerie was left with only one shirt to play in during the Monday playoff, a dark tartan design, which did not help his cause in the very hot playing conditions. He shot 78 to trail the 74s shot by Els and Roberts, with Els winning at the 20th extra hole. At the 1995 PGA Championship, Montgomerie birdied the final three holes of the Riviera Country Club course in the final round, to tie Steve Elkington at 17 under par, which was a record low score in a major championship. On the first sudden-death playoff hole, after being in better position after two shots, Montgomerie missed his putt, while Elkington holed from 35 feet to claim the title. Els defeated Montgomerie at the 1997 U.S. Open, played at Congressional Country Club. Montgomerie opened the tournament with a 65 but shot a 76 in the second round. A bogey on the 71st hole dropped Montgomerie one shot behind Els, who parred the last to win. At the 2006 U.S. Open, played on the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He stood in the middle of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the lead. While waiting in position on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, &quot; At my age I&apos;ve got to think positively. I&apos;m 43 next week, and it&apos;s nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster. &quot; { The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations, ed. Jim Apfelbaum. 2007. } Geoff Ogilvy won the championship. Montgomerie&apos;s best finish in the Masters Tournament came in 1998 when he finished tied for 8th. At The Open Championship, it is only in recent years that Montgomerie has shown signs of challenging to win. He started brightly in 2001 at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club, with an opening 65, and still remained ahead after 36 holes, but fell away over the weekend. He was also in contention with two rounds to play at Muirfield in 2002 and Royal Troon Golf Club in 2004, but failed to capitalise and finished midway down the field. His best finish in the Championship came in 2005 at St Andrews, where he finished second to Tiger Woods, who beat him by five shots. [ Ryder Cup and other team golf ] { 2004 Ryder Cup } Despite his disappointments in the majors, Montgomerie is heralded as one of the greatest Ryder Cup players of all time. To date he has been a member of the European team on eight occasions, and has never lost in a singles match. He holds a win-lose-draw record of 20–9–7, thus giving him a total points scored tally of 23.5, only 1.5 points behind the all time record held by Nick Faldo. He has played pivotal roles in several of the matches. He halved the last hole with Scott Hoch to obtain the half point that won Europe the cup in 1997, and sank the winning putt, { Montgomerie is widely credited as having holed the winning putt, although } { Ian Poulter birdied on the 15th hole of his match to guarantee a half point and so mathematically win the Ryder Cup seconds before Montgomerie.

Montgomerie was not part of Nick Faldo&apos;s 2008 Ryder Cup team, with the wildcards going to Paul Casey and Ian Poulter. Montgomerie captained the Great Britain &amp; Ireland team in the first four stagings of the Seve Trophy, losing in 2000 but winning in 2002, 2003, and 2005. On 28 January 2009, it was announced that Montgomerie would be the captain the European team at the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor. { Monty to lead Europe at Ryder Cup } On 4 October 2010, Montgomerie led the European team to victory, 14½ to 13½.

Europe was successful on both those occasions. He has the distinction of being the only person to have been a victorious player and captain in the Ryder Cup, Seve Trophy and Royal Trophy – the three main team golf competitions open to players from Europe. [ February 2012 ] [ Relationship with the golfing public ] { Austrian Open 2006 } Montgomerie has often come under fire for his attitude on the golf course. He is noted for his lack of focus, and quite often becomes distracted by seemingly very minor incidents. [ February 2012 ] [ Personal life ] Montgomerie met his first wife Eimear Wilson, from Troon, when he was a good amateur and she was a promotions assistant. She was a 17-year-old law student at Edinburgh University and a spectator at an amateur championship in Nairn, at which Montgomerie destroyed the field.
