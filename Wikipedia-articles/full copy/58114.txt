As of 2010, the population was 799,874, making it the third most populous county in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia and Allegheny counties). The county seat is Norristown. The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire (which was named after one of William the Conqueror &apos;s main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie ), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quaker s from Wales. Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county&apos;s name as uncertain. Montgomery County is a suburb an county northwest of Philadelphia. It is part of the Delaware Valley and marks the region&apos;s northern border with the Lehigh Valley region of the state. It is the 20th wealthiest county in the country (measured by personal per-capita income) and was named the 9th Best Place to Raise a Family by Forbes. { forbes.com } [ Geography ] Montgomery County Courthouse According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 487 square miles (1,262  km²), of which 483 square miles (1,251  km²) is land and 4  square miles (11  km²) (0.89%) is water.

However, Montco is also a major employment center with large business parks in Blue Bell, Lansdale, Fort Washington, Horsham and King of Prussia which attract thousands of workers from all over the region. The strong job base and taxes generated by those jobs have resulted in Montgomery County receiving the highest credit rating of &apos;AAA&apos; from Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, one of fewer than 30 counties in the United States with such a rating. { &quot; Montgomery County, &quot; Rydal-Meadowbrook Civic Association } Major employers include: Abington Memorial Hospital Aetna BAE Systems Bradford White Dorman Products Genuardi&apos;s Family Markets GlaxoSmithKline Holy Redeemer Hospital InfoStretch Corporation Jefferson Health System Johnson &amp; Johnson - McNeil Pharmaceuticals Lockheed Martin Merck Motorola Prudential Quest Diagnostics Rohm and Haas Teva Pharmaceuticals Unisys [ Population growth ] Montgomery County&apos;s population grew about 10.6% as of the 2000 census with much of the growth in the western part of the county. Much of the growth is attributable to population shifts in the region. The county especially saw an increase of Asian American immigrants [ April 2011 ] as well as in Mexican immigrants. Also, Montgomery County receives a large number of immigrants, and many migrants from other urban areas, looking for cheaper real estate compared to their areas. Montgomery County provides many expressways to Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places in Pennsylvania. Census Bureau projections show a slowing of the growth this decade. Part of the slowing of the growth is attributed to the massive emigration of native born residents.
