[ 1896 1 23 y ] { Berg Castle, } { Luxembourg } [ 1985 7 9 1896 1 23 y ] { Fischbach Castle, } { Fischbach, Luxembourg } { Notre-Dame Cathedral } Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg ( [ Charlotte Adelgonde Élise/Elisabeth Marie Wilhelmine vu Lëtzebuerg ]; Schloss Berg, 23 January 1896 – Schloss Fischbach, 9 July 1985) was the reigning Grand Duchess of Luxembourg from 1919 to 1964. [ Biography ] A private portrait in 1921 [ Early life and life as Grand Duchess ] Charlotte was the second daughter of William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and his wife Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal. Her maternal grandparents were King Miguel of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. When her older sister Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, who had succeeded their father, was forced to abdicate on 14 January 1919, Charlotte became the one who had to deal with the revolutionary tendencies in the country. Unlike her sister, she chose not to meddle with its politics. In a referendum about the new constitution on 28 September 1919, 77.8% of the Luxembourgish people voted for the continuation of a Grand Ducal monarchy with Charlotte as head of state. In this constitution, the power of the monarch was severely restricted. During the German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II, Charlotte, exiled in London, became an important symbol of national unity. [ Marriage and children ] On 6 November 1919 in Luxembourg, she married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, a first cousin on her mother&apos;s side. (Both Charlotte and Felix were grandchildren of King Miguel of Portugal through his daughters Maria Anna and Maria Antonia, respectively). With the marriage, their lineal descent was raised in style from Grand Ducal Highness to Royal Highness. The union produced six children: [ 1921 1 5 y ] [ 2011 11 22 1922 12 22 y ] [ 2007 2 28 1924 5 21 y ] [ 1925 8 2 y ] [ 1977 7 26 1927 8 7 y ] [ 1929 8 24 y ] Name Date of birth Date of death Spouses Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium (1927–2005) Elizabeth, Duchess of Hohenberg 22 December 1922 Franz, Duke of Hohenberg (1927–1977) Marie Adelaide, Countess Henckel von Donnersmarck 21 May 1924 Karl Josef Graf Henckel von Donnersmarck (1928–2008) Marie Gabriele, Countess of Holstein-Ledreborg Knud Johan, Count of Holstein-Ledreborg (1919–2001) Charles, Prince of Luxembourg 7 August 1927 Joan Douglas Dillon (1935–) Alix, Princess of Ligne Antoine, 13th Prince of Ligne (1925–2005) [ Reign ] During the Second World War the grand ducal family left Luxembourg shortly before the arrival of Nazi troops. Luxembourg&apos;s neutrality was violated on 9 May 1940, while the Grand Duchess and her family were in residence at Colmar-Berg. That day she called an extraordinary meeting of her leading ministers, and they all decided to place themselves under the protection of France, described by the Grand duchesses as a difficult but necessary decision. Initially the family took up residence at the Château de Montastruc in south-western France, but the rapid advance of the German forces into France followed by French capitulation the next month caused the French government to refuse any guarantee of security to the exiled Luxembourg government. Permission was received to cross Spain provided they did not stop en route, and the Grand Duchess with her ministers moved on to Portugal. The Germans proposed to restore the Grand Duchess to her functions, but Charlotte was mindful of her predecessor&apos;s experiences of remaining in Luxembourg under German occupation during the First World War, and refused the offer. By 29 August 1940 Grand Duchess Charlotte was in London where she began to make supportive broadcasts to her homeland using the BBC. Later she traveled to the United States and to Canada. Her children continued their schooling in Montréal while she had several meetings with President Roosevelt who encouraged her itinerant campaigning across the country in support of his own opposition to isolationism which was a powerful political current until the Pearl Harbor attacks. In the meantime Luxembourg, along with the adjacent French Moselle department, found itself integrated into an expanded Germany under the name Heim ins Reich, which left Luxembourgers required to speak German and liable for conscription into the German army. In 1943 Grand Duchess Charlotte and the Luxembourg government established themselves in London : her broadcasts became a more regular feature of the BBC schedules, establishing her as a focus for the resistance movements in Luxembourg. Charlotte&apos;s younger sister Princess Antonia of Luxembourg had in 1921 married the last crown prince of Bavaria and in 1939 the couple had been exiled from Germany. In 1944, living now in Hungary, Princess Antonia was captured when the Germans invaded Hungary and found herself deported to the concentration camp at Dachau, being later transferred to Flossenbürg where she survived torture but only with her health badly impaired. Meanwhile from 1942 Grand Duchess Charlotte&apos;s eldest son, the future Grand Duke Jean served as a volunteer in the Irish Guards which was a British army regiment, for historical reasons he was known at this time as &quot; Lieutenant Luxembourg &quot;. [ Abdication and death ] On 12 November 1964, she abdicated in favour of her son, Prince Jean, who then reigned until 2000. Charlotte died on 9 July 1985, from cancer. She was interred in the Ducal Crypt of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in the city of Luxembourg. Had she not abdicated, she would have reigned for a total of [ 1919 1 14 1985 7 6 ]. She was the 366th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.
