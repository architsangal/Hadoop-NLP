Another curiosity of this highway is that it runs the entire length of the Oklahoma Panhandle and traverses the Missouri Bootheel. [ 2004 ], the highway&apos;s eastern terminus is in Columbia, Tennessee at an intersection with Interstate 65, where it continues east as State Route 99. Its western terminus is in Springer, New Mexico at an intersection with Interstate 25.

It is concurrent with U.S. Route 56 throughout its entire route in the state at just under [ 100 mi km ]. Besides Springer, the only other town Route 412 passes through is Clayton, where it merges with U.S. Route 64. Just before entering Oklahoma, the highway touches the northwestern corner of Texas at a small road junction. [ Oklahoma ] Highway 412 runs across the Panhandle and northern part of the state passing through cities such as Boise City, Woodward, Enid, and Tulsa. Some major highway junctions include Interstate 35 in Noble County and several others in Tulsa such as I-44, 244, 444, and U.S. Routes 75 and 169.

[ History ] Arkansas Highway 68 is the former designation of U.S. Highway 412 from the Arkansas-Oklahoma State Line to U.S. Highway 62 at Alpena. The original eastern terminus of Highway 68 was [ 10 mi km ] east of Huntsville at Highway 21, but was extended in the 1940s to Alpena. An old alignment of Highway 68 can be found [ 4 mi km ] east of Huntsville. This section includes an open-spandrel arch bridge over War Eagle Creek. Highway 68 also had a business route that ran from Siloam Springs – Springdale. Just east of Mountain Home, in Henderson, the highway crosses Lake Norfork, which at one time had to be crossed by ferry. Coinciding with the final trip of a Norfork Lake ferry at 8 a.m. Friday, October 24, 1983, the U.S. Highway 62 bridge across Lake Norfork was opened. Charles Gibson piloted the ferry on that trip, carrying three cars across the lake within the shadow of the bridge, which brought a 40-year era to an end.
