Charles H. Scott and the Southern California Methodist Episcopal Church bought the land; in 1922, Scott founded Pacific Palisades, envisioning an elaborate religious-intellectual commune. [ Loomis Jan Pacific Palisades http://books.google.com/books?id%3DL6VgfC530y0C Arcadia Publishing ] Believers snapped up choice lots and lived in tents during construction. By 1925, the Palisades had 100 homes. In one subdivision, streets were named for Methodist missionaries. The tents eventually were replaced by cabins, then by bungalows, and ultimately by multimillion-dollar homes. During their exile from Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 40s, Pacific Palisades became a venue for German and Austrian writers and actors, like Thomas Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Vicki Baum, Oskar Homolka and Emil Ludwig. { Feuchtwanger Memorial Library - Researching German Exiles } For many decades there was a virtual ban on drinking alcohol in the district, and a Chinese restaurant, House of Lee, held the only liquor license.
