[ Amygdaloideae Cherry Stella444.jpg Cherries Prunus avium Plant ae Angiosperms Eudicots Rosids Rosales Rosaceae Amygdaloideae Arn. * Prunoideae Horan. ] Amygdaloideae is a subfamily within the flowering plant family Rosaceae. It was formerly considered by some authors [ John Lindley 1830 Introduction to the natural system of botany: or, a systematic view of the organization, natural affinities, and geographic distribution of the whole vegetable kingdom; together with the uses of the most important species in medicine, the arts, and rural or domestic economy Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green London http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31944#21 ] to be separate from Rosaceae, and the family names Prunaceae and Amygdalaceae have been used. Reanalysis from 2007 has shown that the previous definition of subfamily Spiraeoideae was paraphyletic, [ 10.1007/s00606-007-0539-9 Potter, D., et al. 2007 Phylogeny and classification of Rosaceae Plant Systematics and Evolution 266 1–2 5–43 ] To solve this problem, a larger subfamily was defined that includes the former Spiraeoideae and Maloideae. This subfamily is to be called Amygdaloideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. [ van Rijckevorsel, P. 2009 (030-036) Some proposals on automatically typified names Taxon 58 2 662–663 ] As traditionally defined, the Amygdaloideae includes such commercially important crops as plum, cherry, apricot, peach, and almond. The fruit of these plants are known as stone fruit ( drupe s ), as each fruit contains a hard shell (the endocarp ) called a stone or pit, which contains the single seed. The expanded definition of the Amygdaloideae adds to these commercially important crops such as apple s and pear s that have pome fruit, and also important ornamental plants such as Spiraea and Aruncus that have hard dry fruits. [ Taxonomic history ] The name Prunoideae is sometimes used, but is incorrect. The 1835 publication of that name by Gilbert Thomas Burnett (Burnett) is invalid because it lacks a description (or diagnosis or reference to an earlier description or diagnosis). Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (Horan.) published the name in 1847, but Amygdaloideae, published in 1832 by George Arnott Walker Arnott, has priority and is therefore the correct name. The taxonomy of this group of plants within the Rosaceae has recently been unclear. In 2001 it was reported [ Sangtae Lee &amp; Jun Wen 2001 A phylogenetic analysis of Prunusand the Amygdaloideae (Rosaceae) using ITS sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA American Journal of Botany 88 1 150–160 http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/88/1/150?ck%3Dnck#T1 10.2307/2657135 11159135 ] that Amygdaloideae consists of two distinct genetic groups or &quot; clades &quot;, Prunus – Maddenia and Exochorda – Oemleria – Prinsepia. Further refinement [ D. Potter, T. Eriksson, R. C. Evans, S. Oh, J. E. E. Smedmark, D. R. Morgan, M. Kerr, K. R. Robertson, M. Arsenault, T. A. Dickinson &amp; C. S. Campbell 2007 Phylogeny and classification of Rosaceae Evolution of Rosaceae Plant Systematics and Evolution 266 1–2 5–43 http://biology.umaine.edu/Amelanchier/Rosaceae_2007.pdf PDF 10.1007/s00606-007-0539-9 ] shows that Exochorda–Oemleria–Prinsepia is somewhat separate from Prunus–Maddenia–Pygeum, and that the traditional subfamilies Maloideae and Spiraeoideae must be included in Amygdaloideae if a paraphyletic group is to be avoided. With this classification the genus Prunus is considered to include Armeniaca, Cerasus, Amygdalus, Padus, Laurocerasus, Pygeum, and Maddenia. Robert Frost alluded to the merging of Amygdalaceae into Rosaceae in his poem The Rose Family, [ Robert Frost 1928 West-Running Brook Henry Holt &amp; Co ] when he wrote &quot; The rose is a rose and was always a rose / But the theory now goes that the apple&apos;s a rose, / and the pear is, and so&apos;s the plum, I suppose. &quot; In the next line he wrote, &quot; The dear [i.e., &quot; the dear Lord &quot;, euphemized] only knows what will next prove a rose. &quot; This referred to shifting botanical opinion which had recently [ Focke, W.O. 1894 Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien nebst ihren Gattungen und wichtigeren Arten insbesondere den Nutzpflanzen unter Mitwirkung zahlreicher hervorragender Fachgelehrten Rosaceae Leipzig W. Engelmann A. Engler; K. Prantl 3(3) ] reunited Amygdalaceae, Spiraeaceae, and Malaceae into Rosaceae (which matches de Jussieu&apos;s 1789 classification).
