[ History ] Astronaut View of Bujumbura Bujumbura grew from a small village after it became a military post in German East Africa in 1889.

The city&apos;s name was changed from Usumbura to Bujumbura when Burundi became independent in 1962. Since independence, Bujumbura has been the scene of frequent fighting between the country&apos;s two main ethnic groups, with Hutu militias opposing the Tutsi -dominated Burundi army. Bujumbura today stands as an undeveloped city, but remains to develop along with its country.
