The series chronicled their day-to-day life, and the show became a hit for its portrayal of a dysfunctional, though close-knit family in which metal music, profanity and other harshness were a daily part of life. Kelly, the middle child, emerged (according to Rolling Stone ) as &quot; a wickedly funny, brutally honest, pint-size, potty-mouthed spitfire. &quot; The series started when she was seventeen, and ended when she was twenty. Kelly said in an interview for The Osbournes DVD that the crew were only actually supposed to be there for a few weeks but ended up staying for a few months and that the constant cameras focusing on her and her family was stressful. { Eliscu, Jenny (12 December 2002), &quot; Kelly Osbourne &quot;.
