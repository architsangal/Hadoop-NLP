[ the city in the Maldives Mulah ] { Imamzadeh Seyyed Hamza, } { Tabriz. } Mullah ( [ ملا ] ) is generally used to refer to a Muslim man, educated in Islamic theology and sacred law. The title, given to some Islam ic clergy, is derived from the Arabic word [ ar مَوْلَى ] mawlā, meaning &quot; vicar &quot;, &quot; master &quot; and &quot; guardian &quot;. In large parts of the Muslim world, particularly Iran, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Central Asia, Somalia and South Asia, it is the name commonly given to local Islamic clerics or mosque leaders. [ The Failure of Political Islam Roy Olivier Olivier Roy (professor) 1994 28–9 Harvard University Press Cambridge, Massachusetts 0-674-29140-9 ] The title has also been used in some Sephardic Jewish communities to refer to the community&apos;s leadership, especially religious leadership. { See for example: Rabbinic Succession in Bukhara 1790-1930, } It is primarily understood in the Muslim world as a term of respect for an educated man. [ The spirit of Allah : Khomeini and the Islamic revolution Taheri Amir Amir Taheri 1985 53 Adler &amp; Adler Bethesda, Md. 0-917561-04-X ] [ Training and duties ] Ideally, a trained mullah will have studied Islamic traditions ( hadith ), and Islamic law ( fiqh ). They are often hafiz, i.e. have memorized the Qur&apos;an. However, uneducated villagers often recognize a literate Muslim with a less than complete Islamic training as their &quot; mullah &quot; or religious cleric. Mullahs with varying levels of training lead prayers in mosques, deliver religious sermons, and perform religious ceremonies such as birth rites and funeral services. They also often teach in a type of Islamic school known as a madrasah. These three kinds of knowledge are applied mostly in interpreting Islamic texts (i.e. the Quran, Hadiths, etc.) for matters of Shariah, i.e. Islamic law. Mullahs have frequently been involved in politics, but only recently have they actually taken power, when Islamists seized power in Iran in 1979, and later, in Afghanistan under the Taliban. [ Usage ] The term is most often applied to Shi&apos;ite clerics, as Shi&apos;a Islam is the predominant tradition in Iran. However, the term is very common in Urdu, spoken throughout Pakistan, and it is used throughout the Indian subcontinent for any Muslim clergy, Sunni or Shi&apos;a. Muslim clergy in Russia and other former Soviet Republic s are also referred to as mullahs, regardless of whether they are Sunni or Shi&apos;a. It has been used among Persian Jews, Bukharan Jews, Afghani Jews and other Central Asian Jews to refer to the community&apos;s religious and/or secular leadership. In Kaifeng, China as well, the historic Chinese Jews who managed the synagogue were called &quot; mullahs &quot;.

Oxford 48 2011-07-06 ] { (Original from the University of Michigan) } The term is seldom used in Arabic-speaking areas, where its nearest equivalent is shaykh (implying formal Islamic training), imam (prayer leader; not to be confused with the imams of the Shiite world), or &apos;&apos;ʿālim&apos;&apos; (‘scholar’, plural ʿulamāʾ). In the Sunni world, the concept of &quot; cleric &quot; is of limited usefulness, as authority in the religious system is relatively decentralized. The term is frequently used in English, although English-speaking Muslim clergy rarely call themselves mullahs. It was adopted from Urdu by the British rulers of India and subsequently came into more widespread use. [ Usage as a derogatory term ] [ June 2007 ] [ Iran ] Until early 20th century, the term mullah was used in Iranian hawza s (seminaries) to refer to low-level clergy who specialized in telling stories of Ashura, rather than teaching or issuing fatwa s. Today, the term is sometimes used as a derogatory term for any Islamic cleric. It is common in Iran to refer to an ayatollah or other high level cleric as a mullah, to ridicule his religious authority. [ November 2008 ] In recent years, at least among Shia mullahs, the term ruhani (spiritual) has been promoted as an alternative to mullah and akhoond, free of pejorative connotations. { Momen, Moojan, An Introduction to Shi&apos;i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p.203 } [ See also ] Maulvi Maulana Mullah Mohammed Omar Mullah Nasruddin Ulema International Imam Organization [ References ] [ Chinese and Japanese repository of facts and events in science, history and art, relating to Eastern Asia, Volume 1 1863 ] Category:Islamic Persian honorifics Category:Islamic terms Category:Islamic Urdu honorifics Category:Muslim theologians Category:Religious leadership roles Category:Sharia ar:ملا bg:Молла ca:Mul·là da:Mullah de:Mullah et:Mulla el:Μουλάς es:Mulá eo:Mulao fr:Mollah gl:Mulá id:Mullah he:מולא kk:Молда lbe:Малла ms:Mullah nl:Moellah ja:ムッラー no:Mulla pl:Mułła pt:Mulá ru:Мулла sq:Mulla simple:Mullah sl:Mula (naziv) sr:Мула (ислам) fi:Mullah sv:Mulla tt:Мулла tr:Molla uk:Мулла ur:ملا zh:穆拉
