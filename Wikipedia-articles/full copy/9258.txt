Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. { http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ } Major areas of study in ethics may be divided into 3 operational areas: { http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ } Meta-ethics, about the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions and how their truth value s (if any) may be determined; Normative ethics, about the practical means of determining a moral course of action; Applied ethics, about how moral outcomes can be achieved in specific situations; Each of these areas include many further sub-fields of study. [ Meta-ethics ] [ Meta-ethics ] Meta-ethics is a field within ethics that seeks to understand the nature of normative ethics. The focus of meta-ethics is on how we understand, know about, and what we mean when we talk about what is right and what is wrong. Meta-ethics came to the fore with G.E. Moore &apos;s Principia Ethica from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called the naturalistic fallacy. Moore was seen to reject naturalism in ethics, in his Open Question Argument. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish philosopher David Hume had put forward a similar view on the difference between facts and values. Studies of how we know in ethics divide into cognitivism and non-cognitivism; this is similar to the contrast between descriptivists and non-descriptivists. Non-cognitivism is the claim that when we judge something as right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may for example be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things. { http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/ } Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact. The ontology of ethics is about value-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific ontology, since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists on the other hand must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions. { Miller, C. (2009). The Conditions of Moral Realism. The Journal of Philosophical Research, 34, 123-155. } [ Normative ethics ] [ Normative ethics ] Traditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions. At the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and are no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but are interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in analytic philosophy and by the popularity of logical positivism. In 1971 John Rawls published A Theory of Justice, noteworthy in its pursuit of moral arguments and eschewing of meta-ethics. This publication set the trend for renewed interest in normative ethics. [ Virtue ethics ] [ Virtue ethics ] Socrates Virtue ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and is used to describe the ethics of Socrates, Aristotle, and other early Greek philosophers. Socrates (469  BC – 399  BC) was one of the first Greek philosophers to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, knowledge having a bearing on human life was placed highest, all other knowledge being secondary. Self-knowledge was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good, if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the result of ignorance. If a criminal were truly aware of the mental and spiritual consequences of his actions, he would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with virtue, he similarly equated virtue with happiness. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy. { Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. Ideas of the Great Philosophers. pp 32-33. } { Barnes &amp; Noble Books (1993). ISBN 978-1-56619-271-2. } Aristotle (384  BC – 322  BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed &quot; self-realizationism. &quot; In Aristotle&apos;s view, when a person acts in accordance with his nature and realizes his full potential, he will do good and be content. At birth, a baby is not a person, but a potential person. To become a &quot; real &quot; person, the child&apos;s inherent potential must be realized. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by the unrealized potential of a person, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Aristotle said, &quot; Nature does nothing in vain. &quot; Therefore, it is imperative for persons to act in accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or wealth, are merely means to the end. Self-realization, the awareness of one&apos;s nature and the development of one&apos;s talents, is the surest path to happiness. { Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. Ideas of the Great Philosophers. pp 33-35. Barnes &amp; Noble Books (1993). ISBN 978-1-56619-271-2. } Aristotle asserted that man had three natures: vegetable (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite) and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care, emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges, and mental through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. Moderation was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, courage is the moderate virtue between the extremes of cowardice and recklessness. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by moderate virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, to the right person, at the right time, to the proper extent, in the correct fashion, for the right reason. { Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. Ideas of the Great Philosophers. pp 35-37. Barnes &amp; Noble Books (1993). ISBN 978-1-56619-271-2. } [ Stoicism ] The Stoic philosopher Epictetus posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or Apatheia, was of the highest value; self-mastery over one&apos;s desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The &quot; unconquerable will &quot; is central to this philosophy. The individual&apos;s will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is in essence offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not &quot; lose &quot; their life, but instead &quot; return &quot;, for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the integrity and equilibrium of a man&apos;s mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud. { Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. Ideas of the Great Philosophers. pp 38-41. Barnes &amp; Noble Books (1993). ISBN 978-1-56619-271-2. } [ Epicureanism ] Epicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. Epicurus &quot; presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue &quot;. { Ancient Ethical Theory, } { Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. } He rejected the extremism of the Cyrenaics, believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. Epicureans observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus the summum bonum, or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often will cause a person to lose taste for it. Eating too much food at once will lead to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there was an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one&apos;s state in death in the absence of an afterlife. { Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. Ideas of the Great Philosophers. pp 37-38. Barnes &amp; Noble Books (1993). ISBN 978-1-56619-271-2. } [ Hedonism ] Hedonism posits that the principal ethic is maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating self-gratification regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people. { Sahakian, William S. &amp; Sahakian, Mabel Lewis. Ideas of the Great Philosophers. pg 37. Barnes &amp; Noble Books (1993). ISBN 978-1-56619-271-2. } [ Cyrenaic hedonism ] Founded by Aristippus of Cyrene, Cyrenaics supported immediate gratification or pleasure. &quot; Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. &quot; Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit for immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good. [ Consequentialism ] [ Utilitarianism Ethical egoism ] [ Consequentialism ] Consequentialism refers to moral theories that hold that the consequences of a particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action (or create a structure for judgment, see rule consequentialism ). Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the aphorism &quot; The ends justify the means &quot;. The term &quot; consequentialism &quot; was coined by G.E.M. Anscombe in her essay &quot; Modern Moral Philosophy &quot; in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by Mill and Sidgwick. [ G.E.M. Anscombe Modern Moral Philosophy Philosophy 33 1–19 http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html 10.1017/S0031819100037943 1958 Anscombe, G. E. M. 1958 124 ] Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory. The defining feature of consequentialist moral theories is the weight given to the consequences in evaluating the rightness and wrongness of actions. [ Mackie J. L. J._L._Mackie 1977 Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong Penguin London 0-14-013558-8 1990 ] In consequentialist theories, the consequences of an action or rule generally outweigh other considerations. Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address: What sort of consequences count as good consequences? Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action? How are the consequences judged and who judges them? One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to hedonistic utilitarianism, a good action is one that results in an increase in pleasure, and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is eudaimonic consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in material equality or political liberty instead of something like the more ephemeral &quot; pleasure &quot;. Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally. Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated. [ State consequentialism ] [ Mohist consequentialism ] Mohist consequentialism, also known as state consequentialism, [ Readings in classical Chinese philosophy 2005 Ivanhoe P.J. Van Norden Bryan William Hackett Publishing 978-0-87220-780-6 60 &quot; he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state ] is an ethical theory which evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the social harmony of a state. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as &quot; a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare. &quot; { Fraser, Chris, &quot; Mohism &quot;, } { The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edward N. Zalta. } Unlike utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, &quot; the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population &quot;. [ The Cambridge History of Ancient China 1999 Loewe Michael Shaughnessy Edward L. Cambridge University Press 978-0-521-47030-8 761 ] During Mozi &apos;s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The &quot; material wealth &quot; of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing, and the &quot; order &quot; of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi&apos;s stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability. [ Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy 2011 Van Norden Bryan W. Hackett Publishing 978-1-60384-468-0 52 ] Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison, in the The Cambridge History of Ancient China, writes that the moral goods of Mohism &quot; are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically. &quot; In contrast to Bentham, Mozi did not believe that individual happiness was important, the consequences of the state outweigh the consequences of individual actions. [ What is the purpose of houses? It is to protect us from the wind and cold of winter, the heat and rain of summer, and to keep out robbers and thieves. Once these ends have been secured, that is all. Whatever does not contribute to these ends should be eliminated. Mozi Mozi(5th century BC) Ch 20 ] [ Deontology ] [ Deontological ethics ] Deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek [ grc δέον ], deon, &quot; obligation, duty &quot;; and [ grc -λογία ], -logia ) is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining acts, or the intention s of the person doing the act, as it adheres to rules and duties. { Stanford.edu } This is contrast to consequentialism, in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself. In deontology, an act may be considered right even if the act produces a bad consequence, { Olson, Robert G. 1967. &apos;Deontological Ethics&apos;. In Paul Edwards (ed.) The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: } { Collier Macmillan : 343. } if it follows the rule that “one should do unto others as they would have done unto them”, { http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/ } and even if the person who does the act lacks virtue and had a bad intention in doing the act [ September 2009 ]. According to deontology, we have a duty to act in a way that does those things that are inherently good as acts ( &quot; truth-telling &quot; for example), or follow an objectively obligatory rule (as in rule utilitarianism ). For deontologists, the ends or consequences of our actions are not important in and of themselves, and our intentions are not important in and of themselves. Immanuel Kant&apos;s theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons. { Orend, Brian. 2000. War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective. West Waterloo, Ontario: } { Wilfrid Laurier University Press : 19. } { Kelly, Eugene. 2006. The Basics of Western Philosophy. } { Greenwood Press : 160. } First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (deon). { Kant, Immanuel. 1780. &apos;Preface&apos;. In The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics. Translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott } Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action. { Immanuel Kant } { right } Kant&apos;s argument that to act in the morally right way, one must act from duty, begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself, and good without qualification. { Kant, Immanuel. 1785. &apos;First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical&apos;, } { Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals. } Something is &apos;good in itself&apos; when it is intrinsically good, and &apos;good without qualification&apos; when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as intelligence, perseverance and pleasure, fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffering, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good: Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a good will. [ Pragmatic ethics ] [ Pragmatic ethics ] Associated with the pragmatists, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and especially John Dewey, pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes. Thus, we should prioritize social reform over attempts to account for consequences, individual virtue or duty (although these may be worthwhile attempts, provided social reform is provided for). [ Hugh Lafollette Blackwell Philosophy Guides 1 http://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/pragmati.htm 2000 February The Blackwell Guide to Ethical Theory 978-0-631-20119-9 Wiley-Blackwell harv ] [ Postmodern ethics ] [ July 2009 ] The 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier Marxist Theory efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action. Antihumanists such as Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault and structuralists such as Roland Barthes challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the &apos;individual&apos; itself. [ February 2010 ] As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, post-structuralism sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and &apos;objective&apos; reality. Jacques Derrida argued that access to meaning and the &apos;real&apos; was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that &quot; There is nothing outside the text &quot;; at the same time, Jean Baudrillard theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world. Post-structuralism and postmodernism argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions. A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible. There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized. Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, genealogy ) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individuated actions. Zygmunt Bauman says Postmodernity is best described as Modernity without illusion. The illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle. Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable. David Couzens Hoy states that Emmanuel Levinas &apos;s writings on the face of the Other and Derrida &apos;s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the &quot; ethical turn &quot; in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the &quot; obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable &quot; (2004, p.  103). Hoy&apos;s post-critique model uses the term ethical resistance. Examples of this would be an individual&apos;s resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual&apos;s resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas&apos;s account as &quot; not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless &quot; (2004, p.  8). Hoy concludes that [ The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other&apos;s lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p.184) ] In present day terms the powerless may include the unborn, the terminally sick, the aged, the insane, and non-human animals. It is in these areas that ethical action in Hoy&apos;s sense will apply. Until legislation or the state apparatus enforces a moral order that addresses the causes of resistance these issues will remain in the ethical realm. For example, should animal experimentation become illegal in a society, it will no longer be an ethical issue on Hoy&apos;s definition. Likewise one hundred and fifty years ago, not having a black slave in America would have been an ethical choice. This later issue has been absorbed into the fabric of an enforceable social order and is therefore no longer an ethical issue in Hoy&apos;s sense. [ Machine ethics ] [ Machine ethics ] In Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong, Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that issues in machine ethics will likely drive advancement in understanding of human ethics by forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation. [ Wendell Wallach Colin Allen 2008 November Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong 978-0-19-537404-9 Oxford University Press USA harv ] The effort to actually program a machine or artificial agent to behave as though instilled with a sense of ethics requires new specificity in our normative theories, especially regarding aspects customarily considered common-sense. For example, machines, unlike humans, can support a wide selection of learning algorithms, and controversy has arisen over the relative ethical merits of these options. This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms. [ Applied ethics ] [ Applied ethics ] Applied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations. The discipline has many specialized fields, such as Engineering Ethics, bioethics, public service ethics and business ethics. [ Specific questions ] [ May 2009 ] Applied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: &quot; Is getting an abortion immoral? &quot; &quot; Is euthanasia immoral? &quot; &quot; Is affirmative action right or wrong? &quot; &quot; What are human rights, and how do we determine them? &quot; &quot; Do animals have rights as well? &quot; and &quot; Do individuals have the right of self determination? &quot; A more specific question could be: &quot; If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed? &quot; Without these questions there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration — in fact, no common assumptions of all participants—so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, &quot; Is lying always wrong? &quot; and, &quot; If not, when is it permissible? &quot; is prior to any etiquette. People in-general are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites). However, in ethics the issues are most often multifaceted and the best proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions the answer is almost never a &quot; yes or no &quot;, &quot; right or wrong &quot; statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction. [ Particular fields of application ] [ Relational ethics ] Relational ethics are related to an ethics of care. { Gilligan, C. (1982). In a different Voice: Pscychological theory and women&apos;s development. Cambridge, MA: } { Harvard University Press. } They are used in qualitative research, especially ethnography and authoethnography. Researchers who employ relational ethics value and respect the connection between themselves and the people they study, and &quot; between researchers and the communities in which they live and work &quot; (Ellis, 2007, p.  4). { Ellis, C. (2007). Telling secrets, revealing lives: Relational ethics in research with intimate others. Qualitative Inquiry, 13, 3-29. } Relational ethics also help researchers understand difficult issues such as conducting research on intimate others that have died and developing friendships with their participants. { Ellis, C. (1986). Fisher folk. Two communities on Chesapeake Bay. Lexington: } { University Press of Kentucky. } { Ellis, C. (1995).Final negotiations: A story of love, loss, and chronic illness. Philadelphia: } { Temple University Press. } [ Military ethics ] [ March 2009 ] [ Nuremberg Principles Geneva Conventions ] Military ethics are intended to guide members of the armed forces to act in a manner consistent with the requirements of combat and military organization. While Just war theory is generally seen to set the background terms of moral debate, individual countries have more specific methods of upholding these ethical principles. In the United States, for example, the Department of Defense 5500.7-R (DoD 5500.7-R), serves as the primary regulatory source of ethical standards and conduct to members of the Armed Services (DoD, pg 1). Military ethics involves multiple subareas, including the following among others: justification for the initiation of military force decisions about who may be targeted in warfare standards for handling military prisoners methods of dealing with violations of the laws of war [ Public service ethics ] Public service ethics is a set of principles that guide public officials in their service to their constituents, including their decision-making on behalf of their constituents. Fundamental to the concept of public service ethics is the notion that decisions and actions are based on what best serves the public&apos;s interests, as opposed to the official&apos;s personal interests (including financial interests) or self-serving political interests. { See, for example, work of Institute for Local Government, at www.ca-ilg.org/trust. } [ Moral psychology ] [ Moral psychology ] Moral psychology is a field of study that began, like most things, as an issue in philosophy and that is now properly considered part of the discipline of psychology. Some use the term &quot; moral psychology &quot; relatively narrowly to refer to the study of moral development. { See, for example, Lapsley (2006) and &quot; moral psychology &quot; (2007). } However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics and psychology (and philosophy of mind ). { See, for example, Doris &amp; Stich (2008) and Wallace (2007). Wallace writes: &quot; Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions &quot; (p. 86). } Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are moral responsibility, moral development, moral character (especially as related to virtue ethics ), altruism, psychological egoism, moral luck, and moral disagreement. { See Doris &amp; Stich (2008), §1. } [ Evolutionary ethics ] [ Evolutionary ethics Evolution of morality ] Evolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as evolutionary psychology or sociobiology, with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices. [ http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ Evolutionary Ethics Doris Schroeder 2010-01-05 ] [ Descriptive ethics ] [ Descriptive ethics ] Descriptive ethics is a value-free approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science (specifically sociology ) rather than a humanity. It examines ethics not from a top-down a priori perspective but rather observations of actual choices made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a society or culture to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to situational ethics and situated ethics. These philosophers often view aesthetics, etiquette, and arbitration as more fundamental, percolating &quot; bottom up &quot; to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following: Ethical code s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics– and a personal moral core developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one&apos;s later ethical choices. Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is Judith Martin ( &quot; Miss Manners &quot; ). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of common sense social decisions. Practices in arbitration and law, e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing &quot; right versus right, &quot; i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation. Observed choices made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who vote, buy, and decide what is worth valuing. This is a major concern of sociology, political science, and economics.
