The area of the town is [ 2767.76 km2 sqmi ], stretching along Highway 11 from Lake Nipigon to Longlac; it is one of the largest incorporated towns in Canada. The town was formed in 2001, as part of a wave of community amalgamations under the Progressive Conservative government of Ontario. { Municipal Act RSO 1990 c.M.45 } It combined the former Townships of Beardmore and Nakina, the Towns of Geraldton and Longlac with large unincorporated portions of Unorganized Thunder Bay District. Greenstone includes the communities of Nakina, Geraldton, Longlac, Beardmore, Caramat, Jellicoe, Macdiarmid, and Orient Bay. Nakina and Caramat are entirely exclave d from the rest of the municipality&apos;s territory. [ History ] Nakina was first established in 1923 as a station and railway yard on the National Transcontinental Railway, between the divisional point s of Grant and Armstrong. Nakina was at Mile 15.9 of the NTR&apos;s Grant Sub-Division. Following the completion in 1924 of Canadian National Railways &apos;s Longlac-Nakina Cut-Off, connecting the rails of the Canadian Northern at Longlac and the NTR, Nakina became the new divisional point, and the buildings from the town of Grant (25 kilometers to the east) were moved to the new Nakina town site. As an important railway service stop from 1923 until 1986, the town had a railway round-house as well as a watering and fueling capability. During World War II, there was also a radar base [ Military Relations Between the United States and Canada 1939 - 1945 Dziuban Stanley W. 1970 196 http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Canada/USA-SS-Canada-7.html 2010-06-30 United States Army Center of Military History CMH Pub 11-5 ] on the edge of the town, intended to watch for a potential attack on the strategically important Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie. Research [ July 2010 ] into the radar site in the National Archives of Canada indicates that it was largely a United States Army Air Forces operation, pre-dating the Pinetree Line radar bases that were erected to focus on the Cold War threat. The Nakina base was totally removed shortly after the war. The Geraldton-Beardmore Gold Camp, in the heart of the Canadian Shield, hosts numerous mineralized zones which continue to be explored for potential development. Eight gold mines operated here between 1936 and 1970. In the 1970s pulp and paper operations near the town resulted in growth in the towns population to its peak of approximately 1200. However, at this point cost controls in the railway industry meant that service and maintenance could be consolidated at points much more distant from one another than had been common in the first half of the 20th century. As a result, the value of Nakina as a railway service community was greatly diminished, to the point where it was no longer a substantial employer in the town. Also in the 1970s, a radio station was launched in Longlac as CHAP on the AM dial, which left the air by the late 70s. { CHAP AM (1970-1977) - } { Canadian Communications Foundation. } [ 2004 ] the town remains focussed on tourism, diminished pulp and paper operations and support of other more northern communities (food, fuel and transportation). Mining and minerals industries are often seen as a source of further growth, though the Canadian Shield geology of the area makes extraction of minerals like gold an expensive operation. [ 2009 ], a proposed ore transport point around Nakina, as part of the Ring of Fire development, may shift the emphasis of local industry from logging back to mining. In 2010 the Ring of Fire development, proposed James Bay rail link and placement of processing plants remains of great economic interest for the region. Development is slated to move over the next three to five years in an over 1.5 billion dollar project.
