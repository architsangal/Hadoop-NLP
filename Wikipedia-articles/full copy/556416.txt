[ Series premise ] The recurring characters were Hoppity Hooper, a frog, voiced by Chris Allen, &quot; Uncle &quot; Waldo P. Wigglesworth, a fox, voiced by Hans Conried; Fillmore, a bear wearing Civil War clothes, voiced by Bill Scott; and the narrator, Paul Frees. Fillmore, as in the picture at right, often blew on his bugle, producing loud, sour notes. The stories revolved around the three main characters, who lived in Foggy Bog, Wisconsin, seeking their fortune together, through different jobs or schemes, usually ending in misadventure. Each story consisted of four short cartoons, one aired at the beginning and end of two series episodes. Interspersed were recycled second features from the earlier series Rocky and His Friends &amp; The Bullwinkle Show and Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales (the latter not produced by Ward but animated by the same company, Gamma Productions ), like Peabody&apos;s Improbable History, Fractured Fairy Tales, Mr. Know-It-All, and The World of Commander McBragg. One of the best-remembered stories is &quot; The Traffic Zone, &quot; a parody of The Twilight Zone in which the characters were transformed into vegetables. [ Background ] The first two episodes were produced in 1960 and featured Alan Reed as Fillmore. The series wasn&apos;t picked up for broadcast until September 1964, and by that time Reed was unavailable, because of his commitment with another ABC animated TV series, The Flintstones, as the voice of Fred Flintstone. Therefore, Bill Scott was named to do the voice of Fillmore. The series was broadcast by ABC from September 12, 1964 to September 3, 1966. ABC continued to air reruns until September 2, 1967. The series was syndicated to local television stations through the 1970s and 1980s. The series was later syndicated under the title Uncle Waldo&apos;s Cartoon Show. [ Episodes ] In the course of two seasons, 52 weekly episodes were broadcast. Each episode contained two Hoppity Hooper shorts. With two exceptions (as noted), each story line consisted of two episodes (or four shorts).
