[ al-Jama&apos;ah al-Islamiyah al-Musallaha Gialogo-1.jpg 200px 1992–present The creation of an Islamic state Algeria Takfir wal-Hijra Islamism ] The Armed Islamic Group (GIA, al-Jama&apos;ah al-Islamiyah al-Musallaha, from French Groupe Islamique Armé; Arabic الجماعة الإسلامية المسلّحة ) is an Islamist organisation that wants to overthrow the Algeria n government and replace it with an Islamic state. The GIA adopted violent tactics in 1992 after the military government voided the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front, the largest Islamic opposition party, in the first round of legislative elections held in December 1991. During their 1994 hijack of Air France Flight 8969 the GIA announced &quot; We are the Soldiers of Mercy &quot;.

Allah has selected us as his soldiers. We are here to wage war in his name. 2009-02-14 Peter Taylor (journalist) ] Between 1992 and 1998 the GIA conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation (see List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s; notably the Bentalha massacre and Rais massacre, among others.) Since announcing its campaign against foreigners living in Algeria in 1993, the GIA has killed more than 100 expatriate men and women in the country. The group uses assassinations and bombings, including car bombs, and it is known to favor kidnapping victims. The GIA is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Algeria, France and the United States. Outside of Algeria, the GIA established a presence in France, Belgium, Britain, Italy and the United States. [ History ] Early in 1992, Mansour Meliani, with many &quot; Afghans &quot;, broke with his former friend Abdelkader Heresay and left the MIA ( Islamic Armed Movement ), founding the first Armed Islamic Group (GIA) around July 1992. This group dispersed after his arrest that month, but the idea was revived in January 1993 by Abdelhak Layada, who declared his group independent of Heresay and not obedient to his orders. It adopted the radical Omar El-Eulmi as a spiritual guide, affirming that &quot; political pluralism is equivalent to sedition &quot; { Abdelhak Layada, quoted in } { Jeune Afrique, 27 January 1994. } It was far less selective than the MIA, which insisted on ideological training; as a result, it was regularly infiltrated by the security forces, resulting in a rapid leadership turnover as successive heads were killed. It explicitly affirmed that it &quot; did not represent the armed wing of the FIS &quot;, { Agence France-Presse, 20 November 1993. } and issued death threats against several FIS and MIA members, including MIA&apos;s Heresay and FIS&apos;s Kebir and Redjam. From its inception on, the GIA called for and implemented the killing of anyone collaborating with or supporting the authorities, including government employees such as teachers and civil servants. It named and assassinated specific journalists and intellectuals (such as Tahar Djaout ), saying that &quot; The journalists who fight against Islamism through the pen willperish by the sword. &quot;. { Sid Ahmed Mourad, quoted in Jeune Afrique, 27/1/94. } It soon broadened its attacks to civilians who refused to live by their prohibitions, and in later 1993 began killing foreigners, declaring that &quot; anyone who exceeds that period [a one month deadline] will be responsible for his own sudden death { The Times, 20 November 1993. } &quot; [ Guerrilla army ] Djamel Zitouni was the leader of the group Under Cherif Gousmi (its leader since March), the GIA became the most high-profile terrorist organization in 1994. In May, FIS suffered an apparent blow as Abderrezak Redjam, Mohammed Said, the exiled Anwar Haddam, and the MEI&apos;s Said Makhloufi joined the GIA; since the GIA had been issuing death threats against them since November 1993, this came as a surprise to many observers, who interpreted it either as the result of intra-FIS competition or as an attempt to change the GIA&apos;s course from within. On August 26, it declared a &quot; Caliphate &quot;, or Islamic government for Algeria, with Gousmi as Commander of the Faithful, Mohammed Said as head of government, the US-based Haddam as foreign minister, and Mekhloufi as provisional interior minister. However, the very next day Said Mekhloufi announced his withdrawal from the GIA, claiming that the GIA had deviated from Islam and that this &quot; Caliphate &quot; was an effort by Mohammed Said to take over the GIA, and Haddam soon afterwards denied ever having joined it, asserting that this Caliphate was an invention of the security services. The GIA continued attacking its usual targets, notably assassinating artists, such as Cheb Hasni, and in late August added a new one to its list, threatening schools which allowed mixed classes, music, gym for girls, or not wearing hijab with arson. Cherif Gousmi was eventually succeeded by Djamel Zitouni as GIA head. Zitouni extended the GIA&apos;s attacks on civilians to French soil, beginning with the hijacking of Air France Flight 8969 at the end of December 1994 and continuing with several bombings and attempted bombings throughout 1995. In Algeria itself, he continued likewise, with car bombs, assassinations of musicians, sportsmen, and unveiled women as well as the usual victims. Even at this stage, the seemingly counterproductive nature of many of its attacks led to speculation (encouraged by FIS members abroad) that the group had been infiltrated by Algerian secret services. The region south of Algiers, in particular, came to be virtually dominated by the GIA; they called it the &quot; liberated zone &quot;. Later it would be known as the &quot; triangle of death &quot;. During this period, judging from its London-based magazine Al-Ansar, it worked out ever broader ideological justifications for killing civilians, with the help of fatwa s from such figures as Abu Qatada. Abu Qatada&apos;s writings and speeches have been critically assessed by a contemporary Muslim scholar, Shaykh &apos;Abdul-Malik ar-Ramadani al-Jaza&apos;iri, in the book Takhlis al-&apos;Ibad min Wahshiyyat Ab&apos;il-Qataad aladhi yu&apos;du ila Qatli&apos;n-Nisa wa Awlad (Jeddah: Maktabah Asalah al-Athariyyah, 1422AH [ Shaykh &apos;Abdul-Malik ar-Ramadani al-Jaza&apos;iri The Savage Barbarism of Aboo Qataadah http://www.salafimanhaj.com/pdf/SalafiManhajQataadah.pdf pdf 2007 lecture given at Masjid Ibn Taymeeyah ( Brixton Mosque, London) on Sunday 21 August 2005 CE.

On July 11, they assassinated a co-founder of FIS, Abdelbaki Sahraoui, in Paris (although some question the authenticity of their statement claiming credit for this.) During the 1995 election, the GIA threatened to kill anyone who voted (using the slogan &quot; one vote, one bullet &quot;.) Soon afterwards, the GIA was shaken by internal dissension: shortly after the election, its leadership killed the FIS leaders who had joined the GIA - Mohammed Saïd, Abderrezak Redjam, and their supporters, accusing them of attempting a takeover. Other Islamists suggested that they had objected to the GIA&apos;s indiscriminate violence. This purge accelerated the disintegration of the GIA, leading to suspicion of Zitouni&apos;s leadership: Mustapha Kartali, Ali Benhadjar, and Hassan Hattab &apos;s factions all refused to recognize Zitouni&apos;s leadership starting around late 1995, although they would not formally break away until somewhat later. The GIA killed the AIS leader for central Algeria, Azzedine Baa, in December, and in January pledged to fight the AIS as an enemy; particularly in the west, full-scale battles between them became common. In July 1996, GIA leader Djamel Zitouni was killed by one of the breakaway factions - Ali Benhadjar &apos;s Medea brigade, later to become the AIS-aligned Islamic League for Da&apos;wa and Jihad - and was succeeded by Antar Zouabri. Djamel Zitouni had earned notoriety for such acts as the killing of the seven Monks of Tibhirine in March, but his successor would prove to be far bloodier. Under the leadership of Antar Zouabri, its longest serving &quot; emir &quot; (1996–2002), the GIA became a &quot; takfiri &quot; group, considering Algerian society to be in violation of Islamic precepts, therefore justifying the killing of members of that society as a form of purification of heretical elements. Like some of his predecessors, Zouabri was himself killed in a gun battle with security forces, in February 2002. The group&apos;s leadership next passed on to Rachid Abou Tourab, who was allegedly killed by close aides in July 2004. Next, Boulenouar Oukil was designated leader of the group. On April 7, the GIA was reported to have killed 14 civilians at a fake road block. On April 29, Oukil was arrested. [ Algeria&apos;s top GIA rebel captured http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4500171.stm BBC news 2005-04-29 2009-02-14 ] Nourredine Boudiafi iwas the last known &quot; emir &quot; of the GIA. He was arrested sometime in November 2004 and the Algerian government announced his arrest in early January 2005. [ Algeria reveals rebel crackdown http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4144265.stm BBC news 2005-01-04 2009-02-14 ] In Algeria, however, the group&apos;s repeated massacres of civilians had drained popular support (although rumors persist that security forces were involved in some of the massacres, or even controlled the group). Meanwhile, a 1999 amnesty law that was officially rejected by the GIA was accepted by many rank-and-file Islamist fighters; an estimated 85 percent surrendered their arms and returned to civilian life. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat ( GSPC ) splinter faction appears to have eclipsed the GIA since approximately 1998 and is currently assessed by the CIA to be the most effective armed group remaining inside Algeria. Both the GIA and GSPC leadership continue to proclaim their rejection of President Bouteflika&apos;s amnesty, but in contrast to the GIA, the GSPC has stated that it avoids attacks on civilians. [ GIA in France ] The Algerian state pursued a number of strategies against the GIA. One was to encourage France to take an active part in the fight against the networks of the GIA in France, and thus to cut off its principal means of support abroad. In an unsuccessful attempt to keep France out of the struggle, the GIA hijacked Air France Flight 8969, which was due to fly from Algiers to Paris in December 1994. A GIA mole named Omar Nasiri (a pseudonym for a Moroccan spy and author of Inside the Jihad) and a police raid of a safe house discovered their plan was to crash it on Paris, a plan prevented when the GIGN stormed the plane at Marseille.

Analysis of a bomb with a failed trigger mechanism made it possible to identify a conspirator, Khaled Kelkal, who was shot and killed by French gendarmes on September 29, 1995. In late 1999, several GIA members were convicted by a French court for the 1995 bombing campaign. { Institute for Counter Terrorism, 2 June 1999. } In 1998, prior to the World Cup, France in collaboration with other European countries launched a vast preventive operation against the GIA. About 100 alleged members of the group were arrested throughout Europe. In Belgium, security forces seized weapons, detonators and forged identity papers. { National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, April 1999. } On June 11, 1999, the GIA announced a jihad on French territory in a threatening letter addressed to the media. [ Claims of Algerian Government involvement ] International security analyst Nafeez Ahmed claims GIA atrocities were in fact perpetrated by the state. He claims ‘Yussuf-Joseph’, a career secret agent in Algeria’s sécurité militaire for 14 years, defected to Britain in 1997 and told the Guardian that civilian massacres in Algeria, blamed on the GIA, were ‘the work of secret police and army death squads… not Islamic extremists’. GIA terrorism was ‘orchestrated’ by ‘Mohammed Mediane, head of the Algerian secret service’, and ‘General Smain Lamari’, head of ‘the counter intelligence agency’. According to Ahmed &apos;Joseph&apos; says: ‘The GIA is a pure product of Smain’s secret service. I used to read all the secret telexes. I know that the GIA has been infiltrated and manipulated by the Government. The GIA has been completely turned by the Government… In 1992 Smain created a special group, L’Escadron de la Mort (the Squadron of Death)… The death squads organize the massacres… The FIS aren’t doing the massacres.’ [ Nafeez Ahmed Our terrorists http://www.newint.org/features/2009/10/01/blowback-extended-version/ October 1, 2009 New Internationalist Magazine ] &apos;Joseph&apos; is also supposed to have confirmed that Algerian intelligence agents organized ‘at least’ two of the bombs in Paris in summer 1995. ‘The operation was run by Colonel Souames Mahmoud, alias Habib, head of the secret service at the Algerian embassy in Paris.’ According to Ahmed&apos;s theories, &apos;Joseph&apos;s testimony has been corroborated by numerous defectors from the Algerian secret services. [ Nafeez Ahmed The War on Truth: 9/11, Disinformation and the Anatomy of Terrorism Interlink New York 2005 65–77 ] Ahmed claims that Western intelligence agencies are implicated. Secret British Foreign Office documents revealed in a terrorist trial in 2000 showed that ‘British intelligence believed the Algerian Government was involved in atrocities, contradicting the view the Government was claiming in public’. The documents referred to the ‘manipulation of the GIA being used as a cover to carry out their own operations’, and that ‘there was no evidence to link 1995 Paris bombings to Algerian militants’.
