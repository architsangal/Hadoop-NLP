President Benjamin Harrison Republican Party (United States) Grover Cleveland Democratic Party (United States) ] In the United States presidential election of 1892, former President Grover Cleveland ran for re-election against the incumbent President Benjamin Harrison, who was also running for re-election. Cleveland defeated Harrison, thus becoming the only person in American history to be elected to a second, non-consecutive presidential term. Cleveland, who had won the popular vote against Harrison in 1888, lost the electoral vote (and thus the election) in that year. He won both the popular and electoral vote in the re-match election. Consequently, Cleveland joined Andrew Jackson and, later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt as the only candidates to win the popular vote in at least three U.S. presidential elections. The campaign centered mainly on the issue of a sound currency. The new Populist Party, formed by groups from the Grange, the Farmers&apos; Alliances, and the Knights of Labor, polled more than a million votes, but Cleveland won easily. Cleveland also became the first Democrat to be nominated by his party three consecutive times, a distinction that would be equaled only by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 and then exceeded by him in 1944. Although William Jennings Bryan was nominated for a third time in 1908, it was not consecutive with his two other nominations in 1896 and 1900.

Platt and other disaffected party leaders mounted a dump-Harrison movement coalescing around veteran candidate James G. Blaine of Maine, the president&apos;s forces had the nomination locked up by the time delegates met in Minneapolis on June 7-10, 1892. Richard Thomas of Indiana delivered Harrison&apos;s nominating speech. Harrison was nominated on the first ballot with 535.17 votes to 182.83 for Blaine, 182 for William McKinley of Ohio, and the rest scattered. The strength of McKinley, nominally a favorite-son candidate, surprised many observers. Whitelaw Reid of New York, editor of the New York Tribune and recent U.S. Ambassador to France, was nominated for vice-president. The Republican platform supported high tariffs, bimetallism, stiffer immigration laws, free rural mail delivery, and a canal across Central America. It also expressed sympathy for Ireland&apos;s struggle for home rule and the plight of Jews under persecution in czarist Russia. Presidential Ballot Ballot 1st Benjamin Harrison 535.17 James G.

Hill of New York Governor Horace Boies of Iowa Senator Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland Cleveland/Stevenson campaign poster By the end of Harrison&apos;s term, many Americans were ready to return to Cleveland&apos;s harder policies. As Democrats convened in Chicago, Illinois on June 8-11, 1892, Cleveland was the frontrunner for the nomination, but faced formidable opposition. He had come out against the free coinage of silver, thereby earning the enmity of Western and Southern Democrats. Most damaging of all was the opposition of his home state; the New York delegation, packed with Tammany men, frequently demonstrated their hostility to Cleveland&apos;s candidacy on the convention floor. In a narrow first-ballot victory, Cleveland received 617.33 votes, barely 10 more than needed, to 114 for Senator David B. Hill of New York, the candidate of Tammany Hall, 103 for Governor Horace Boies of Iowa, a populist and former Republican, and the rest scattered. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice-president, they accepted the convention favorite, Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois. { William DeGregorio, The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents, Gramercy 1997 } As a supporter of using greenbacks and free silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in rural districts, Stevenson balanced the ticket headed by Cleveland, the hard-money, gold-standard supporter. { Adlai Ewing Stevenson, 23rd Vice President (1893-1897), http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Adlai_Stevenson.htm } Presidential Ballot Ballot 1st Grover Cleveland 617.33 David B.

They formed the People&apos;s Party, usually called the People&apos;s Party, a year later in St. Louis, Missouri. At the first Populist national convention in Omaha, Nebraska in July 1892, James B. Weaver of Iowa was nominated for president on the first ballot. James G. Field of Virginia was nominated for vice-president. The Populist platform called for nationalization of the telegraph, telephone, and railroads, free coinage of silver, a graduated income tax, and creation of postal savings banks.

Stewart of Ohio National Prohibition Convention, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1892. The 6th Prohibition Party National Convention assembled in Music Hall in Cincinnati. There were 972 delegates present from all states except Louisiana and South Carolina. Two major stories about the convention loomed before it assembled. In the first place, some members of the national committee sought to merge the Prohibition and Populist Parties. While there appeared a likelihood that the merger would materialize, by convention time it was clear that it was not going to happen. Secondly, the southern states sent a number of black delegates. Cincinnati hotels refused to serve meals to blacks and whites at the same time, and several hotels refused all service to the black delegates. The convention nominated John Bidwell of California for president on the first ballot. Prior to the convention, the race was thought to be close between Bidwell and William Jennings Demorest, but the New York delegation became irritated with Demorest and voted for Bidwell 73-7. James B. Cranfill of Texas was nominated for vice-president on the first ballot with 417 votes to 351 for Joshua Levering of Maryland and 45 for others. { http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=278273 } Presidential Ballot Ballot 1st John Bidwell 590 Gideon T.

The tariff issue dominated this rather lackluster campaign. Harrison defended the protectionist McKinley Tariff passed during his term: Cleveland, assuring voters that he opposed absolute free trade, continued his campaign for a reduction in the tariff. William McKinley campaigned extensively for Harrison, setting the stage for his own run four years later. The campaign took a somber turn when, in October, First Lady Caroline Harrison died. Despite the ill health that had plagued Mrs. Harrison since her youth and had worsened in the last decade, she often accompanied Mr. Harrison on official travels. On one such trip, to California in the spring of 1891, she caught a cold. It quickly deepened into her chest, and she was eventually diagnosed with tuberculosis. A summer in the Adirondack Mountains failed to restore her to health. An invalid the last six months of her life, she died in the White House on October 25, 1892, just two weeks before the national election. As a result, all of the candidates ceased campaigning. [ Results ] Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate. Shades of blue are for Cleveland (Democratic), shades of red are for Harrison (Republican), and shades of green are for Weaver (Populist). The margin in the popular vote for Cleveland was 400,000, the largest since Grant&apos;s re-election in 1872. { The Gilded Age: Perspectives on the Origins of Modern America, Edited by Charles W. Calhoun, pg. 275 } The Democrats won the presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time since the Civil War. President Harrison&apos;s reelection bid was a total loss across the board, as had been President Cleveland&apos;s reelection bid four years earlier, in 1888. At the county level, the Democratic candidate fared much better than the Republican candidate. Harrison managed to win only 1,017 counties while Cleveland carried 1,389. The Republicans&apos; vote was not nearly as widespread as the Democrats. In 1892, it was still a sectionally based party mainly situated in the East, Midwest, and West and was barely visible south of the Mason-Dixon Line. In only a few counties in the South was the party holding on. In East Tennessee and tidewater Virginia, the vote at the county level showed some strength, but it barely existed in Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. { Presidential Elections, 1789-2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data, Donald R. Deskins, Jr., Hanes Walton, Jr., and Sherman C. Puckett, pg. 250 } Populist James B. Weaver, calling for free coinage of silver and an inflationary monetary policy, received such strong support in the West that he become the only third-party nominee between 1860 and 1912 to carry a single state. In the end, Weaver managed to carry 276 counties. Weaver also performed well in the South as he won counties in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas. Populists did best in Alabama, where electoral chicanery probably carried the day for Democrats. { The Gilded Age: Perspectives on the Origins of Modern America, Edited by Charles W. Calhoun, pg. 295 } The Prohibition ticket received 270,879, or 2.2% nationwide. It was the largest total vote and highest percentage of the vote received by any Prohibition Party national ticket. Wyoming, having attained statehood two years earlier, became the first state to allow women to vote in a presidential election since 1804. (Women in New Jersey had the right to vote under the state&apos;s original constitution, but this right was rescinded in 1807.) Wyoming was also one of six states (along with North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, and Idaho) participating in their first presidential election—other than the first election, the most in American history. This was the first election in which an incumbent president was defeated for a second time in a row. This would not happen again until 1980.
