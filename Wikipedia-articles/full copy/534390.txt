It was the world&apos;s first } { turbofan -powered airliner. } [ Design and development ] Developed from the medium-range Tupolev Tu-104, the Tu-124 was meant to meet Aeroflot &apos;s requirement for a regional airliner to supersede the Ilyushin Il-14 on the airline’s domestic routes. Resembling a 75% scaled-down version, the two were hard to tell apart when seen at a distance. However, it was not a complete copy of the Tu-104. The Tu-124 included a number of refinements, including double-slotted flaps, a large centre-section airbrake and automatic spoilers. Unlike the Tu-104, the wing trailing edge inboard of the undercarriage was unswept. { &quot; TU-124 - Details of Tupolev&apos;s Medium Range Turbofan &quot; Flight International, 16th August 1962, pp.229-230, article includes drawings } The Tu-124 retained a drogue parachute to be used in the event of an emergency landing or landing on a slippery surface and had low pressure tires to aid operation from unpaved airfields. { Gunston 1995, p. 433. } { Stroud 1968, pp. 227–229. } As with the Tu-104, the engines were integrated into the wings, but it enjoyed much better fuel efficiency, due to the use of turbofan engines. However, the non-optimal placement of the engines amplified vibrations, which affected the comfort of the passenger cabin, and also the fatigue lifetime of the wing assembly. The standard seating of the basic version was 44 seats. The first of two prototype, SSSR-45000 (C/N 0350101) made its first flight from Zhukovsky airfield on 24 March 1960. The second prototype, SSSR-45001 (C/N 0350102), followed in June 1960. Two other airframes served as a static test cells. Testing was successful, and the aircraft entered production at Factory 135 at Kharkov, Ukraine, replacing the Tu-104 in production. { Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 134. } Deliveries to Aeroflot began in August 1962, with the type operating its first scheduled passenger service, between Moscow and Tallinn in Estonia, on 2 October 1962. { Duffy and Kandalov 1996, pp. 134–135. } [ Operational history ] Aeroflot was impressed with the flight performance of the Tu-124, and began placing it into service on domestic routes from the end of 1962. The improved Tu-124V, which could seat 56 passengers instead of the 44 of the original model, and which had increased range and maximum take-off weight, came into service in 1964. Despite the aircraft&apos;s low purchase price (stated as $1.45 millon in 1965) and low operating costs, few were exported, with Československé Státní Aerolinie (ČSA) and the East German airline Interflug being the only airlines other than Aeroflot that bought the Tu-124 new, although ČSA sold its surviving Tu-124s to Iraqi Airways for use on VIP flights in 1973. Interflug used its three Tu-124s as an alternative to the Ilyushin Il-62, when the Il-62s were grounded due to mechanical issues. All three were sold back to the Soviet Union in 1975. Three airframes were completed in 1966 in a VIP configuration, and designated Tu-124K. However, Aeroflot never placed them into service, and they were purchased by the Indian Air Force. A number were also sold to military users, including the Soviet Air Force, which used them as navigational trainers, and to the Chinese Air Force. { Duffy and Kandalov 1996, pp. 135–136. } A total of 164 Tu-124s were built. { Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 224. } Issues with the safety of the Tu-104 had an impact on the fate of the Tu-124, although the reliability of the Tu-124 was slightly better. In 1965, the aircraft was withdrawn from production. In the USSR, Aeroflot decommissioned its last twelve Tu-124s on 21 January 1980. The Tu-124 continued in operation for some years with the Soviet Air Force and in Iraq, but all aircraft were withdrawn before 1990. Several Tu-124s have been preserved. One is in the museum of Kharkov State Aircraft Manufacturing Company (formerly the Tu-124 manufacturer Factory 135), another is in China&apos;s Datangshan aviation museum in Beijing and a third is at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino outside Moscow. A Tu-124K is on display at New Delhi Airport. [ Competition within the COMECON ] The German Democratic Republic attempted to compete within the COMECON trading bloc with its own four-engined design called the Baade B-152. The design was unsuccessful, leading Interflug to buy a rear-engined development of the Tu-124, the Tupolev Tu-134, instead. [ Variants ] Tu-124/Tu-124V The first production variant. International demand was small, as most foreign airlines were waiting to buy the improved Tupolev Tu-134 Tu-124B Three prototypes with D-20P-125 engines, built in 1963 Tu-124K/Tu-124K2 VIP configuration operated by the militaries of Iraq and the Peoples&apos; Republic of China, and by the Indian Air Force Tu-124Sh-1 Military version used as navigator trainer Tu-124Sh-2 Military version used as navigator trainer [ Operators ] [ Tu-124 Tu-124 operators (countries with only military operators in dark red) ] [ Civil operators ] ČSA Interflug (operated in Interflug colours, but owned by the East German Air Force) [ Iraq 1963 ] Iraqi Airways Aeroflot [ Military operators ] People&apos;s Liberation Army Air Force Czechoslovakian Air Force East German Air Force Indian Air Force [three Tu-124K VIP variants] [ Iraq 1963 ] Iraqi Air Force Soviet Air Force [ Accidents and incidents ] A total of 13 Tu-124s were written off in crashes during the type&apos;s operational career, and two aircraft of Iraqi Airways were destroyed on the ground during the Gulf War { Aviation Safety Network list of Tu-124 hull losses retrieved 14 September 2011 } [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ Czechoslovakia ] [ Swiss ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ India ] [ India ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ Iraq ] [ Iraq ] [ Iraq ] [ Iraq ] Date Tail number Crash Site Casualties Brief description 21 August 1963 45021 Leningrad 0/52 ditched in the Neva river in Leningrad after it ran out of fuel.
