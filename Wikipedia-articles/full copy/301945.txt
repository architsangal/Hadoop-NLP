[ Christianity ] In the Catholic Church, Holy Days of Obligation or Holidays of Obligation, { In Scotland and Ireland and elsewhere } less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the Code of Canon Law states: [ On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are obliged to participate in the Mass. Moreover they are to abstain from those works and affairs which hinder the worship to be rendered to God, the joy proper to the Lord’s day, or the suitable relaxation of mind and body. ] [ Eastern Catholic Churches ] The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches lays down the following norms for Eastern Catholic Churches : [ It is for the authority competent to establish the particular law of a sui iurisChurch to constitute, transfer or suppress feast days and days of penance for that sui iurisChurch, after, however, seeking the views of other sui iurisChurches and observing canon 40 §1. canon 880 §2 (translation corrected to correspond to the original Latin ). Canon 40 §1, referred to here, says: &quot; Hierarchs who preside over sui iuris Churches and other hierarchs are to attend very zealously to the faithful protection and exact observance of their own rite; they are not to admit changes in it except by reason of its organic progress, keeping in mind, however, mutual goodwill and the unity of Christians. &quot; Holy days of obligation common to all the Eastern Churches are, apart from Sundays, the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Epiphany, the Ascension, the Dormition of Holy Mary the Mother of God, and the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, except for a particular law of a sui iurisChurch, approved by the Apostolic See, which suppresses some holy days of obligation or transfers them to a Sunday. canon 880 §3 The Christian faithful are bound by the obligation to participate on Sundays and feast days in the Divine Liturgy or, according to the prescriptions or legitimate customs of their own sui iurisChurch, in the celebration of the divine praises. canon 881 §1 ] [ Latin Catholic Church ] The holy days of obligation for Latin Catholics are indicated in canon 1246 of the Code of Canon Law: [ §1. Sunday, on which by apostolic tradition the paschal mystery is celebrated, must be observed in the universal Church as the primordial holy day of obligation. The following days must also be observed: the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Epiphany, the Ascension, the Body and Blood of Christ, Holy Mary the Mother of God, her Immaculate Conception, her Assumption, Saint Joseph, Saint Peter and Saint Paul the Apostles, and All Saints. §2. With the prior approval of the Apostolic See, however, the conference of bishops can suppress some of the holy days of obligation or transfer them to a Sunday. ] Placed in the order of the civil calendar, the ten days (apart from Sundays) that this canon mentions are: 1 January: Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God 6 January: the Epiphany 19 March: Solemnity of St. Joseph, Husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary Thursday of the sixth week of Easter : the Ascension Thursday after Trinity Sunday : the Body and Blood of Christ 29 June: Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul, Apostles 15 August: the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary 1 November: All Saints 8 December: the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary 25 December: the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ ( Christmas ) The number of holy days of obligation was once much greater. With the motu proprio Supremi disciplinae of 2 July 1911, Pope Pius X reduced the number of such non-Sunday holy days from 36 to 8 (the above 10 minus the feasts of the Body and Blood of Christ and Saint Joseph). { &apos;&apos;Supremi disciplinæ&apos;&apos; in } { Catholic Encyclopedia } The present list was established in 1917. { Codex Iuris Canonici canon 1247 (1917). } In many countries the bishops had obtained, even before the time of Pope Pius X, the Holy See&apos;s approval to diminish the number of non-Sunday holy days of obligation, making it far less than 36. Today too, Episcopal Conference s have availed themselves of the authority granted them in law to reduce the number below the ten mentioned above. Non-Sunday holy days of obligation all have the rank of solemnity. Accordingly, if in Ordinary Time one of them falls on a Sunday, the Sunday celebration gives way to it; but the Sundays of Advent, Lent and Eastertide take precedence over all solemnities, which are then transferred to another day. { General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar § 5. } [ Latin-Rite observance by country ] In Vatican City, but not in the rest of the Diocese of Rome, Sundays and all ten days listed in canon 1246 are observed as holy days of obligation. This is also the case in the Swiss canton of Ticino, but perhaps nowhere else. Some countries have as holy days of obligation feasts that are not among those listed in canon 1246. Ireland has Saint Patrick&apos;s Day. { Liturgical Calendar } Germany has St. Stephen on the &quot; Second Christmas Day &quot; (26 December), Easter Monday and Pentecost Monday (Whit Monday). { Feiertagsregelung } In countries where they are not holy days of obligation, three of the ten feast days listed above are assigned to a Sunday as their proper day: { General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 7 } The Epiphany to the Sunday that falls between 2 and 8 January; The Ascension of Our Lord to the following Sunday; The Body and Blood of Christ to the following Sunday. If they are thus assigned to a Sunday, they are not included in the following national lists of holy days of obligation, since in every country all Sundays are holy days of obligation.

The attributes &quot; holy day of obligation &quot; and &quot; public holiday &quot; coincide; thus, not only dioceses have different ones but even in districts of the same diocese, the law is different; practically, it depends on which Bundesland, not which diocese you are in. In addition, Good Friday, which is another public holiday, is in practice, though not by Church law, celebrated in a way similar to the holy days of obligation, with attendance at the liturgical service, which on that day is distinct from celebration of Mass. Austria, Switzerland and German-speaking areas in neighbouring countries have similar rules.
