It is the most densely populated and southernmost region in Canada. Situated south of Algonquin Park it covers between 14 to 15% of the province, depending on the inclusion of the Parry Sound and Muskoka districts. Southern Ontario differs very greatly from Northern Ontario. The region has a larger population, different climate, and different culture than its northern counterpart. Southern Ontario can also be broken into smaller subregions, such as Central Ontario, Eastern Ontario, Southwestern Ontario, and the Golden Horseshoe. [ Identity ] Southern Ontario can be distinguished from Northern Ontario because it is far more densely populated and contains the majority of the province&apos;s cities, major roads, and institutions. (The north, in contrast, contains more natural resources and remote wilderness.) Although it has no saltwater coastline, the region has an abundance of fresh water coastline on three Great Lakes ( Huron, Erie and Ontario ) as well as smaller lakes such as Lake Simcoe and Lake St. Clair. It is a major vineyard region and producer of Canadian wine s. [ http://www.winesofcanada.com/regions.html Winesofcanada.com Winesofcanada.com 2011-03-10 ] While Southern Ontario has been a part of the province of Ontario since its establishment at Confederation in 1867, having previously formed the colony of Upper Canada, a large portion of Northern Ontario did not become part of Ontario until 1912. [ Demographics ] Toronto, ON Southern Ontario is home to over 92 per cent, or 12.1 million, of Ontario&apos;s total population of 13.1 million people (and about 35% of Canada&apos;s total population), compared to approximately 1 million in Northern Ontario. This is due to many factors, including the more arable land in the south, its more moderate climate, well-used transportation (water, land and air) routes, proximity to populated areas of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, as well as a long history of early European settlers and colonialism. For thousands of years the territory of indigenous aboriginal communities, Ontario had numerous tribes with differing languages at the time of European contact. The region still has many aboriginal communities as well, with combined populations of over 200,000. Southern Ontario was colonized by the French and the British. After the area began to be developed for European settlement, especially after the American Revolutionary War, other European immigrants arrived as well, with increased immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the late-20th century, many immigrants have come from Asia and other parts of the world. The region is one of the top destinations for immigrants worldwide, [ http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/census/cenhi5.html Census 2001 Highlights: Factsheet 5: Immigration to Ontario ] particularly the Greater Toronto Area. The area has a large manufacturing sector. Since the mid-2000s, Ontario produces more vehicles per year than the state of Michigan.

Campbell, &quot; Rust Belt, &quot; in The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia, eds. Richard Sisson, Christian Zacher, and Andrew Cayton, Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 78. } Factory closings because of industry restructuring, globalization (corresponding movement of jobs overseas and to non-unionized labour markets in the United States) have for the past few decades taken their toll. This most evident in the region&apos;s southern tier cities which have large automobile or associated industrial bases, such as Windsor, London, St. Thomas and St. Catharines, still affected by these factors but to a lesser extent is Hamilton the centre of steel production and Sarnia, the centre of petrochemical production. The province&apos;s two largest cities, however, Toronto and Ottawa, have moved increasingly to a service and knowledge economy, although Toronto still has a strong industrial presence spread over wide areas along its rail and highway corridors as well as a container port linking it to the St. Lawrence Seaway. The largest city of the province is the site of all of the major Canadian banks and its heart has the country&apos;s financial sector, including the Toronto Stock Exchange. Ottawa, the national capital, has an economy heavily dependant on the public sector, in addition to having a strong technology sector. Some parts of Southern Ontario are heavily entwined with bordering cities in New York and Michigan, in terms of industry and people. The focus areas are the Niagara Region, Sarnia and Detroit–Windsor. Many people work and live on opposite sides of the border. The NEXUS program for frequent travelers across the border [ http://pcbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/menu-eng.html NEXUS Canada Border Services Agency ] is increasing in populaity amongst bordering communities. Other areas with heavy trade traffic with Southern Ontario include Montreal and the province of Quebec, parts of northern Ohio, and western Pennsylvania. [ Tourism ] Southern Ontario is well known for its attractions and tourism. Some popular tourist attractions include the CN Tower, Parliament Hill, Niagara Falls, National Gallery of Canada, Canada&apos;s Wonderland, CNE, Canadian War Museum, Toronto Zoo, Hockey Hall of Fame, Royal Canadian Mint, Marineland, The Rideau Canal, and the Royal Ontario Museum. Niagara Falls is the 6th most visited attraction by domestic and international tourists in the world, with over 14 million tourists each year. In 2006, Toronto was the 14th most visited city by international tourists in the world with over 4.1 million visitors in the year.

[ May 2011 ] Southern Ontario is home to several professional sports teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Raptors, Toronto FC, and two teams in the Canadian Football League. The region also hosts the Canadian Open in golf and Canada Masters in tennis. Niagara Falls, ON The area sponsors many internationally renowned festivals and events, including Toronto International Film Festival, Winterlude, Caribana, Bluesfest, Pride Week, Kitchener Oktoberfest, Havelock Jamboree, Toronto Indy, Sarnia Bayfest, Canada Day in Ottawa, International Freedom Festival in Windsor, Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and Virgin Festival.

[ http://www.agco.on.ca/en/home/index.aspx Welcome to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario May 28, 2011 ] Southern Ontario has many beautiful natural attractions as well. Wasaga Beach, Grand Bend, Sauble Beach, and Sandbanks are beaches along the Great Lakes. The Niagara Escarpment offers hiking, skiing, and hundreds of waterfalls, including Niagara Falls. The Ottawa River has world-class white-water rafting which attracts rafters and kayakers from all over the globe. Ontario Parks governs all provincial parks, and Parks Canada governs all national parks. [ Cities ] Southern Ontario is home to both Canada&apos;s largest city (Toronto) and the national capital city (Ottawa). Toronto is Canada&apos;s largest, and North America&apos;s fifth-largest, city. It has a population of 2,503,281, and a metropolitan population of over 5.8 million as of late 2009. Ottawa is Canada&apos;s fourth largest city and capital city. It is home to most federal government departments and the Parliament of Canada. It has a population of 883,391, and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million. Southern Ontario contains the only city in the nation where one can travel north to the contiguous United States. At Windsor, Ontario if one travels north they will reach Detroit, Michigan. Southern Ontario communities have nine telephone area codes : 226, 249, 289, 343, 416, 519, 613, 647, 705, and 905.

The line between the counties and regions of the south and the districts of the north forms the boundary between Southern and Northern Ontario. This is disputed however, as the demarcation line that is referenced in provincial documents is the Nipissing Passageway, originally an Indian trail between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River. The trail follows the French River from Georgian Bay to Lake Nipissing. At North Bay, [ 2 km mi ] of land separates Lake Nipissing from Trout Lake.
