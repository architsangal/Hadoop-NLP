Years later, the new owner, cotton baron William Marsh Rice, whose first wife was Bremond&apos;s daughter, Margaret, had the town surveyed and named after Bremond. The town was incorporated in 1870. In the 1870s a large number of Polish immigrants came to the area to grow cotton. In 1878, local resident Francis Marion Wootan discovered that the local water had a high mineral content. Following a popular trend at the time, Wootan began bottling the water and marketing it for its curing properties. Wootan Wells soon became a popular resort community, with four hotels and hundreds of support staff. (See also Mineral Wells, Texas ) In 1916, fire devastated the community, dealing a heavy blow to Wootan Wells also. Flooding and drought also contributed to the decline of the town, and in 1921 another fire shut down Wootan Wells permanently. Texas Highway 6 was once routed through Bremond coming into town with Texas Highway 14 and took a sharp turn to the left in the town onto what is now Farm to Market Road 46 but when the Highway was straightened out it bypassed Bremond to the west. Where Texas Highway 6 intersects Farm to Market Road 46 if you look to the right coming south and to the left going north you can still see part of the curve that the original highway made to go into Bremond from the north.
