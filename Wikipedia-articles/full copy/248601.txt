It was written by Alun Owen and originally released by United Artists. The film was made in the style of a mockumentary, describing a couple of days in the lives of the group. It was successful both financially and critically; it was rated by Time magazine as one of the all-time great 100 films.

[ Screenplay ] The screenplay was written by Alun Owen, who was chosen because The Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, &quot; Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might&apos;ve heard us speak, so I thought he did a very good script. &quot; Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like &quot; a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room &quot;; the character of Paul&apos;s grandfather refers to this in the dialogue.

[ Plot ] Halliwell encapsulates the plot as &quot; Harassed by their manager and Paul&apos;s grandpa, The Beatles embark from Liverpool by train for a London TV show. &quot; Having escaped a horde of fan s, once aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions begin to test their patience, prompting George to go to the goods van for some peace and quiet. On arrival in London, The Beatles are driven to a hotel where they feel trapped. After a night out during which Paul&apos;s grandfather causes minor trouble at a casino, the group is taken to the theatre where their performance is to be filmed. The preparations are lengthy so Ringo decides to spend some time alone reading a book. Paul&apos;s grandfather, a &quot; villain, a real mixer, &quot; convinces him that he should be outside experiencing life instead of reading books, so Ringo goes off by himself. He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, walks alongside a canal and at one point rides a bicycle along a railway station platform. { This scene was filmed at Crowcombe Heathfield Station on the } { West Somerset Railway } [ http://www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/Crowcombe_Heathfield.html Crowcombe Heathfield 3 April 2008 http://web.archive.org/web/20080513171103/http%3A//www.west-somerset-railway.co.uk/Crowcombe_Heathfield.html 13 May 2008 no ] Meanwhile, the rest of the band frantically (and unsuccessfully) attempts to find Ringo.

[ Title ] The movie&apos;s strange title originated from something said by Ringo Starr, who described it this way in an interview with disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: &quot; We went to do a job, and we&apos;d worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, &apos;It&apos;s been a hard day...&apos; and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, &apos;...night!&apos; So we came to A Hard Day&apos;s Night. &quot; [ Keith The Beatles Off The Record Music Sales Corporation 978-0-7119-7985-7 93 last – Badman ] According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: &quot; I was going home in the car and Dick Lester suggested the title, &apos;Hard Day&apos;s Night&apos; from something Ringo had said.

We&apos;d almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we&apos;d not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session... and we said, &apos;Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.&apos; Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong.

Its status as an early contender for inclusion led to the song being included on the US soundtrack album. In the 1982 US theatrical reissue of the film by Universal Pictures, the song &quot; I&apos;ll Cry Instead &quot; was used as the audio track for a prologue sequence to the film which consisted of stills from the film and publicity photographs. The prologue was assembled without the involvement or knowledge of the film&apos;s director Richard Lester, who subsequently expressed his disapproval of the addition. The prologue was not included on the 2000 restoration of the film. The song &quot; You Can&apos;t Do That &quot; was filmed as part of the film&apos;s TV concert sequence, but was not included in the final cut of the film. At a point before a decision had been made to excise the song from the film, footage of that performance had been sent by the filmmakers and Brian Epstein to be aired on the Ed Sullivan Show as a tease to promote the forthcoming release of the movie. The clip aired on the Sullivan show on Sunday, 24 May 1964 in conjunction with an interview with The Beatles specially filmed by Sullivan in London. An extract of the footage of the song performance was included in the 1994 documentary The Making of &quot; A Hard Day&apos;s Night &quot;.
