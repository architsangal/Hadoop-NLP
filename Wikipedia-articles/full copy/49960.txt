Born in Waiblingen, he was the brother of Joachim Winkelhock and father of Markus Winkelhock, also both racing drivers. Manfred Winkelhock became famous when he flipped his F2 March at the very steep rise-and-fall Flugplatz corner on the Nürburgring in 1980. Winkelhock&apos;s first attempt at qualifying for a Formula One Grand Prix race was in Italy in 1980 when he stood in for the injured Jochen Mass at Arrows. He was able to land a drive with ATS in 1982. As BMW became the team&apos;s engine supplier in 1983, he qualified well on several occasions in 1983 and 1984, but the car was rarely reliable, so there were few results and a lot of accidents. At the same time he was a regular sports car and touring car driver, winning the 1000km Monza with Marc Surer in 1985. He was killed in the summer when he crashed heavily at turn 2 at Mosport Park of Bowmanville near Toronto, Ontario, Canada, during the Budweiser 1000  km World Endurance Championship event, driving a Porsche 962 C for Kremer Racing with co-driver Marc Surer.
