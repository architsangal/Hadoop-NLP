Accessed 25 December 2009? } The choice of Swahili, an East Africa n language, reflects its status as a symbol of Pan-Africanism, especially in the 1960s. Kwanzaa is a celebration that has its roots in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s, and was established as a means to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of African traditions and Nguzu Saba, the &quot; seven principles of African Heritage &quot; which Karenga said &quot; is a communitarian African philosophy &quot;. During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion which black people should shun.

Lawrence Scholer, &quot; The story of Kwanzaa &quot;, Dartmouth Review, 15 January 2001. } Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.

Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libation s, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles.

It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice, Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.

The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani? { Kwanzaa Greeting } which is Swahili for &quot; What&apos;s the News? &quot; { A Model Kwanzaa Ceremony } At first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year&apos;s. [ December 2011 ] Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinara s, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas. Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry. { The Spirit of Kwanzaa } { The Dance Institute of Washington } The first U.S. postage stamp commemorating Kwanzaa, issued in 1997 The first Kwanzaa stamp was issued by the United States Postal Service on October 22, 1997, with artwork by Synthia Saint James. { Bringing Good Into the World } In 2004, a second Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Daniel Minter, was issued; this has seven figures in colorful robes symbolizing the seven principles. { Kwanzaa featured on this year&apos;s holiday U.S. postage stamp } The holiday has also spread to Canada, and is celebrated by Black Canadians in a similar fashion as in America.
