Ninety-one 30-minute episodes were made over the three seasons of production. At the time of first screening, Australian television was still in black and white, however, the show was filmed in colour on 16  mm film to increase its international marketability, especially in the United States and Canada, where it aired in syndication between 1969 and 1972. The Nine Network readily repeated the series several times after Australian television switched to colour transmission in 1975. The series was dubbed into Spanish in Mexico, where it is known as Skippy el canguro, and has been distributed to most Spanish-speaking countries, including Cuba and Spain, where it became very popular. The series crossed the Iron Curtain and was aired in Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, and is still being broadcast in Iran. The show was forbidden to be shown in Sweden, where psychologist s feared the show would mislead children into believing animals could do things they actually could not.

Skippy was played by at least nine different kangaroo s As quoted on DVD 1, Making of Special extra [ Episodes ] [ List of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo episodes ] [ Plot and setting ] The show&apos;s star was Skippy, a wild female Eastern Grey Kangaroo befriended by Sonny Hammond, younger son of the Head Ranger of Waratah National Park. The stories revolved around events in the park, including its animals, the dangers arising from natural hazards, and the actions of visitors. The boy&apos;s mother is said (in Episode 48 &quot; The Mine &quot; ) to have died shortly after Sonny was born. The series was shot in northern Sydney at the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and the adjacent Waratah Park (now known as Waratah Park Earth Sanctuary ). Permission to film and build structures in the park was given by the then NSW Premier, Tom Lewis AO, before the Skippy series began filming in 1967, to showcase the new NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service government department he had just established. The sanctuary has much of the original film set including the &apos;Ranger Headquarters&apos; and descendants of the kangaroos used in the series. The series appeared in over 80 countries and its theme tune, composed by Eric Jupp, is one of the best-known and recognisable Australian tunes. The lyrics of the extended version (the B side on the record) were written by Ted Roberts. The clicking sounds made by Skippy are vocal sound effects, rather than the natural vocalisations of a kangaroo, with chocolate, chewing gum or grass (and in some cases, an elastic band around the lower jaw, [ February 2010 ] ) used to make Skippy move her mouth. Between nine and fifteen kangaroos were used for each show. The apparent manual dexterity was often achieved by using separate arms in the hands of human operators. In 1969 a movie -length &quot; Skippy and The Intruders &quot; was released. [ Later history ] The series was revived in 1992 as the short-lived The Adventures of Skippy using an entirely new cast including Andrew Clarke and Simon James, plot and location with several children, including Craig &apos;Tommy Lee&apos; Di Topp, as the stars. This version also aired on Animal Planet in the United States in 1997. In September 2008, actor Tony Bonner sued the production company seeking residuals from merchandising and DVD sales from the series.

Its writer, Sanjeev Bhaskar, tried to put Skippy in Room 101. Australian sketch comedy series Fast Forward also frequently parodied Skippy, with Michael Veitch playing Sonny and Marg Downey playing Clancy, whose head alone was visible, alongside an obviously fake stuffed kangaroo, often with unpleasant intentions toward his younger human companion. The series was referenced on the TV show House in the episode &quot; The Jerk, &quot; when the young patient mocked Australian doctor Robert Chase by repeatedly calling him &quot; Skippy the bush kangaroo &quot; or simply &quot; Skippy. &quot; The character was also referenced in the first Crocodile Dundee movie when, after outshooting drunk poachers from behind the corpse of the kangaroo they&apos;d shot, Michael J. &quot; Mick &quot; Dundee turns to the dead kangaroo and says, &quot; Good one, Skippy. &quot; Another reference to Skippy is found on the 1995 Arrogant Worms album C&apos;est Cheese. In the closing seconds of &quot; The Happy Happy Birthday Song &quot;, the final line &quot; Happy birthday dear-- &quot; is sung, then several names are muttered as the track segues into Dangerous, one of which is a fairly clear &quot; Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. &quot; The series was briefly parodied in the episode &quot; Killeroo &quot; of The Mighty Boosh - in this version, the protagonists overhear an episode where a feral &quot; Skipper &quot; turns on and devours his human companion.
