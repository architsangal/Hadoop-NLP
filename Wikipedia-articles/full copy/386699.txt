Since 1999, it has been situated in the Lublin Voivodeship, previously it was a part of the Siedlce Voivodeship (between 1975–1998). It is the capital of Łuków County. The town has the area of 35,75 sq. km., of which forests make up 13%. Łuków is located on the Southern Krzna river, at approximately 160 meters above sea level. The name of the town first appeared in documents in 1233 (Castelani nostri de Lucow). Łuków comes from Old Slavic word luk, which means “a place located in a wetland”. For 500 years Łuków, together with neigboring towns: Siedlce and Radzyn Podlaski, was part of Lesser Poland, located in extreme northeastern corner of the province. After Partitions of Poland (late 18th century), it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Some time in the 19th century, it became associated with another Polish historical region, Podlachia. [ History ] Łuków historically belonged to Lesser Poland. It was established around 1233 as a stronghold guarding eastern border of Poland against warring tribes from the East including Yotvingians and Lithuanians. Between 1250 and 1257 Bolesław V the Chaste – a sovereign of Poland, prince of Kraków and Sandomierz – located the Knights Templar in Łuków. The town belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship, but in 1474, it became part of the Lublin Voivodeship (1474-1795). Łuków was incorporated as a city in 1403 by King Władysław Jagiełło. In the first half of the 13th century, Łuków was the seat of Lesser Poland’s castellany, positioned in a strategic corner of the province. After Boleslaw V the Chaste brought in the Knights Templar there, a diocese was established as well. It existed for a short time between 1254–1257, but after protests from the Teutonic Knights, it was closed. In late Middle Ages Łuków was frequently invaded and destroyed by the Old Prussians, Yotvingians, Lithuanians and Tatars. The city life improved only after 1385 (see Union of Krewo ), when Poland and Lithuania became allies. In 1403 Łuków was officially granted a charter codifying its legal status. The town was frequently burned (1517, 1528, 15330). Its period of prosperity in the first half of the 17th century came to and end after the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660). In the second half of the 18th century Łuków had some 3,000 residents. The town slowly began to recover, but in 1782, in a great fire, almost the whole Łuków burned. Its population was cut by half. At that time, Łuków was one of the prominent centers of education. In 1701, Piarist monks opened a college there, and later on, the college was one of the first in Poland to carry out the reforms of the Commission of National Education. During the Partitions of Poland, Łuków originally was annexed by Austria, but since 1815, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Its inhabitants took active role in Polish uprisings of the 19th century. Russian discriminatory policies brought an end to education in the town, as the high school was moved to Siedlce. In the Second Polish Republic, Łuków belonged to Lublin Voivodeship. It was home to a military garrison with several mounted units stationed there. Jews made about 50% of the population. Almost all of them perished in the Holocaust. [ World War II ] In May 1941 a large Jewish ghetto was formed by German administration. It was fenced-out in mid-September 1942, and liquidated before the end of the same year. The number of inmates was nearly 12,000. Deportations took place on the 5th and 8th of October, and the 7th and 8th of November. Around 9,000 Jews were put onto Holocaust train s and sent to Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 2,200 inmates were shot locally into execution pits. On 28th of October more Jews were brought in from Adamów, Wojcieszków, Kock, Tuchowicz and Trzebieszów, about 4,500 in total. Many were executed locally, while others were sent to Treblinka along with the locals. After the wave of deportations and transfers, the ghetto was rearranged as a slave labor camp for Jewish workers employed in the Gestapo warehouses. In December 1942, approximately 500 of them were shot dead. Five months later, on May 2, 1943 the remaining 3,000–4,000 Jews were transported to Treblinka extermination camp. Only about 150 Jews of Łuków survived the Holocaust, mostly in the USSR. They migrated to Israel, Western Europe and USA.
