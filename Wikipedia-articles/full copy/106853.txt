The population was 392 at the 2010 census. The Boone County portion of Alpena is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area. [ History ] [ April 2008 ] Alpena Pass was founded in 1908 on top of a graveyard shortly after the Missouri-North Arkansas Railroad was built through Boone County. In the 1950s, the word pass was dropped from the name, thus creating the current name, Alpena. At the time of the town&apos;s founding, the town of Carrollton was in decline. Many of the buildings of Carrollton were disassembled, moved and reassembled at Alpena Pass. MADtv&apos;s Rice and Beans Tour once came through the town, doing a tongue-in-cheek expose` about rural America. They encountered a seemingly drug-intoxicated woman and had an interview with the mayor. [ Geography ] Alpena is located at [ 36.293713 -93.296233 type:city_region:US dms inline ].
