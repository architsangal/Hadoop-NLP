[ November 2009 ] The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H). It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign worker s in specialty occupations. If a foreign worker in H-1B status quits or is dismissed from the sponsoring employer, the worker must either apply for and be granted a change of status to another non-immigrant status, find another employer (subject to application for adjustment of status and/or change of visa), or leave the United States. The regulations define a &quot; specialty occupation &quot; as requiring theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in a field of human endeavor { 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1)(A) } including but not limited to architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, biotechnology, medicine and health, education, law, accounting, business specialties, theology, and the arts, and requiring the attainment of a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent as a minimum { 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1)(B) } (with the exception of fashion models, who must be &quot; of distinguished merit and ability &quot; ). { 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i) } Likewise, the foreign worker must possess at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent and state licensure, if required to practice in that field. H-1B work-authorization is strictly limited to employment by the sponsoring employer. [ Structure of the Program ] [ Duration of stay ] The duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years. An exception to maximum length of stay applies in certain circumstances: If a visa holder has submitted an I-140 immigrant petition or a labor certification prior to their fifth year anniversary of having the H-1B visa, they are entitled to renew their H-1B visa in one year or three year increments until a decision has been rendered on their application for permanent residence. If the visa holder has an approved I-140 immigrant petition, but is unable to initiate the final step of the green card process due to their priority date not being current, they may be entitled to a three-year extension of their H-1B visa. This exception originated with the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000. American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 The maximum duration of the H-1B visa is ten years for exceptional Defense Department project related work. H-1B holders who want to continue to work in the U.S. after six years, but who have not obtained permanent residency status, must remain outside of the U.S. for one year before reapplying for another H-1B visa. Despite a limit on length of stay, no requirement exists that the individual remain for any period in the job the visa was originally issued for. This is known as H-1B portability or transfer, provided the new employer sponsors another H-1B visa, which may or may not be subjected to the quota. Under current law, H-1B visa has no stipulated grace period in the event the employer-employee relationship ceases to exist. [ Congressional yearly numerical cap ] The current law limits to 65,000 the number of foreign nationals who may be issued a visa or otherwise provided H-1B status each fiscal year (FY). Laws exempt up to 20,000 foreign nationals holding a master’s or higher degree from U.S. universities from the cap on H-1B visas. In addition, excluded from the ceiling are all H-1B non-immigrants who work at (but not necessarily for) universities and non-profit research facilities. { American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, Pub. L.No.106-313, 114 Stat.1251, 2000 S. 2045; Pub. L. No. 106-311, 114 Stat. 1247 (Oct 17, 2000), 2000 HR 5362; 146 Cong. Rec. H9004-06 (October 5, 2000) } This means that contractors working at, but not directly employed by the institutions may be exempt from the cap. Free Trade Agreements carve out 1,400 H-1B visas for Chilean nationals and 5,400 H-1B visas for Singapore nationals. However, if these reserved visas are not used, then they are made available in the next fiscal year to applicants from other countries. Thus the number of H-1B visas issued each year is significantly more than the 65,000 cap, with 117,409 having been issued in 2010.

For instance, H-1B visa applications that count against the FY 2013 cap could be submitted starting from Monday, April 2, 2012. USCIS accepts H-1B visa applications no more than 6 months in advance of the requested start date. [ H-1B Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 Cap Season www.uscis.gov/h-1b_count USCIS 2012-05-28 http://www.webcitation.org/612crusvx 2011-08-18 H-1B petitions can be filed no more than six months in advance of the requested start date. Therefore, petitions seeking an FY 2010 H-1B Cap number with an Oct. 1, 2009 start date can be filed no sooner than April 1, 2009. ] Beneficiaries not subject to the annual cap are those who currently hold H-1B status or have held H-1B status at some point in the past six years. [ Tax status of H-1B workers ] The taxation of income for H-1B employees depends on whether they are categorized for tax purposes as either non-resident aliens or resident aliens. A non-resident alien for tax purposes is only taxed on income from the United States, while a resident alien for tax purposes is taxed on income from both inside and outside the United States. The classification is determined based on the &quot; substantial presence test &quot; : If the substantial presence test indicates that the H-1B visa holder is a resident, then income taxation is like any other U.S. person and may be filed using Form 1040 and the necessary schedules; otherwise, the visa-holder must file as a non-resident alien using tax form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ; he or she may claim benefit from tax treaties if they exist between the United States and the visa holder&apos;s country of citizenship. Persons who are in their first year within the United States may choose to be considered a resident for taxation purposes for the entire year, and must pay taxes on their worldwide income for that year. This &quot; First Year Choice &quot; is described in IRS Publication 519 and can only be made once in a person&apos;s lifetime. A spouse, regardless of visa status, must have a valid Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) or Social Security number (SSN) in order to be included on a joint tax return with the H-1B holder. The rules to file taxes for H-1B holders may be complex, depending on the individual situation. Besides consulting a professional tax preparer knowledgeable about the rules for foreigners, the IRS Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, may be consulted. H-1B visa holders pay Medicare and Social Security taxes, and are eligible for Social Security benefits. They also pay state and federal taxes. [ H-1B and legal immigration ] Even though the H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa, it is one of the few visa categories recognized as dual intent, meaning an H-1B holder can have legal immigration intent (apply for and obtain the green card ) while still a holder of the visa. In the past the employment-based green card process used to take only a few years, less than the duration of the H-1B visa itself. However, in recent times the legal employment-based immigration process has backlogged and retrogressed to the extent that it now takes many years for skilled professional applicants from certain countries to obtain their green cards. Since the duration of the H-1B visa hasn&apos;t changed, this has meant a lot more H-1B visa holders have to renew their visas in one-year or three-year increments to continue to be in legal status while their green card application is in process. [ Dependents of H-1B visa holders ] H-1B visa holders are allowed to bring their immediate family members (spouse and children under 21) to the United States under the H4 Visa category as dependents. An H4 Visa holder may remain in the U.S. as long as the H-1B visa holder remains in legal status. An H4 visa holder is not eligible to work in the U.S. and is not eligible for a Social Security number (SSN). { http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10096.html#4 } An H4 Visa holder may attend school, obtain a driver&apos;s license and open a bank account while in the US. In order to claim a dependent on a tax return or file a joint tax return, the dependent will have to obtain an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) which is used only for tax filing purposes. [ Evolution of the Program ] [ Changes in the cap and number of applications received ] During the early 1990s, the cap was rarely reached. By the mid-1990s, however, the allocation tended to be filled each year on a first come, first served basis, resulting in new H-1Bs often being denied or delayed because the annual cap had already been reached. In 1998, the cap was increased to 115,000. The cap was increased to 195,000 for FY 2001, FY 2002 and FY 2003. In FY 2004, the cap reverted to 90,000 when the temporary increase passed by Congress in 1999 expired. A yearly &quot; shortfall &quot; in available visas arose beginning in the mid 2000s, despite the temporary increase in the yearly cap. { Another Year, Another H-1B Crisis, Frank Nelson, Attorney, Asian Journal, Sep 05, 2005 } In its annual report on H-1B visas, released in November 2006, USCIS stated that it approved 131,000 H-1B visas in FY 2004 and 117,000 in FY 2005. [ October 2010 ] For FY 2007, beginning on October 1, 2006, the entire quota of visas for the year was exhausted within a span of less than 2 months on May 26, 2006, { 2007 H-1B visa limit already reached } well before the beginning of the financial year concerned. The additional 20,000 Advanced Degree H-1B visas were exhausted on July 26. For FY 2008, the entire quota was exhausted before the end of the first day on which applications were accepted, April 2. { USCIS REACHES FY 2008 H-1B CAP } Under USCIS rules, the 123,480 petitions received on April 2 and April 3 that were subject to the cap were pooled, and then 65,000 of these were selected at random for further processing. { USCIS Runs Random Selection Process For H-1B, USCIS, April 13, 2007 } The additional 20,000 Advanced Degree H-1B visas for FY 2008 was exhausted on April 30. In 2008, a total of 276,252 visa applications (initial, renewals and extensions) were approved. In 2009 that number decreased slightly to 214,271 { U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Characteristics of H-1B Specialty Occupation Workers Report for Fiscal Year 2009 } and 110,367 initial H-1B visas were issued from consular offices. [ Table XVI(B) Nonimmigrant Visas Issued by Classification (Including Crewlist Visas and Border Crossing Cards) Fiscal Years 2006-2010 http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/FY10AnnualReport-TableXVI_B.pdf Report of the Visa Office 2010 Table of Contents travel.state.gov 2011-10-03 ] The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), described the situation as a crisis, and the situation was reported on by the Wall Street Journal, BusinessWeek and Washington Post. Employers applied pressure on congress. { Wall Street Journal, March, 2007 } Microsoft chairman Bill Gates testified in 2007 on behalf of the expanded visa program on Capitol Hill, &quot; warning of dangers to the U. S. economy if employers can&apos;t import skilled workers to fill job gaps &quot;. Congress considered a bill to address the claims of shortfall, { S.1092: Hi-Tech Worker Relief Act of 2007. United States Congress via American Immigration Lawyers Association. } but in the end did not revise the program. { S.1092: Hi-Tech Worker Relief Act of 2007. Thomas.gov. United States Library of Congress. Retrieved 2008-06-12. } For FY 2009, USCIS announced on April 8, 2008 that the entire quota for visas for the year had been reached, for both 20,000 Advanced and the 65,000 quota. USCIS would complete initial data entry for all filing received during April 1 to April 7, 2008 before running the lottery. { USCIS Reaches FY 2009 H-1B Cap } For FY 2010, USCIS announced on December 21, 2009, that enough petitions were received to reach the year cap. { USCIS FY 2010 H-1B Cap Count } For FY 2011, USCIS announced on January 27, 2011, that enough petitions were received to reach the year cap on January 26. { USCIS FY 2011 H-1B Cap Count } For FY 2012, USCIS announced on November 23, 2011, that enough petitions were received to reach the year quota on November 22.

With PERM, labor certification processing time is now approximately 9 months (as of Mar 2010). { Changes to the H-1B and L-1 Visa Application Fees, August 12, 2010 } Because of AC21, the H-1B employee is free to change jobs if they have an I-485 application pending for six months and an approved I-140, if the position they are moving to is substantially comparable to their current position. In some cases, if those labor certifications are withdrawn and replaced with PERM applications, processing times will improve, but the person will also lose their favorable priority date. In those cases, employers&apos; incentive to attempt to lock in H-1B employees to a job by offering a green card is reduced, because the employer bears the high legal costs and fees associated with labor certification and I-140 processing, but the H-1B employee is still free to change jobs. However, many people are ineligible to file I-485 at the current time due to the widespread retrogression in priority dates. Thus, they may well still be stuck with their sponsoring employer for many years. There are also many old labor certification cases pending under pre-PERM rules. [ Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 ] The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, which, among other issues, federalizes immigration in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, stipulates that during a transition period, numerical limitations will not apply to otherwise qualified workers in the H visa category in the CNMI and Guam. { Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 } [ American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ] On Feb. 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“stimulus bill”), Public Law 111-5. { &apos;&apos;uscis.gov&apos;&apos; } Section 1661 of the ARRA incorporates the Employ American Workers Act (“EAWA”) by Senators Sanders (I-Vt.) and Grassley (R-Iowa) to limit certain banks and other financial institutions from hiring H-1B workers unless they had offered positions to equally or better-qualified US workers, and to prevent banks from hiring H-1B workers in occupations they had laid off US workers from. These restrictions include: The employer must, prior to filing the H-1B petition, take good-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers for the position for which the H-1B worker is sought, offering a wage at least as high as what the law requires for the H-1B worker. The employer must also attest that, in connection with this recruitment, it has offered the job to any U.S. worker who applies who is equally or better qualified for the position. The employer must not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker within the period beginning 90 days prior to the filing of the H-1B petition and ending 90 days after its filing. FAQ on affect of stimulus legislation on H-1B program, cglawaffiliates.x2cms.com/blog. [ Changes in USCIS policy ] After completing a policy review, the USCIS clarified that individuals who spent one year outside of U.S. and did not exhaust their entire six year term can choose to be re-admitted for the “remainder” of initial six-year period without being subject to the H-1B cap. { USCIS Interoffice Memorandum from Michael Aytes, Associate Director, Domestic Operations, to all Regional Directors and Service Center Directors, dated December 5, 2006 } After completing a policy review, the USCIS clarified that “any time spent in H-4 status will not count against the six-year maximum period of admission applicable to H-1B aliens. USCIS recently issued a memorandum dated 8 Jan 2010. The memorandum effectively states that there must be a clear &quot; employee employer relationship &quot; between the petitioner (employer) and the beneficiary (prospective visa holder). It simply outlines what the employer must do to be considered in compliance as well as putting forth the documentation requirements to back up the employer&apos;s assertion that a valid relationship exists. The memorandum gives three clear examples of what is considered a valid &quot; employee employer relationship &quot; : an accountant working on and off-site to work a fashion model a computer software engineer working off-site In the case of the software engineer, the petitioner (employer) must simply agree to do (some of) the following among others: supervise the beneficiary off-site &amp; on-site maintain such supervision through calls, reports, or visits have a &quot; right &quot; to control the work on a day-to-day basis if such control is required. provide tools for the job hire, pay and have the ability to fire the beneficiary evaluate work products and perform progress/performance reviews claim them for tax purposes provide (some type of) employee benefits use &quot; proprietary information &quot; to perform work produce an end product related to the business have an &quot; ability to &quot; control the manner and means in which the work product is accomplished. It further states that &quot; common law is flexible &quot; in how these factors are to be weighed. Although this memorandum cites legal cases and provides examples, such a memorandum in itself is not law and future memoranda could easily be issued that could change this. Some argue that this has effectively &quot; killed the job-shop industry &quot;. While it is clear that it now (as of 2012) takes longer to reach the H-1B visa numerical cap, it is not clear whether this is a result of simple political pressure to put the program on &quot; hold &quot;, or a result of the decreased economic growth. [ Protections for U.S. workers ] [ Labor Condition Application ] The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for ensuring that foreign workers do not displace or adversely affect wages or working conditions of U.S. workers. For every H-1B petition filed with the USCIS, there must be included a Labor Condition Application (LCA) certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA is designed to ensure that the wage offered to the non-immigrant worker meets or exceeds the &quot; prevailing wage &quot; in the area of employment. The LCA also contains an attestation section designed to prevent the program from being used to import foreign workers for the purpose of breaking a strike, or for the purpose of replacing U.S. citizen workers. While an employer is not required to advertise the position before hiring an H-1B non-immigrant pursuant to the H-1B visa approval, the employer is required to notify the employee representative about the Labor Condition Application (LCA) or if there is no such representation then the employer is required to publish that LCA at the workplace and the employer&apos;s office. [ Overview : H-1B Visas for Temporary Professional Workers The Law Office of Sheela Murthy, P.C. 2003-09-19 http://www.murthy.com/news/UDtempro.html http://www.webcitation.org/5rxYX1rWE 2010-08-13 2010-08-13 ] [ H-1B Visa Workpermit.com http://www.workpermit.com/us/investor_h-1b.htm http://www.webcitation.org/5rxYdicOo 2010-08-13 2010-08-13 ] Under the regulations, LCAs are a matter of public record. Corporations hiring H-1B workers are required to make these records available to any member of the public who requests to look at them. Copies of the relevant records are also available from various web sites, including the Department of Labor. [ Employer attestations ] By signing the LCA, the employer attests that: [ ETA-9035 Labor Condition Application for H-1B Nonimmigrants http://www.doleta.gov/regions/reg05/Documents/eta-9035.pdf United States Department of Labor ] Notice of this filing has been provided to bargaining representative of workers in the occupation in which H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed; or There is no such bargaining representative; therefore, a notice of this filing has been posted and was, or will remain, posted for 10 days in at least two conspicuous locations where H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed. The law requires H-1B workers to be paid the higher of the prevailing wage for the same occupation and geographic location, or the same as the employer pays to similarly situated employees. Other factors, such as age and skill were not permitted to be taken into account for the prevailing wage. Congress changed the program in 2004 to require the Department of Labor to provide four skill-based prevailing wage levels for employers to use. This is the only prevailing wage mechanism the law permits that incorporates factors other than occupation and location. The approval process for these applications are based on employer attestations and documentary evidence submitted. The employer is advised of their liability if they are replacing a US worker. [ Limits on employment ] According to the USCIS, &quot; H-1B aliens may only work for the petitioning U.S. employer and only in the H-1B activities described in the petition. The petitioning U.S. employer may place the H-1B worker on the worksite of another employer if all applicable rules (e.g., Department of Labor rules) are followed. H-1B aliens may work for more than one U.S. employer, but must have a Form I-129 petition approved by each employer. &quot; { H-1B Frequently Asked Questions } [ H-1B fees earmarked for U.S. worker education and training ] In 2007, the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (ETA), reported on two programs, the High Growth Training Initiative and Workforce Innovation Regional Economic Development (WIRED), which have received or will receive $284 million and $260 million, respectively, from H-1B training fees to educate and train U.S. workers. [ July 2008 ] [ Criticisms of the program ] [ November 2009 ] The H-1B program has caused a number of criticisms. [ Employees made to pay H-1B sponsorship costs ] Although the practice is unlawful, { 20 CFR 655.731 } it is widely believed [ March 2010 ] that some employers make their H-1B employees pay for most, all or in excess, of the costs associated with sponsoring and processing an H-1B application. These fees are usually under the guise of bond or other instruments, in an attempt to serve as a legal workaround to the law. [ No labor shortages ] Paul Donnelly, in a 2002 article in Computerworld, cited Milton Friedman as stating that the H-1B program acts as a subsidy for corporations. { H-1B Is Just Another Gov&apos;t. Subsidy } Others holding this view include Dr. Norman Matloff, who testified to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration on the H-1B subject. Matloff&apos;s paper for the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform claims that there has been no shortage of qualified American citizens to fill American computer-related jobs, and that the data offered as evidence of American corporations needing H-1B visas to address labor shortages was erroneous. { ON THE NEED FOR REFORM OF THE H-1B NON-IMMIGRANT WORK VISA IN COMPUTER-RELATED OCCUPATIONS } The United States General Accounting Office found in a report in 2000 that controls on the H-1B program lacked effectiveness. { GAO Report on H-1B Foreign Workers } The GAO report&apos;s recommendations were subsequently implemented. High-tech companies often cite a tech-worker shortage when asking Congress to raise the 65,000 annual cap on H-1B visas, but according to a study conducted by John Miano and the Center for Immigration Studies there is no empirical data to support that claim.

A paper by Harvard Professor George J. Borjas for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that &quot; a 10 percent immigration-induced increase in the supply of doctorates lowers the wage of competing workers by about 3 to 4 percent. &quot; [ November 2009 ] The LCA included in the H-1B petition is supposed to ensure that H-1B workers are paid the prevailing wage in the labor market, or the employer&apos;s actual average wage (whichever is higher), but evidence exists that some employers do not abide by these provisions and avoid paying the actual prevailing wage despite stiff penalties for abusers. { &quot; H-1B Prevailing Wage Enforcement On The Rise – Millions In Back Wages And Fines Ordered &quot;, millerjohnson.com. } Theoretically, the LCA process appears to offer protection to both U.S. and H-1B workers. However, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office, enforcement limitations and procedural problems render these protections ineffective. { United States General Accounting Office, H-1B Foreign Workers: Better Controls Needed to Help Employers and Protect Workers } Ultimately, the employer, not the Department of Labor, determines what source it will use to determine the prevailing wage for an offered position, and it may choose among a variety of competing surveys, including its own wage surveys, provided that such surveys follow certain defined rules and regulations. The law specifically restricts the Department of Labor&apos;s approval process of LCAs to checking for &quot; completeness and obvious inaccuracies &quot;. { 8 USC 1182 (n) } In FY 2005, only about 800 LCAs were rejected out of over 300,000 submitted. Hire Americans First has posted several hundred first hand accounts of individuals negatively impacted by the program, many of whom are willing to speak with the media. DOL has split the prevailing wage into four levels, with Level One representing about the 17th percentile of wage average Americans earn. About 80 percent of LCAs are filed at this 17th percentile level [ September 2008 ]. This four-level prevailing wage can be obtained the DOL website, { DOL Foreign Labor Certification Online Wage Library } and is generally far lower than average wages [ September 2008 ]. The &quot; prevailing wage &quot; stipulation is allegedly vague and thus easy to manipulate [ November 2009 ], resulting in employers underpaying visa workers. According to Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the median wage in 2005 for new H-1B information technology (IT) was just $50,000, which is even lower than starting wages for IT graduates with a B.S. degree. The U.S. government OES office&apos;s data indicates that 90 percent of H-1B IT wages were below the median U.S. wage for the same occupation.

Santiglia accused the company of bias against U.S. citizens when it laid off 3,900 workers in late 2001 and at the same time applied for thousands of visas. In 2002, about 5 percent of Sun&apos;s 39,000 employees had temporary work visas, he said. { Sun Accused of Worker Discrimination, San Francisco chronicle, June 25, 2002, online text } In 2005, it was decided that Sun violated only minor requirements and that neither of these violations was substantial or willful. Thus, the judge only ordered Sun to change its posting practices. { Santiglia v. Sun Microsystems, Inc., ARB No. 03-076, ALJ No. 2003-LCA-2 (ARB July 29, 2005) } [ Hidden costs and risks for employers ] Lower wages do not necessarily mean lower costs for employers. The cost to a company to sponsor a prospective employee for an H-1B visa can be significant, and it can vary between $1,440 and $5,000 depending on the attorney&apos;s fees (if used), the number of employees in the company, and if a premium is paid for faster service, without including the cost of a possible trip to the border of the country of origin, nor the renewal costs. { www.uscis.gov/h-1b_count } From August 14, 2010, the H-1B fee was increased by $2,000 for petitioners who employ 50 or more employees in the United States with more than 50 percent of its employees in the United States in H-1B or L (including L-1A, L-1B and L-2) nonimmigrant status as President Obama signed into law Public Law 111-230 { http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=27eac9514bb8a210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD &amp; vgnextchannel=68439c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD }. In addition to that, if the employer should dismiss the employee, the company is liable for any reasonable costs associated with relocation back to the employee&apos;s last foreign residence. (This provision covers only dismissal; it is not relevant when an employee chooses to resign.) [ January 2011 ] Besides, there is no guarantee that the prospective employee will be granted the visa due to high demand, and the expenses are sometimes non-refundable. [ Risks for employees ] Historically, H-1B holders have sometimes been described as indentured servants, [ Skilled Workers – or Indentured Servants? BusinessWeek Brian Grow June 6, 2003 http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2003/ca20030610_2638_ca014.htm ] and while the comparison is no longer as compelling, it had more validity prior to the passage of American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000. Although immigration generally requires short- and long-term visitors to disavow any ambition to seek the green card (permanent residency), H-1B visa holders are an important exception, in that the H-1B is legally acknowledged as a possible step towards a green card under what is called the doctrine of dual intent. H-1B visa holders may be sponsored for their green cards by their employers through an Application for Alien Labor Certification, filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. [ April 2010 ] In the past, the sponsorship process has taken several years, and for much of that time the H-1B visa holder was unable to change jobs without losing their place in line for the green card. This created an element of enforced loyalty to an employer by an H-1B visa holder. Critics [ November 2009 ] alleged that employers benefit from this enforced loyalty because it reduced the risk that the H-1B employee might leave the job and go work for a competitor, and that it put citizen workers at a disadvantage in the job market, since the employer has less assurance that the citizen will stay at his job for an extended period of time, especially if the work conditions are tough, wages are lower or the work is difficult or complex. It has been argued that this makes the H-1B program extremely attractive to employers, and that labor legislation in this regard has been influenced by corporations seeking and benefiting from such advantages. [ November 2009 ] Some recent news reports suggest that the recession that started in 2008 will exacerbate the H-1B visa situation, both for supporters of the program and for those who oppose it. [ http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE51I60N20090219 Reuters Foreign tech workers touchy subject in U.S. downturn February 19, 2009 ] The process to obtain the green card has become so long that during these recession years it has not been unusual that sponsoring companies fail and disappear, thus forcing the H-1B employee to find another sponsor, and lose their place in line for the green card. An H-1B employee could be just one month from obtaining their green card, but if the employee is laid off, he or she may have to leave the country, or go to the end of the line and start over the process to get the green card, and wait as much as 10 more years, depending on the nationality and visa category. { US Department of State visa bulletin } The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 provides some relief for people waiting for a long time for a green card, by allowing H-1B extensions past the normal 6 years, as well as by making it easier to change the sponsoring employer. [ Fraud by Employers and Applicants ] The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services &quot; H-1B Benefit Fraud &amp; Compliance Assessment &quot; of September 2008 concluded 21% of H-1B visas granted originate from fraudulent applications or applications with technical violations. { http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/Resources/Reports/uscis-annual-report-2008.pdf } Fraud was defined as a willful misrepresentation, falsification, or omission of a material fact. Technical violations, errors, omissions, and failures to comply that are not within the fraud definition were included in the 21% rate.Subsequently, USCIS has made procedural changes to reduce the number of fraud and technical violations on H-1B applications. Enforcement is substandard and there are reports of abusers surviving INS audits unscathed.

What happens to those workers after that? Well, they could stay. It is possible. But these new companies have a much better idea for making money. They send the engineers to America to fill spots--and get money to do it--and then after the 3 to 6 years, they bring them back to work for the companies that are competing with American companies. They call it their outsourcing visa. They are sending their talented engineers to learn how Americans do business and then bring them back and compete with those American companies. &quot; { http://web.archive.org/web/20110108195825/http://durbin.senate.gov/showRelease.cfm?releaseId=280890 } Critics of H-1B use for outsourcing have also noted that more H-1B visas are granted to companies headquartered in India than companies headquartered in the United States. { http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9142152/List_of_H_1B_visa_employers_for_2009 } Of all Computer Systems Analysts and programmers on H-1B visas in the US, 74 percent were from Asia. This large scale migration of Asian IT professionals to the United States has been cited as a central cause for the quick emergence of the offshore outsourcing industry. { Yeoh et al., &apos;State/Nation/trasnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific&apos;, Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-40279-X } [ Check digit (X) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] {, page 167 } In 2006, these firms collectively were issued 19,512 of the 65,000 H-1B visas granted, with 4 outsourcing firms among the top 5 receivers of H-1B visas. These are Infosys, Satyam Computer Services, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro Technologies. Critics have argued that granting H-1B visas to these outsourcing firms is not the real intent of the H-1B Visa program. [ http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID%3D199601616 Who Gets H-1B Visas? Check Out This List 06/02/2007 Marianne Kolbasuk McGee May 17, 2007 InformationWeek ] [ http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jun2007/db20070606_792054.htm Immigration: Google Makes Its Case 04/02/2010 Peter Elstrom June 7, 2007 BusinessWeek ] One reason given is that the Indian firms skirt regulations and use the visas to train workers in the U.S. to facilitate moving jobs offshore. In 2006, Wipro applied for 20,000 H-1B visas and 160 Green Cards while Infosys applied for 20,000 H-1B visas and only 50 Green Cards. Of the Applied H-1B visas, Wipro and Infosys were granted 4,002 and 4,108 visas, respectively, an acceptance rate of 20% and 24%. { Prithiv Patel, Infosys, Wipro and TCS under investigation for misuse of H-1B visas, India Daily, May 15, 2007 } Given that both companies have a work force of approximately 100,000 employees, and a U.S. employment base of roughly 20,000 H-1B holders, this indicates that roughly 1/5 of the Indian workforce of Infosys &amp; Wipro applied for a visa in 2006. [ http://www.businessweek.com/table/0518_h1btable.htm Immigration: Who Gets Temp Work Visas? 04/02/2010 Peter Elstrom June 7, 2007 BusinessWeek ] A 2009 Business Week article cited a ComputerWorld article indicating that Wipro was the top user of the program with 1,964 Visas.

[ April 2010 ] These requirements do not apply when hiring an exempt H-1B nonimmigrant. For firms of 50 employees or more, an H-1B dependent employer is defined as having more than 15% of their employees in H-1B status. Smaller firms are allowed to have a higher percentage of H-1B employees before becoming &apos;dependent&apos;. [ Payment of out-of-state tuition ] In most states, H-1B workers and their dependents do not qualify for in-state tuition regardless of the amount of time spent in the US. [ November 2009 ] However, for more than a decade, a few states such as California, New York, Washington and Texas have extended in-state tuition to H-1B workers and dependents. Typically the decision to offer in-state tuition to H-1B and H4 residents is taken as a result of an adverse state court decision that uses the precedent established for G-4 visas in the Supreme Court decision in TOLL v. MORENO, 441 U.S. 458 (1979). [ Social Security and Medicare taxes ] H-1B employees have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes as part of their payroll. Like US citizens, they are eligible to receive Social Security benefits even if they leave the United States, provided they have paid Social Security benefits for at least 10 years. Further, the US has bilateral agreements with several countries to ensure that the time paid into the US Social Security system, even if it is less than 10 years, is taken into account in the foreign country&apos;s comparable system and vice versa. { Social Security Administration: International Agreements } [ Spouses cannot work ] The spouse of a H-1B visa holder who generally comes on H-4 (dependent) visa cannot work in the United States. { 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iv) } [ Unrealistic Departure Requirement on Job Loss ] If an H-1B worker is laid off for any reason, the H-1B program technically does not specify a time allowance or grace period to round up one&apos;s affairs irrespective of how long the H-1B worker might have lived in the United States. To round up one&apos;s affairs, filing an application to change to another non-immigrant status may therefore become a necessity. An H-1B worker who is laid off and attempts to find a new H-1B employer to file a petition for him is considered out of status if there is even a one day gap between the last day of employment and the date that the new H-1B petition is filed. While some attorneys claim that there is a grace period of 30 days, 60 days, or sometimes 10 days, that is not true according to the law. In practice, USCIS has accepted H-1B transfer applications even with a gap in employment up to 60 days, but that is by no means guaranteed. Some of the confusion regarding the &quot; grace period &quot; arose because there is a 10 day grace period for an H-1B worker to depart the United States at the end of his authorized period of stay (does not apply for laid-off workers). This grace period only applies if the worker works until the H-1B expiration date listed on his I-797 approval notice, or I-94 card. 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(i)(A). The employer has the legal obligation to pay for the laid-off worker&apos;s return transportation. [ Administrative processing ] When an H-1B worker goes outside of US for vacation, he or she has to get the visa stamped on his passport unless he has already done so for re-entry in the United States. The interview is taken in US Embassy by a visa officer. In some cases, H-1B workers can be required to undergo &quot; administrative processing &quot;, involving extra, lengthy background checks. Under current rules, these checks are supposed to take ten days or less, but in some cases, have lasted years. [ Alden Edward America’s ‘National Suicide’ Newsweek 10 April 2011 http://www.newsweek.com/2011/04/10/america-s-national-suicide.html 5 July 2011 ] [ Similar programs ] In addition to H-1B visas, there are a variety of other visa categories that allow foreign workers to come into the U.S. to work for some period of time. L-1 visa s are issued to foreign employees of a corporation. Under recent rules, the foreign worker must have worked for the corporation for at least one year in the preceding three years prior to getting the visa. An L-1B visa is appropriate for nonimmigrant workers who are being temporarily transferred to the United States based on their specialized knowledge of the company&apos;s techniques and methodologies. An L-1A visa is for managers or executives who will either manage people or an essential function of the company. There is no requirement to pay prevailing wages for the L-1 visa holders. For Canadian residents, a special L visa category is available. TN-1 visas are part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and are issued to Canadian and Mexican citizens. { Mexican and Canadian NAFTA Professional Worker } TN visas are only available to workers who fall into one of a pre-set list of occupations determined by the NAFTA treaty. There are specific eligibility requirements for the TN Visa. E-3 visa s are issued to citizens of Australia under the Australia free-trade treaty. H-1B1 visas are issued to residents of Chile and Singapore under the amended NAFTA treaty. One recent trend in work visas is that various countries attempt to get special preference for their nationals as part of treaty negotiations. Another trend is for changes in immigration law to be embedded in large Authorization or Omnibus bills to avoid the controversy that might accompany a separate vote. H-2B visa : The H-2B nonimmigrant program permits employers to hire foreign workers to come to the U.S. and perform temporary nonagricultural work, which may be one-time, seasonal, peak load or intermittent. There is a 66,000 per year limit on the number of foreign workers who may receive H-2B status.
