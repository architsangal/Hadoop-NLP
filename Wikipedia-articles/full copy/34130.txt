Parkes and directed by John Badham. The film stars Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. The film follows David Lightman (Broderick), a young hacker who unwittingly accesses WOPR, a United States military supercomputer programmed to predict possible outcomes of nuclear war. Lightman gets WOPR to run a nuclear war simulation, originally believing it to be a computer game. The simulation causes a national nuclear missile scare and nearly starts World War III. The film was a box office success, costing US$ 12 million, but grossing $79,567,667 after five months in the United States and Canada. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards. A sequel, WarGames: The Dead Code, was released direct to DVD on July 29, 2008. [ Plot ] During a secret live fire exercise of a nuclear attack, many United States Air Force Strategic Missile Wing missileers prove unwilling to turn a required key to launch a missile strike. Such refusals convince Dr. John McKittrick ( Dabney Coleman ) and other systems engineers at NORAD that command of missile silos must be maintained through automation, without human intervention. Control is given to a NORAD supercomputer, WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), programmed to continuously run military simulation s and learn over time. David Lightman ( Matthew Broderick ) is a bright but unmotivated Seattle high school student and hacker. After receiving a failing grade in school, he uses his IMSAI microcomputer to hack into the district&apos;s computer system. He then changes his grade and does the same for his friend and classmate Jennifer Mack ( Ally Sheedy ). Later, while dialing every number in Sunnyvale, California to find a set of forthcoming computer games, a computer that does not identify itself intrigues Lightman. On the computer he finds a list of games, starting with general strategy games like chess, checkers, backgammon, and poker and then progressing to titles like Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare and Global Thermonuclear War, but cannot proceed further. Two of his hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the &quot; Falken &quot; referenced in Falken&apos;s Maze, the first game listed. Lightman discovers that Stephen Falken is an early artificial intelligence researcher, and guesses correctly that his dead son&apos;s name &quot; Joshua &quot; is the backdoor password. Lightman does not know that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to WOPR, or &quot; Joshua &quot;, at Cheyenne Mountain. He starts a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the Soviet Union. The computer starts a simulation that briefly convinces the military personnel at NORAD that actual Soviet nuclear missiles are inbound. While they defuse the situation, Joshua nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game. It continuously feeds false data such as Soviet bomber incursions and submarines deployments to the humans at NORAD, pushing them into raising the DEFCON level and toward a retaliation that will start World War III. Lightman learns the true nature of his actions from a news broadcast, and the FBI arrests him and takes him to NORAD. He realizes that Joshua is behind the NORAD alerts but fails to convince McKittrick and faces imprisonment. Lightman escapes NORAD by joining a tourist group and, with Mack&apos;s help, travels to the Oregon island where the widowed Falken ( John Wood ) now lives under a new identity. Lightman and Mack find that Falken has become despondent and believes the world is on an inevitable path to nuclear holocaust. The teenagers convince Falken that he should return to NORAD to stop Joshua. The computer stages a massive Soviet first strike with hundreds of missiles, submarines, and bombers. Believing the attack to be genuine, NORAD prepares to retaliate. Falken, Lightman, and Mack convince military officials to cancel the second strike and ride out the non-existent attack. Joshua starts an attempt to launch a second strike, however, using a brute force attack to obtain the launch code for the U.S. nuclear missiles. Without humans in the silos as a safeguard, the computer will trigger a mass launch. All attempts to log in and order Joshua to cancel the countdown fail, and all weapons will launch if the computer is disabled. Instead, Falken and Lightman direct the computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself. This results in a long string of draw s, forcing the computer to learn the concept of futility. Joshua obtains the missile code but before launching, it cycles through all the nuclear war scenarios it has devised, finding they too all result in stalemates. The computer concludes that nuclear warfare is &quot; a strange game &quot;; having discovered the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction ( &quot; WINNER: NONE &quot; ), therefore &quot; the only winning move is not to play. &quot; Joshua then offers to play &quot; a nice game of chess &quot;, and relinquishes control of NORAD and the missiles.

Schneider Billy Ray Sharkey as Radar Analyst Jesse D. Goins as Sergeant (as Jesse Goins) [ Production ] [ Development ] Development on WarGames began in 1979, when writers Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker developed an idea for a script called The Genius, about &quot; a dying scientist and the only person in the world who understands him – a rebellious kid who&apos;s too smart for his own good. &quot; Lasker was inspired by a television special presented by Peter Ustinov on several geniuses including Stephen Hawking. Lasker said &quot; I found the predicament Hawking was in fascinating – that he might one day figure out the unified field theory and not be able to tell anyone, because of his progressive ALS. So there was this idea that he&apos;d need a successor. And who would that be? Maybe this kid, a juvenile delinquent whose problem was that nobody realized he was too smart for his environment. &quot; The concept of computers and hacking as part of the film was not yet present.

Schwartz made the connection between youth, computers, gaming, and the military. Parkes and Lasker came up with several different military-themed plotlines prior to the final story. One version of the script had an early version of WOPR. Named Uncle Ollie, or OLI (Omnipresent Laser Interceptor), it was a space-based defensive laser run by an intelligent program. The idea was discarded in preference of WOPR because it was too speculative. David Lightman was modeled on David Scott Lewis, a hacking enthusiast Parkes and Lasker met.

General Beringer was based on James V. Hartinger, the then- commander-in-chief of NORAD who Parkes and Lasker met while visiting the base, and who, like Beringer, favored keeping humans in the decision loop. [ Filming ] Martin Brest was originally hired as director but was fired after 12 days of shooting because of an on-set argument with the producers, [ http://www.allmovie.com/artist/martin-brest-82954/bio Martin Brest: Biography March 15, 2009 Erickson, Hal Allmovie ] and replaced with John Badham. Several of the scenes shot by Brest remain in the final film. Badham said that &quot; [Brest had] taken a somewhat dark approach to the story and the way it was shot. It was like [Broderick and Sheedy] were doing some Nazi undercover thing. So it was my job to make it seem like they were having fun, and that it was exciting. &quot; According to Badham, Broderick and Sheedy were &quot; stiff as boards &quot; when they came onto the sound stage, having both Brest&apos;s dark vision and the idea that they were going to get fired in their minds. Badham did 12–14 takes of the first shot to loosen the actors up. At one point, Badham decided to have a race with the two actors around the sound stage with the one who came last having to sing a song to the crew. Badham lost and sang &quot; The Happy Wanderer &quot;, the silliest song he could think of.

(The set was more visually impressive than the actual NORAD facilities at the time.) No post-production work was needed. For this, the company was awarded a Technical Achievement Award by the Academy. [ Influence ] The movie was notable for coining the term firewall in reference to computer network security [ March 2012 ]. The scenes showing Lightman&apos;s computer dialing every number in Sunnyvale led to the term &quot; war dialing &quot;, a technique of using a modem to scan a list of telephone numbers to search for unknown computers, and indirectly to the newer term &quot; wardriving &quot;.

It played similarly to the NORAD side of the &quot; Global Thermonuclear War &quot; game, where the United States had to be defended from a Soviet strike by placing bases and weapons at strategic points. A game called &quot; Computer War, &quot; in which the player must track and shoot down ICBM s as well as crack a computer code, was released for the TI-99/4A. A real-time strategy game that was very loosely related to the film was released for the PlayStation and PC called WarGames: Defcon 1 in 1998. The film also inspired the Introversion game DEFCON (2006).
