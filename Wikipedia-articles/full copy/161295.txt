[ History ] West Brookfield was first settled in 1664 and was officially incorporated in 1848, splitting off from Brookfield. The town is believed to be the birthplace of asparagus in the New World. Diederik Leertouwer came to the United States in 1784 to promote trade between the Netherlands and New England. He later settled with his wife and daughter in West Brookfield where he carried out his duties as Consul and lived here between the years 1794 and 1798. At that time West Brookfield had a population greater than Worcester and was being considered for the county seat. Local legend has it that Diederik Leertouwer imported asparagus from his homeland and was the first to plant it in this area. This fact was forgotten until it was discovered in an old cookbook. Wild asparagus still grows in this area today. Leertouwer died here and is buried in the Old Indian Cemetery on Cottage Street in West Brookfield. { &quot; The Legend of Diederick Leertouwer and Asparagus in New England. &quot; Diederick Leertouwer.

By the mid 1800s, it was part of a farm owned by William Adams whose descendant, F. A. Carter, dammed a small stream to create Carter Pond and built the cottage now serving as a trailside museum and nature center. The reservation is open year round, daily, sunrise to sunset. Admission is free to all. { &quot; Rock House Reservation. &quot; West Brookfield Historical Commission. West Brookfield Historical Commission, 25 Oct 2006.

After seven months of construction, the building was dedicated as the Merriam Public Library and Reading Room. The Library was eventually re-dedicated in 1960 as the Merriam-Gilbert Public Library after it received an unexpected and generous bequest from Helen E. Gilbert, a former West Brookfield native. The exterior of the Library remains relatively unchanged with the exception of a cupola, which was destroyed in the Hurricane of &apos;38. Also, an elevator tower was discreetly added during the 1997 building renovation project that both refurbished and made the building accessible to the handicapped. { &quot; About the Library. &quot; Merriam-Gilbert Public Library.
