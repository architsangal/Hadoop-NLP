[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1300805 } [ 3 ] Saulsbury is a town in Hardeman County, Tennessee. The population was 99 at the 2000 census. It is located along State Highway 57 in southwest Hardeman County. [ History ] Saulsbury&apos;s historical roots stem from a former settlement named Berlin, which was located one mile south of the current location of Saulsbury. Two regional mail roads - one from Bolivar to Ripley, Mississippi, and another from LaGrange to Corinth, Mississippi. These mail roads met at an intersection which would form into a trading center. In 1839 a post office was established there, and Berlin would be incorporated in 1846, and within five years it would be home to 351 people. Upon the completion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, Berlin was bypassed due to one landowner&apos;s refusal to sell their property to the railroad. A track was instead laid one mile north of Berlin, on land that was owned by Burrell Sauls and Berry Futrell. The finished railroad station and track would be called Sauls-Berry Depot. Eventually Berlin would be deserted as people moved to the new settlement and in 1856 Saulsbury was incorporated. [ Civil War ] Just after the taking of Memphis in 1862, the Union Army took Saulsbury. Skirmishes continued throughout the area, and eventually Saulsbury would return to Confederate control. Confederate soldiers would use Saulsbury as a rally point to travel to Corinth to join their regiments. After the Civil War, Saulsbury maintained itself as a town, unlike others in the area which barely survived the war. Saulsbury&apos;s cotton production survived the war as well, and Saulsbury would become a leader in cotton production in the region. The town would also become a producer of eggs, turkeys, poultry and hogs; which was often sent to Memphis for sale. Sand mining became a major industry in the 1870s, providing 47 different types of sand for brass molding. [ 1999 Tornado ] On January 17, 1999, an F1 tornado formed just southwest of Saulsbury, and moved northeast until dissipating near Rogers Springs. { http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/meg/events/01172299/saulsbury.gif } One person was killed, four others were injured. Fourteen houses and mobile homes were destroyed, and twenty-seven others were damaged. Power lines and trees also sustained significant damage. [ July 2010 ] As a result, the town of Saulsbury installed a tornado siren at the local fire station. { http://hardemancountytn.com/government/cities-towns/saulsbury } [ Geography ] Saulsbury is located at [ 35 2 57 N 89 5 20 W type:city ] (35.049276, -89.088858) [ 1 ].
