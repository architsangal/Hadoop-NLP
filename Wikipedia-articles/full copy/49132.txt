Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens, and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having already fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day. In 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem &apos;&apos;Pheidippides&apos;&apos;. Browning&apos;s poem, his composite story, became part of late-19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend. [ February 2008 ] Mount Penteli stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that, if Pheidippides actually made his famous run after the battle, he had to run around the mountain, either from the north or from the south. The latter and more obvious route matches almost exactly the modern Marathon-Athens highway, which follows the lay of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then a gentle but protracted uphill westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then mildly downhill to Athens proper. This route, as it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately [ 40 km mi uk ], but was later extended to the current standard marathon distance of 42.195 kilometres (26 miles 385 yards, approximately 26.22 miles). However there have been suggestions that Pheidippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens. This route is considerably shorter, some [ 35 km mi uk ], but features a very steep initial climb of more than [ 5 km mi uk ]. [ Modern Olympics marathon ] 1896 Olympic marathon When the idea of a modern Olympics became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece. The idea of organizing a marathon race came from Michel Bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as the Greeks. The Greeks staged a selection race for the Olympic marathon on 10 March 1896 that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes (with the future winner of the introductory Olympic Games marathon coming in fifth). The winner of the first Olympic Marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon &quot; Spyros &quot; Louis, a Greek water-carrier. He won at the Olympics in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds. The women&apos;s marathon was introduced at the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles, USA) and was won by Joan Benoit of the United States with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.

At a meeting of the International Olympic Committee in The Hague in May 1907 it was agreed with the British Olympic Association that the 1908 Olympics would include a marathon of about 25 miles or 40 kilometres. { British Olympic Council Minutes } In November 1907 a route of about that distance was published in the newspapers, starting at Windsor Castle and finishing at the Olympic Stadium, the Great White City Stadium in Shepherd&apos;s Bush in London. {. Bob Wilcock, The 1908 Olympic Marathon, Journal of Olympic History, Volume 16 Issue 1, March 2008 } There were protests about the final few miles because of tram-lines and cobbles, so the route was revised to cross the rough ground of Wormwood Scrubs. This lengthened the route, as did plans to make the start [ 700 yd m ] from Queen Victoria &apos;s statue by Windsor Castle, and it was decided to fix the distance at [ 26 mi ] to the stadium, plus a lap of the track (586 yards, 2 feet) (536 m), using the Royal Entrance as the marathon tunnel, and finishing in front of the Royal Box. For the official Trial Marathon on 25 April 1908, organized by the Polytechnic Harriers, the start was on ‘The Long Walk’  – a magnificent avenue leading up to Windsor Castle in the grounds of Windsor Great Park. For the Olympic Marathon itself the start was on the private East Terrace of Windsor Castle, with the permission of King Edward VII, so that the public would not interfere with the start. The Princess of Wales and her children drove from their home at Frogmore on the far side of Windsor Great Park to watch the start of the race. { The Princess of Wales&apos; private diary and press reports } Shortly before the Games opened it was realized that the Royal Entrance could not be used as the marathon entrance—it was raised to permit easy descent by the royal party from their carriages, and did not open onto the track—so an alternative entrance was chosen, diagonally opposite the Royal Box. A special path was made just outside the Franco British Exhibition ground so that the distance to the stadium remained 26 miles (42 km). The finishing line was left unchanged, but in order that the spectators, including Queen Alexandra, could have the best view of the final yards, the direction of running was changed to &quot; right-hand inside &quot; (i.e. clockwise). This meant the distance in the stadium was shortened to 385 yards (352 m), and the total distance became 26 miles 385 yards (42.195  km). According to the book &quot; The Marathon Makers &quot; by John Bryant, the 1908 Olympic Marathon course was incorrectly measured. The course was remeasured in recent years and the first mile was 174 yards (159 m) short. This means that the intended distance of 26 miles and 385 yards (42.195 km) was actually only 26 miles and 211 yards (42.036 km). { Dorando Pietri staggering across the finish line of the } { 1908 Olympic marathon } For the next Olympics in 1912, the length was changed to [ 40.2 km mi ], and changed again to [ 42.75 km mi ] for the 1920 Olympics, until it was fixed at the 1908 distance for the 1924 Olympics.

However, the dramatic finish of the 1908 Olympic marathon led to worldwide marathon fever. In a postcard sent at the time, an American spectator said he had &quot; just seen the greatest race of the century. &quot; { Bob Wilcock, &quot; The 1908 Olympic Games, the Great Stadium and the Marathon, a Pictorial Record &quot; (2008 ISBN 978-0-9558236-0-2) } [ September 2010 ] The huge crowd, including Queen Alexandra, watched as the little Italian, Dorando Pietri, staggered round the final [ 385 yd ], falling several times, and eventually being propelled by officials over the line as Irish-American Johnny Hayes got ever closer. Pietri was disqualified and Hayes was awarded the Gold Medal. However, Queen Alexandra was so moved by his plight that the very next day she presented Pietri with a silver-gilt cup. Pietri and Hayes both turned professional and there were several re-matches over the distance of 26 miles 385 yards. Many other marathons were also held at that distance, including the important Polytechnic Marathon. The IAAF minutes are reportedly silent as to the reason the 26 miles 385 yards (42.195  km) was chosen in 1921, { Martin &amp; Gynn, &quot; The Olympic Marathon &quot; (2000 ISBN 0-88011-969-1) } [ September 2010 ] so any conclusion must be speculative, but emotional attachment to the distance of the &quot; race of the century &quot; was clearly strong.

For events governed by IAAF rules, it is mandatory that the route be marked such that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometres. The rules make no mention regarding the use of miles. The IAAF will only recognise world record s that are established at events that are run under IAAF rules.

The last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. Many marathon runners also &quot; carbo-load &quot; (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen. [ Glycogen and &quot; the wall &quot; ] [ Hitting the wall ] { Melbourne Marathon } Carbohydrate s that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscle s into glycogen for storage. Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30  km/18–20 miles of running. Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point. [ http://www.half-marathon-running.com/HittingTheWall Hitting the wall for marathon runners Half-marathon-running.com 22 August 2009 ] When glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to &quot; hit the wall &quot;. The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches, { Lesser-known Dangers Associated with Running a Marathon Retrieved 9/7/2009 } is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the &quot; wall &quot; is not as dramatic. This is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen. Carbohydrate-based &quot; energy gel s &quot; are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of &quot; hitting the wall &quot;, as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely. A runner getting encouragement at Mile 25 of the Boston Marathon Alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race. It is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers ( NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen ), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. NSAIDS block the COX-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. In less than 5% of the whole population that take NSAIDS, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. [ Brater D.

Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.

The paper went on to say that since the risk was so small, cardiac screening programs for marathons were not warranted. However, this study was not an attempt to assess the overall benefit or risk to cardiac health of marathon running. In 2006, a study of 60 non-elite marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins (see Troponin ) which indicate heart damage or dysfunction after they had completed the marathon, and gave them ultrasound scans before and after the race. The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had done less than [ 35 mi km ] per week of training before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than [ 45 mi km ] per week of training beforehand showed few or no heart problems.

Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death. { Merck Manual: Hyponatremia } Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, medical director for the New York City Marathon, has stated, &quot; There are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running, but there are plenty of cases of people dying of hyponatremia. &quot; { Gina Kolata: Marathoners Warned About Too Much Water (NYTimes, 20 Oct. 2005) } Consumption of water during a race has not been demonstrated to enhance performance and may even impair it. { Inverse relationship between percentage body weight change and finishing time in 643 forty-two-kilometre marathon runners } Because hyponatremia is caused by excessive water retention, not merely loss of sodium, consumption of sports drinks or salty foods will not prevent it. { Marathon Dilemma: How Much Water is Too Much? } The International Marathon Medical Directors Association issued a warning in 2001 that urged runners only to drink when they are thirsty, rather than &quot; drinking ahead of their thirst. &quot; Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia. [ Almond CS, Shin AY, Fortescue EB, et al.

Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs. If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water. [ Charity involvement ] Particularly for marathons, it is common to find charities associated with various races.
