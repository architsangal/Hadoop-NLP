[ December 2010 ] [ 251 m ft 0 on ] [ 270 m ft 0 on ] { 63 (plus 3 underground) } [ 84000 m2 sqft -2 on ] { Gerard de Preu and Partners } { Perrott Lyon Mathieson } { Grollo Australia } The Rialto Towers (often The Rialto) is a skyscraper located at 525 Collins Street, in the western side of the central business district of Melbourne, Australia. It is the second-tallest reinforced concrete building and the tallest office building in the Southern Hemisphere, when measured to its roof (several other skyscrapers in Australia are taller if their spires are included, as are some other structures in Australia such as communications masts and observation towers). The Rialto Towers featured Melbourne&apos;s first skyscraper public observation deck which operated between 1994 and 31 December 2009. { http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2009/10/23/2722902.htm } It was also the location of Melbourne&apos;s first Tower running event. [ Background ] Robbs Building, demolished in 1980 to make way for the Rialto&apos;s concrete and glass podium { Rialto Building (right) and } { Winfield Building (left) were retained as part of the development. } The site of the Rialto Towers (Flinders Lane, Collins Street, Winfield Square and Robbs Lane) was occupied by several buildings including Robb&apos;s Buildings (now demolished), a grand classical styled 5 storey Victorian office building designed by Thomas Watts and Sons { Robb&apos;s buildings, corner of Collins and King Streets Melbourne [picture &amp; #93; by } (and reputedly the tallest in the Melbourne City Centre { Robbs was the tallest in the Hoddle Grid, however it was not the tallest in the metropolitan area } in 1885), { Robb, John (1834 - 1896) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online } a 1920s building of the same size, the Rialto Building (1889) designed by William Pitt and the Winfield Building (1890) designed by Charles DEbro &amp; Richard Speight all formed a uniform height limited streetscape along Collins Street and around the corner of King Street. During the 1970s, the large derelict site was owned by the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia and it was around 1979 when the first development proposal was prepared and submitted to the Melbourne City Council. Little progress was made until 1980 when the site was acquired by Grollo Australia. [ http://www.rialto.com.au/ Building Construction 17 January 2007 (Building Profile → Features → Construction) ] Despite the structural integrity of Robb&apos;s buildings and objections by the National Trust of Victoria, Grocon successfully argued that the retention of Robb&apos;s Buildings would spoil the effect of the proposed building and that as it would not integrate well with the new structure and that the Rialto should have its own modern concrete and glass podium. During the application process Rialto and Windfield buildings were added to heritage registers and a 10 metres frontage and side facades including Victorian roofscape and turrets and small access laneway were retained to be integrated into the development. [ Construction ] Robb&apos;s buildings were subsequently demolished opening the way for construction to begin on the Rialto. Designed by architects Gerard de Preu and Partners in association with Perrott Lyon Mathieson, the building was built between 1982 and 1986, opening in October 1986, and takes its name from the much older Rialto Building next door. The massive glass curtain wall façade of reinforced blue tinted mirrored glass is its central feature and changes colour during the day, ranging from a trademark dark blue to a brilliant gold during sunset. It is 251  m (824  ft) high, with 63 floors and 3 basement floors. It comprises two conjoined towers, the shorter North Tower being 185  m high with 43 floors. In total, there are 84,000  m² of office space. Early tenants moved into the lower floors while the upper floors were still under construction in 1984. [ Observation Deck ] The Melbourne Observation Deck opened to the public on 19 July 1994 and is on the 55th floor of the South Tower, at 234  m. Views of up to 60  km can be had on a clear day. It is serviced by two express passenger lift s. However, on 31 December 2009, the observation deck closed to become a restaurant.

Previous winners include Robin Rishworth (1989,1990); Geoff Case (1991). The winner was awarded with a trip to New York to compete in the Empire State Building race. [ Statistics ] In total there are 36 passenger lifts, 95  km of lift cables, 706 lift door openings and 1,450 staircase steps. The outer surface of the building has 13,000 windows.
