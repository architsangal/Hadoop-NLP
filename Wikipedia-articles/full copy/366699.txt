[ 1856 7 30 y ] { Edinburgh, Scotland } [ 1928 08 19 1856 7 30 y ] { Auchterarder, } { Perthshire } { Göttingen University } { University of Edinburgh } { Barrister } Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane KT, OM, PC, KC, FRS, FBA, FSA (30 July 1856 – 19 August 1928), was an influential British Liberal Imperialist and later Labour politician, lawyer and philosopher. He was Secretary of State for War between 1905 and 1912 during which time the &quot; Haldane Reforms &quot; were implemented. Raised to the peerage as Viscount Haldane in 1911, he was Lord Chancellor between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of his supposed and unproven German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1914. [ Background and education ] Haldane was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist James Alexander Haldane, the brother of respiratory physiologist John Scott Haldane, Sir William Haldane and author Elizabeth Haldane and the uncle of J. B. S. Haldane. He received his first education at the Edinburgh Academy and at the Göttingen University and University of Edinburgh { thepeerage.com Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st and last Viscount Haldane of Cloan } where he received first-class honors in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities. After studying law in London, he was called to the Bar, Lincoln&apos;s Inn, in 1879, and became a successful lawyer. In 1890 he was made a Queen&apos;s Counsel. [ 26018 28 January 1890 475 ] [ Early political career ] In 1885 Haldane was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Haddingtonshire, a seat he held until 1911. { leighrayment.com House of Commons: Hackney to Harwich } In 1902 he was admitted to the Privy Council. [ 27464 12 August 1902 5174 ] { West Point sometime before the Great War. } [ Secretary of State for War ] After the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Herbert Henry Asquith and his allies Haldane and Sir Edward Grey would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. However, the plot (called &quot; The Relugas Compact &quot; after the Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Campbell-Bannerman. [ September 2010 ] Haldane was appointed Secretary of State for War (Grey became Foreign Secretary). [ 27862 8 December 1905 8893 ] The party won a landslide victory in the 1906 general election. Haldane, a prominent Liberal Imperialist and close associate of Asquith, was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist, Edward Grey, as early as January 1906 to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans. Having reduced the Estimates to £28 million first, Haldane then implemented his reforms of the Army; a wide-ranging set of reforms aimed at preparing the army for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the British Expeditionary Force, along with the creation of the Imperial General Staff, the Territorial Force, the Officer Training Corps and the Special Reserve. He was also instrumental in the creation the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979). This institution was soon copied by many other major developed countries. [ September 2010 ] In 1911 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Haldane, of Cloan in the County of Perth. [ 28480 28 March 1911 2522 ] [ Lord Chancellor ] { Punch magazine 3 March 1920, after Haldane&apos;s term as Liberal Lord Chancellor and three years before his term as Labour Lord Chancellor. } On Lord Loreburn&apos;s retirement in 1912, Haldane succeeded him as Lord Chancellor. That year saw the unsuccessful attempt of the Haldane Mission. In 1913 he was made a Knight of the Thistle. However, he was forced to resign in 1915, after being falsely accused of pro-German sympathies. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song ( &quot; All dressed up and nowhere to go &quot; ) in the revue &quot; Mr Manhattan &quot;. As the war progressed, Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. It was not until the general election of 1923 that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of Labour candidates. [ September 2010 ] When the Labour government was formed by Ramsay MacDonald in early 1924, Haldane was recruited to serve once again as Lord Chancellor. [ 32901 25 January 1924 769 ] He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with Lord Parmoor. Haldane was a vital member of the Cabinet as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before; the other two had sat only briefly and for junior posts. [ September 2010 ]. When the Irish War of Independence broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force. [ Contribution to Canadian Constitutional Law ] As Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor. He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the Canadian Constitution, particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government. For instance, in the case of &apos;&apos;In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act&apos;&apos;, { In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191 } he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy. In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the &quot; peace, order and good government &quot; power of the federal government, as well as the federal criminal law power. Similarly, in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, { Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396. } Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right. The effect of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court of Canada, but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers. Haldane&apos;s approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as F.R. Scott { F.R. Scott, Some Privy Counsel (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780. } and Chief Justice Bora Laskin, as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving the federal government of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues. More recently, one major study has characterised him as &quot; the wicked stepfather &quot; of the Canadian Constitution. { Vaughan, Viscount Haldane: &apos;The Wicked Step-father of the Canadian Constitution&apos;. University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 2010. } [ Other public appointments ] Haldane was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb. In 1904 he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club&apos;s annual dinner. He also served as second Chancellor of the University of Bristol, and was elected Chancellor of the University of St Andrews shortly before his death. [ September 2010 ] [ Influence on education ] In 1895 Haldane helped found the London School of Economics. He was also involved in the founding of Imperial College in 1907 and in his honour the University contains the Haldane Recreational Library. [ Writings ] Haldane co-translated the first English edition of Schopenhauer &apos;s The World as Will and Representation, published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is The Reign of Relativity (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity. From 1907 to 1908 he was president of the Aristotelian Society. [ September 2010 ] [ Personal life ] Haldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fiancée, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in Auchterarder, Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72. [ Ex-War Secretary and Lord Chancellor Succumbs Suddenly to Heart Disease.

New York Times 20 August 1928 2008-08-15 ] The viscountcy became extinct on his death. [ Legacy ] { Philip Alexius de László. } Lord Birkenhead, the Conservative politician, praised Haldane in November 1923 as an exception to the idealism in Britain before the Great War: In the welter of sentimentality, amid which Great Britain might easily have mouldered into ruin, my valued colleague, Lord Haldane, presented a figure alike interesting, individual, and arresting. In speech fluent and even infinite he yielded to no living idealist in the easy coinage of sentimental phraseology. Here, indeed, he was a match for those who distributed the chloroform of Berlin. Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual. He devised the Territorial Army, which was capable of becoming the easy nucleus of national conscription, and which unquestionably ought to have been used for that purpose at the outbreak of war. He created the Imperial General Staff. He founded the Officers&apos; Training Corps. { Lord Birkenhead, ‘ Idealism in International Politics. A Rectorial Address, Delivered on November 23rd ’ (Peterborough: The Peterborough Press, n.d.), p. 9. } The military historian Correlli Barnett claimed Haldane had &quot; all-round personal talents far exceeding those of his predecessors &quot; as Secretary of State for War and was &quot; a man of first-class intellect and wide education &quot;. { Correlli Barnett, Britain and Her Army (London: Allen Lane, 1970), p. 362, p. 388. } [ Notes ] [ See also ] Haldane principle Haldane Reforms [ References ] [ Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] Correlli Barnett, Britain and Her Army (London: Allen Lane, 1970) H.
