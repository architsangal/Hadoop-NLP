It is now the world&apos;s only remaining sovereign grand duchy. The country has a highly developed economy, with the world&apos;s highest GDP (nominal) per capita according to the IMF. Its historic and strategic importance dates back to its founding as a Roman era fortress site and Frankish count&apos;s castle site in the Early Middle Ages. It was an important bastion along the Spanish Road when Spain was the principal European power influencing the whole western hemisphere and beyond in the 16th–17th centuries. Luxembourg is a member of the European Union, NATO, OECD, the United Nations, and Benelux, reflecting the political consensus in favour of economic, political, and military integration. The city of Luxembourg, the largest and capital city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the EU. Luxembourg culture is a mix of Romance Europe and Germanic Europe, borrowing customs from each of the distinct traditions. Luxembourg is a trilingual country; German, French and Luxembourgish are official language s. Although a secular state, Luxembourg is predominantly Roman Catholic.

[ http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/luxembourg/apropos_histoire/ap_histoire_2008_EN.pdf History of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg PDF ] Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a small state of great strategic value. In the 14th and early 15th centuries three members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperor s. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne, which led to the territory being sold by Duchess Elisabeth to Philip the Good of Burgundy. { Kreins (2003), p. 39 } In the following centuries, Luxembourg&apos;s fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants, the Bourbons, Habsburg s, Hohenzollern s, and the French, among others. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands. The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands. Luxembourg also became a member of the German Confederation, with a Confederate fortress manned by Prussian troops. { Kreins (2003), p. 70 } The Belgian Revolution of 1830–1839 reduced Luxembourg&apos;s territory by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium. Luxembourg&apos;s independence was reaffirmed by the 1839 First Treaty of London. In the same year, Luxembourg joined the Zollverein. { Kreins (2003), p. 76 } Luxembourg&apos;s independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of London, after the Luxembourg Crisis nearly led to war between Prussia and France. { Kreins (2003), pp. 80–81 } After the latter conflict, the Confederate fortress was dismantled. { Kreins (2003), p. 81 } The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of William III, the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while Luxembourg (at that time restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact ) passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg. { Kreins (2003), p. 84 } During World War I Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by Germany, but was allowed to maintain its independence and political mechanisms. During World War II, Luxembourg was unable to maintain its policy of neutrality when in 1940 Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the country, due to its strategic location on the invasion route into France. In contrast to the First World War experience, Luxembourg was treated as a Germanic territory and informally annexed to an adjacent province of the Third Reich in 1940. A government in exile based in London fought alongside the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion. Luxembourg was liberated in September 1944. It became a founding member of the United Nations in 1946, and of NATO in 1949. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union ), and, in 1999, it joined the euro currency era. In 2005, a referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was held in Luxembourg. { Timeline: Luxembourg – A chronology of key events BBC News Online, 9 September 2006.

In efforts foreshadowing European integration, Luxembourg and Belgium in 1921 formed the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create an inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs regime. Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union ). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed), whose goal is the free movement of citizens among member states. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro- NATO, pro-US foreign policy. Luxembourg is the site of the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( &quot; Eurostat &quot; ) and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in nearby Strasbourg. [ Military ] [ Luxembourg Army ] A NATO owned AWACS aircraft. The contribution Luxembourg makes to its defense and to NATO consists of a small army (currently consisting of around 800 people). As a landlocked country, it has no navy. Luxembourg also lacks an air force, though the seventeen NATO AWACS aeroplanes are for convenience registered as aircraft of Luxembourg.

[ Geography ] [ Geography of Luxembourg ] { Luxembourg, } { Esch-sur-Alzette, } { Dudelange, and } { Differdange. } Luxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe, and ranked 170th in size of all the 194 independent countries of the world; the country is about [ 2,586 km2 sqmi ] in size, and measures [ 82 km mi on ] long and [ 57 km mi on ] wide. It lies between latitudes 49° and 51° N, and longitudes 5° and 7° E. To the east, Luxembourg borders the German Bundesländer of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and, to the south, it borders the French région of Lorraine. The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian Walloon Region, in particular the latter&apos;s provinces of Luxembourg and Liège, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north respectively. The northern third of the country is known as the &apos; Oesling &apos;, and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange, { Mountains in Luxembourg, recueil de statistiques par commune. statistiques.public.lu (2003) p. 20 } which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837  ft). Other mountains are the &apos;Buurgplaaz&apos; at 559 metres near Huldange and the &apos;Napoléonsgaard&apos; at 548 metres near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town ( Wiltz ) with a population of more than four thousand people. { Alscheid. } The southern two-thirds of the country is called the &quot; Gutland &quot;, and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse, and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg&apos;s industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg&apos;s largest towns. The border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three river s : the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valley s of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.

It is ranked second richest country in the world with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $81,466 (in a new list compiled by US-based &apos;&apos;Forbes&apos;&apos; magazine ). [ February 2012 ] The industrial sector, which was dominated until the 1960s by steel, has diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking and other financial export s, account for the majority of economic output. Luxembourg is the world&apos;s second largest investment fund center (after the United States), the most important private banking center in the Eurozone and Europe&apos;s leading center for reinsurance companies. Moreover, the Luxembourgish government has tried to attract internet start-ups. Skype and Amazon are two of the many internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg. Concern about Luxembourg&apos;s banking secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009 to it being added to a &quot; grey list &quot; of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. Luxembourg adapted some months later the OECD standards on exchange of information and moved into the category of &apos;Jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard.&apos; [ http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0%2C3746%2Cen_2649_33767_43281075_1_1_1_1%2C00.html Luxembourg makes progress in OECD standards on tax information exchange 08/07/2009 OECD 8 July 2009 ] [ http://www.fidomes.com/newsletter/Report-OECD.pdf A progress report on the jurisdictions surveyed by the OECD Global Forum PDF July 2009 OECD ] In March 2010, the Sunday Telegraph reported that most of Kim Jong-Il&apos;s $4bn in secret accounts is in Luxembourg banks. { Arlow, Oliver, &quot; Kim Jong-il keeps $4bn &apos;emergency fund&apos; in European banks &quot;, Sunday Telegraph, 14 March 2010. } Agriculture is based on small, family-owned farms.
