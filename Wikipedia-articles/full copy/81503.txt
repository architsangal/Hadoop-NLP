[ April 2012 ] [ the film the soundtrack Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (soundtrack) the arcade game Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (arcade game) ] [ 1984 5 23 ] { 118 minutes } { English } { $28.17 million } { $333,107,271 } Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a 1984 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the second (chronologically the first) film in the &apos;&apos;Indiana Jones&apos;&apos; franchise and prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, stumbling upon a Kali -worshipping thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice. Producer and co-writer George Lucas decided to make the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. The original idea was to set the film in China, with a hidden valley inhabited by dinosaurs. Other rejected plot device s included the Monkey King and a haunted castle in Scotland. Lucas then wrote a film treatment that resembled the final storyline of the film. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas&apos;s collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacement. The film was released to financial success but mixed reviews, which criticized the on-screen violence, later contributing to the creation of the PG-13 rating.

Some of the film&apos;s cast and crew, including Spielberg, retrospectively view the film in an unfavorable light. The film has also been the subject of controversy due to its portrayal of India and Hinduism.

With his eleven-year old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the gold-digging nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indiana flees Shanghai on a plane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. The pilots leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas, though the trio narrowly manage to escape on an inflatable boat and ride down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a desolate village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by the Hindu god Shiva and enlist their help to retrieve the sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community&apos;s children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indiana hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones which promise fortune and glory. The trio receive a warm welcome from the residents of Pankot Palace (which includes the young Maharajah Zalim Singh and his representative, Pankot Palace Prime Minister Chattar Lal) and are allowed to stay the night as their guests, during which they attend a lavish banquet attended by the Maharajah. During the banquet, they are presented with odd culinary delicacies such as baby snakes, large beetles, eyeball soup, and chilled monkey brains. The palace rebuffs Indiana&apos;s questions about the villagers&apos; claims and his theory that the ancient Thuggee cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, however, Indiana is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Short Round to believe that something is amiss. They discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie&apos;s room and set out to explore them, facing many booby-trapped rooms and a room filled with insects along the way. From the tunnels of the palace, they travel through an underground temple where the Thuggee worship the Hindu goddess Kali with human sacrifice. The trio discover that the Thuggee, led by their evil, villainous high priest Mola Ram, are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children (as well as the Maharajah) to mine for the final two stones, which they hope will allow them to rule the world. As Indiana tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie and Short Round are captured and separated. Indiana is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the &quot; Blood of Kali &quot;, which places him in a trance-like state called the &quot; Black Sleep of Kali Ma &quot;. As a result, he begins to mindlessly serve Mola Ram. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Short Round is put in the mines to labour alongside the enslaved children. Short Round breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indiana with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. The Maharajah, who was also forcibly entranced by the &quot; Blood of Kali &quot;, attempts to sabotage Indiana with a voodoo doll. Short Round spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. The Maharajah then tells Short Round how to get out of the mines. While Mola Ram escapes, Indiana and Short Round rescue Willie, retrieve the three Sankara stones, and free the village children. After a mine cart chase to escape the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge on both ends over a gorge with crocodile-infested river flowing within. Using a sword stolen from one of the Thuggee warriors, Indiana cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving everyone to hang on for their lives. In one final struggle against Mola Ram for the Sankara stones, Indiana invokes an incantation to Shiva, causing the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into and burns Mola Ram&apos;s hand. Indiana catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below, where he is devoured by crocodiles. The Thuggee across then attempt to shoot Indiana with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen from Pankot arrive, having been summoned by the palace maharajah. In the ensuing firefight, over half of the Thuggee archers are killed and the remainder are surrounded and captured. Indiana, Willie and Short Round return victoriously to the village with the missing Sivalinga stone and the children. [ Cast ] [ List of Indiana Jones characters ] [ http://www.empireonline.com/indy/day1/2.asp The People Who Were Almost Cast Empire August 26, 2008 ] [ Scouting for Locations and New Faces TheRaider.net http://www.theraider.net/films/todoom/making_2_newfaces.php April 23, 2008 ] Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones : An archaeologist adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone. Ford undertook a strict physical exercise regimen headed by Jake Steinfeld to gain more muscular tone for the part. Kate Capshaw as Wilhelmina &quot; Willie &quot; Scott: An American nightclub singer working in Shanghai. Willie is unprepared for her adventure with Indy and Short Round, and appears to be a damsel in distress. She also forms a romantic relationship with Indy. Over 120 actresses auditioned for the role, including Sharon Stone. To prepare for the role, Capshaw watched The African Queen and A Guy Named Joe. Spielberg wanted Willie to be a complete contrast to Marion Ravenwood from Raiders of the Lost Ark, so Capshaw dyed her brown hair blonde for the part. Costume designer Anthony Powell wanted the character to have red hair. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round: Indiana&apos;s eleven-year old Chinese sidekick, who drives the 1936 Auburn Boat Tail Speedster which allows Indiana to escape during the opening sequence. Quan was chosen as part of a casting call in Los Angeles. Around 6000 actors auditioned worldwide for the part: Quan was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indiana of cheating during a card game. He was credited by his birthname, Ke Huy Quan. Amrish Puri as Mola Ram: A demon ic Thuggee priest who performs ritual s of human sacrifice s. The character is named after a 17th century Indian painter. Lucas wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so the screenwriters added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers, and European devil worship to the character. To create his headdress, make-up artist Tom Smith based the skull on a cow, and used a latex shrunken head. Roshan Seth as Chattar Lal: The Prime Minister of the Maharaja of Pankot. Chattar, also a Thuggee worshiper, is enchanted by Indy, Willie and Short Round&apos;s arrival, but is offended by Indy&apos;s questioning of the palace&apos;s history and the archaeologist&apos;s own dubious past. Philip Stone as Captain Philip Blumburtt: A British Captain in the Indian Army called to Pankot Palace for &quot; exercises &quot;. Alongside a unit of his riflemen, Blumburtt assists Indiana towards the end in fighting off Thuggee reinforcements. David Niven was attached to the role but died before filming began. Raj Singh as Zalim Singh: The adolescent Maharajá of Pankot, who appears as an innocent puppet of the Thuggee faithful. In the end he helps to defeat them. D. R. Nanayakkara as Shaman: The leader of a small village that recruits Indiana to retrieve their stolen sacred Shiva lingam stone Roy Chiao as Lao Che: A Shanghai crime boss who hires Indy to recover the cremated ashes of one of his ancestors, only to attempt to cheat him out of his fee, a large diamond. David Yip as Wu Han: A friend of Indiana. He is killed by one of Lao Che&apos;s sons while posing as a waiter at the Club Obi Wan. Actor Pat Roach plays the overseer in the mines. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy, and Dan Aykroyd have cameos at the airport. [ Production ] [ Development ] When George Lucas first approached Steven Spielberg for Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg recalled, &quot; George said if I directed the first one then I would have to direct a trilogy. He had three stories in mind. It turned out George did not have three stories in mind and we had to make up subsequent stories. &quot; { Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy, 2003, } { Paramount Pictures } Spielberg and Lucas attributed the film&apos;s tone, which was darker than Raiders of the Lost Ark, to their personal moods following the breakups of their relationships (Spielberg with Amy Irving, Lucas with Marcia ). In addition Lucas felt &quot; it had to have been a dark film. The way Empire Strikes Back was the dark second act of the Star Wars trilogy. &quot; Lucas made the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains once more. Spielberg originally wanted to bring Marion Ravenwood back, with Abner Ravenwood being considered as a possible character. [ J.W. Rinzler; Laurent Bouzereau The Complete Making of Indiana Jones Random House 2008 129–141 Temple of Death: (June 1981 – April 1983) 978-0-09-192661-8 ] Lucas created an opening chase scene that had Indiana Jones on a motorcycle on the Great Wall of China. In addition Indiana discovered a &quot; Lost World pastiche with a hidden valley inhabited by dinosaur s &quot;. Chinese authorities refused to allow filming, [ John Baxter Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas Avon Books 1999 332–341 Snake Surprise 0-380-97833-4 ] and Lucas considered the Monkey King as the plot device. [ Temple of Doom: An Oral History Empire May 1, 2008 http://www.empireonline.com/indy/day10/ May 1, 2008 ] Lucas wrote a film treatment that included a haunted castle in Scotland, but Spielberg felt it was too similar to Poltergeist. The haunted castle in Scotland slowly transformed into a demon ic temple in India. Lucas came up with ideas that involved a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. &quot; I didn&apos;t want to be associated with Temple of Doom, &quot; he reflected. &quot; I just thought it was horrible. It&apos;s so mean. There&apos;s nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [Lucas and Spielberg] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited. &quot; Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film. Huyck and Katz spent four days at Skywalker Ranch for story discussions with Lucas and Spielberg in early-1982. Lucas&apos;s initial idea for Indiana&apos;s sidekick was a virginal young princess, but Huyck, Katz and Spielberg disliked the idea. [ Adventure&apos;s New Name TheRaider.net http://www.theraider.net/films/todoom/making_1_newideas.php April 23, 2008 ] Just as Indiana Jones was named after Lucas&apos;s Alaskan Malamute, Willie was named after Spielberg&apos;s Cocker Spaniel, and Short Round was named after Huyck&apos;s dog, whose name was derived from The Steel Helmet. Lucas handed Huyck and Katz a 20-page treatment in May 1982 titled Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death to adapt into a screenplay. Scenes such as the fight scene in Shanghai, escape from the airplane and the mine cart chase came from original scripts of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lucas, Huyck and Katz had been developing Radioland Murders (1994) since the early 1970s. The opening music number was taken from that script and applied to Temple of Doom. Spielberg reflected, &quot; George&apos;s idea was to start the movie with a musical number. He wanted to do a Busby Berkeley dance number. At all our story meetings he would say, &apos;Hey, Steven, you always said you wanted to shoot musicals.&apos; I thought, &apos;Yeah, that could be fun.&apos; &quot; The first draft was delivered in early-August 1982 with a second draft in September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal and the boy Maharaja originally had more crucial roles. A dogfight was deleted, while those who drank the Kali blood turned into zombie s with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production the Temple of Death title was replaced with Temple of Doom. From March—April 1983 Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a final shooting script. [ Filming ] The filmmakers were denied permission to film in North India and Amer Fort due to the government finding the script racist and offensive. The government demanded many script changes, rewritings and final cut privilege. As a result, location work went to Kandy, Sri Lanka, with matte painting s and scale model s applied for the village, temple, and Pankot Palace. Budgetary inflation also caused Temple of Doom to cost $28.17 million, $8 million more than Raiders of the Lost Ark. Filming began on April 18, 1983 in Kandy, { Rinzler, Bouzereau, Chapter 6: &quot; Doomruners (April—August 1983, p. 142—167 } and moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England on May 5. Producer Frank Marshall recalled, &quot; when filming the bug scenes, crew members would go home and find bugs in their hair, clothes and shoes. &quot; Eight out of the nine sound stage s at Elstree housed the filming of Temple of Doom. Lucas biographer Marcus Hearn observed, &quot; Douglas Slocombe &apos;s skillful lighting helped disguise the fact that about 80 percent of the film was shot with sound stages. &quot; [ Marcus Hearn The Cinema of George Lucas Harry N.

Capshaw learned to sing in Mandarin and took tap dance lessons. However, when wearing her dress, which was too tight, Capshaw was not able to tap dance. One of her red dresses was eaten by an elephant during filming; a second was made by costume design er Anthony Powell. Production designer Norman Reynolds could not return for Temple of Doom because of his commitment to Return of the Jedi. Elliot Scott ( Labyrinth, Who Framed Roger Rabbit ), Reynolds&apos; mentor, was hired. To build the rope bridge the filmmakers found a group of British engineers working on the nearby Balfour Beatty dam. Harrison Ford suffered a severe spinal disc herniation while riding elephants. A hospital bed was brought on set for Ford to rest between takes. Lucas stated, &quot; He could barely stand up, yet he was there every day so shooting would not stop. He was in incomprehensible pain, but he was still trying to make it happen. &quot; With no alternatives, Lucas shut down production while Ford was flown to Centinela Hospital on June 21 for recovery. Stunt double Vic Armstrong spent five weeks as a stand-in for various shots. Wendy Leach, Armstrong&apos;s wife, served as Capshaw&apos;s stunt double. { The Stunts of Indiana Jones, 2003, } { Paramount Pictures } Macau was substituted for Shanghai, while cinematographer Douglas Slocombe caught fever from June 24 to July 7 and could not work. Ford returned on August 8. Despite the problems during filming, Spielberg was able to complete Temple of Doom on schedule and on budget, finishing on principal photography on August 26. Various pick-up s took place afterwards. This included Snake River Canyon in Idaho, Mammoth Mountain, Tuolumne and American River, Yosemite National Park, San Joaquin Valley, Hamilton Air Force Base and Arizona. { Rinzler, Bouzereau, Chapter 8: &quot; Forward on All Fronts (August 1983 – June 1984) &quot;, p. 168—183 } Producer Frank Marshall directed a second unit in Florida in January 1984, using alligator s to double as crocodile s.

No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. &quot; Kate Capshaw called her character &quot; not much more than a dumb screaming blonde. &quot; Steven Spielberg said in 1989, &quot; I wasn&apos;t happy with Temple of Doom at all. It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There&apos;s not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom. &quot; He later added during the &quot; Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom &quot; documentary, &quot; Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, &apos;Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw. We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom. &quot; The film&apos;s depiction of Hindus caused controversy in India, and brought it to the attention of the country&apos;s censors, who placed a temporary ban on it.

However, it is true that the thuggee cult, who were actually robbers and nothing more, used to worship Kali and offer human sacrifices so that their venture may succeed. Nevertheless, it was nothing as compared to its depiction in Spielberg&apos;s film.
