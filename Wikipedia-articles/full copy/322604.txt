[ Agamids MC_Siedleragame.jpg Male Mwanza Flat-headed Rock Agama (Agama mwanzae), in the Serengeti, Tanzania Animal ia Chordata Reptilia Squamata Lacertilia Iguania Agamidae Subfamilies 6, see text ] Agamids, lizards of the family Agamidae, include more than 300 species in Africa, Asia, Australia, and a few in Southern Europe. Many species are commonly called dragons or dragon lizards. [ Overview ] Phylogenetically they may be sister to the Iguanidae, and have a similar appearance. Agamids usually have well-developed, strong legs. Their tails cannot be shed and regenerated like those of gecko es, though a certain amount of regeneration is observed in some. [ Thompson M.B.

This group of lizards includes some more popularly known, such as the domesticated bearded dragon and the uromastyx. One of the key distinguishing features of the agamids is their teeth, which are borne on the outer rim of the mouth ( acrodont ), rather than on the inner side of the jaws ( pleurodont ). This feature is shared with the chameleon s, but is otherwise unusual among lizards. Agamid lizards are generally diurnal, with good vision, and include a number of arboreal species, in addition to ground and rock-dwellers. They generally feed on insects and other arthropod s (such as spiders), although some larger species may include small reptiles or mammals, nestling birds, flowers or other vegetable matter in their diets.

The agamids show a curious distribution. They are found over much of the Old World, including continental Africa, Australia, Southern Asia and sparsely in warmer regions of Europe. They are however absent from Madagascar and from the New World. The distribution is the opposite of that of the iguanids, who are found in just these areas but absent in areas where agamids are found. A similar faunal divide is found in between the boas and pythons. [ November 2010 ] [ Subfamilies ] Among the Agamidae, six subfamilies are generally recognized: { Agamidae, UniProt Taxonomy } [ November 2010 ] Agaminae (Africa, Asia and Australia) Amphibolurinae (Australia and New Guinea) Draconinae (South and Southeast Asia) Hydrosaurinae (Hydrosaurus, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and Indonesia) Leiolepidinae (Leiolepis, Southeast Asia) Uromasticinae (Saara and Uromastyx, Africa and south Asia) The chameleon s of the sister family Chamaeleonidae are sometimes discussed as subfamily Chamaeleoninae and subfamily Agaminae (referring to Agamidae, not the Agaminae mentioned above).
