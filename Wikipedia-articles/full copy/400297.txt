[ History ] [ County Palatine of Durham ] [ County Palatine of Durham ] The territory that became known as County Durham was originally a liberty under the control of the Bishops of Durham. The liberty was known variously as the &quot; Liberty of Durham &quot;, &quot; Liberty of St Cuthbert&apos;s Land &quot; &quot; The lands of St. Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees &quot; or &quot; The Liberty of Haliwerfolc &quot;. { Jean Scammell, &apos;&apos;The Origin and Limitations of the Liberty of Durham&apos;&apos; in &apos;&apos;The English Historical Review&apos;&apos;, Vol. 81, No. 320. (Jul., 1966), pp. 449-473. } The bishops&apos; special jurisdiction was based on claims that King Ecgfrith of Northumbria had granted a substantial territory to St Cuthbert on his election to the see of Lindisfarne in 684. In about 883, a cathedral housing the saint&apos;s remains was established at Chester-le-Street and Guthfrith, King of York granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the Tyne and the Wear. In 995 the see was moved again to Durham. Following the Norman invasion, the administrative machinery of government was only slowly extended to northern England. In the twelfth century a shire or county of Northumberland was formed, and Durham was considered to be within its bounds. { W. L. Warren, &apos;&apos;The Myth of Norman Administrative Efficiency: The Prothero Lecture&apos;&apos; in &apos;&apos;Transactions of the Royal Historical Society&apos;&apos;, 5th Ser., Vol. 34. (1984), pp. 113-132 } However the authority of the sheriff of Northumberland and his officials was disputed by the bishops. The crown still regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century. Matters came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of quo warranto held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishops&apos; case was heard in parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that &quot; from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff... nor made there proclamations or attachments &quot;. { C. M. Fraser, Edward I of England and the Regalian Franchise of Durham in Speculum, Vol. 31, No. 2. (Apr., 1956), pp. 329-342 } The arguments appear to have been accepted, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff. The area eventually became known as the &quot; County Palatine of Durham &quot;. Sadberge was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate sheriff, coroner and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in Stockton ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of, Chester-le-Street, Darlington, Easington and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the hundred court. The diocese was divided into the archdeacon ries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, Lanchester and Darlington. The term palatinus is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom. [ Early administration ] Durham palatinate plaque. At its historic extent, Durham included a main body covering the Catchment of the Pennines in the west, the River Tees in the south, the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north. { Vision of Britain - Durham historic boundaries.

Retrieved 1 December 2007. } and Norhamshire { Vision of Britain - Norhamshire ( historic map ). Retrieved 1 December 2007. } within Northumberland, and Craikshire within the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1831 the county covered an area of [ 679530 acre km2 ] { Vision of Britain - Durham (Ancient): area. Retrieved 30 November 2007 } and had a population of 253,910. { National Statistics - 200 years of the Census in... Durham. Retrieved 2 December 2007. } The historic boundaries were used for parliamentary purposes until 1832, and for judicial and local government purposes until the coming into force of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county. Until the 15th century the most important administrative officer in the palatinate was the steward. Other officers were the sheriff, the coroners, the Chamberlain and the chancellor. The palatine exchequer was organized in the 12th century. The palatine assembly represented the whole county, and dealt chiefly with fiscal questions. The bishops council, consisting of the clergy, the sheriff and the baron s, regulated the judicial affairs, and later produced the Chancery and the courts of Admiralty and Marshalsea. Durham city was captured by a Norman army in 1069. There was a rebellion against the new Norman earl Robert de Comines, who was killed. However, County Durham largely missed the Harrying of the North that was designed to subjugate such rebellions. { Douglas, D.C. William the Conqueror: The Norman Impact Upon England } The best remains of the Norman period are to be found in Durham Cathedral and in the castle, also in some few parish churches, as at Pittington and Norton in Stockton. Of the Early English period are the eastern portion of the cathedral, the churches of Darlington, Hartlepool, and St Andrew, Auckland, Sedgefield, and portions of a few other churches. The prior of Durham ranked first among the bishop&apos;s barons. He had his own court, and almost exclusive jurisdiction over his men. There were ten palatinate barons in the 12th century, the most important being the Hyltons of Hylton Castle, the Bulmers of Brancepeth, the Conyers of Sockburne, the Hansards of Evenwood, and the Lumleys of Lumley Castle. The Nevilles owned large estates in the county. Raby Castle, their principal seat, was rebuilt by John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby in 1377. Edward I &apos;s quo warranto proceedings of 1293 showed twelve lords enjoying more or less extensive franchises under the bishop. The repeated efforts of the Crown to check the powers of the palatinate bishops culminated in 1536 in the Act of Resumption, which deprived the bishop of the power to pardon offences against the law or to appoint judicial officers. Moreover, indictments and legal processes were in future to run in the name of the king, and offences to be described as against the peace of the king, rather than that of the bishop. In 1596 restrictions were imposed on the powers of the chancery, and in 1646 the palatinate was formally abolished. It was revived, however, after the Restoration, and continued with much the same power until July 5, 1836, when the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 provided that the palatine jurisdiction should in future be vested in the crown. { The } { Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will 4 c 19) } During the Wars of the Roses, Henry VI passed through Durham. On the outbreak of the Great Rebellion Durham inclined to support the cause of the Parliament, and in 1640 the high sheriff of the palatinate guaranteed to supply the Scottish army with provisions during their stay in the county. In 1642 the Earl of Newcastle formed the western counties into an association for the kings service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by the Scottish army, and after the Battle of Marston Moor fell entirely into the hands of the parliament. In 1614 a bill was introduced in parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of Barnard Castle. The movement was strongly opposed by the bishop, as an infringement of his palatinate rights, and the county was first summoned to return members to parliament in 1654. After the Restoration the county and city returned two members each. By the Reform Act of 1832 the county returned two members for two divisions, and the boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland acquired representation. The boroughs of Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool returned one member each from 1868 until the Redistribution Act of 1885.

Local Government in Britain 1994 Penguin 0-14-026739-5 ] Most of the county came under control of the newly formed Durham County Council in an area known as an administrative county. Not included were the county borough s of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. However, for purposes other than local government the administrative county of Durham and the county boroughs continued to form a &quot; county of Durham &quot; to which a Lord Lieutenant of Durham was appointed. Over its existence, the administrative county lost territory, both to the existing county boroughs, and also due to the municipal borough of West Hartlepool becoming a county borough in 1902 and Darlington in 1915. { Vision of Britain - Darlington MB/CB. Retrieved 30 November 2007. } In 1967 the former area of the borough of Hartlepool was removed from the administrative county when it merged with West Hartlepool to form a new county borough of Hartlepool. The county boundary with the North Riding of Yorkshire was adjusted: that part of the town of Barnard Castle historically in Yorkshire was added to County Durham, { Vision of Britain - Yorkshire, North Riding.

Cleveland was adopted as a postal county in 1974 and by the time of its abolition, Royal Mail had abandoned the use of counties altogether; { Royal Mail, Address Management Guide, (2004) } the County Durham former postal county therefore has not been adjusted to the new ceremonial boundary.

Cockfield Fell was one of the earliest Landsale collieries in Durham.

The port was the largest in Durham and the fourth biggest in Britain.
