Frank Warren promoted the fight, which took place on March 14, 2009 at the MEN Arena. Barrera lost the bout by a fifth-round technical decision. In the first round, the two fighters clashed heads, resulting in a deep gash above Barrera&apos;s forehead, which bled throughout the bout.

Before this fight, Barrera had fought Freudis Rojas on January 31, 2009 in Zapopan, Jalisco. Rojas was disqualified for a headbutt which left Barrera with a bad cut over his left eye.
