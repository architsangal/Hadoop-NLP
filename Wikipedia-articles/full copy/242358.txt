[ This article is about the Iranian deliberative body. For the former Greenlandic guardian councils, see parsissaet. ] [ Guardian Council شورای نگهبان Coat of arms of Iran.svg Election management body Chairman Ahmad Jannati August 29, 1988 12 Tehran, Iran ] The Guardian Council of the Constitution [ http://www.shora-gc.ir/Portal/Home/ Shora-gc.ir Shora-gc.ir 2010-08-21 ] ( [ شورای نگهبان قانون اساسی ], Shora-ye Negahban-e Qanun-e Assassi), also known as the Guardian Council or Council of Guardians, is an appointed and constitutionally-mandated 12-member council that wields considerable power and influence in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian constitution calls for the council to be composed of six Islamic faqihs (expert in Islamic Law), &quot; conscious of the present needs and the issues of the day &quot; to be selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran, and six jurists, &quot; specializing in different areas of law, to be elected by the Majlis (the Iranian Parliament) from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial Power, &quot; { Powers and Authority of The Islamic Consultative Assembly } (who, in turn, is also appointed by the supreme leader). { Article No.91 http://mellat.majlis.ir/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } It is charged with interpreting the Constitution of Iran, { Article 98 of the constitution } supervising elections of, and approving of candidates to, the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis, { Article 99 of the constitution } and &quot; ensuring... the compatibility of the legislation passed by the Islamic Consultative Assembly [i.e. Majlis]... with the criteria of Islam and the Constitution &quot;, i.e., as the watchdog of the constitution it can veto any law passed by the Majlis. { Articles 96 and 94 of the constitution. } The Council has played a central role in allowing only one interpretation of Islamic values to inform Iranian law, as it consistently disqualifies reform-minded candidates—including the most well-known candidates—from running for office, and vetoes laws passed by the popularly elected Majlis. { Whose Iran?, Laura Secor, } { New York Times, January 28, 2007. Retrieved September 22, 2008. } { Iran: Voices Struggling To Be Heard, U.S. Department of State Fact Sheet, April 9, 2004. Retrieved September 22, 2008. } When the 2009 Presidential election was announced, the popular former president, Mohammad Khatami, would not discuss his plans to run against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the Council may disqualify the Muslim cleric as it has other reformist candidates on the grounds that they were not dedicated enough to Islamic values. { Khatami reluctant to discuss candidacy, Maryam Sinaiee, } { The National, September 21, 2008. } { Split hard-liners hold Iran parliament, AP via } { USA Today, March 16, 2008. } It has also increased the influence the Islamic Revolutionary Guard (an ideological fighting force separate from the Iranian army ) has on the economic and cultural life of the country. [ Legislative functions ] The Guardian Council does not introduce bills. Bills are introduced in the Majlis; but any bill passed by the Majlis must be reviewed and approved by the Guardian Council, { Article 94 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } { IRANIAN LEGISLATURE APPROVES FUNDS FOR GASOLINE IMPORTS provides an example the need for approval of the Guardian Council. } The Majlis has no legal status without the Guardian Council. { Article 93 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } According to Article 96 of the constitution, the Guardian Council holds veto power over all legislation approved by the Majlis. It can nullify a law based on two accounts: being against Islamic laws, { Article 4 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } or being against the constitution. While all the members vote on the laws being compatible with the constitution, only the six clerics vote on them being compatible with Islam. If any law is rejected, it will be passed back to the Majlis for correction. If the Majlis and the Council of Guardians cannot decide on a case, it is passed up to the Expediency Council for a decision. { Article 112 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } The Guardian Council is uniquely involved in the legislative process, with equal oversight with regards to economic law and social policy, including such controversial topics as abortion. Chapter 6 of the Constitution explains its interworkings with the Islamic Consultative Assembly. Articles 91-97 all fall in the legislative Chapter 6. [ Judicial authority ] The Council of Guardians also functions similar to a constitutional court. The authority to interpret the constitution is vested in the Council; { Article 98 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } interpretative decisions require a three-quarters majority of the Council. However, it does not conduct a court hearing where opposing sides are argued. [ Electoral authority ] Since 1991, all candidates of parliamentary or presidential { Article 110 Clause 9 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } elections, as well as candidates for the Assembly of Experts, have to be qualified by the Guardian Council in order to run in the election. The Council is accorded &quot; supervision of elections &quot;. { Article 99 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } { خانه ملت } The Guardian Council interprets the term supervision in Article 99 as &quot; approbation supervision &quot; ( [ نظارت استصوابی ] ) { http://www.shora-gc.ir/Portal/Home/ShowPage.aspx?Object=News &amp; ID=7ca3f12d-47c1-4ac5-a088-397771794abb &amp; LayoutID=e3152b95-620e-4dfd-97f1-1fefd0f696b1 &amp; CategoryID=8fac823a-5745-41b6-a9e2-b879c74deb7b } which implies the right for acceptance or rejection of elections legality and candidates competency. This interpretation is in contrast with the idea of &quot; notification supervision &quot; ( [ نظارت استطلاعی ] ) which does not imply the mentioned approval right. { magiran.com: نشريه حقوق اساسي، شماره 7 } The &quot; evidentiary supervision &quot; ( [ نظارت استنادی ] ), which requires evidences for acceptance or rejection of elections legality and candidates competency, is another interpretation of mentioned article. { Mellat Electronic Newspaper } { http://www.irannewspaper.ir/1382/820205/html/politic.htm#s210702 } [ Role in the 2009 elections ] [ Iranian presidential election, 2009 ] On Monday, June 29, 2009, the Guardian Council certified the results of the controversial election in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected. [ Iran Council Certifies Disputed Election Results Michael Slackman June 29, 2009 June 29, 2009 New York Times ] The Council had completed a recount of 10% percent of the overall votes in order to appease the citizens of Iran. [ Lebanon&apos;s President congratulates Admadinejad on re-election June 30, 2009 June 30, 2009 http://televisionwashington.com/floater_article1.aspx?lang%3Den%26amp%3Bt%3D2%26amp%3Bid%3D11715 Washington TV ] As the &quot; final authority on the election &quot;, the Council has declared the election closed. [ Iran Electoral Body: Won&apos;t Accept More Election Objections June 30, 2009 June 30, 2009 http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/iran-electoral-body-won-t-accept-more-election-objections-693959 EasyBourse ] The certification of the results set off a wave of protests, disregarding the Iranian government&apos;s ban on street marches. The Iranian intelligence chief alleged that western and &quot; Zionist &quot; forces were responsible for inciting the protests. [ Criticism ] [ Increases the role of the army in everyday life ] The Council favors military candidates at the expense of reform candidates. This ensures that the ideological Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (separate from the Iranian army) holds a commanding influence over the political, economic, and cultural life of Iran. { The Revolutionary Guards&apos; Role in Iranian Politics, } { Ali Alfoneh, } { Middle East Quarterly, Fall 2008; accessed via AEI&apos;s website on September 22, 2008. } [ Arbitrarily disqualifies candidates from elections ] Hadi Khamenei, the brother of Supreme Leader Ali Khameni and an adviser in the administration of reformist former President Mohammad Khatami, said the Guardian Council&apos;s vetting of candidates threatens Iranian democracy. He believes some reformist candidates are wrongly kept from running. [ Khamenei&apos;s brother attacks reformist purge BBC News 2000-01-12 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/600741.stm 2009-07-28 ] In 1998, the Guardian Council rejected Hadi Khamenei&apos;s candidacy for a seat in the Assembly of Experts for &quot; insufficient theological qualifications. &quot; [ A.

[ Overview of Human Rights Issues in Iran Human Rights Watch 2005-01-13 http://www.hrw.org/legacy/english/docs/2005/01/13/iran9803.htm3/iran9803_txt.htm 2009-07-28 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] In the run-up to the Iranian Assembly of Experts election, 2006, all women candidates were disqualified. { The Iranian Regime: Human Rights and Civil Liberties Under Siege, U.S. State Department Fact Sheet, April 18, 2007. Retrieved September 23, 2008. } The Council disqualified many candidates in the 2008 parliamentary elections. One third of them were members of the outgoing parliament it had previously approved. The Iranian Ministry of the Interior gave nebulous, arbitrary reasons for disqualifying the majority of the candidates, including narcotics addiction or involvement in drug-smuggling, connections to the Shah&apos;s pre-revolutionary government, lack of belief in or insufficient practice of Islam, being &quot; against &quot; the Islamic Republic, or having connections to foreign intelligence services. [ Rule by unelected leaders ] This unelected Council frequently vetoes bills passed by the popularly-elected legislature. It repeatedly vetoes bills in favor of women’s rights, electoral reform, the prohibition of torture and ratification of international human rights treaties. [ Composition ] The Council is composed of Islam ic clerics and lawyers. [ http://portal.irisn.com/aza/aza.htm irisn.com Portal.irisn.com 2010-08-21 ] Membership is for phased six-year terms: half the membership changes every three years. The Supreme Leader (Iran&apos;s Head of State ) nominates six clerics, { Article 91 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } and may constitutionally dismiss them at will. { Article 110 http://mellat.majlis.ir/archive/CONSTITUTION/ENGLISH.HTM } The head of the judicial system of Iran, himself selected by the Supreme Leader, nominates six lawyers for confirmation by the Majlis.
