His parents worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. One of four children, he attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to Emanuel School in London, from 1969 to 1973. He studied at The Queen&apos;s College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class degree in Physics. [ Career ] Berners-Lee, 2005 While an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980, Berners-Lee proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. [ Berners-Lee&apos;s original proposal to CERN World Wide Web Consortium March 1989 http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html 25 May 2008 ] While there, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE. [ Stewart Bill Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and the World Wide Web http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_lee.htm 22 July 2010 ] After leaving CERN in 1980, he went to work at John Poole&apos;s Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, England. [ Frequently asked questions http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html World Wide Web Consortium 22 July 2010 Tim Berners-Lee ] The project he worked on was a real-time remote procedure call which gave him experience in computer network ing. In 1984 he returned to CERN as a fellow. In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet: &quot; I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web. &quot; [ Tim Berners-Lee Answers for Young People World Wide Web Consortium http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids 25 May 2008 ] “Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.” [ http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/ber1int-1 Biography and Video Interview of Timothy Berners-Lee at Academy of Achievement Achievement.org 2011-12-21 ] He wrote his initial proposal in March 1989, and in 1990, with the help of Robert Cailliau (with whom he shared the 1995 ACM Software System Award ), produced a revision which was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall. [ Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Story/WelcomeStory.html CERN 21 July 2010 ] He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first Web browser. This also functioned as an editor ( WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon ). [ &quot; Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to Tim [Berners-Lee]. Tim&apos;s prototype implementation on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development system. This prototype offers WYSIWYG browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in &quot; surfing the Internet &quot; are mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria, Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology. Tim proposes &quot; World-Wide Web &quot;. I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce in French... &quot; by Robert Cailliau, 2 November 1995. Roads and Crossroads of Internet History Chapter 4: Birth of the Web ] The first website built was at CERN within the border of France [ Tim Berners-Lee.

The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which centred on information regarding the WWW project. Visitors could learn more about hypertext, technical details for creating their own webpage, and even an explanation on how to search the Web for information. There are no screenshots of this original page and, in any case, changes were made daily to the information available on the page as the WWW project developed. You may find a later copy (1992) on the World Wide Web Consortium website. &quot; -CERN It provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how one could use a browser and set up a web server.

It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they could easily be adopted by anyone.

Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010 Berners-Lee said that: &quot; The changes signal a wider cultural change in Government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around. &quot; He went on to say &quot; Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them. &quot; [ Ordnance Survey offers free data access BBC News 1 April 2010 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8597779.stm 3 April 2009 ] In November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation in order to &quot; Advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change. &quot; { FAQ—World Wide Web Foundation Retrieved 18 January 2011 } Berners-Lee is one of the pioneer voices in favour of Net Neutrality, [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7613201.stm Web creator rejects net tracking BBC 15 September 2008 15 September 2008 Warning sounded on web&apos;s future.
