[ Child protection ] Many Vachss novels feature the shadowy, unlicensed investigator Burke, an ex-con, career criminal, and deeply conflicted character. About his protagonist, Vachss says: [ http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/vachss.html &quot; Andrew Vachss: A Man Who Will Die Trying &quot;, by Paula Guran, &apos; &amp; #39;Horror Online,&apos; &amp; #39; May 1999 Darkecho.com 2012-02-02 ] Vachss coined the phrase &quot; Children of the Secret &quot;, which refers to abused children, of whatever age, who were victimized without ever experiencing justice, much less love and protection. [ http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/buffalo_news_95.html Children of the Secret Vachss.com 1995-11-13 2012-02-02 ] In the Burke novels, some of these Children of the Secret have banded together as adults into what Vachss calls a &quot; family of choice &quot;.

Most are career criminals; none allows the law to come before the duty to family. [ Dogs ] Another important theme that pervades Vachss&apos; work is his love of dog s, particularly breeds considered &quot; dangerous, &quot; such as Doberman pinschers, rottweilers, and especially pit bulls.

[ http://www.vachss.com/media/righteous/ascione.html Breed-specific legislation Vachss.com 2012-02-02 ] With fellow crime writer James Colbert, Vachss has trained dogs to serve as therapy dog s for abused children. The dogs have a calming effect on traumatized children. Vachss notes that using these particular breeds further increases the victims&apos; feelings of security; their &quot; dangerous &quot; appearance, in combination with the extensive therapy training, makes them excellent protection against human threats.
