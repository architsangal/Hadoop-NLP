Species See text ] Crataegus ( [ icon k r ə ˈ t iː ɡ ə s ] ), { Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 } commonly called hawthorn or thornapple, { Voss, E.G. 1985.

Cranbrook Institute of Science and University of Michigan Herbarium, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. } is a large genus of shrub s and tree s in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia and North America. The name hawthorn was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the Common Hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. However the name is now also applied to the entire genus, and also to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis. { Crataegus monogyna &apos;&apos; } { C. monogyna &apos;&apos; } They are shrub s or small tree s, mostly growing to [ 5 – 15 m ] tall, { Phipps, J.B., O’Kennon, R.J., Lance, R.W. (2003). Hawthorns and medlars. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K. } with small pome fruit and (usually) thorny branches. The most common type of bark is smooth grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in older trees. The thorns are small sharp-tipped branches that arise either from other branches or from the trunk, and are typically 1–3  cm long (recorded as up to [ 11.5 cm ] in one case ). The leaves grow spirally arranged on long shoots, and in clusters on spur shoots on the branches or twigs. The leaves of most species have lobed or serrate margins and are somewhat variable in shape. The fruit, sometimes known as a &quot; haw &quot;, is berry -like, but structurally a pome containing from 1 to 5 pyrene s that resemble the &quot; stones &quot; of plum s, peach es, etc. which are drupaceous fruit in the same subfamily. Hawthorns provide food and shelter for many species of bird s and mammal s, and the flower s are important for many nectar-feeding insect s. Hawthorns are also used as food plants by the larva e of a large number of Lepidoptera species; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on hawthorns. Haws are important for wildlife in winter, particularly thrushes and waxwing s; these birds eat the haws and disperse the seed s in their droppings. Many species and hybrids are used as ornamental and street trees. The Common Hawthorn is extensively used in Europe as a hedge plant. Several cultivar s of the Midland Hawthorn C. laevigata have been selected for their pink or red flowers. Hawthorns are among the trees most recommended for water conservation landscapes. [ in what part of the world? Not in dry parts of the US, where they grow only near water May 2009 ] [ Taxonomy ] The number of species in the genus depends on taxonomic interpretation. Some botanists in the past recognised a thousand or more species, { Palmer, E.J. (1925). Synopsis of North American Crataegi. Journal of the Arnold Arboretum. 6(1-2): 5–128. } many of which are apomictic microspecies. It is estimated that a reasonable number is 200 species, but it is not yet clear how many species should be recognized because &quot; a large portion of the synonymy, especially in North American Crataegus, has not been worked out. &quot; { Phipps, J.B.; Robertson, K.R.; Smith, P.G.; Rohrer, J.R.

Small plants or suckers are often transplanted from the wild. Seeds require stratification and take one or two years to germinate. { Bailey, L.H.; Bailey, E.Z.; the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium. 1976. Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada. Macmillan, New York. } Seed germination is improved if the pyrenes that contain the seed are subjected to extensive drying at room temperature, before stratification. { Bujarska-Borkowska, B. (2002) Breaking of seed dormancy, germination and seedling emergence of the common hawthorn (&apos;&apos;Crataegus monogyna&apos;&apos; Jacq.). &apos;&apos;Dendrobiology&apos;&apos;. 47(Supplement): 61–70. } Uncommon forms can be grafted onto seedlings of other species. [ Uses ] [ Culinary use ] The fruits of the species Crataegus pinnatifida (Chinese Hawthorn) are tart, bright red, and resemble small crabapple fruits. They are used to make many kinds of Chinese snacks, including haw flakes and tanghulu (糖葫芦). The fruits, which are called shānzhā ( 山 楂 ) in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks. In South Korea, a liquor called sansachun (산사춘) is made from the fruits. The fruits of Crataegus mexicana are known in Mexico as tejocotes and are eaten raw, cooked, or in jam during the winter months. They are stuffed in the piñata s broken during the traditional pre-Christmas celebration known as Las Posadas. They are also cooked with other fruits to prepare a Christmas punch. The mixture of tejocote paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called rielitos, which is manufactured by several brands. In the southern United States fruits of three native species are collectively known as mayhaw s and are made into jellies which are considered a great delicacy. On Manitoulin Island in Canada, some red-fruited species are called hawberries. They are common there thanks to the island&apos;s distinctive alkaline soil. During the pioneer days, white settlers ate these fruits during the winter as the only remaining food supply. People born on the island are now called &quot; haweater s &quot;. In Iran, the fruits of Crataegus (including Crataegus azarolus var. aronia, as well as other species) are known as zalzalak and are eaten raw as a snack, or used as in a jam known by the same name. The leaves are edible and, if picked in spring when still young, they are tender enough to be used in salads. { Richard Mabey, Food for Free, Collins, October 2001. } [ Medicinal use ] Several species of hawthorn have been used in traditional medicine, and there is considerable interest in testing hawthorn products for evidence-based medicine. The products being tested are often derived from C. monogyna, C laevigata, or related Crataegus species, &quot; collectively known as hawthorn &quot;, not necessarily distinguishing between these species, which are very similar in appearance. A meta-analysis of previous studies concluded that there is evidence of benefit for an extract in treating chronic heart failure. [ Pittler MH, Guo R, Ernst E Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Cochrane Database Syst Rev Jan 23 1 CD005312 2008 18254076 10.1002/14651858.CD005312.pub2 Hawthorn extract for treating chronic heart failure Guo Ruoling ] A 2010 review { Tassell, M.; Kingston, R.; Gilroy, D.; Lehane, M.; Furey, A. (2010). Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. &apos;&apos;Pharmacognosy Review&apos;&apos;. 4(7): 32-41. } cites the need for further study of the best dosages and concludes that although &quot; many different theoretical interactions between Crataegus and orthodox medications have been postulated... none have [yet] been substantiated. The dried fruit s of Crataegus pinnatifida (called shān zhā in Chinese) are used in naturopathic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as a digestive aid. A closely related species, Crataegus cuneata (Japanese Hawthorn, called sanzashi in Japanese) is used in a similar manner. Other species (especially Crataegus laevigata) are used in herbal medicine where the plant is believed to strengthen cardiovascular function. [ Dharmananda S. Hawthorn (Crataegus). Food and Medicine in China Institute of Traditional Medicine Online January 2004 http://www.itmonline.org/arts/crataegus.htm ] Another use of this herb is as a mild sedative in promotion of sleep. [ November 2010 ] Hawthorn should not be used during pregnancy. [ November 2010 ] Active ingredients found in hawthorn include tannin s, flavonoid s (such as vitexin, rutin, quercetin, and hyperoside ), oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs, such as epicatechin, procyanidin, and particularly procyanidin B-2 ), flavone-C, triterpene acid s (such ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, and crataegolic acid ), and phenolic acid s (such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and related phenolcarboxylic acids).Standardization of hawthorn products is based on content of flavonoid s (2.2%) and OPCs (18.75%). { https://www.achs.edu/Mediabank/files/HawthornHerb.pdf American College of Healthcare Sciences, Summary of Medical Articles. } { Ed Greenwood 1995, Electronic version of A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-Lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs &amp; Trees with their Modern Scientific Uses, by Mrs. M. Grieve, first published 1931. } [ Human studies ] Several pilot studies have assessed the ability of hawthorn to help improve exercise tolerance in people with NYHA class II cardiac insufficiency compared to placebo. One experiment, at (300  mg/day) for 4 to 8 weeks, found no difference from placebo. The second study, including 78 subjects (600  mg/day) for 8 weeks, found &quot; significant improvement in exercise tolerance &quot; and lower blood pressure and heart rate during exercise. The third, including 32 subjects (900  mg/day) for 8 weeks, found improved exercise tolerance as well as a reduction in the &quot; incidence and severity of symptoms such as dyspnea &quot; and fatigue decreased by approximately 50%. { Harry Fong &amp; Jerry Bauman 2002. Alternative Medicines for Cardiovascular Diseases--Hawthorn, Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 16(4):1-8] } In the HERB-CHF (Hawthorn Extract Randomized Blinded Chronic HF Study) clinical study, 120 patients took 450  mg of hawthorn extract twice daily for 6 months in combination with standard therapy and a standardized exercise program. &quot; No effects of hawthorn were seen on either quality-of-life endpoint (Tables 1 and 2), or when adjusted for LVEF &quot;. { Aaronson K: HERB-CHF: Hawthorn Extract Randomized Blinded Chronic Heart Failure Trial. In, 2004 } One research program, consisting of 1,011 patients taking one tablet (standardized to 84.3  mg procyanidin ) twice daily for 24 weeks, found &quot; improvements in clinical symptoms (such as fatigue, palpitations, and exercise dyspnea), performance and exercise tolerance test, and ejection fraction &quot;. { Sweet JMRBV (2002).

Milder side effects include nausea and sedation. { Sloan-Kettering - Hawthorn } [ Other uses ] { rootstock on a } { medlar tree in } { Totnes, } { United Kingdom. } The wood of some hawthorn species is very hard and resistant to rot. In rural North America it was prized for use as tool handles and fence posts. [ Grafting ] Hawthorn can also be used as a rootstock in the practice of grafting. It is graft-compatible with Mespilus (medlar), and with pear, and makes a hardier rootstock than quince, but the thorny suckering habit of the hawthorn can be problematic. Seedling s of Crataegus monogyna, have been used to graft multiple species on the same trunk, such as Pink hawthorn, pear tree and medlar, the result being trees which give pink and white flowers in May and fruits during the summer. &quot; Chip budding &quot; has also been performed on hawthorn trunks in order to have several branches of several varieties on the same tree. Such trees can be seen in Vigo, Spain and in the north west of France (mainly in Brittany ). [ May 2009 ] [ Folklore ] The saying &quot; Ne&apos;er cast a cloot til Mey&apos;s oot &quot; conveys a warning not to shed any cloots (clothes) before the summer has fully arrived and the may flowers ( hawthorn blossoms) are in full bloom.

In the Scottish Highlands the flowers may be seen as late as the middle of June. The hawthorn has been regarded as the emblem of hope, and its branches are stated to have been carried by the ancient Greeks in wedding processions, and to have been used by them to deck the altar of Hymenaios. The supposition that the tree was the source of Jesus &apos;s crown of thorns doubtless gave rise around 1911 to the tradition among the French peasantry that it utters groans and cries on Good Friday, and probably also to the old popular superstition in Great Britain and Ireland that ill-luck attended the uprooting of hawthorns. Branches of Glastonbury Thorn, (C. monogyna &apos;Biflora&apos;, sometimes called C. oxyacantha var. praecox), which flowers both in December and in spring, were formerly highly valued in England, on account of the legend that the tree was originally the staff of Joseph of Arimathea. Robert Graves, in his book The White Goddess traces and reinterprets many European legends, to which the whitethorn (hawthorn) is central. In Celtic lore, the hawthorn plant was used commonly for rune inscriptions [ what does it mean to use a tree for rune inscriptions? Carve on the trunk of a living tree? February 2010 ] along with Yew and Apple. It was once said to heal the broken heart. In Ireland, the red fruit is, or was in living memory [ whose living memory, how ancient is this person? May 2009 ], called the Johnny MacGorey or Magory. Serbian and Croatian folklore notes hawthorn ( Serbian глог / glog, Croatian glog) is particularly deadly to vampire s, and stakes used for their slaying must be made from the wood of the thorn tree [ May 2009 ]. In Gaelic folklore, hawthorn (in Scottish Gaelic, Sgitheach and in Irish, sceach) &apos;marks the entrance to the otherworld &apos; and is strongly associated with the fairies. { Campbell, John Gregorson (1900, 1902, 2005) The Gaelic Otherworld. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh, Birlinn Ltd. ISBN 1-84158-207-7 p.345 } Lore has it that it is very unlucky to cut the tree at any time other than when it is in bloom, however during this time it is commonly cut and decorated as a May Bush (see Beltane ). { Danaher, Kevin (1972) The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs Dublin, Mercier. ISBN 1-85635-093-2 pp.86-127 } This warning persists to modern times; it has been questioned by folklorist Bob Curran whether the ill luck of the De Lorean Motor Company was associated with the destruction of a fairy thorn to make way for a production facility. [ Monaghan Patricia The Red-Haired Girl from the Bog: The Landscape of Celtic Myth and Spirit New World Library 2004-03-11 67 978-1-57731-458-5 ] Hawthorn trees are often found beside clootie well s; at these types of holy wells they are sometimes known as &apos;rag trees&apos;, for the strips of cloth which are tied to them as part of healing rituals. { Healy, Elizabeth (2002) In Search of Ireland&apos;s Holy Wells. Dublin, Wolfhound Press ISBN 0-86327-865-5 pp.56-7, 69, 81 } &apos;When all fruit fails, welcome haws&apos; was once a common expression in Ireland.
