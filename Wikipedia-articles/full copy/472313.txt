In the 2001 census Oronsay was recorded as having a population of five people, who live at the farm adjacent to Oronsay Priory. The island has no facilities of its own, and is entirely dependent upon its tidal access to and from Colonsay. The rocks and skerries of Eilean nan Ròn (Seal Island), to the south-west, are an important Grey Seal breeding colony. In order to conserve the population of resident Chough s and breeding Corncrake s Oronsay and southern Colonsay became a Special Protection Area in December 2007.

Either it is Oran&apos;s Isle, St Oran being the founder of the island&apos;s monastery in 563, or it may be from the Old Norse Örfirisey meaning &quot; island of the ebb tide &quot;. { Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 52. } { Watson (2004) p. 505. } [ History ] On a visit to Colonsay in the 18th century, Sir Joseph Banks was informed that, &quot; Macdufie was a factor or manager for Macdonald King of the Isles upon these islands of Oransay and Colonsay &amp; that for his mismanagement &amp; tyranny he was executed by order of that prince &quot;.

The Priory was modest in scale, but has one of the most complete (though somewhat restored) cloister garths of any Scottish medieval religious house. In the late Middle Ages a distinct &apos;school&apos; of monumental sculpture flourished on Oronsay, leaving many slabs with effigies or other carvings at the Priory itself, or at other religious sites throughout the Hebrides to which they were exported. [ August 2007 ] See examples pictured below. The production of sculpture ceased at the Scottish Reformation. [ August 2007 ] Oronsay is one of several Hebridean islands that have furnished archaeologists with invaluable information about the Mesolithic period of prehistory, particularly about the diet of human beings. { Queen Elizabeth &apos;s visit. } Tombs on Oransay [ See also ] Oronsay Priory Prior of Oronsay [ References and footnotes ] General references [ Moncreiffe of that Ilk Iain Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk The Highland Clans 1967 Barrie &amp; Rocklif London M1 ] [ 2005 September On the Monastic Trail: Oronsay Hidden Europe Magazine 4 pp. 16–18 http://www.hiddeneurope.co.uk/article_info.php?articles_id%3D97 2008-12-13 ] Watson, W.J.
