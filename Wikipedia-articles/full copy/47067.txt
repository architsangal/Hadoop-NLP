Emesa, Syria c. 20 April 167 Rome, Roman Empire ] [ Anicetus late first century c. 20 April 168 20 April Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy Emesa (modern-day Homs ), Syria Rome, Roman Empire Pope Papal tiara, palm branch ] Pope Saint Anicetus was Pope of the Catholic Church from about 150 to about 167 (the Vatican&apos;s list cites 150 to 167 or 153 to 168). His name is Greek for unconquered (ἀ-νίκητος). He was a Syrian from the city of Emesa (modern-day Homs). According to Irenaeus, it was during his pontificate that the aged Polycarp of Smyrna, a disciple of John the Evangelist, visited Rome to discuss the celebration of Passover with Anicetus. Polycarp and his Church of Smyrna celebrated the crucifixion on the fourteenth day of Nisan, which coincides with Pesach (or Passover) regardless of which day of the week upon this date fell, while the Roman Church celebrated the Pasch on Sunday —the weekday of Jesus &apos; resurrection. The two did not agree on a common date, but Anicetus conceded to St Polycarp and the Church of Smyrna the ability to retain the date to which they were accustomed. The controversy was to grow heated in the following centuries. The Christian historian Hegesippus also visited Rome during Anicetus&apos; pontificate. This visit is often cited as a sign of the early importance of the Roman See. St Anicetus was the first Roman Bishop to condemn heresy by forbidding Montanism. He also actively opposed the Gnostic s and Marcionism. According to Liber Pontificalis, Anicetus decreed that priests are not allowed to have long hair (perhaps because the Gnostics wore long hair). { http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Pope_Anicetus } According to legend, St Anicetus suffered martyrdom during the reign of the Roman Co-Emperor Lucius Verus, but there are no historical grounds for this account. { Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 120 } 16, 17 and 20 April are all cited as the date of his death, but 20 April is currently celebrated as his feast day. { Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7) } Before 1970, the date chosen was 17 April.
