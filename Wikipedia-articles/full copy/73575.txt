Hanneman, King, and bassist/lead vocalist Tom Araya, contribute to the band&apos;s lyrics. King and Hanneman create and arrange the music with additional arrangement from drummer Dave Lombardo and sometimes Araya. The band&apos;s lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, Satanism, religion and war fare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public. Since their debut album in 1983, the band has released two live album s, one box set, six videos, two extended play s, and eleven studio album s, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning two of them; one in 2007 for the song &quot; Eyes of the Insane &quot;, and one in 2008 for the song &quot; Final Six &quot; (both from 2006&apos;s Christ Illusion ).

The tour gave the band additional popularity; sales of Show No Mercy reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.

The video featured live footage filmed at New York &apos;s Studio 54 club, on the band&apos;s 1984 tour with Venom and Exodus. By early 1985, Show No Mercy had sold over 40,000 copies, which led to the band returning to the studio to record a second full length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, which allowed the band to hire producer Ron Fair. Released in September 1985, Slayer&apos;s second full length release Hell Awaits expanded on the darkness of Haunting the Chapel, with hell and Satan as common song subjects. The album was the band&apos;s most progressive offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures. The intro of the title track is a backwards recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating &quot; Join us &quot;, ending with &quot; Welcome back &quot; before the track begins.
