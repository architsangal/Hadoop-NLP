He is regarded as one of the greatest coaches in college football history. [ Whittingham Richard Rites of autumn: the story of college football 2001 The Free Press New York 0-7432-2219-9 58–61 3 ] His biography at the College Football Hall of Fame calls him &quot; without question, American football&apos;s most-renowned coach. &quot; A Norwegian American, he was educated as a chemist at the University of Notre Dame. He popularized the forward pass and made Notre Dame a major factor in collegiate football. [ Early life ] Knute Rockne was born Knut Larsen Rokne in Voss, Norway to the smith and wagonmaker Lars Knutson Rokne (1858–1912) and his wife Martha Pedersdatter Gjermo (1859–1944). He emigrated with his parents at five years old to Chicago. [ Death of Rockne http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C741372%2C00.html Time Magazine April 6, 1931 23 January 2009 ] He grew up in the Logan Square area of Chicago, on the northwest side of the city. Rockne learned to play football in his neighborhood and later played end in a local group called the Logan Square Tigers. He attended North West Division High School in Chicago playing football and also running track. After Rockne graduated from high school, he took a job as a mail dispatcher with the Chicago Post Office for four years. When he was 22, he had saved enough money to continue his education. He headed to Notre Dame in Indiana to finish his schooling. Rockne excelled as a football end while at the university, winning All-American honors in 1913. He also helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the highly-regarded Army team 35–13 in a game played at West Point. Led by quarterback Charlie &quot; Gus &quot; Dorais and Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward pass es from Dorais to Rockne. This game was not the &quot; invention &quot; of the forward pass but it was the first major contest in which a team used the forward pass regularly throughout the game. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1914 with a degree in pharmacy. After graduating he was the laboratory assistant to noted polymer chemist Julius Arthur Nieuwland at Notre Dame and helped out with the football team, but rejected further work in chemistry after receiving an offer to coach football. [ Notre Dame coach ] left Portions of this section are adapted from Murray Sperber &apos;s book Shake Down The Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football During 13 years as head coach, Rockne led his &quot; Fighting Irish &quot; to 105 victories, 12 losses, five ties, and three national championships, including five undefeated seasons without a tie. Rockne posted the highest all-time winning percentage (.881) for an American football coach, college or professional. His players included George &apos;Gipper&apos; Gipp, the &quot; Four Horsemen &quot; ( Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden ), Frank Thomas, Frank Leahy, Curly Lambeau, Jack Chevigny, and Johnny O&apos;Brien. Rockne introduced the &quot; shift &quot;, with the backfield lining up in a T formation and then quickly shifting into a box to the left or right just as the ball was snapped. Rockne was also shrewd enough to recognize that intercollegiate sports had a show-business aspect. Thus he worked hard promoting Notre Dame football so as to make it financially successful. He used his considerable charm to court favor from the media, which then consisted of newspapers, wire services and radio stations and networks, to obtain free advertising for Notre Dame football. He was very successful as an advertising pitchman, for South Bend -based Studebaker and other products. For all his success, Rockne also made what an Associated Press writer called &quot; one of the greatest coaching blunders in history. &quot; [ http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2007/09/06/Sports/Rocknes.Gaffe.Remembered-2953261.shtml Rockne&apos;s gaffe remembered The Daily Texan Texas Student Media Robinson, Alan September 9, 2007 2007-09-06 ] Instead of coaching his 1926 team against Carnegie Tech, Rockne traveled to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to &quot; write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team. &quot; Carnegie Tech used the coach&apos;s absence as motivation for a 19 –0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title. On November 10, 1928, when the &quot; Fighting Irish &quot; team was losing to undefeated Army 6-0 at the end of the half, Rockne entered the locker room and told the team the words he heard on Gipp&apos;s deathbed in 1920: &quot; I&apos;ve got to go, Rock. It&apos;s all right. I&apos;m not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they&apos;ve got and win just one for the Gipper. I don&apos;t know where I&apos;ll be then, Rock. But I&apos;ll know about it, and I&apos;ll be happy. &quot; This inspired the team, who tied Army 6-6 in the third quarter with senior Jack Chevigny&apos;s, &quot; that&apos;s one for the Gipper &quot; touchdown and sophomore Johnny &quot; one play &quot; O&apos;brien&apos;s 12-6 game winning touchdown with three minutes left to play. Obrien would be killed in an auto accident in 1937 and Chevigny would be killed in action on Iwo Jima in 1945. [ Plane crash ] [ TWA Flight 599 ] Rockne died in a plane crash in Kansas on March 31, 1931, while en route to participate in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame. Shortly after taking off from Kansas City, where he had stopped to visit his two sons, Bill and Knute Jr., who were in boarding school there at the Pembroke-Country Day School, one of the Fokker Trimotor aircraft&apos;s wings separated in flight. The plane crashed into a wheat field near Bazaar, Kansas, killing Rockne and seven others. { The Official Knute Rockne Web Site. URL accessed 03:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC) } President Herbert Hoover called Rockne&apos;s death &quot; a national loss. &quot; A personal envoy represented King Haakon VII of Norway at Rockne&apos;s funeral. On the spot where the plane crashed, a memorial dedicated to the victims stands surrounded by a wire fence with wooden posts; it was maintained for many years by James Easter Heathman, who, at age thirteen in 1931, was one of the first people to arrive at the site of the tragedy. [ Maria Sudekum Fisher J. E.

[ Legacy ] Knute Rockne bronze sculpture in Voss, Norway. Rockne was not the first coach to use the forward pass, but he helped popularize it nationally. Most football historians agree that a few schools, notably Saint Louis University (under coach Eddie Cochems ), Michigan, Carlisle and Minnesota, had passing attacks in place before Rockne arrived at Notre Dame. The great majority of passing attacks, however, consisted solely of short pitches and shovel passes to stationary receivers. Additionally, few of the major eastern teams that constituted the power center of college football at the time used the pass. In the summer of 1913, while he was a lifeguard on the beach at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, Rockne and his college teammate and roommate Gus Dorais worked on passing techniques. These were employed in games by the 1913 Notre Dame squad and subsequent Harper- and Rockne-coached teams and included many features common in modern passing, including having the passer throw the ball overhand and having the receiver run under a football and catch the ball in stride. That fall, Notre Dame upset heavily favored Army, 35-13, at West Point thanks to a barrage of Dorais-to-Rockne long downfield passes. The game played an important role in displaying the potency of the forward pass and &quot; open offense &quot; and convinced many coaches to add pass plays to their play books. The game is dramatized in the movie The Long Gray Line. [ Memorials and tributes ] { Voss, Norway } Notre Dame memorializes him in the Knute Rockne Memorial Building, an athletic facility built in 1937, as well as the main football stadium. Sherry C. M.
