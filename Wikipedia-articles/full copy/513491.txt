Its council is based at Bedford, which is also the county town of Bedfordshire. The borough contains one large urban area, the 71st largest in the United Kingdom that comprises Bedford and the adjacent town of Kempston, surrounded by a rural area with many villages. 75% of the borough&apos;s population live in the Bedford Urban Area and the five large villages which surround it, which makes up slightly less than 6% of the total land area of the Borough. The borough is also the location of the Wixams new town development, which received its first residents in 2009. Unlike most English districts, Bedford&apos;s council is led by a directly elected mayor of Bedford, who has been Dave Hodgson since October 16, 2009. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/8311065.stm BBC News Lib Dem win in mayoral election 2009-10-16 ] The District of Bedford was formed on 1 April 1974 as a merger of the existing borough of Bedford, along with Kempston urban district and Bedford Rural District. In 1975 the district was granted a royal charter granting borough status as North Bedfordshire. The borough was renamed as Borough of Bedford in 1992. Over half of the former municipal borough of Bedford is unparished, however Brickhill is a parish, and Queens Park as well as Cauldwell &amp; Kingsbrook elect their own urban community councils who have similar functions to parish councils. The rest of the district including Kempston is parished. The Department for Communities and Local Government have reorganised Bedfordshire&apos;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, meaning that Bedford Borough Council became a unitary authority in April 2009. This means Bedford Borough has assumed responsibility in areas such as education, social services and transport which were previously provided by Bedfordshire County Council. { Unitary solution confirmed for Bedfordshire - New flagship unitary councils approved for Cheshire - Corporate - Communities and Local Government } { County council to be abolished in shake-up - Bedford Today } { http://www.bedford.gov.uk/unitary/ } [ Council and cabinet ] [ Bedford local elections ] The first elections for the new unitary Bedford Borough Council were held on 4 June 2009 when 36 councillors in addition to the mayor were elected.
