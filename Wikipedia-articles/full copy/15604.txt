There have been six other authors who wrote authorised Bond novels or novelizations after Fleming&apos;s death in 1964: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver; a new novel, written by William Boyd, is planned for release in 2013.

The fictional British Secret Service agent has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip and video game formats as well as being used in the longest running and the second-highest grossing film franchise to date, which started in 1962 with &apos;&apos;Dr. No&apos;&apos;, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of, there have been twenty two films in the Eon Productions series, with a twenty third, Skyfall, due for release on 26 October 2012. The film will star Daniel Craig in his third portrayal of Bond: he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films, &apos;&apos;Casino Royale&apos;&apos;, a 1967 spoof, and Never Say Never Again, a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, &apos;&apos;Thunderball&apos;&apos;. The films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs to the films having picked up Academy Award nominations on several occasions. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond&apos;s cars, his guns and the gadgets he is supplied with by Q Branch. [ Publication history ] [ Creation and inspiration ] [ James Bond (character) Inspirations for James Bond ] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Name Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond&apos;s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist’s wife that &quot; It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born &quot;. [ Caplen 2010 21 ] He further explained that: [ When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument...when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, (James Bond) is the dullest name I ever heard. Ian Fleming ] On another occasion Fleming said: &quot; I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, &quot; James Bond &quot; was much better than something more interesting, like &quot; Peregrine Carruthers &quot;. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department. &quot; [ Chancellor 2005 112 ] Inspiration Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond &quot; was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war &quot;. Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. [ Obituary: Colonel Peter Fleming, Author and explorer The Times 20 August 1971 14 ] Aside from Fleming&apos;s brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond&apos;s make up, including Conrad O&apos;Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill &quot; Biffy &quot; Dunderdale. { Hoagy Carmichael —Fleming&apos;s view of James Bond. } Tastes Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. [ Macintyre 2008 50 ] Bond&apos;s tastes are also often taken from Fleming’s own as was his behaviour, [ Cook William Novel man New Statesman 28 June 2004 40 ] with Bond&apos;s love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming&apos;s own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books. Looks Fleming decided Bond should look a little like both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself [ Macintyre 2008 67 ] and in &apos;&apos;Casino Royale&apos;&apos;, Vesper Lynd remarks, &quot; Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless. &quot; Likewise, in &apos;&apos;Moonraker&apos;&apos;, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is &quot; certainly good-looking… Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold. &quot; [ Macintyre 2008 67 ] Background It was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of &apos;&apos;Dr. No&apos;&apos; in cinemas and Sean Connery &apos;s depiction of Bond affected Fleming&apos;s interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. [ Macintyre 2008 205 ] In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond&apos;s parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from Yverdon, Switzerland. [ Chancellor 2005 58 ] Fleming did not provide Bond&apos;s date of birth, but John Pearson &apos;s fictional biography of Bond, James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007, gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, [ Pearson 2008 21 ] while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.

[ Chancellor 2005 5 ] He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials. [ Bennett Woollacott 2003 1 ch 1 ] After completing the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming&apos;s older brother Peter, an established travel writer. [ Chancellor 2005 5 ] Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously.
