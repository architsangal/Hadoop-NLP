[ mdy 2 ] Joliet ( [ ˈ dʒ oʊ l i. ɛ t ] or [ dʒ oʊ l i ˈ ɛ t ] ) is a city in Will and Kendall Counties [ http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm%3Dy%26amp%3B-geo_id%3D04000US17%26amp%3B-_box_head_nbr%3DGCT-PH1%26amp%3B-ds_name%3DDEC_2000_SF1_U%26amp%3B-_lang%3Den%26amp%3B-format%3DST-7%26amp%3B-_sse%3Don Illinois by Place 2000 Census 2000 Summary File 1 United States Census Bureau 2 March 2010 ] in the U.S. state of Illinois, located [ 40 mi km ] southwest of Chicago. It is the county seat of Will County. [ mdy 6 ] As of the 2010 census, the city was the fourth-most populated in Illinois, with a population of 147,433. It continues to be Illinois&apos; fastest growing city and one of the fastest growing in the United States. When Joliet was first planned in the early 1830s, it was still in Cook County. In 1836, it became the county seat of the new Will County. [ Grossman, James R.; Keating, Ann Durkin; Reiff, Janice L. Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago 2005 2004 Online 676 Chicago Historical Society, Newberry Library Chicago 0-226-31015-9 http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/ 60342627 ] [ History ] Joliet Veteran&apos;s Memorial Bicentennial Park In 1833, following the Black Hawk War, Charles Reed built a cabin along the west side of the Des Plaines River. Across the river in 1834, James B. Campbell, treasurer of the canal commissioners, laid out the village of &quot; Juliet &quot;, a name local settlers had been using before his arrival. The origin of the name was most likely a corruption of the name of French Canadian explorer Louis Jolliet, who in 1673, along with Father Jacques Marquette, paddled up the Des Plaines River and camped on a huge mound, a few miles south of present-day Joliet. Maps from Jolliet&apos;s exploration of the area, placed a large hill or mound on what is now the southwest corner of the city. That hill was named Mound Jolliet and was made up entirely of clay. The spot was mined by early settlers and is now a depression. Just before the depression of 1837, Juliet incorporated as a village, but to cut tax expenses, Juliet residents soon petitioned the state to rescind that incorporation. In 1845, local residents changed the community&apos;s name from &quot; Juliet &quot; to &quot; Joliet &quot;. Joliet was reincorporated as a city in 1852. [ Geography ] Joliet is located at [ 41 31 21 N 88 08 26 W inline ] (41.5224597, -88.1406140). [ 2395477 City of Joliet ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 38.35 sqmi on ], of which, [ 38.06 sqmi on ] of it is land and [ 0.29 sqmi on ] of it (0.76%) is water. [ mdy 2 ] It has a sprawling, irregular shape that extends into nine different townships, more than any other Illinois city. They are: Joliet, Plainfield, Troy, New Lenox, Jackson, Channahon, and Lockport in Will County, and Na-Au-Say and Seward in Kendall County. Joliet is a Des Plaines River town, with the downtown located in the river valley. This is especially evident on Interstate 80 if one is coming from the east or the west where it has been flat for many miles and suddenly the land drops as you approach the river. This offers a great view looking north to see downtown Joliet. For most of its existence Joliet geographically has had its &quot; west side &quot; and &quot; east side &quot;, referring to areas to the west or the east of the Des Plaines River, which runs through the city. Both sides were roughly proportionate throughout most of its history until the 2nd half of the 20th century when westward expansion began. Many businesses moved from the downtown area to the expanding areas west of the river. Many stores relocated to the west side in new strip malls and shopping centers with more parking and easier access. This began the decline of the downtown shopping district which is still felt today. Today Joliet has a &quot; west side &quot; and a far &quot; west side &quot; (which includes all city limits in Kendall County ). This has given rise to a newly referenced &quot; Central Joliet &quot; portion of the City which essentially is all land west of the Des Plaines River and east of Interstate 55. This new reference may soon change the current meaning of &quot; west side &quot; to west of Interstate 55. [ September 2009 ] [ Waterways ] While the heart and history of Joliet is centered around the Des Plaines River Joliet actually expands across both the Des Plaines River and the DuPage River. There are several other waterways that traverse through the city limits including Hickory Creek, Spring Creek, the historic Illinois and Michigan Canal, Jackson Creek, and Aux Sable Creek. Some small lakes and bodies of water include Chase Lake, Lake Juco, Michigan Beach, the Brandon Road Quarry, and Leisure Lake. [ Demographics ] As of July 1, 2008, Joliet was the 159th most populous city in the United States.

Joliet&apos;s proximity to the Chicago metropolitan area has provided some relief; the city is increasingly evolving from its status as a steel-town to an exurb. Still, most new migrants to the area are moving to Joliet to live, choosing to work in bordering Cook and DuPage counties, and the downtown area, once downtrodden, is undergoing a total revitalization. The main attractions in Joliet&apos;s City Center are the Harrah&apos;s Casino and Hotel, Joliet Slammers baseball ( Silver Cross Field ), Hollywood Casino (formerly, Empress Casino) and the Rialto Square Theatre, the &apos;Jewel of Joliet&apos;, which has been called one of the world&apos;s 10 most beautiful theaters. The 1999 film Stir of Echoes starring Kevin Bacon had scenes shot on location in Joliet at the Rialto Square Theatre (the hypnotism scenes in which Bacon saw the word &quot; Dig &quot; on the movie screen), at the corner of Scott Street and Jefferson, and at the old Menards that took over the Wieboltd&apos;s building at Jefferson Square Mall. The lobby of the Rialto Square Theatre also served the filming of John Goodman&apos;s &quot; The Babe &quot;.

The famous Joliet Prison is located near Joliet&apos;s downtown district on Collins Street. The prison has been featured in both television shows and movies. One such television series filmed at Joliet Prison was Prison Break. The Prison was also used for the opening scenes in the popular 1980 movie, The Blues Brothers, which starred John Belushi as &quot; Joliet &quot; Jake Blues and Dan Aykroyd as &quot; Elwood &quot; Blues. The first Dairy Queen store opened in Joliet.

There are two casino s which originated as riverboat casino in Joliet: the Hollywood Casino near Channahon and a Harrah&apos;s hotel and casino downtown. Joliet is the only city in the State of Illinois to have two casinos. The Westfield Louis Joliet mall is located at the intersection of I-55 and U.S. Route 30. The Auditorium Building is located at the northeast corner of Chicago and Clinton streets. Designed by G. Julian Barnes and built of limestone in 1891, it was controversial as one of the first buildings to combine religious, civic and commercial uses. The Jacob A. Henry Mansion, 20 South Eastern Avenue is a three-story, red brick, Second Empire/Italian Renaissance style structure built on a Joliet limestone foundation in 1873(completed in 1876).The structure is set on bedrock and the entire basement floor is made of Joliet limestone from the building owner’s quarry. The walls of the structure are constructed of red Illinois sandstone and deep red brick specially fired in Ohio (wrapped individually and shipped by barge to Joliet). A commanding three-story tower is the focal point of the structure. The structure has steel trim with slate shingles on a Mansard roof. The front and side porches are single slabs of limestone. The largest stone ever quarried [ October 2010 ] lies in the sidewalk under the front entry gate. The stone is 9’ X 22’ X 20” thick. In 1885, an immense Byzantine dome was added to the south façade.

[ Sports ] { Joliet Central High School campus, Jefferson St. Exit } One of Joliet&apos;s nicknames is the &quot; City of Champions &quot;.
