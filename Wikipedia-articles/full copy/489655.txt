The submarine was ordered on 22 March 1983. She was laid down by Vickers Shipbuilding on 28 October 1985, and was launched on 3 November 1986 in the presence of Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Hezlet, who had commanded the World War II T-class submarine &apos;&apos;Trenchant&apos;&apos;. { http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Trafalgar-Class/HMS-Trenchant } She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 14 January 1989. { Jane&apos;s Fighting Ships, 2004-2005.

At the time the submarine was conducting a &apos;Perisher&apos; Submarine Command Course exercise in company with the frigate HMS &apos;&apos;Charybdis&apos;&apos;. Antares was pulled under with the loss of all four members of the crew. { Marine Accident Investigation Branch report } { Kintyre } [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/submarine-crew-blamed-for-sinking-of-antares-1532324.html London The Independent James Cusick 10 July 1992 ] In July 1997, the submarine ran aground off the western coast of Australia.

Trenchant was able to free herself, and an inspection by divers reported no significant damage. Trenchant tested the non-hull-penetrating optronic mast in 1998. She also trialled a camouflage paint scheme comprising jagged shapes of various colours, including pale blue. [ April 2011 ] [ 2000-present day ] On 21 June 2007, the submarine became the first Royal Navy vessel to fire the new Block IV Tomahawk cruise missile in a live-firing trial in the Gulf of Mexico off the United States coast. { http://www.hmforces.co.uk/education/articles/1445-hms-trenchant---trafalgar-class } In late 2009, Trenchant entered the Devonport submarine refit complex to undertake a 2 year refit and upgrade programme. Upon completion of the programme, the submarine underwent a rededication service on 6 June 2011 to welcome the boat back to active service. { http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1229-trenchant-ready-to-be-a-potent-presence-again.aspx } [ Affliations ] Trenchant is affiliated with the following military and civilian organisations, bodies &amp; individuals: Sea Cadet unit TS St Davidâ€™s Sea Cadet unit TS Echo (Llanelli) Town of Llanelli Lady Meriel Hunt (sponsor) [ References ] Notes [ Note ] References Bibliography Submarines, War Beneath The Waves, From 1776 To The Present Day, by Robert Hutchinson [ External links ] Royal Navy official site HMS Trenchant S91 pages at MaritimeQuest MOD News tomahawk launch [ April 2011 ] Category:Trafalgar class submarines Category:Barrow-built ships Category:1986 ships Category:Cold War submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Active submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Fatal accident inquiries fr:HMS Trenchant (S91) fi:HMS Trenchant (S91)
