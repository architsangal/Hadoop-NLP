The population was 564 at the 2000 census. [ History ] The name of the precinct has gone through three changes. In 1868 it was officially &quot; Robard&apos;s Station &quot;. In 1880 it became &quot; Robard &quot; and in 1924, the final change made it &quot; Robards. &quot; Robards is pronounced Roberts. The early settlers of the area were: Reuben Moss, George Robards, George Eakins, Bennett Sandefur, Jordan Moss, Enoch Spencer, Thomas Reidout, Ben Wall, Nathan Smith, T. W. Royster, James McMullin, Samuel McMullin, Sr. As far back as 1810 and through 1840, and even later, before Robards became a community, its site attracted daring horsemen who raced their steeds there on a race track, which was a straight half mile section of road, congregating to bet, test the speed of their horses, drink liquor and otherwise indulge their depraved and uncultured appetites. George Rudy&apos;s school house was built before 1840 and between the years of 1840 and 1848, the school had four teachers: Washington Sale, Dave Cowan, Frank Davis, and Joseph C. Norman. The Methodists built a church near the school and in 1853 it was dedicated as &quot; McMullin&apos;s Chapel. &quot; Although, the town of Robards did not officially exist, in the 1860s, two of the chief battles of the Civil War in this county took place at Robards. J.D. Robards for whom Robards was named after, built the first house in 1867. This was a frame store house which was also used as a dry goods, grocery and general merchandise store. In this store he carried on a business totaling from $25,000 to $40,000 per year. In addition to the store, he owned and operated a tobacco stemmery. The tobacco stemmery employed 50 men and shipped directly to Europe. In the twenty years, after the Civil War, Robards doubled in population. The average price of land in the 1800s was $20–$25 per acre. While tobacco, corn and wheat were the chief cash crops, a number of farmers were engaged in cattle raising. In 1880, Robards supported: John W. Arnett and J.L. Burdon as physicians and surgeons. S.W. Spencer serving as manager of the Robard&apos;s Station Co-operative Grange Store. F.M. Eakins served as the druggist and also, was Express agent on the Henderson Branch of the L &amp; N Railroad. Jasper Robards and John F. Schanebach accommodated the blacksmith ing needs of the community. John W. Royster, Jr. was a buyer and dealer in leaf tobacco. J.D. Robards ran the dry goods store. J.T. Williams was the carpenter. R.S. Triplett was also a merchant in the area. A.B. Sugg supplied the areas stock needs. Mosco Cox was the local teacher. Population of 100 and daily mail delivery. There was one ample frame building used for the District Common School and for religious services. The Christian denomination had the only established church, with S.W. Cowan serving as pastor, in the 1880s. Three coal mines were opened during the 1880s and continued into the 1920s. In 1887, Starling reported that Robards had nine stores, a steam mill, a school building, a church with a seating capacity of 400, a large livery stable and a good hotel. Lucy Furman, a fiction writer, told events of Robards Station as they related to the religious sect that flourished during the late 19th century. Her book, &quot; Stories of a Sanctified town &quot;, was so true to life that the residents of Robards recognized her characters in spite of changed names and combination of locales. Present day when traveling Highway U.S. 41 South, you will see the road sign calling &quot; Robards the Sanctified Town &quot;.
