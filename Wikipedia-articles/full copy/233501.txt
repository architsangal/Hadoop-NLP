Another autonym of this people is &quot; Našinci &quot;, { Xhelal Ylli, Erlangen: &quot; Sprache und Identität bei den Gorani in Albanien: &apos;Nie sme nasinci&apos;. } which literally means &quot; our people &quot;. Gorani speak the Gora dialect, which belongs to the Torlak group of South Slavic languages. The Gora region comprises Dragaš municipality in Kosovo and Shishtavec village in Albania. They are adherents to Islam and have a rich and varied folk culture. They have been claimed by Albanians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Macedonians and Serbs but the general view is that they should be treated as a distinct minority group, which is indeed their own view of themselves. { Kosovo: the Bradt travel guide, Gail Warrander, Verena Knaus, Published by Bradt Travel Guides, 2007, ISBN 1-84162-199-4, p. 211. } { Historical dictionary of Kosova, Robert Elsie, Scarecrow Press, 2004, ISBN 0-8108-5309-4, p. 70. } Part of these people are already albanised. { Bulgarians in the region of Korcha and Mala Prespa (Albania) nowadays, Balkanistic Forum (1-3/2005), South-West University &quot; Neofit Rilski &quot;, Blagoevgrad, Pashova, Anastasija Nikolaeva; Issue: 1-3/2005, Page Range: 113-130. } By the last censuses at the end of 20th century in Yugoslavia they have declared themselves to be Muslims by nationality. { Religion and the politics of identity in Kosovo by Gerlachlus Duijzings, C.

The area was populated by Slavs during their migration in the 6th–7th centuries. Тhe region is mentioned in 1348 in the edict of Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan, along with seven other Gorani-populated villages that were subsumed by the Monastery of Saint Archangel at Prizren at that time. In 1455, Gora was conquered from the Serbian Despotate by the Ottoman Turks and became a part of the beylerbeylik of Rumelia, or specifically, the Sanjak of Prizren. The process of natural assimilation into Ottoman society henceforth began, after the end of the 16th century. The Ottoman defter from 1591 registers Gora as inhabited exclusively by Serbs while Opolje to the north is Albanian populated. { TKGM, TD № 55 (412), ( } { Defter sandžaka } { Prizren iz 1591. godine). } The Ottoman abolishment of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1766 is thought to have prompted the Islamization of Gora as was the trend of many Balkan communities. { http://books.google.se/books?id=aJRYkzl5YC4C } The Gorani continue to maintain a religious hybridity of sorts  — while steadfast Muslims, they observe a number of Orthodox Christian traditions and holidays, with observance of certain Saint &apos;s days and their acknowledging of the Bogomil. Because of Gora&apos;s highly isolated location in and around Albania&apos;s mountainous northern region, the difficult terrain aided the Gorani in resisting first the Slavic and later the Ottoman invasions. Migrations to escape the Ottoman invasion did occur, as they did in Albania in the 14th century, when many Gorani from Albania fled to Italy, Egypt, Syria and the Ukraine, they were later absorbed into the Albanian populations of Italy, losing their own language in the process. These migrations were repeated several centuries thenceforth when many Gorani, hemmed in by both Yugoslav and Albanian authoritarian regimes, fled the region. Many surfaced in America, where a significant diaspora has emerged (primarily in California). Migrations from Gora during the Ottoman era resulted in two significant waves: the first towards Prizren and Sirinić, and the other towards Tetovo. The latter populated the Macedonian settlements of Dolno, Palčište and Tearce. Their descendants still populate that part of the Republic of Macedonia. Gorani colonists have migrated and populated the colonies of Urvič and Jelovjane on the eastern side of the Šar Mountains. In the First Balkan War in 1912 the Serbian Army seized Gora. A minor part of the Gorani population migrated to Turkey as a result. In the 1916–1918 First World War the Gora was conquered by the Central Powers and assigned to the Bulgarian (until May 1916) { България в Първата световна война, Германски дипломатически документи, т. ІІ, 1916-1918 г., София 2005, с. 70-71, Avramovski, Živko, Ratni ciljevi Bugarske i Centralne sile 1914-1918, Beograd 1985, s. 243-244. } and to the Austro-Hungarian (until October 1918) zone. After 1918 they were integrated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The troubles during First World War, as well as the difficult period between 1919-20 were characterized by drought, causing famine and much poverty for the Gorani. [ June 2009 ] This paradigm also incited migrations to larger cities of Prizren and Tetovo. Disease and hunger in the post-communist era in Albania have caused a general downfall of the Gorani population, mostly due to in-migration out of villages for urban centers like Shkodra and Tirana. By the decision of the League of Nations however, in 1925, the final border towards Albania was established. In it, over 15,000 Gorani remained in Albania&apos;s borders in their 9 villages: Borje, Zapod, kosharisht, novosoj, Orgjost, Oreshke, pakisht, cernaleve and shishtavec on demand of Fascist Italy, despite the local Gorani community&apos;s desire to remain together undivided. In the 1939 census of Yugoslavia, the Gora Gorani were in the category of &quot; non-Slavs &quot; shared by Albanians and Turks. Since the World War I and Albanian dominance, the Gorani underwent a major cultural change, attested by the Albanian loan words and changing of names into the Albanian language (e.g. Hasanović - Hasani). In the 1971-1981 censuses, the majority of Gorani declared themselves as &quot; Muslims by nationality &quot; a classification by time transformed into Bosniak. In 1999 after the NATO bombing campaign on Yugoslavia, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) took over international administration of the Serbian province of Kosovo. Their own municipality was redrawn and Dragash established, in which now Albanians are in majority. In 2007 the Kosovar provisional institutions opened a school in Gora to teach the Bosnian language, which sparked minor consternation amongst the Gorani population, added by the fact that the Principal declares as an Albanian. Many Gorani refuse to send their children to school for threats of assimilation and self-initially founded home schools for their young. In 1999 and over the years altogether, over 6,500 Gorani have fled to Serbia proper along with many Serb and Romani refugees. [ October 2011 ] They are also known among the neighbouring Albanians with several exonym s as &quot; Bulgareci &quot;, i.e. Bulgarians, { Albania: from anarchy to a Balkan identity, Miranda Vickers, James Pettifer, C.

The Torlakian dialect is a transitional dialect of Bulgarian and Serbian whilst also sharing features with Macedonian. While still remaining a Slavic based language it has numerous loan words, the Gora dialect has been greatly influenced by Turkish, Albanian and Arabic due to its speakers being Muslims and is similar to the Bosnian language because of the numerous Turkish loanwords. Goranian has also been classified sometimes as part of the Bulgarian dialect area, as by Bulgarian, { Младенов, Стефан.

According to the last 1991 Yugoslav census, 54.8% of the inhabitants of the Gora municipality said that they spoke the Gorani language, while the remainder had called it Serbian. { Gorani speech by dr. Radivoje Mladenovic } Some Gorani scholars define their language as Bulgarian, similar to the Bulgarian dialects spoken in Northwest Macedonia. { Dokle, Nazif.

Goranian (Nashinski) - Albanian Dictionary, Sofia 2007, Published by Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, p. 5, 11, 19) } Some linguists, including Vidoeski, Brozovic and Ivic, identify the Slavic-dialect of the Gora region as Macedonian. { http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3 Macedonian by Victor Friedman, pg 4 (footnote) } There are assertions that Macedonian is spoken in 50 to 75 villages in the Gora region (Albania and Kosovo). { http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3 Macedonian by Victor Friedman, pg 6 } According to some unverified sources in 2003 the Kosovo government acquired Macedonian language and grammar books for Gorani school. { Focus News (4th of July, 2003) Kosovo Government Acquires Macedonian language and grammar books for Gorani Minority Schools } [ Example ] The following is a traditional Gorani song: &apos;&apos;Verno libe &apos;&apos;Gledaj me gledaj libe, abe verno libe, &apos;&apos;nagledaj mi se dur ti som ovde. &apos;&apos;Utre ke odim abe verno libe dalek-dalek &apos;&apos;na pusti Gurbet. &apos;&apos;Racaj poracaj libe šo da ti kupim. &apos;&apos;Ti da mi kupiš &apos;&apos;abe gledaniku cerna šamija, ja da ga nosim &apos;&apos;abe gledaniku i da ga želam. &apos;&apos;Racaj poracaj abe verno &apos;&apos;libe šo da ti pratim &apos;&apos;Ti da mi pratiš abe &apos;&apos;gledaniku šarena knjiga &apos;&apos;Ja da ga pujem abe &apos;&apos;gledaniku i da ga želam [ Media and literature ] Gorani scholar Nazif Dokle compiled the first Gorani– Albanian dictionary (with 43,000 words and phrases) in 2007, sponsored and printed by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 2008 the first issue of a Macedonian language newspaper, Гороцвет (Gorocvet) was published. [ Population ] The Gorani population numbered some 16,000, in the Gora administrative division, according to the 1991 census. Of these, 50% declared themselves Muslims by nationality, 30% Serbs and 20% Albanians. Gorani leaders today estimate that fewer than 10,000 are left in Gora, after large migrations to Albania&apos;s capital, Tirana. Most Gorani state that the unstable situation and the economic issue drives them to leave Kosovo. There is also some mention of threats and discrimination by the ethnic Albanians. [ Update on the Kosovo Roma, Ashkaelia, Egyptian, Serb, Bosniak, Gorani and Albanian communities in a minority situation ] {, } { UNHCR Kosovo, June 2004 } The UN administration in Kosovo, UNMIK, has redrawn internal boundaries in the province in such a way that a Gorani-majority municipality no longer exists. The Gora was combined with the neighboring Albanian-populated region of Opolje (some 20,000 people) into a new subdivision named Dragaš, which again has an Albanian majority. { Gora municipality in } { Kosovo, marked in blue. } [ Settlements ] Below is a list of the traditional Gorani settlements in the Shar Mountains region. { http://mlicanin.weebly.com/short-history-english.html } Kosovo Bllacë Brod Dikance Donja Rapča Donji Krstac Dragash Globočica Gornja Rapča Gornji Krstac Orqushë Kukaljane Leštane Ljubovište Mlike Radeša Restelicë Vranishtë Zli Potok Albania Borje Cernalevë Kosharisht Novosoj Orćiklje Orgjost Oreshkë Pakisht Shishtavec Zapod Macedonia Jelovjane Urvič [ Gorani diaspora ] [ August 2011 ] The Gora is an underdeveloped region and for almost two centuries, its male inhabitants would go off to more distant regions in order to find work. Due to this, a true Gorani diaspora has come to life with many living in parts of Central Serbia (particularly Belgrade : 3,340), Vojvodina (606), Albania (primarily in Durres ), the Republic of Macedonia (particularly the Western parts); Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Greece, Turkey; and following escape from communist Albania and socialist Yugoslavia in the late-1940s, the United States of America (particularly New York and Los Angeles ) and the United Kingdom (particularly Haringey, London ). [ Culture and religion ] The Slavs of Gora were Christianized in 870 following the Byzantine Empire&apos;s baptism of the Serbs and Bulgarians. The Ottomans conquered the region in the 14th century, which started the process of Islamization of the Gorani and neighbouring Albanians. However, the Gorani still tangentially observe some Orthodox Christian traditions, such as Slava s and Saint George&apos;s Day ( Djurdjevdan ). Traditional Gorani folk music includes a two-beat dance called &quot; Kolo &quot; (&apos;circle&apos;), which is a circle dance focused on the foot movements: it always starts on the right foot and moves in an anti-clockwise direction. Kolo is usually accompanied by instrumental music made often with a Curlje or Kaval and Tapan, kolos are less frequently accompanied by singing as they are in neighboring ethnic groups such as the Albanians and Serbs. The cifteli it is Albanian but the goran people can play as well, also the added to their culture. The &quot; national &quot; sport of oil wrestling called &quot; Pelivan &quot; is popular amongst Gorani with regular tournaments being held in the outdoors to the accompaniment of Curlje and Tapan with associated rituals, with origins in the Middle East through the Ottoman Empire &apos;s conquest of Balkans. The &quot; national &quot; drink of the Gorani is Rakija which is commonly distilled at home by elderly people. Another popular drink is Turkish Coffee which is drunk in small cups accompanied by a glass of water. Future divination is popular amongst all Gorani using the residue of Turkish Coffee. { Miralem Sulejmani, Serbian footballer in } { Ajax } [ Famous Gorani people ] Fahrudin Jusufi, football player Miralem Sulejmani, football player [ See also ] Torlaks Civic Initiative of Gora (political party) Pomaks [ Notes and references ] Notes: [ status ] a.     References: [ Determination and Doubling in Balkan Borderlands http://mahimahi.uchicago.edu/media/faculty/vfriedm/220Friedman09.pdf Friedman Victor Harvard Ukrainian Studies 1-4 2006 105–116 ] Нексхат Ибрахими, Първи контакти на исляма с Балканските нации Хюсеин Мехмед.
