As a wholly owned division of Wal-Mart, Asda is not required to declare quarterly or half-yearly earnings. It submits full accounts to Companies House each October. [ History ] { Leeds } { West Bridgford, Nottingham } { Bury St Edmunds } Asda Stores Limited was founded as Associated Dairies &amp; Farm Stores Limited in 1949 in Leeds. The adoption of the Asda name occurred in 1965 with the merger of the Asquith chain of three supermarkets and Associated Dairies; Asda is an abbreviation of Asquith and Dairies, often capitalised.

Other companies in the group were Associated Dairies Limited, the furniture retailer MFI and Allied Carpets. After the sale of MFI and Allied Carpets the company name changed to Asda Group plc. The dairy division was sold in a management buyout and renamed Associated Fresh Foods, { Cinven – Case studies } meaning that Asda has since had no connection with one of the firms its name was derived from. With stores mainly based in the North of England, the newly focused food retail group expanded further south in 1989 by buying the large format stores of rival Gateway Superstores for £705  million. This move overstretched the company and it found itself in trouble trying to sell too many different products.

It revived under the leadership of Archie Norman, who later became a front bench Conservative MP. CEO from 1991, Norman was chairman of the company during the period 1996–99, and replicated the store on the basis of United States retail giant Wal-Mart, even sending protégé Allan Leighton to Bentonville, Arkansas to assess and photograph the systems and marketing which Wal-Mart had deployed.

The Spice Girls earned £1  million for this sponsorship deal. When Norman left the company to pursue his political career, he was replaced by Leighton. Wal-Mart wanted to enter the UK market so CEO Bob Martin lobbied British Prime Minister Tony Blair on planning issues.

After the takeover Asda continued to maintain its headquarters at the then newly opened &quot; Asda House &quot;. This building was one of the first of the new large office blocks to open as part of the redevelopment of the huge area south of the River Aire in Leeds city centre, in the Holbeck district, West Yorkshire. In 2005, amid reported concerns within Wal-Mart about a slippage in market share, partially due to a resurgent Sainsbury&apos;s, Asda&apos;s chief executive, Tony De Nunzio left, and was replaced by Andy Bond.

The pocket tap ads were launched in 1977 and over the next 30 years a range of celebrities have been &quot; tappers &quot;, including Julie Walters, Michael Owen, sitcom actor Leonard Rossiter and Carry On actress Hattie Jacques.

In 2004, Sharon Osbourne was selected to be part of a new marketing campaign by Asda; her last advert was aired in August 2005. From 1990 to 1992, they were the sponsors of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. during arguably their two most successful seasons in modern times – when they won promotion from the Football League Second Division as Football League Cup winners and finished third in the Football League First Division ( last season before the creation of the FA Premier League ). In the smiley face &quot; rollback &quot; campaign, also used in Wal-Mart advertisements, a CGI smiley face bounced from price tag to price tag, knocking them down as customers watch. The focus of these campaigns is to portray Asda as the most affordable supermarket in the country, a claim that was challenged by competitors, especially Aldi. In 2006, Asda advertising was themed around singing children and the slogan &quot; More for you for less &quot;, and the previous tap of the trouser pocket advertising was reduced to a double-tap on a stylised &apos;A&apos;, still producing the &apos;chinking&apos; sound. This included an advert during the 2006 FIFA World Cup featuring the England football player Michael Owen in an advert with the children singing Vindaloo. In 2007, the advertising campaign abandoned the rollback hook in favour of featuring celebrities including Victoria Wood and Paul Whitehouse working as Asda employees. For Christmas 2007, Asda reintroduced the &quot; That&apos;s Asda price &quot; slogan [ http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename%3DTA5261%26amp%3Badvertiser%3DAsda Asda &apos;Something Big&apos; TV ad – 20 sec advert www.tellyads.com 9 October 2008 ] as well as the famous &apos; jingle &apos; to some of its adverts, this can also be heard on its in-store radio station &apos; Asda FM &apos;. Starting in 2008, Asda has been returning to its roots and is now re-focusing on price with its new &quot; Why Pay More? &quot; campaign both on TV and in stores. Current Asda TV commercials in April 2009 focus on price comparisons between Asda and its rivals, using information from &quot; MySupermarket &quot; to suggest that Asda is Britain&apos;s most affordable supermarket.

In August 2005, rival supermarket chain Tesco challenged Asda&apos;s ability to use the claim that it was the cheapest supermarket in the country, by complaining to the Advertising Standards Agency. The A.S.A upheld the complaint { &quot; Asda made to drop low price claim &quot;, BBC, 17 August 2005. } and ordered Asda to stop using it, citing that The Grocer magazine survey was based on limited and unrepresentative evidence as it examined the price of just 33 products, and that the survey did not study low-cost supermarkets such as Aldi, and that their price checker, My Supermarket, doesn&apos;t include Morrisons, which was mentioned a few times. As a result Asda no longer cites itself as &quot; Officially Britain&apos;s lowest priced supermarket &quot;, instead using &quot; Winner: Britain&apos;s lowest price supermarket award &quot;. Throughout the year, Asda has asked pricing strategics company Skuuudle to assist them in their campaign against rivals Argos for the Christmas season to produce price listings so shoppers can see transparent pricing on children&apos;s toys on the key Christmas lines, helping people save money though out the season.

Implementing this initiative is difficult, however, because the concept of a living wage varies between countries and the buying strategies of a major importer like Asda have an indirect impact on national minimum wages by obliging governments to set them low enough to stop businesses from going elsewhere.

Call for boycott In October 2010, Chairman Andy Bond was a signatory to a controversial letter to The Daily Telegraph { &quot; Osborne’s cuts will strengthen Britain’s economy by allowing the private sector to generate more jobs &quot;, The Daily Telegraph, 18 October 2010 } which claimed that &quot; The private sector should be more than capable of generating additional jobs to replace those lost in the public sector, and the redeployment of people to more productive activities will improve economic performance, so generating more employment opportunities. &quot; This prompted calls for a boycott of Asda, as well as the companies represented by the other signatories to the letter on the grounds that &quot; Companies that support the CSR [Comprehensive Spending Review] are failed corporate citizens. &quot;. { &quot; Why I’m boycotting the 35 businesses who support the cuts &quot;, Kate Belgrave, Liberal Conspiracy, 24 October 2010 } [ Asda Smart Price ] Asda&apos;s Smart Price logo Asda Smart Price is a no-frills private label trade name. The equivalents from the three other big supermarkets are Tesco Everyday Value { Tesco rebrands Value range }, Sainsbury&apos;s Basics and Morrisons M Savers. The Smart Price brand can trace its origins to Asda&apos;s Farm Stores brand launched in the mid 1990s, which consisted of products that were offered at a lower price than the equivalent famous name brand product and Asda&apos;s own brand equivalent. The Farm Stores brand originally consisted of a small number of food only products, largely frozen such as frozen chips and a small range of ready meals, this range later expanded to include fresh food. Smart Price products are almost always the lowest price option (known as Our Lowest Price) in a product category in Asda stores. Occasionally this difference is only a few pence, however in others it is a marked difference. For example, a box of Smart Price Biological Washing Powder costs 50  pence while the equivalent Asda brand washing powder costs £1.50 and well known name brand alternatives cost from £2 upwards. The Smart Price label was originally a food only brand, however over the years it has expanded to cover almost every product range in the store, including clothing and furnishings with the George Smart Price brand. Like early generic products in the US some Smart Price products lack what can be thought of as &apos;frills&apos; in the modern brand name or supermarket own brand, for example the Smart Price toothpaste has an old fashioned screw cap rather than the now more common flip cap and the Smart Price range of crisps come in traditional clear plastic bags rather than the foil bags common to most name brand versions. In 2012, Asda changed the Smart Price Label once again to fit in with the remodelling of its product ranges. [ George clothing ] Asda has its own range of clothing known as George which was created in 1990. [ http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/design/article/554301/superbrand-case-studies-george/ Superbrands case studies: George Brand Republic 18 April 2006 30 June 2008 ] This is marketed as quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. Wal-Mart also sells the George brand in Argentina, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the US (and in South Korea until Wal-Mart pulled out of that market). This George label was named after George Davies, the founder of Next, who was its original chief designer. He is no longer associated with the brand, although it has aimed to remain true to the high quality, low price business model that he established. In 2005, Asda stated that the George range was a £1.75  billion business, including sales from Wal-Mart stores in the USA and Germany. Mintel estimate that George is the fourth largest retailer of clothing in the United Kingdom, after Marks &amp; Spencer, the Arcadia Group and Next. { Mintel Clothing Retailing – UK, July 2005 } Asda was the first supermarket to stock wedding dress es. Part of the George line, they cost just £60 while adult bridesmaid dresses ranged between £30 and £35, at launch. { Supermarket unveils £60 wedding dress Telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 6 October 2006. } [ October 2008 ] [ Stores ] [ Current stores ] An Asda Wal-mart Supercentre Asda originally had a &quot; simple and fresh &quot; store format, which under Archie Norman&apos;s team and the focus on a Wal-Mart style strategy became even more emphasised. The stores are generally white and green, with simplistic layout but built on a Wal-Mart larger footprint format – Asda&apos;s average store is almost 20% bigger than its rivals, but stocks 20% fewer lines. However, the preferred large-format stores have brought problems to Asda&apos;s growth beyond its spurts in both the 1990s and immediate post Wal-Mart era. With the UK&apos;s tight planning restrictions, the opportunity to increase retail space via new store builds has been limited. Rather than follow rivals Tesco and Sainsbury&apos;s into &quot; local &quot; format smaller-footprint stores, Asda has chosen to adapt its format to niche store s to retain longer term growth. On 16 April 2010, Asda announced plans to open over 100 new non-food stores as part of an ambitious five-year plan. { Asda takes aim at Tesco with new stores } In February 2011, Asda announced the purchase of 6 stores from Focus DIY, which will be converted into supermarkets subject to approvals and local planning consents. Asda Supercentres Following the takeover by Wal-Mart, several &quot; Asda Wal-Mart Supercentres &quot; have been opened, creating some of the largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom. From around 2008 onwards all new Supercentres have been solely branded as Asda Supercentre without the Wal-Mart branding. The first Supercentre opened in Livingston, Scotland, in June 2000.

Asda Essentials In April 2006, Asda launched a new format called &apos;Asda Essentials&apos; in a former Co-op store in Northampton, followed by another in Pontefract a month later. This was modelled on the French Leaderprice chain, with a smaller floorplate than Asda&apos;s mainstream stores. Essentials focuses primarily on own-brand products, only stocking branded items that are perceived to be at the &quot; core &quot; of a family&apos;s weekly shop. This style of retailing is an attempt to address competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto.
