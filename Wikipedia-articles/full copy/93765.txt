Fields got the idea of an airline from London to the Falkland Islands in June 1982, when the Falklands War had just finished and there was need for a service. { West Sussex County Times, Friday, 20 January 1984 Page 1 } Fields needed expertise and contacted Alan Hellary, Laker Airways&apos; former chief pilot, who had thought about establishing a regular, commercial service to the Falklands at the same time. Hellary was in contact with colleagues out of work following the collapse of Laker Airways and they worked on the idea. However the short runway at Port Stanley Airport and the time to improve it made the scheme unviable, so the idea of the Falklands service was dropped. Instead, Hellary and Fields tried to secure a licence from Gatwick Airport to John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) in New York. A three-day inquiry in May 1983 rejected it after British Airways (BA), British Caledonian and BAA objected. Hellary and Fields then applied for a licence between Gatwick and Newark. It was planned that British Atlantic Airways would use a 380-seat DC-10 to fly to Newark. [ Aircraft Illustrated – Virgin Birth Ian Allan Publishing 48–51 0002-2675 ] However, faced with the prospect of direct competition from People Express, a post- deregulation &quot; no frills &quot; discount airline at Newark, they decided to secure more funding before proceeding. Fields met Richard Branson at a party in Central London during which he proposed a business partnership. After protracted and testy negotiations, Fields agreed to a reduced stake of 25% in the airline (renamed Virgin Atlantic) and became first chairman. Following disagreements over operations, Fields agreed to be bought out for an initial sum of £1  million with further payment on Virgin&apos;s first dividend. As a result of a High Court action, this additional payment was received shortly before Fields&apos; death from cancer in 1997. [ Formative years ] On 22 June 1984, Virgin Atlantic operated its inaugural scheduled service between Gatwick and Newark using a leased Boeing 747-200 (registration G-VIRG), christened Maiden Voyager, formerly operated by Aerolíneas Argentinas. Part of Richard Branson&apos;s approach to business is to succeed within the first year or exit the market. This includes a one-year limit on everything associated with starting up.

The firm timed operations to take advantage of a full summer, which included June to September – the most profitable period of the year. In 1986, the airline added another Boeing 747 and started a scheduled route from Gatwick to Miami. Additional aircraft were acquired and routes launched from Gatwick to New York JFK (1988), Tokyo (1989), Los Angeles (1990), Boston (1991), and Orlando (1992). In 1987, a service was launched between Luton and Dublin using Viscount turboprop aircraft, but this was withdrawn around 1990. In 1988, Club Air operated two Boeing 727 jet aircraft on behalf of Virgin. These served the Luton to Dublin route until ca. 1990 as well.

The London TDRs had come into effect in 1978, originally created to achieve a fairer distribution of traffic between Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK&apos;s two main international airports, to help Gatwick make a profit. The former rules stated airlines without an international scheduled service from Heathrow prior to 1 April 1977 would not be permitted operations there; instead they would have to use Gatwick. However, a irlines that did not already operate at Heathrow were still able to commence domestic scheduled services there provided BAA, which ran both Heathrow and Gatwick on behalf of the Government, and the Secretary of State for Transport, granted permission. The decision to open Heathrow to all newcomers in 1991 – other than those governed by Bermuda II – angered BA&apos;s chairman Lord King, who stopped British Airways&apos; donations to the Conservative Party in protest. Lord King was furthermore angered by the subsequent decision of the CAA to transfer two pairs of unused slots British Airways held at Tokyo &apos;s Narita Airport to Virgin to let it increase its frequency between Heathrow and Tokyo from four to six weekly round-trips, making it easier for Virgin to compete against British Airways. Lord King called the CAA &apos;s decision, which the Government had endorsed, &quot; a confiscation of his company&apos;s property &quot;.

This was primarily the result of a reduction in demand for travel caused by the recession of the early 1990s as well as by fear to travel in the aftermath of the first Gulf War. Britain&apos;s Conservative Government, which had presided over the collapse of International Leisure Group (ILG) and its subsidiary Air Europe resulting in 4,000 job losses was aware that Dan-Air was on the brink of bankruptcy, and wanted to avoid the collapse of another independent { independent from } { government-owned corporation s } British airline, especially if its profile was as high as Virgin Atlantic&apos;s. The Government decided to let Virgin Atlantic into Heathrow despite facing opposition from British Airways. [ &quot; Dirty tricks &quot; controversy ] Two Airbus A340-600 at London Heathrow Airport in 2010 The decision to abolish the London TDRs and to let Virgin Atlantic operate at Heathrow in competition with British Airways became the trigger for BA&apos;s so-called &quot; dirty tricks &quot; campaign against Virgin. In 1993 BA&apos;s PR director, David Burnside, published an article in BA News, British Airways&apos; internal magazine, which argued that Branson&apos;s protests against British Airways were a publicity stunt. Branson sued British Airways for libel, using the services of George Carman QC. BA settled out of court when its lawyers found the lengths to which the company went to try to kill off Virgin. BA had to pay a legal bill of up to £3m, damages to Branson of £500,000 and a further £110,000 to his airline.

In the 1990s, Virgin Atlantic jets were painted with &quot; No-Way BA/AA &quot; in opposition to the attempted merger between British Airways and American Airlines. In 1997, following British Airways&apos; announcement that it was to remove the Union Flag from its tailfins in favour of world images, Virgin introduced a Union Flag design on the winglet s of its aircraft and changed the red dress on the Scarlet Lady on the nose of aircraft to the union flag with the tag line &quot; Britain&apos;s Flag Carrier &quot;.

The left outboard engine lost power, and shortly after the right outboard engine also began to falter until the crew began crossfeeding fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam, where a safe landing was made. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft ( EASA and the FAA ), advising on the need for a low fuel warning system for large aircraft.
