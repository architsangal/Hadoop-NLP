Built from 1943, the 30 locomotives in the class were designed to haul express train s and replace the C36 class on these premium workings. They were the first NSW locomotives to use the popular Pacific 4-6-2 wheel arrangement. { Some Notes on the C38 Class 4-6-2 Locomotive Young, Harold } { Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, December, 2003 pp443-463 } { NOTOC } Unstreamlined 3820 preserved at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, wearing the black livery applied to many of the 38 class locomotives. 3803 [ History ] The C38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction - mostly due to the Second World War. 3801 was the first engine completed and entered service in January 1943. The last in the class, 3830 entered service in November 1949. The first five locomotives were built in the Clyde Engineering workshops and wore distinctive streamlined boiler casing. The remaining 25 locomotives were built at the New South Wales Government Railway Workshops at Eveleigh, New South Wales (13 locomotives) and NSWGR Workshops at Cardiff in Newcastle (12 locomotives). By 1951 diesel locomotive s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These gradually took the &quot; glamour workings &quot; away from the 38 class, who would be confined to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. They could still be found working The Newcastle Flyer up until December 1970. [ Preston, R.G. 3801 A Legend in Steam 3801 Limited 1992 0-646-11931-1 ] [ Today ] Four 38 class locomotives were saved from scrap. Currently no 38 class locomotives are operational. 3801 is in the custody of the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum (previously by 3801 Limited from 1986 - 2006), which is currently receiving a major overhaul. 3830 by the Powerhouse Museum waiting for a minor overhaul after problems were found in the boiler from a tour in the 4 of July 2009. 3830 is on display at the NSWRTM in the new roundhouse, while 3820 is as a static exhibit at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum display hall. 3813 suffered at the hands of a new railway commissioner after a complete restoration was begun in the mid 1970s. It is currently in a dismantled state at the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum. [ Stock list ] New South Wales Government Railways was a latecomer in Pacific era on its standard gauge express passenger train service. Thirty Pacific type locomotives were built for NSWGR.The first engines turned out during World War II. The last entered service in 1949.

It has since been remade by Hornby. A more prototypical model with DCC and sound has since been produced by Eureka Models. [ References ] [ Further reading ] [ Grunbach Alex.
