The Nalanda University was the oldest university-system of education in the world. { &quot; Really Old School, &quot; Garten, Jeffrey E. New York Times, 9 December 2006. } Western education became ingrained into Indian society with the establishment of the British Raj. Education in India falls under the control of both the Union Government and the states, with some responsibilities lying with the Union and the states having autonomy for others. The various articles of the Indian Constitution provide for education as a fundamental right. Most universities in India are controlled by the Union or the State Government. India has made progress in terms of increasing primary education attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately two thirds of the population. India&apos;s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to the economic rise of India. { India achieves 27% decline in poverty, Press Trust of India via Sify.com, 2008-09-12 } Much of the progress especially in Higher education, Scientific research has been credited to various public institutions. The private education market in India is merely 5% [ August 2011 ] although in terms of value is estimated to be worth $40 billion in 2008 and will increase to $78 billion by 2012 [ August 2011 ]. However, India continues to face stern challenges. Despite growing investment in education, 25% of its population is still illiterate; only 15% of Indian students reach high school, and just 7%, of the 15% who make it to high school, graduate. { India still Asia&apos;s reluctant tiger, by Zareer Masani of BBC Radio 4, 27 February 2008 } As of 2008, India&apos;s post-secondary institutions offer only enough seats for 7% of India&apos;s college-age population, 25% of teaching positions nationwide are vacant, and 57% of college professors lack either a master&apos;s or PhD degree. { SPECIAL REPORT: THE EDUCATION RACE, by Newsweek, August 18–25, 2011 issue } [ 2011 ], there are 1522 degree-granting engineering colleges in India with an annual student intake of 582,000, [ http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2007/May07/2007050113.pdf Science and Technology Education Press Information Bureau 2009-08-08 ] plus 1,244 polytechnics with an annual intake of 265,000. However, these institutions face shortage of faculty and concerns have been raised over the quality of education. { How To Save The World&apos;s Back Office, by Sramana Mitra of Forbes, 03.14.08 } [ History ] Monastic orders of education under the supervision of a guru was a favored form of education for the nobility in ancient India. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform.The priest class, the Brahmin s, were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya, were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade and the working class of the Shudra s was generally deprived of educational advantages. The book of laws, the Manusmriti, and the treatise on statecraft the Arthashastra were among the influential works of this era which reflect the outlook and understanding of the world at the time. Secular Buddhist institutions cropped up along with monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centers became increasingly visible from the period between 200 BCE to 400 CE.The important urban centers of learning were Taxila (in modern day Pakistan ) and Nalanda, among others.These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist literature, logic, grammar, etc. By the time of the visit of the Islamic scholar Alberuni (973–1048 CE), India already had a sophisticated system of mathematics. With the arrival of the British Raj in India the modern European education came to India. British Raj was reluctant to introduce mass education system as it was not their interest. The colonial educational policy was deliberately one of reducing indigenous culture and religion, an approach which became known as Macaulayism. { Kum. } With this the whole educational as well as government system went through changes. Educated people failed to get a job because the language in which they got their education had become redundant. { B. Nivedita, &quot; The Destruction of the Indian System of Education, &quot; } Adapted from a speech given to the Vivekananda Study Circle, IIT-Madras, January 1998. The system soon became solidified in India as a number of primary, secondary, and tertiary centers for education cropped up during the colonial era. { Blackwell, 91–92 } Between 1867 and 1941 the British increased the percentage of the population in Primary and Secondary Education from around 0.6% of the population in 1867 to over 3.5% of the population in 1941. However this was much lower than the equivalent figures for Europe where in 1911 between 8 and 18% of the population were in Primary and Secondary education.

India&apos;s first education minister Maulana Azad envisaged,strong central government control over education throughout the country, with a uniform educational system. { Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 150 } However, given the cultural and linguistic diversity of India, it was only the higher education dealing with science and technology that came under the jurisdiction of the central government. The government also held powers to make national policies for educational development and could regulate selected aspects of education throughout India. { Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 150–151 } The central government of India formulated the National Policy on Education (NPE) in 1968 and in 1986 and also reinforced the Programme of Action (POA) in 1992., { India 2004: A Reference Annual (53rd edition) } 208 The government initiated several measures the launching of DPEP (District Primary Education Programme) and SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,ssa.nic.in India&apos;s initiative for Education for All) and setting up of Navodaya Vidyalaya and other selective schools in every district, advances in female education, inter-disciplinary research and establishment of open universities. India&apos;s NPE also contains the National System of Education, which ensures some uniformity while taking into account regional education needs. The NPE also stresses on higher spending on education, envisaging a budget of more than 6% of the Gross Domestic Product. { RA-208 } While the need for wider reform in the primary and secondary sectors is recognized as an issue, the emphasis is also on the development of science and technology education infrastructure. [ Present education in India ] India&apos;s education system is divided into different levels such as pre-primary level, primary level, elementary education, secondary education, undergraduate level and postgraduate level. { Present education in India } [ Overview ] Children lining up for school in Kochi. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is the apex body for curriculum related matters for school education in India. The NCERT provides support and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 230–234 } In India, the various curriculum bodies governing school education system are: The state government boards, in which the majority of Indian children are enrolled. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). CBSE conducts two examinations, namely, the All India Secondary School Examination, AISSE (Class/Grade 10) and the All India Senior School Certificate Examination, AISSCE (Class/Grade 12). The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). CISCE conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/ Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/ Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). International schools affiliated to the International Baccalaureate Programme and/or the Cambridge International Examinations. Islamic Madrasah schools, whose boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with Darul Uloom Deoband. Autonomous schools like Woodstock School, Auroville, Patha Bhavan and Ananda Marga Gurukula. In addition, NUEPA (National University of Educational Planning and Administration) { www.nuepa.org } and NCTE (National Council for Teacher Education) are responsible for the management of the education system and teacher accreditation. { www.ncte-india.org } [ Primary education ] The Indian government lays emphasis to primary education up to the age of fourteen years (referred to as Elementary Education in India. { Blackwell, 93–94 } ) The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions. 80% of all recognized schools at the Elementary Stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the Country. { http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html } School children, Mumbai However, due to shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training.Education has also been made free for children for 6 to 14 years of age or up to class VIII under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009. { http://education.nic.in/Elementary/free%20and%20compulsory.pdf } There have been several efforts to enhance quality made by the government. The District Education Revitalization Programme (DERP) was launched in 1994 with an aim to universalize primary education in India by reforming and vitalizing the existing primary education system. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 215 } 85% of the DERP was funded by the central government and the remaining 15 percent was funded by the states. The DERP, which had opened 160000 new schools including 84000 alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately 3.5 million children, was also supported by UNICEF and other international programmes. This primary education scheme has also shown a high Gross Enrollment Ratio of 93–95% for the last three years in some states. Significant improvement in staffing and enrollment of girls has also been made as a part of this scheme. The current scheme for universalization of Education for All is the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan which is one of the largest education initiatives in the world. Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low. [ Private education ] { India. } According to current estimates, 80% of all schools are government schools making the government the major provider of education. However, because of poor quality of public education, 27% of Indian children are privately educated. According to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a fraction of the unit cost of government schools. [ http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id%3D12749787 A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is India’s biggest handicap 11 December 2008 The Economist ] [ http://www.gprg.org/pubs/workingpapers/pdfs/gprg-wps-071.pdf The progress of school education in India Geeta Gandhi Kingdon ] However, others have suggested that private schools fail to provide education to the poorest families, a selective being only a fifth of the schools and have in the past ignored Court orders for their regulation [ August 2011 ]. In their favour, it has been pointed out that private schools cover the entire curriculum and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs, general knowledge, sports, music and drama. The pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools and more teachers in private schools are female [ August 2011 ]. There is some disgreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (paratechers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive inservice training compared to 43.44% for government schools. The competition in the school market is intense, yet most schools make profit. [ http://www.globalenvision.org/library/8/767 Private Education in India can Benefit Poor People ] However, the number of private schools in India is still low - the share of private institutions is 7% (with upper primary being 21% and secondary 32% - source : fortress team research). Even the poorest often go to private schools despite the fact that government schools are free. A study found that 65% of schoolchildren in Hyderabad&apos;s slums attend private schools.

[ Homeschooling ] Homeschooling is legal in India, though it is the less explored option. The Indian Government&apos;s stance on the issue is that parents are free to teach their children at home, if they wish to and have the means. HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has stated that despite the RTE Act of 2009, if someone decides not to send his/her children to school, the government would not interfere.

However, enrolment figures show that only 31 million of these children were attending schools in 2001–02, which means that two-third of the population remained out of school. { Secondary Education. Education.nic.in. Retrieved on 2011-03-21. } A significant feature of India&apos;s secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society. Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of India&apos;s secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing. { Blackwell, 94–95 } A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan { Microsoft Word – Framework_Final_RMSA.doc.

The emphasis in the tertiary level of education lies on science and technology. { Blackwell, 95–96 } Indian educational institutions by 2004 consisted of a large number of technology institutes. Distance learning is also a feature of the Indian higher education system. { Blackwell, 96 } Some institutions of India, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), have been globally acclaimed for their standard of undergraduate education in engineering. The IITs enroll about 10,000 students annually and the alumni have contributed to both the growth of the private sector and the public sectors of India. { Vrat, 230–231 } However the IIT&apos;s have not had significant impact on fundamental scientific research and innovation. Several other institutes of fundamental research such as the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Indian Institute of Science IISC), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Harishchandra Research Institute (HRI), are acclaimed for their standard of research in basic sciences and mathematics. However, India has failed to produce world class universities both in the private sector or the public sector. { India doesn&apos;t figure in world top-100 universities, Press Trust of India via timesofindia.com, 2010-09-12 } Besides top rated universities which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India is also home to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen &amp; politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfill the required criterion by the Government and central bodies ( UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them.

By 2001 literacy for women had exceeded 50% of the overall female population, though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within India. { Raman, 236 } Recently the Indian government has launched Saakshar Bharat Mission for Female Literacy. This mission aims to bring down female illiteracy by half of its present level. Sita Anantha Raman outlines the progress of women&apos;s education in India: [ Since 1947 the Indian government has tried to provide incentives for girls’ school attendance through programs for midday meals, free books, and uniforms. This welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between 1951 and 1981. In 1986 the National Policy on Education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state, and with larger national goals. It emphasized that education was necessary for democracy, and central to the improvement of women’s condition. The new policy aimed at social change through revised texts, curricula, increased funding for schools, expansion in the numbers of schools, and policy improvements. Emphasis was placed on expanding girls’ occupational centers and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions. The report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty, and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care. The National Literacy Mission also worked through female tutors in villages. Although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls, many continue to be married much earlier. Therefore, at the secondary level, female dropout rates are high. ] Sita Anantha Raman also maintains that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions. { Raman, 238 } The education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country. A higher women literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside of home, by encouraging and promoting education of children, especially female children, and in reducing the infant mortality rate. Several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality, poorer nutrition, lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household. {. S. Chandrasekhar and A. Jayaraman, District Level Analysis of the Total Fertility Rate Using Indian Census Data (viewed on 9 Mar 2011), http://paa2004.princeton.edu/download.asp?submissionId=41578 } Women’s lower educational levels is also shown to adversely affect the health and living conditions of children. A survey that was conducted in India showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and educational level. { Women Education in India, (viewed on 9 mar 2011), http://www.slideshare.net/siddharth4mba/women-education-in-india } The survey also suggests a correlation between education and economic growth. In India, it was found that there is a large disparity between female literacy rates in different states. { Literacy Rate and Gender Gap in Sechduled Castes in India, (viewed on 9 Mar 2011), http://www.capabilityapproach.com/pubs/NavjeetKaur.pdf } For example, while Kerala actually has a female literacy rate of about 86 percent, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have female literacy rates around 55-60 percent. These values are further correlated with health levels of the Indians, where it was found that Kerala was the state with the lowest infant mortality rate while Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are the states with the lowest life expectancies in India. Furthermore, the disparity of female literacy rates across rural and urban areas is also significant in India. { Nutrition in India, Viewed on 11 Mar 2011, http://www.icosgroup.net/static/foodsec/text/accscnun_indiacasestudy.pdf } Out of the 24 states in India, 6 of them have female literacy rates of below 60 percent. The rural state Rajasthan has a female literacy rate of less than 12 percent. { Landscaping Women&apos;s Empowerment through Learning and Education in India, A study, Viewed on 11 Mar 2011,http://dasra.org/n/forwebsite/factsheet/Landscaping_Women_Empowerment_Report.pdf } [ Rural education ] { Rohith&apos;s Backyard. } Following independence, India viewed education as an effective tool for bringing social change through community development. { Setty and Ross, 120 } The administrative control was effectively initiated in the 1950s, when, in 1952, the government grouped villages under a Community Development Block—an authority under national programme which could control education in up to 100 villages. A Block Development Officer oversaw a geographical area of [ 150 sqmi km2 2 ] which could contain a population of as many as 70000 people. Setty and Ross elaborate on the role of such programmes, themselves divided further into individual-based, community based, or the Individual-cum-community-based, in which microscopic levels of development are overseen at village level by an appointed worker: [ The community development programmes comprise agriculture, animal husbandry, cooperation, rural industries, rural engineering (consisting of minor irrigation, roads, buildings), health and sanitation including family welfare, family planning, women welfare, child care and nutrition, education including adult education, social education and literacy, youth welfare and community organisation. In each of these areas of development there are several programmes, schemes and activities which are additive, expanding and tapering off covering the total community, some segments, or specific target populations such as small and marginal farmers, artisans, women and in general people below the poverty line. ] Despite some setbacks the rural education programmes continued throughout the 1950s, with support from private institutions. { Setty and Ross, 121 } A sizable network of rural education had been established by the time the Gandhigram Rural Institute was established and 5, 200 Community Development Blocks were established in India. { Setty and Ross, 122 } Nursery schools, elementary schools, secondary school, and schools for adult education for women were set up. Parayar School Children The government continued to view rural education as an agenda that could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation. However, in some cases lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of India. Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India&apos;s poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results. { Setty and Ross, 125 } Today, government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the Rural Development Foundation (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality rural schools, but the number of students served is small. [ Issues ] [ Workforce quality, funding and infrastructure ] Indian School-Girls One study found out that 25% of public sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers were absent during the survey. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 15% in Maharashtra to 30% in Bihar. Only 1 in nearly 3000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence.

This school is part of the &apos;Paathshaala&apos; project. The school currently educates 70 students. Following India&apos;s independence a number of rules were formulated for the backward Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of India, and in 1960 a list identifying 405 Scheduled Castes and 225 Scheduled Tribes was published by the central government. { Elder, 227 } An amendment was made to the list in 1975, which identified 841 Scheduled Castes and 510 Scheduled Tribes. The total percentage of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes combined was found to be 22.5 percent with the Scheduled Castes accounting for 17 percent and the Scheduled Tribes accounting for the remaining 7.5 percent. Following the report many Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes increasingly referred to themselves as Dalit, a Marathi language terminology used by B. R. Ambedkar which literally means &quot; oppressed &quot;. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are provided for in many of India&apos;s educational programmes. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 226–227 } Special reservations are also provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India, e.g. a reservation of 15% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Castes and another reservation of 7.5% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Tribes. Similar reservations are held by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in many schemes and educational facilities in India. The remote and far-flung regions of North East India are provided for under the Non Lapsible Central pool of Resources (NLCPR) since 1998–1999. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 236–237 } The NLCPR aims to provide funds for infrastructure development in these remote areas. Women from remote, underdeveloped areas or from weaker social groups in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, fall under the Mahila Samakhya Scheme, initiated in 1989. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 216 } Apart from provisions for education this programme also aims to raise awareness by holding meetings and seminars at rural levels. The government allowed [ 340 m 1 ] during 2007–08 to carry out this scheme over 83 districts including more than 21, 000 villages. Currently there are 68 Bal Bhavans and 10 Bal Kendra affiliated to the National Bal Bhavan. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 218 } The scheme involves educational and social activities and recognising children with a marked talent for a particular educational stream. A number of programmes and activities are held under this scheme, which also involves cultural exchanges and participation in several international forums. India&apos;s minorities, especially the ones considered &apos;educationally backward&apos; by the government, are provided for in the 1992 amendment of the Indian National Policy on Education (NPE). The government initiated the Scheme of Area Intensive Programme for Educationally Backward Minorities and Scheme of Financial Assistance or Modernisation of Madarsa Education as part of its revised Programme of Action (1992). Both these schemes were started nationwide by 1994. In 2004 the Indian parliament allowed an act which enabled minority education establishments to seek university affiliations if they passed the required norms. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 239 } Surprisingly,in the field of Sindhi language,(a 8th schedule language,which is prevalently spoken by the sindhis of India who have no state of their own)government has not made any significant contribution.Sindhis are linguistic minority and most of the states have no sindhi schools or schools with sindhi language as an optional paper.Sindhis with around ten million population has less than 100 teachers in this language.Sindhi,basically draws its origin from Indus Valley civilsation, while the language has Indo-aryan origin it is prevalently spoken in Pakistan and patronised by Pakistan Govt. Most of the sindhi Associations fear that due to apathy of Indian Govt. Sindhi language and culture will only be a story for next generation in near future. Rajesh Thadani,President of Bihar Sindhi Association,which was constituted by the first Governor of Bihar,Jairamdas Doulatram,has started awareness compaign in this direction.this compaign has gathered a momemntum and it has started recognition worldwide. [ Creative Learning ] [ Association for Promotion of Creative Learning ] The Association for Promotion of Creative Learning has been running a school for children since 1997 in Patna, where the organisation has developed a unique teaching learning methodology based on the Theory of Multiple Intelligences by Howard Gardner called Creative Learning. The organisation stresses on seven core competencies which are essential in any natural process of learning - Power of Observation, Concentration, Memory, Thinking, Imagination, Power of Expression/Communication and Emotional Control. [ Central government involvement ] [ Budget ] As a part of the tenth Five year Plan (2002–2007), the central government of India outlined an expenditure of 65.6% of its total education budget of [ 438.25 b ] i.e. [ 287.5 b ] on elementary education; 9.9% i.e. [ 43.25 b ] on secondary education; 2.9% i.e. [ 12.5 b ] on adult education; 9.5% i.e. [ 41.765 b ] on higher education; 10.7% i.e. [ 47 b ] on technical education; and the remaining 1.4% i.e. [ 6.235 b ] on miscellaneous education schemes. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 223 } According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), India has the lowest public expenditure on higher education per student in the world. [ http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/feb/05edu.htm Higher education spending: India at the bottom of BRIC Rediff 2005 ] [ Education in India Five Year Plan Expenditure ] [ Public Expenditure on Education in India ] During the Financial Year 2011-12, the Central Government of India has allocated Rs 38,957 crores for the Department of School Education and Literacy which is the main department dealing with primary education in India. Within this allocation, major share of Rs 21,000 crores, is for the flagship program &apos;Sarva Siksha Abhiyan&apos;. However, budgetary allocation of Rs 21,000 crores is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of Rs 35,659 for the year 2011-12. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation &apos;Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are;(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6 percent of GDP.(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6–14 years.(e) To universalize education through its flagship programmes such as Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and Mid Day Meal. However, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951-52 to 2.31% in 1970-71 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000-01. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004-05. There is a definite need to step up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1 per cent in 2000–2001 to around 9.98 per cent during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget. A policy brief issued by [Network for Social Accountability (NSA)] [ http://www.nsa.org.in Network for Social Accountability NSA 2009-12-28 2010-09-01 ] titled “[NSA Response to Education Sector Interventions in Union Budget: UPA Rule and the Education Sector] [ http://www.nsa.org.in/Policybrief/2009/345NSARUBEDU1.htm 345 NSA Response to Education Sector Interventions in Union Budget-UPA Rule and the Education Sector by Siba Sankar Mohanty Nsa.org.in 2009-02-21 2010-09-01 ] ” provides significant revelation to this fact. Due to a declining priority of education in the public policy paradigm in India, there has been an exponential growth in the private expenditure on education also. [As per the available information, the private out of pocket expenditure by the working class population for the education of their children in India has increased by around 1150 percent or around 12.5 times over the last decade].

Following initiatives by the Supreme Court of India during the 1990s the Ninety-third amendment bill suggested three separate amendments to the Indian constitution: { Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 152–154 } The constitution of India was amended to include a new article, 21A, which read: [ The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in a such manner as the State may, by law, determine. ] Article 45 was proposed to be substituted by the article which read: [ Provision for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years: The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of sixteen years. Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 154 ] Another article, 51A, was to additionally have the clause: [...a parent or guardian [shall] provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, [a] ward between the age of six to fourteen years. ] The bill was passed unanimously in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, on November 28, 2001. { Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 156 } It was later passed by the upper house—the Rajya Sabha —on May 14, 2002. After being signed by the President of India the Indian constitution was amended formally for the eighty sixth time and the bill came into effect. Since then those between the age of 6–14 have a fundamental right to education. { Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 149 } Article 46 of the Constitution of India holds that: [ The State shall promote, with special care, the education and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of social exploitation&apos;. ] Other provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can be found in Articles 330, 332, 335, 338–342. { India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 225 } Both the 5th and the 6th Schedules of the Constitution also make special provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
