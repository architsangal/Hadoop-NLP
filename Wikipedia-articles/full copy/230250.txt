Executive Producer was Adrian Malone, film directors were Dick Gilling, Mick Jackson and David Kennard. Quotations were read by actors Roy Dotrice and Joss Ackland. Series music was by Dudley Simpson with Brian Hodgson and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Additional music includes, amongst others, music by Pink Floyd. Apart from Bronowski, the only other named person appearing is the sculptor, Henry Moore. Malone and Kennard later emigrated to Hollywood, where they produced Carl Sagan &apos;s Cosmos. Jackson followed them, and now directs feature films. The title alludes to The Descent of Man, the second book on evolution by Charles Darwin. Over the series&apos; thirteen episodes, Bronowski travelled around the world in order to trace the development of human society through its understanding of science. It was commissioned specifically to complement Kenneth Clark &apos;s Civilisation (1969), in which Clark argued that art reflected and was informed by the major driving forces in cultural evolution. Bronowski wrote in his 1951 book The Commonsense of Science: &quot; It has been one of the most destructive modern prejudices that art and science are different and somehow incompatible interests &quot;. Both series were commissioned by David Attenborough, then controller of BBC Two, whose colleague Aubrey Singer had been astonished by Attenborough prioritising an arts series given his science background. { Attenborough interview in The Ascent of Man DVD set } The book of the series, The Ascent of Man: A Personal View, is an almost word-for-word transcript from the television episodes, diverging from Bronowski&apos;s original narration only where the lack of images might make its meaning unclear. A few details of the film version were omitted from the book, notably Episode 11, &quot; Knowledge or Certainty. &quot; It begins by showing the face of Stefan Borgrajewicz as an elderly man who had known suffering. At the end, after Bronowski shows us the ruins of Hiroshima and the ash-strewn pond at Auschwitz (a 16mm filmstrip of this scene is shown in the book), we see again a shot of the older Borgrajewicz dissolving to a photograph of a younger man with the name &quot; BOR-GRAJEWICZ, Stefan &quot; and the number 125558, which may be his official record in the archives of Auschwitz. Just over a year after the series appeared, Bronowski died of a heart attack aged 66. [ Series outline ] Lower than the Angels — Evolution of man from proto-ape to the modern form 400,000 years ago.

[ Broadcast and Reruns ] The Ascent of Man was originally broadcast on BBC in 1974. The series was broadcast on PBS in the United States starting in January 1975. In the late 1990s Douglas Adams recorded new introductions and afterwords for a rerun of the series on the British satellite channel UK Horizons. This was billed as the first complete rerun of the series in more than a decade. However, each episode was cut by up to five minutes to make room for the new material and for commercial breaks. In about 2000 it was reported that the BBC had been approached by Channel 5 who wanted to screen the series in prime time, but the BBC refused to lease the rights [ June 2010 ] Shortly afterward, BBC Two began a rerun as part of its Learning Zone block, in late night and early morning time slots, and cut by five minutes per episode. The reason for the cuts in this case is unclear as BBC Two has no commercials. The complete series has not been broadcast uncut in Britain since 1986 although the BBC Knowledge channel (the forerunner of BBC Four ) screened some selected complete episodes. The book from the television series has sold millions since the original broadcast. In 2011 the book was reissued by the BBC, with a foreword by Richard Dawkins but otherwise unchanged. [ Video release ] [ United States and Canada ] The series is available from several suppliers - including Ambrose Video Publishing ( video or DVD ) and Documentary-Video ( video or DVD ). [ United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand ] The series was belatedly released on PAL VHS and on Region 2 &amp; 4 PAL DVD in the UK in early 2005, initially on mail order only. It received a general release on April 18, 2005. This version does not include the pieces by Douglas Adams; the only extra feature, apart from a comprehensive illustrated booklet on the making of the series, is a short reminiscence by Sir David Attenborough, who commissioned the series. This DVD set has also been released in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. [ Legacy ] The Ascent of Man was placed 65th on a list of the 100 Greatest World Television Programmes voted for by industry professionals and drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000.
