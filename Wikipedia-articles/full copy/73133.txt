They are members of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Canucks play their home games at Rogers Arena, formerly known as General Motors Place, which has a capacity of 18,860. Mike Gillis is the team&apos;s president and general manager, Alain Vigneault is the coach and they are captained by centre Henrik Sedin. They won the Campbell Bowl as Western Conference playoff champions in 2011 and have won the Presidents&apos; Trophy, having recorded the best regular season record in the NHL for the past two seasons ( 2010–11 and 2011–12 ). The Canucks joined the league in 1970 as an expansion team along with the Buffalo Sabres. In its NHL history, the team has advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals three times, losing to the New York Islanders in 1982, the New York Rangers in 1994 and the Boston Bruins in 2011. The Canucks have won the Presidents&apos; Trophy in back-to-back seasons as the team with the league&apos;s best regular season record in the 2010–11 and 2011–2012 seasons. They won three division titles as a member of the Smythe Division from 1974 to 1993, and six titles as a member of the Northwest Division from 2003 to 2012. The Canucks have retired three players&apos; jerseys in their history — Stan Smyl (12), Trevor Linden (16) and Markus Naslund (19), all of whom served as team captains and held the all-time team point-scoring lead at the end of their respective careers. [ Hockey background in Vancouver ] After the Millionaires disbanded following the 1925–26 season, Vancouver was home to only minor league teams for many years. Most notably, the present-day Canucks&apos; minor league predecessor (also known as the Vancouver Canucks ), played from 1945 to 1970 in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and Western Hockey League. [ Team history ] [ 1967–1970: NHL application ] With the intention of attracting an NHL franchise, Vancouver began the construction of a new modern arena, the Pacific Coliseum, in 1967. [ Pacific Coliseum http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/venues/story/2010/01/12/spo-venue-pacificcoliseum.html May 25, 2011 January 13, 2010 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ] The WHL&apos;s Canucks were playing in a small indoor arena at the time, the Vancouver Forum, situated on the same Pacific National Exhibition grounds as the Coliseum. Meanwhile, a Vancouver group led by WHL Canucks owner and former Vancouver mayor Fred Hume made a bid to be one of the six teams due to join the league in 1967, but the NHL rejected their application.

Speculation long abounded afterwards that the bid was hindered by Toronto Maple Leafs president Stafford Smythe; after a failed Vancouver-based business deal, he was quoted as saying that the city would not get a NHL franchise in his lifetime. Additionally, along with the Montreal Canadiens, Smythe purportedly did not wish to split Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) hockey revenues three ways rather than two. { Total Hockey, ed. Dan Diamond (1998), Andrews McMeel, p. 251. } There were reports at the time, however, that the group had made a very weak proposal in expectation that Vancouver was a lock for one of the new franchises. [ May 2011 ] Less than a year later, the Oakland Seals were in financial difficulty and having trouble drawing fans. An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL did not want to see one of their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move so quickly and killed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, [ May 2011 ] made a new presentation, and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of $6  million dollars (three times the cost in 1967 ). { Rossiter 1994, p. 27. } The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and joined the league along with the Buffalo Sabres for the 1970–71 season. [ 1970–82: Early years ] To fill the Canucks&apos; roster for their inaugural season, the league held an Expansion Draft in the preceding summer. A draft lottery was held on June 9, 1970, determining who between the Canucks and Sabres would get the first selection in the Expansion Draft, as well as the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft; the Sabres won both spins. With his first selection in the Expansion Draft, Canucks general manager Bud Poile chose defenceman Gary Doak. { Rossiter 1994, pp. 27–28. } Among the other players chosen by Vancouver were centre Orland Kurtenbach, who was named the Canucks&apos; first captain, [ Gary Mason Oldtimers: On the Road with the Legendary Heroes of Hockey, Including Bobby Hull, Darryl Sittler, Marcel Dionne, Reggie Leach and Tiger Williams http://books.google.com/books?id%3D_O-r_SNCGhkC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA120 May 26, 2011 September 1, 2003 Greystone Books 978-1-55054-890-7 120 ] as well as defenceman Pat Quinn, who later became the team&apos;s general manager and coach in the 1990s. Two days later, on June 11, 1970, the Canucks made defenceman Dale Tallon their first-ever Amateur Draft selection. Tallon played three seasons with the club before being traded away to the Chicago Black Hawks. By comparison, the Sabres chose center Gilbert Perrault with the first overall selection they won from the lottery; Perrault went on to become a nine-time All-Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. { Rossiter 1994, p. 28. } With the Canucks&apos; roster set, the team played its inaugural game against the Los Angeles Kings on October 9, 1970. They lost the contest 3–1; defenceman Barry Wilkins scored the Canucks&apos; lone goal in the game and first in franchise history, a backhander against goaltender Denis DeJordy.

Placed in the competitive East Division, Poile assembled a core of players during this period led by Kurtenbach that included defencemen Tallon and Jocelyn Guevremont, as well as wingers Andre Boudrias and Dennis Ververgaert. Boudrias emerged as the team&apos;s leading point-scorer in four of their first five seasons. Prior to the 1974–75 season, Scallen and his ownership group from Minnesota sold the team to local media mogul Frank Griffiths for $9  million. { Rossiter 1994, p. 33. } Also in the summer of 1974, the Canucks were re-aligned within the league and placed in the new Smythe Division. They responded with their first winning record (38 wins, 32 losses and 10 ties), finishing first in the division with 86 points. { Media Guide 2008, pp. 146–82. } Making their debut in the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks lost the opening series of the 1975 post-season in five games to the Montreal Canadiens. Head coach and general manager Phil Maloney (the third GM in team history after Poile and Hal Laycoe ) recalled the importance of a successful season for the Canucks in that year specifically, as the rival league World Hockey Association had established another major professional team in the city – the Vancouver Blazers. Competing for the same hockey market, the Canucks emerged over the Blazers as the latter relocated to Calgary, Alberta, the following season. { Rossiter 1994, p. 39. } The Canucks posted a second consecutive winning record and made the playoffs in 1975–76, but lost to the New York Islanders in a two-game preliminary series. The Canucks missed the playoffs in the two seasons thereafter. Meanwhile, Kurtenbach had since retired and assumed a coaching position with Vancouver. His departure as a player marked the beginning of a seven-year period in which the Canucks had four different captains – Boudrias, Chris Oddleifson, Don Lever and Kevin McCarthy. Following their post-season loss to the Islanders in 1976, Vancouver did not have another winning season for sixteen years, though they made the playoffs nine times in that span. Following the 1976–77 season, Maloney was replaced as general manager by Jake Milford, who acquired such players as Stan Smyl, Thomas Gradin and Richard Brodeur – a core that would lead the team throughout the 1980s. { Rossiter 1994, p. 47. } [ 1982 Stanley Cup run ] [ 1981–82 Vancouver Canucks season 1982 Stanley Cup Finals ] The Canucks made their first significant playoff impact in the post-season of 1982. In their previous five playoff appearances, the team had failed to win a single series. Though the Canucks finished three games under a.500 win percentage in the 1981–82 regular season, they began gaining momentum by finishing the campaign on a nine-game unbeaten streak. { Rossiter 1994, p. 57. } Meanwhile, Smyl emerged as the club&apos;s leader, replacing McCarthy as captain after the latter was sidelined with an injury late in the season (he would retain that position for a team-record eight years).

The Canucks also had home ice advantage during the second round series against the Kings, who upset the Oilers in the first round. During the Conference Finals against the Black Hawks, Vancouver interim coach Roger Neilson, frustrated with what he felt was the poor officiating in the game, placed a white towel on the end of a hockey stick and held it up in a gesture mocking surrender (waving the white flag ). The players on the Canucks&apos; bench followed suit. At the next game, the team&apos;s fans cheered their team on by waving white towels above their heads. The habit stuck, becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the league and in other sports, known as Towel Power. The Canucks proceeded to win the series, making it to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in their history. { Rossiter 1994, p. 58. } [ Towel Power ] Entering the Finals against the New York Islanders, the Canucks were the first team from Western Canada to play for the Stanley Cup in 56 years, when the Victoria Cougars reached the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals. It also marked the first ever coast-to-coast Stanley Cup Finals. [ Stanley Cup champions and finalists http://www.nhl.com/cup/champs.html May 31, 2011 National Hockey League ] Competing against the Islanders – the Stanley Cup champions of the previous two years who had finished with 41 points more than Vancouver in the regular season standings – Vancouver took the first game to overtime. In the final minute of the extra period, Canucks defenceman and fan favourite Harold Snepsts gave the puck away with an errant pass from behind his net, leading to a Mike Bossy goal. { Rossiter 1994, p. 61. } The Canucks were unable to complete their Cinderella run and were swept, losing their next three games by 6–4, 3–0 and 3–1 scores. The 1982 playoffs proved to be the last year in which Vancouver won a playoff series until 1992. [ 1982–94: Decline and resurgence ] After their improbable Stanley Cup run, the Canucks slipped back into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s, making the playoffs only four times for the rest of the decade. Notable players that joined the Canucks&apos; core following the 1982 playoffs included offensively-skilled forwards Patrik Sundstrom and Tony Tanti. Beginning in 1983–84, the Canucks&apos; scoring title was held by either Sundstrom or Tanti for four of the next five seasons. For most of the second half of the 1980s, the Canucks competed with the Los Angeles Kings for the final playoff spot in the Smythe Division. The years in which they qualified, the team was eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers (in [ 1985 ] ) or the Calgary Flames (in [ 1982 ], [ 1983 ] and Flames championship season of [ 1989 ], which was decided in Game 7), both division rivals. Following Milford&apos;s tenure as general manager from 1977 to 1982, the position was held by Harry Neale for three years, then Jack Gordon for two. The latter was responsible for trading away power forward Cam Neely to the Boston Bruins in 1986. { Rossiter 1994, p. 62. } In addition to Neely, the Canucks gave up their 1987 first round draft pick, with which the Bruins chose Glen Wesley, and in return acquired centre Barry Pederson. While Pederson collected back-to-back 70-point seasons with the Canucks in his first two seasons after the trade, he was traded away to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1989 as his performance quickly declined.

Among the more key transactions was a deal with the New Jersey Devils, in which Sundstrom was traded away in exchange for winger Greg Adams and goaltender Kirk McLean. In addition to Quinn&apos;s trades, the team improved through the draft route with two selections, in particular. With the second overall selection in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, the Canucks chose winger Trevor Linden from the Western Hockey League. The following year, the team made a controversial selection by choosing Russian winger Pavel Bure 113th overall. Bure was believed by most teams to be ineligible for selection that year. Consequently, his draft by the Canucks took a year to be verified by the league as team management went about procuring documents to prove his eligibility. { Rossiter 1994, p. 71. } As the decade turned, a shift in the Canucks&apos; leadership occurred as Stan Smyl resigned his captaincy prior to the 1990–91 season due to a reduced on-ice role with the team. In his place, the Canucks implemented a rotating captaincy of Linden, Dan Quinn and Doug Lidster; of the three Linden retained the captaincy thereafter, becoming the youngest permanent captain in team history at 21 years old. At the end of the season, Smyl retired as the team&apos;s all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points. Led by Linden and in large part to Quinn&apos;s dealings, the Canucks rose to prominence in the early 1990s. This increased success came roughly around the time the Oilers and Flames began to sink in the standings. As a result, Vancouver won their first division title in 17 years with 42 wins, 26 losses and 12 ties during the 1991–92 season. During the campaign, the Canucks honoured Smyl, who had remained the team as an assistant coach, by making him the first player in team history to have his jersey (number 12) retired.

Despite underachieving in the regular season (their points total decreased by 16 from the previous year), the Canucks played well in the playoffs and embarked on another unexpected run. Opening the playoffs with a close first-round series against the Calgary Flames, Vancouver rallied from a three-games-to-one deficit to win the series in seven contests. Games 5 through 7 were all won in overtime with goals from Geoff Courtnall, Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure. { Rossiter 1994, pp. 15–16. } The deciding seventh game featured two of the most recognizable and celebrated plays in Canucks history. With the game tied 3–3 in the first overtime, goaltender Kirk McLean made what became known thereafter as &quot; The Save &quot;, sliding across the crease feet-first and stacking his pads on the goal line to stop Robert Reichel on a one-timer pass from Theoren Fleury.

Of the 14 goals Vancouver scored in the low-scoring series, Canucks center Ryan Kesler registered a point in 11 of them, helping the Canucks defeat the Predators in six games. Facing the San Jose Sharks in the Conference Finals, captain Henrik Sedin led the Canucks with 12 points in the five-game series. Vancouver defeated San Jose four-games-to-one with a double-overtime winner from defenceman Kevin Bieksa in the fifth game. Advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1994, the Canucks opened the fourth round against the Boston Bruins with a 1–0 win in Game 1. Winger Raffi Torres scored the winning goal with 18.5 seconds remaining. The following game, the Canucks won 3–2 in overtime with Burrows scoring the winner 11 seconds into the extra frame, making it the second fastest overtime goal in Stanley Cup Finals history.

They also honoured the late Rick Rypien on October 18, 2011. For the rest of the season, they will wear decals on their helmets saying &quot; 37 RYP. &quot; The Canucks were also involved with a couple of trades during the 2011-12 season when they traded Mikael Samuelsson and the recently acquired Marco Sturm to the Florida Panthers for David Booth, Steven Reinprecht, and a 2013 Draft Pick. They would not trade again until February 27, when this time, young rookie player Cody Hodgson, along with Alexander Sulzer, was traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Zach Kassian and Marc-Andre Gragnani. Many fans compare this trade to the lopsided trade back in 1996 when the Canucks traded Alek Stojanov to Pittsburgh for the then 21-year old Markus Naslund. The Canucks spent most of the 2011-2012 season catching up with other Western Conference teams to make the playoffs, they would catch up with the St. Louis Blues to be top seed of the Western Conference, as well as catching up with the New York Rangers for the President&apos;s Trophy. It took until the last game of the season (game 82) to clinch the western conference and President&apos;s Trophy when the Rangers lost to the Washington Capitals 4-1, and Vancouver defeated their division rival Edmonton Oilers 3-0. It was the first time since the 1990-91 Chicago Blackhawks, that a team won both their conference and President&apos;s Trophy at the same time on the last day of the regular season. It is Vancouver&apos;s second consecutive President&apos;s Trophy. Despite their incredible regular season record, Vancouver&apos;s inability to stay out of the penalty box cost them gravely as they fell 4-2 at home in games 1 and 2, and failed to score in game 3 as the Los Angeles Kings took a commanding 3-0 series lead on home ice. However, during the 4th game, the Canucks picked it up and forced a 5th game winning 3-1. This did not last long though, as the Canucks lost Game 5 to the Kings with a score of 2-1 in overtime, knocking them out of the playoffs. [ Team information ] [ Ownership ] The initial owners were Tom Scallen &apos;s Medicor group. In 1972, hints of impropriety were circulating about Scallen. He was charged with stock fraud and spent the last two years of his Canuck ownership in prison. [ May 2011 ] In 1974 Scallen and Medicor sold out to Frank Griffiths.From 1988 to 1997, the Vancouver Canucks were owned by local businessman and philanthropist Arthur Griffiths, who had inherited ownership from his father, Frank. However, he was forced to sell his majority interest in the Canucks after overextending his resources trying to build a new arena, GM Place (currently known as Rogers Arena ). As a result, he sold his majority share to American billionaire John McCaw, Jr.. On November 17, 2004, the Anmoli Investment Group, headed by Francesco Aquilini, purchased a 50% share in Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment (the owners of both the Canucks franchise and Rogers Arena) from John McCaw, Jr.. Prior to the sale, Aquilini and two business partners, Tom Gaglardi and Ryan Beedie, had negotiated with Orca Bay for several months without concluding an agreement. In January 2005, Gaglardi and Beedie filed a lawsuit against Aquilini and Orca Bay, alleging that Aquilini and Orca Bay had acted in bad faith in concluding a deal using information obtained from their joint offer. On November 8, 2006, Aquilini, along with his brothers Roberto and Paolo, purchased the remaining 50% of the Vancouver Canucks and Rogers Arena from McCaw. { TSN.ca, Aquilini group buys rest of Canucks } [ January 2011 ] { Business in Vancouver November 14–20, 2006, issue 890, p. 1. } In May 2007, Gaglardi and Beedie&apos;s civil lawsuit over Aquilini&apos;s purchase reached the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The court ruled for Aquilini, on January 10, 2008. The court held that there was no legal partnership between Aquilini, Beedie, and Gaglardi, and that McCaw was free to sell the team to anyone he wished. { Court feud yields a rare look into Canucks&apos; backroom dealing By Ian Mulgrew. Vancouver Sun, B1. May 8, 2007. } On January 29, 2008 the company responsible for operating the Vancouver Canucks and Rogers Arena, changed its name from Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment to Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment. [ Logos and jerseys ] The team has gone through thirteen different logo and jersey changes in its history. The &quot; Stick-in-Rink &quot;, 1970–78; alternate logo, 2003–2007. The team&apos;s first NHL jerseys, worn from the inaugural season of 1970–71 (modified for the 1972–73 season) until the end of the 1977–78 season, featured a hockey stick in the shape of a shallow &quot; V &quot; superimposed on a blue rink-shaped rectangle forming the letter &quot; C &quot;, designed by North Vancouver artist, Joe Borovich. A modified version of this logo is still in use, as a shoulder patch on the team&apos;s current jerseys and as the primary logo of their Alternate jerseys. In 1978, aiming for a more aggressive image, the organization asked a San Francisco design agency, Beyl &amp; Boyd, to design new uniforms. These consisted of a huge yellow, red-orange, and black striped &quot; V &quot; coming down from the shoulders (suggesting &quot; victory &quot;, according to its designers). It is generally considered to be one of the most unpopular uniforms in NHL history (hockey writer Stephen Cole referred to it looking like &apos;a punch in the eye&apos;). The &quot; Flying Skate &quot;, 1985–1997. The &quot; Flying V &quot; theme was abandoned in 1985, to feature the team&apos;s emblem on the front rather than the &quot; V &quot; (the emblem had previously been worn only on the arms). The logo consisted of the word &quot; Canucks &quot; in a diagonal slant as part the blade of a skate. The logo, with its laser-like design, was sometimes referred to as the &quot; Star Wars &quot; logo, the &quot; waffle iron &quot;, the &quot; plate of spaghetti &quot;, and most commonly, the &quot; Flying Skate &quot;.The yellow home jerseys were scrapped in 1989 in favour of more conventional white ones, and the triangular shoulder stripes which adorned the post- &quot; V &quot; jerseys were discarded as well. The new incarnation was worn from 1989–92, when a subtle change was made – and went largely unnoticed for the rest of the jersey&apos;s lifespan. The orange was changed to red, and the deep &quot; gold &quot; colour was changed to a much brighter yellow, reportedly because jersey-maker CCM no longer produced the required hues. In 1996, an alternate jersey was introduced, retaining the &quot; Flying Skate &quot; logo, but using a salmon colour graduating to black near the bottom. Orca logo, 1997–2007. In 1997 the Canucks unveiled a new logo, in which a Haida -style orca breaking out of a patch of ice forms a stylized &quot; C &quot;. The logo has been much-maligned, accused of being a blatant reference to their parent company, Orca Bay (now Canucks Sports and Entertainment ). At the time, general manager Pat Quinn discussed wanting to have a West Coast colour scheme, and overall West Coast themes in the logo; the colour scheme included blue, red, and silver. Beginning in 2001, an alternate jersey was utilized, with contrasting shoulder patches and a blue-to-maroon graduated colour in the body. In 2006 these gradient-coloured alternate jerseys were officially replaced with the popular, royal blue &quot; Stick-in-Rink &quot; uniforms from the 1970s. &quot; The Stick-in-Rink &quot;, modified; alternate logo, 2007–. Little more than halfway through the 2006–07 season, the Canucks announced that they would be changing their jerseys once again. While a report in February 2007 suggested the new scheme would be revealed on August 1, 2007, the new team jersey was actually unveiled prior to training camp, on August 29, 2007. It featured the same orca design present on their previous jerseys, but the colour scheme was updated to their &quot; retro &quot; colours of royal blue and kelly green. Additionally, the word &quot; Vancouver &quot; was added to the chest area above the orca. This move was seen as a way to connect the NHL Canucks&apos; uniform to that of the WHL team, whose members wore uniforms with the word &quot; Canucks &quot; along the top in a similar arched design. The actual jerseys themselves were changed to the Rbk Edge design, along with all other teams in the NHL. The introduction was largely greeted with disappointment from fans and sports commentators, who criticized the uniforms for looking like a &quot; copy and paste &quot; of those from the past. The Vancouver Sun described the new look as &quot; decidedly unpopular. &quot; [ Hansen Darah Uniform unveiled The Vancouver Sun August 29, 2007 http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id%3D11779383-25dc-4494-9d4a-428dfeb1b97d%26amp%3Bk%3D31762 – Scholar search ] [ April 2009 ] { Johnny Canuck &quot; Reebok third jersey shoulder logo, modified; 2008–. } On November 14, 2008, prior to their Sport Celebrities Festival, the Canucks released their new RBK Edge Third Jersey. While staying with the colours of Vancouver, and combining the old with the new, the jersey looks very similar to their home jersey. The modernized &quot; Stick-in-Rink &quot; logo unveiled the previous year on the shoulder of the main jerseys is used as the main crest. On the shoulder, a V with the head of Johnny Canuck on top is used. This is the first time in team history since joining the NHL that Johnny Canuck has appeared on a Vancouver uniform. Sports Illustrated rated it 13th overall out of the 19 third jerseys released for the 2008 season.
