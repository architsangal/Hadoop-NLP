Morgan is Maryland&apos;s designated public urban university and the largest HBCU in the state of Maryland. In 1890, the institution name formerly known as Centenary Biblical Institute was changed to honor the Reverend Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its Board of Trustees, who donated land to the college.

The University is a member-school of Thurgood Marshall College Fund. Though it is a public institution, Morgan is not a part of the University System of Maryland; the school opted out of becoming a part of the system and possesses its own governing Board of Regents. [ History ] The historic Holmes Hall Morgan was founded in 1867 as the Centenary Biblical Institute, a Methodist Episcopal seminary, to train young men in the ministry. At the time of his death, Thomas Kelso, co-founder and president of the board of directors, endowed the Male Free School and Colored Institute through a legacy of his estate. { Morgan State University Spokesman &apos;Our Forefathers: The Founders of Morgan State&apos;, Feb, 8, 2002, Cox } { History of Baltimore City and County, from the earliest period to the present day: including biographical sketches of their representative men, John Thomas Scharf, p. 667 } { &quot; Got my mind set on freedom &quot; : Maryland&apos;s story of black &amp; white activism 1663-2000, Barbara Mills, Heritage Books 2002, p. 345 } It later broadened its mission to educate both men and women as teacher s. The school was renamed Morgan College in 1890 in honor of the Reverend Lyttleton Morgan, the first chairman of its Board of Trustees, who donated land to the college. In 1915 Andrew Carnegie gave the school a grant of $50,000 for a central academic building. The terms of the grant included the purchase of a new site for the College, payment of all outstanding obligations, and the construction of a building to be named after him. The College met the conditions and moved to its present site in northeast Baltimore in 1917. Then a controversy exploded: in 1918, the white community of Lauraville was incensed that the Ivy Mill property, where Morgan was to be built, had been sold to a &quot; negro &quot; college. It attempted to have the sale revoked by filing suit in the circuit court in Towson, which dismissed the suit. They then appealed the case to the state Court of Appeals. [ Harrison Miles Jr. Chip Silverman Ten Bears Positive Publications 2001 USA 19 0-9679922-1-4 ] The appellate court upheld the lower court decision, finding no basis that siting the college at this location would constitute a public nuisance. { Diggs v. Morgan College, 105 A. 157, 133 Md. 264 (1918) } Despite some ugly threats and several demonstrations against the project, Morgan College was allowed to be constructed at the new site and later expand. Carnegie Hall, the oldest original building on the present MSU campus, was erected a year later. Morgan remained a private institution until 1939. That year, the state of Maryland purchased the school in response to a state study that determined that Maryland needed to provide more opportunities for its black citizens. Morgan College became Morgan State College. In 1975, Morgan added several doctoral programs and its Board of Directors petitioned the Maryland Legislature to be granted University status. [ Improvements ] New student union building The school has undergone numerous renovations, including building a new communications building, a new student union, a new parking garage, and a new library.

Hurt, Morgan&apos;s athletic teams were legendary. More than thirty of its football players were drafted by and played in the NFL [ http://www.databasefootball.com/players/bycollege.htm?sch%3DMorgan%2BState%2BUniversity NFL Players who attended Morgan State University databasefootball.com ] and many of its track athletes competed internationally and received world-class status. By the late 1960s most white colleges and universities ended their segregation against black high school students [ http://www.history.appstate.edu/WadeTolliver.htm http://web.archive.org/web/20070619040328/http%3A//www.history.appstate.edu/WadeTolliver.htm 19 June 2007 Professor Revising History of College Desegregation ] and many top black high school students and athletes started matriculating to schools from which they had been barred just a decade prior. While achieving a national goal of desegregation, integration depleted the athletic strength of schools like Morgan and Grambling State University. For example, the annual contest between Morgan and Grambling played in New York City in the late 1960s drew more than 60,000 fans. [ http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9406EED8163BF93BA15752C0A962948260 Sports: Scouting The New York Times 8 January 2009 Michael Janofsky Thomas Rogers 1984-01-28 ] Today, the two teams do not even play each other and Morgan&apos;s home football games rarely draw as many as 10,000 fans with the exception of the school&apos;s homecoming game. { Hill Field House, Morgan&apos;s indoor athletic venue } [ Lacrosse ] By 1975, Morgan became noted for its lacrosse team. Lacrosse, a sport that, up until then, had been dominated by white athletes. Black high school lacrosse players in Maryland and New York still had trouble getting into non-black schools. Morgan was the first (and until the turn of the 20th to 21st century, the only) historically black university to field a lacrosse team. Several members of the team now coach lacrosse in local high schools. Tony Fulton and Curt Anderson were elected to the Maryland House of Delegates. Dr. Miles Harrison and Coach Howard &quot; Chip &quot; Silverman collaborated on the book, Ten Bears; which is being made into a movie. In 2005, students organized a lacrosse club which plays other college&apos;s lacrosse clubs, but the team has yet to qualify to become an NCAA sanctioned team.

The club team has played more than twenty games in the last three years, most of them &quot; away &quot; because of the Bears&apos; lack of a home field, locker rooms or visiting team amenities. [ Basketball ] [ Morgan State Bears men&apos;s basketball ] In 2009, the Morgan State men&apos;s basketball team won the MEAC regular season and tournament championship and qualified for the 2009 NCAA Men&apos;s Division I Basketball Tournament.

The groups that are subdivisions of the critically acclaimed choir include the University Choir, which is over 140 voices strong, and The Morgan Singers (approximately 40 voices). While classical, gospel, and contemporary popular music comprise the majority of the choir’s repertoire, the choir is noted for its emphasis on preserving the heritage of the spiritual, especially in the historic practices of performance. The Morgan State University Choir has performed for audiences throughout the United States and all over the world—including the Bahamas, Virgin Islands, Canary Islands, Canada, Africa, Asia and Europe. Their most recent international appearance was in St. Petersburg, Russia at the invitation of Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, music director and conductor for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In Russia, the Choir performed in the 5th International Festival Arts Square and was received enthusiastically by their Russian audiences. The Choir has appeared at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC and the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall (in New York City) on numerous occasions, performing and premiering works such as John Corigliano ’s “Poem On His Birthday,” “Too Hot to Handel” arranged by Broadway composers Bob Christianson and Gary Anderson { http://www.toohot2handel.com/creativeteam.html } and Hannibal Lokumbe’s “African Portraits,” led by music director Leonard Slatkin, as part of the Kennedy Center’s African Festival. One of the Choir’s most historic moments came with the opportunity to sing under the baton of Robert Shaw, conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke&apos;s and joined by Jessye Norman and others in Carnegie Hall’s One Hundredth Birthday Tribute to Marian Anderson. A major milestone and historical movement occurred in the 1996-1997 season with the sounds of the “Silver Anniversary” concert being broadcast into households throughout the state of Maryland. The concert won three Emmy Awards for Maryland Public Television (MPT). MPT continues to air this hallmark performance during select sections of their membership drives. In 1993, the choir joined actor James Earl Jones in a performance of the Star-Spangled Banner at the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, broadcast on CBS. When at home, the choir performs here at the Carl J. Murphy Fine Arts Center Known for their consistency of performances, the Choir probably does more annual appearances with major orchestras of the United States than any other university choir.

In December 2003 the Choir performed “African Portraits” with the Baltimore Symphony at the Gala Concert for the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture. In their May 2004 issue, Reader’s Digest named the Morgan State University Choir as the “Best College Choir &quot; in its list of “America’s 100 Best.” [ http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/best-of-america-college-choir/article36660.html America&apos;s Best May, 2004 Reader&apos;s Digest 2008-11-24 ] In January 2005, under the leadership of Dr. Eric Conway, the choir performed Felix Mendelssohn ’s Symphony #2, “Lobgesang,” with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, as well as performing at the State Department at the personal invitation of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to wide acclaim. Most recently, the Morgan State University Choir performed for the service honoring Rosa Parks, the unassuming matriarch of the civil rights movement, who became the first woman to lie in state at our nation’s Capitol Rotunda. In July 2006, the Choir traveled to Prague, Czech Republic, for two concerts with Maestro Paul Freeman. In November 2006, the Morgan State Choir participated in a concert celebrating the Bicentennial Celebration and Re-opening of the Basilica of the Assumption—the first cathedral in America. { Rutgers University -Morgan State football game in } { Piscataway, New Jersey (September 2008) } The Morgan State University Choir has shared its musical gifts on many grand stages all over the world -– with numerous dignitaries and celebrated performers -– making them cultural ambassadors for Morgan State University, the city of Baltimore, and the state of Maryland.
