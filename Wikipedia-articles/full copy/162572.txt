The following List of Presidents of Colombia is a list in chronological order of the persons who have occupied the Office of the President of Colombia or similar office during its history since achieving Independence in 1810. Because of historical events and constitutional restrictions, the Chief Executive Officers of Colombia have not always been called President s, but have held the office under various titles. [ Foolish Fatherland (During the Reign of Fernando VII) ] The Foolish Fatherland is a historical period where the colonies of the Viceroyalty of the New Granada first experimented with self-rule. After the incarceration of King Ferdinand VII of Spain by Napoleon Bonaparte, several cities across the empire cut ties with the shadow government of Napoleon&apos;s brother, Joseph I, who had crowned himself King of Spain. As the news of this unrest reached the New World various cities declared independence from Spain. In the New Granada, given the fraction of its territory, various provinces declared themselves independent and set up their own governments headed by Criollos. The office of President was then first implemented in the country by regional leaders. [ Regional Presidents ] [ State of Cundinamarca (1810—1814) (During the Reign of Fernando VII) ] On January 29, 1810 the Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom in Cádiz dissolved under the pressure of French troops during the Siege of Cádiz, thus ending the last bastillion of the Spanish Resistance in mainland Spain. When news of this event reached the New World local political leaders sought to take advantage of the situation and set up juntas headed by Criollos. In Bogotá, the capital of the Viceroyalty of the New Granada news of this event reached on July 20, 1810 and the events that followed led to the formation of the Open Cabildo of Bogotá. At first the Cabildo sought to gain legitimacy by including the Viceroy in their leadership, but he refused to do so and was replaced by the Vice President of the Cabildo, the Mayor of Bogotá, José Miguel Pey de Andrade making him the first Criollo to hold executive and legislative power over the territory that is now Colombia. As independence spread over the empire, the Cabildo was replaced by the Government of the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca, with Bogotá as its capital and Jorge Tadeo Lozano as its President, or as his title indicated &quot; President of Cundinamarca and Vicegerent of the King&apos;s Person. &quot; The independent Republic of Cundinamarca lasted until 1812, when this one was incorporated into the United Provinces of the New Granada. 30px • Open Cabildo of Bogotá • 30px Picture Name Took office Left office Form of Ascension Reason for stepping down 80px Antonio José Amar y Borbón did not take office President-elect of Cabildo, but refuses to accept office.

[ State of Cartagena de Indias (1810—1812) (During the Reign of Fernando VII) ] [ List of Governors of the Province of Cartagena#Peninsular War, Revolution and Independence (1810-1820) ] When news of the declaration of independence of the Cabildo of Bogotá reached the port city of Cartagena de Indias, local leaders moved to form their own Supreme Junta on August 13, 1810, and subsequently on November 11, 1811 declared absolute independence from Spain and from the Viceroyalty of New Granada becoming its own nation, initially under the leadership of José Ignacio de Cavero y Cárdenas as President of the Junta, and afterwards under a Governor President until the incorporation of Cartagena into the United Provinces of New Granada. 30px • Supreme Junta of Cartagena de Indias • 30px Picture Name Took office Left office Form of Ascension Reason for stepping down 80px José Ignacio Cavero y Cárdenas November 11, 1811 January 21, 1812 President of the Supreme Junta of Government Office subjugated to the new State. 80px José María del Real e Hidalgo January 21, 1812 April 1, 1812 Elected Governor President of the State.

On November 26, 1811 Tunja signed the Act of Confederation joining the United Provinces of New Granada, and on December 9, 1811 declared its formal independence from Spain. The tensions between Cundinamarca and the United Provinces however forced Tunja to enter into a treaty with Cundinamarca; the Santa Rosa Pact separated Tunja from the Federalist government of the United Provinces and put it in track to eventually join the Centralist government of Cundinamarca. The Republic of Tunja was now standing in its own two feet under the administration of President-Governor Juan Nepomuceno Niño, this lasted until Cundinamarca was finally defeated and Tunja rejoined the United Provinces. 30px • Republic of Tunja • 30px Picture Name Took office Left office Form of Ascension Reason for stepping down 80px Juan Nepomuceno Niño y Muelle July 3, 1812 October 4, 1812 Elected President-Governor of Tunja by its Junta. Office subjugated to that of the United Provinces of New Granada. [ United Provinces of New Granada (1812—1816) (During the Reign of Fernando VII) ] [ United Provinces of New Granada ] The United Provinces of New Granada was formed on November 26, 1811 as a Confederation of the independent provinces of Tunja, Pamplona, Antioquia, Cartagena and Neiva. The office of the President was at first non-existent, the provinces did not want to entrust power to one person in order to avoid favoritism. During its first formal assembly, the Federal Congress elected as its first President Camilo Torres Tenorio and entrusted him with executive power while a Triumvirate was set up. The Triumvirate, was an experimental form of executive power in which three individuals would parallel and equally share executive power, giving more representation to various provinces at once; the system however, was flawed and ultimately proved difficult to maintain in light of the invasion by Pablo Morillo and its leaders were persecuted, forced to pass along power in a relay race for time and survival until all of its leaders were finally killed, or captured. 30px • United Provinces of New Granada • 30px Picture Name Took office Left office Form of Ascension Reason for stepping down 80px Camilo Torres Tenorio October 4, 1812 October 5, 1814 President of the Congress, entrusted with the Federal Executive Power.

[ Reign of Terror (1816—1819) ] [ List of Viceroys of New Granada ] The culmination of the Spanish reconquest of New Granada was the reinstitution of the Vice-royalty and the return of Spanish rule. The office of President was abolished in the colony and those fighting for independence were either captured, killed, forced underground or forced into exile; this period is known as the Reign of Terror, a period when the Spanish colonial rulers sought to set an example of all of those who have defied the crown by setting show trial s and sentencing many of the Precursors of independence to death in public displays. 30px • Spanish Reconquista of New Granada • 30px [ Republic of Colombia (1819—1831) ] 30px • 1st Republic of Colombia • 30px Picture Name Took office Left office Form of Ascension Reason for stepping down 80px Simón Bolívar Palacios February 15, 1819 December 13, 1821 Elected by the Congress of Angostura in 1819.
