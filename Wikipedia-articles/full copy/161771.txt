{ John Wootton } The Byerley Turk or Byerly Turk, (c.1684-1706) was the earliest of three stallion s that were the founders of the modern Thoroughbred horse racing bloodstock (the other two are the Godolphin Arabian and the Darley Arabian ). { Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), “Thoroughbred Breeding of the World”, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 } The stallion is believed to have been captured by Captain Robert Byerley at the Battle of Buda (1686), served as Byerley&apos;s war horse when he was dispatched to Ireland in 1689 during King William&apos;s War and saw further military service in the Battle of the Boyne. The General Stud Book simply states, without reference to his origins, that both man and horse were in Ireland: BYERLY TURK, was Captain Byerly&apos;s charger in Ireland, in King William&apos;s wars (1689, &amp; c.). { General Stud Book, Vol., I, p. 389 } The Byerly Turk was reportedly a dark brown horse with the strong oriental or Arabian features of large eyes, arched neck and high carriage of the tail. { Wentworth, Lady, “Thoroughbred Racing Stock”, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, London, 1960, Warne &amp; Co, London &amp; New York, 1960 } Many of his offspring were also noted to have been either bay or black. [ Stud record ] In 1696, Captain Robert Byerley married his cousin, Mary Wharton (sole heir to the estate of Goldsborough, near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire ), England and moved to live with his wife at her family home of Goldsborough Hall. After Byerley retired (as Colonel Byerley), the Byerley Turk retired to stud, first at Middridge Grange, then, from 1697, at Goldsborough Hall, near Knaresborough. { Thoroughbred Bloodlines - Byerley Turk Retrieved on 2009-8-19 } The Byerley Turk died there in 1706 and it is believed he is buried close to the Hall. Goldsborough Hall is now a private family home that offers accommodation, which includes the commemorative Byerley suite. { Goldsborough Hall history Retrieved on 2009-8-20 } The Byerly Turk was sire of Jigg, who in turn was sire of Partner, sire of Tartar who was the sire of the very good racehorse and influential sire, Herod (1738). The most famous of his racing offspring was Basto, but he also sired the Byerley Turk mare, founder of Thorougbred family 1; Bowes&apos; Byerley Turk mare, the &quot; Dam of the Two True Blues &quot;, the taproot of family 3; plus the Byerley Turk mare that was the taproot of family 41. { Thoroughbred Bloodlines - Family 41 Retrieved on 2009-8-20 } There are 12 Epsom Derby winners, 10 St. Leger winners, and 14 The Oaks Stakes winners listed in family 1 as descendants of the Byerly Turk. Relatively few modern Thoroughbreds trace their sire-line back to the Byerley Turk. The continuation of the male sire-line largely depends on the descendants of Ahonoora, several of whom are at stud in Europe.
