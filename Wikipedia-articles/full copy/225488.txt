[ Career ] In 1990, Carteris was cast in her best known role as studious school newspaper editor Andrea Zuckerman on Beverly Hills, 90210. At age 29, she was the oldest cast member to portray a 16-year-old. When the series first began, most of the characters were supposed to be in their junior year of high school. However, when the show became very popular, the writers later wrote that the characters were now sophomores, to get an extra year of high school plots in before they went to college. Carteris was only six years younger than James Eckhouse, who was cast on the show as Jim Walsh, the father of Brenda and Brandon Walsh, Andrea&apos;s contemporaries on the series. Carteris left the series in 1995 and became the host of her own television talk show, entitled Gabrielle, which lasted only one season. In 2003, she participated in the first season of the celebrity reality television show The Surreal Life. She later provided the voice of Elektra in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance. In March 2010, Carteris appeared in the 17th episode of Criminal Minds Season 5.
