The airport ceased operating in 2008 in the process of establishing Schönefeld as the sole commercial airport for Berlin. [ http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0%2C1518%2C550099%2C00.html Tempelhof Grounded / Voter Apathy Seals Berlin Airport&apos;s Fate Spiegel Online 04.28.2008 ] Tempelhof was designated as an airport by the Ministry of Transport on 8 October 1923. The old terminal was originally constructed in 1927. In anticipation of increasing air traffic, the Nazi government began a massive reconstruction in the mid-1930s. While it was occasionally cited as the world&apos;s oldest still operating commercial airport, the title was disputed by several other airports, and has in any case been moot since its closure. Tempelhof was one of Europe &apos;s three iconic pre- World War II airports, the others being London &apos;s now defunct Croydon Airport and the old Paris – Le Bourget Airport. One of the airport&apos;s most distinctive features is its large, canopy -style roof, which was able to accommodate most contemporary airliners during its heyday in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, thereby protecting passengers from the elements. Tempelhof Airport&apos;s main building was once among the top 20 largest buildings on earth; in contrast, it formerly had the world&apos;s smallest duty-free shop. { Airports International June 1975 (industry magazine) } Tempelhof Airport closed all operations on 30 October 2008, despite the efforts of some protesters to prevent the closure. { &apos;&apos;Crowds Bid Fond Farewell to Airport That Saved Berlin&apos;&apos;, New York Times, October 30, 2008 } A non-binding referendum was held on 27 April 2008 against the impending closure but failed due to low voter turnout. [ Overview ] Tempelhof was often called the &quot; City Airport &quot;. In its later years, it mostly had commuter flights to other parts of Germany and neighbouring countries; but it had in the past received long-haul, wide-bodied airliners, such as the Boeing 747, { Pan Am Boeing 747-121 (picture) } the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar { Lockheed L-1011 Tristar 1 demonstrator in BEA colours (picture) } and the Lockheed C-5A Galaxy. { USAF Lockheed C-5A Galaxy (picture) } The first of the former two first appeared at Tempelhof on 18 September 1976, when Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) flew in Boeing 747SP N534PA Clipper Great Republic to participate in the static exhibition of contemporary military, non-combat and civil aircraft at the annual &quot; Day of Open House &quot; of the United States Air Force (USAF) at the airport. The latter had its first appearance at Tempelhof on 17 September 1971, when an aircraft of the USAF&apos;s 436th Military Airlift Wing flew in from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, United States, to participate in that year&apos;s &quot; Day of Open House &quot; static exhibition. These events respectively marked the debut at Tempelhof of the largest aircraft in commercial airline service at the time and the then largest aircraft overall. { &apos;&apos;Cold War Times&apos;&apos;, Vol. 9, No. 1, p. 7, February 2009 } It had two parallel runways. Runway 9L/27R was 2,094 metres (6,870  ft) long and runway 9R/27L was 1,840 m (6,037  ft). Both were paved with asphalt. The taxiway was in the shape of an oval around these two runways, with a single terminal on the north side of the airport. Other possible uses for Tempelhof are being discussed, and many people are trying to keep the airport buildings preserved. [ Airlines and destinations ] The last airlines to fly regularly from/to Tempelhof were: [ Air Baltic Riga Air Berlin Seasonal:Antalya, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Palma de Mallorca Avitrans Växjö Brussels Airlines Brussels Cirrus Airlines Mannheim, Saarbrücken Condor Flugdienst Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Tenerife-South Seasonal:Antalya, Dalaman, Hurghada, Larnaca, Palma de Mallorca, Rhodes CSA Czech Airlines Chartered:Dublin, Manchester Germanwings Cologne/Bonn, Munich, Stuttgart, Zweibrücken Hamburg International Fuerteventura, Tenerife-South Seasonal:Antalya, Heraklion, Palma de Mallorca, Rhodes Chartered:London-Gatwick InterSky Friedrichshafen, Graz, Berlin-Tegel Lufthansa Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Mannheim, Munich, Saarbrücken ] The following air taxi operators had flown from/to Tempelhof: AAF Aviona Air Air Service Berlin (scheduled sightseeing flights using a historic raisin bomber Douglas DC-3 ) operated from Berlin-Schönefeld Airport starting November 2008 AIRSHIP Air Service Bizair Fluggesellschaft Business Air Charter Heli Unionair Jet Club Deutschland Chartermanagement Private Wings Rotorflug TAG Aviation Windrose Air [ History ] Adolf Hitler at Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin, 1932 The site of the airport was originally Knights Templar land in medieval Berlin, and from this beginning came the name Tempelhof. Later, the site was used as a parade field by Prussia n forces, and by unified German forces from 1720 to the start of World War I. In 1909, Frenchman Armand Zipfel made the first flight demonstration in Tempelhof, followed by Orville Wright later that same year. { &apos;&apos;U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission&apos;&apos; } Tempelhof was first officially designated as an airport on 8 October 1923. Deutsche Luft Hansa was founded in Tempelhof on 6 January 1926. The old terminal, originally constructed in 1927, became the world&apos;s first with an underground railway. The station has since been renamed Paradestraße, because the rebuilding of the airport in the 1930s required the airport access to be moved to a major intersection with a station now called Platz der Luftbrücke after the Berlin Airlift. As part of Albert Speer &apos;s plan for the reconstruction of Berlin during the Nazi era, Prof. Ernst Sagebiel was ordered to replace the old terminal with a new terminal building in 1934. The airport halls and the adjoining buildings, intended to become the gateway to Europe and a symbol of Hitler&apos;s &quot; world capital &quot; Germania, are still known as one of the largest built entities worldwide, and have been described by British architect Sir Norman Foster as &quot; the mother of all airports &quot;.With its façades of shell limestone, the terminal building, built between 1936 and 1941, forms a 1.2 kilometre long quadrant. Arriving passengers walked through customs controls to the reception hall. Tempelhof was served by the U6 U-Bahn line along Mehringdamm and up Friedrichstraße ( Platz der Luftbrücke station ). Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin had the advantage of a central location just minutes from the Berlin city centre and quickly became one of the world&apos;s busiest airports. Tempelhof saw its greatest pre-war days during 1938–1939, when more than 52 foreign and 40 domestic aircraft arrived and departed daily from the old terminal while the new one was still under construction. The air terminal was designed as headquarters for Deutsche Luft Hansa, the German national airline at that time. As a forerunner of today&apos;s modern airports, the building was designed with many unique features including giant arc-shaped hangars for aircraft parking. Although under construction for more than ten years, it was never finished because of World War II. The building complex was designed to resemble an eagle in flight with semicircular hangars forming the bird&apos;s spread wings. A mile-long hangar roof was to have been laid in tiers to form a stadium for spectators at air and ground demonstrations. [ World War II ] Weserwerke started war production in a new building for assembling Junkers Ju 87 &quot; Stuka &quot; dive bombers and later Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter planes in Tempelhof&apos;s underground tunnels. Aircraft engines were trucked to Tempelhof and joined to finished airframes. The airport is the hub of a &quot; hub and spoke &quot; arrangement of underground tunnels, and parts for the airplanes were brought from all parts of the city to the air base to be assembled and then flown out. Germany did not use Tempelhof as a military airfield during World War II, except for occasional emergency landings by fighter aircraft. Soviet forces took Tempelhof in the Battle of Berlin on 24 April 1945 in the closing days of the war in Europe following a fierce battle with Luftwaffe troops. Tempelhof&apos;s German commander, Colonel Rudolf Boettger, refused to carry out orders to blow up the base, choosing instead to kill himself. After he died, the Russian troops attempted to clear the five lower levels of the airbase, but the Germans had booby-trapped everything and many were killed, leading the Russian commander to order the lower levels to be flooded with water. The lower three levels are still flooded to this day, having never been opened up due to unexploded ordnance. [ May 2009 ] In accordance with the Yalta agreements, Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin was turned over to the United States Army 2nd Armored Division on 2 July 1945 by the Soviet Union as part of the American occupation zone of Berlin. This agreement was later formalised by the August 1945 Potsdam Agreement, which formally divided Berlin into four occupation zones. The 852nd Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived at Tempelhof (Code Number R-95 ) on 10 July 1945 and conducted the original repairs. [ Berlin Airlift ] [ Berlin Blockade ] { Platz der Luftbrücke in front of the airport, displaying the names of the 39 British and 31 American pilots who lost their lives during the operation, and symbolising the three air corridors. } { Douglas C-47 transport planes preparing to take off from Tempelhof during the } { Berlin Airlift, August 1948. } On 20 June 1948 Soviet authorities, claiming technical difficulties, halted all traffic by land and by water into or out of the western-controlled section of Berlin. The only remaining access routes into the city were three [ 20 mi km on ] -wide air corridor s across the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. { &apos;&apos;BEA in Berlin...&apos;&apos;, Air Transport..., Flight International, 10 August 1972, p. 181 } Faced with the choice of abandoning the city or attempting to supply its inhabitants with the necessities of life by air, the Western Powers chose the latter course, and for the next eleven months sustained the city&apos;s 2½ million residents in one of the greatest feats in aviation history. Operation Vittles, as the airlift was unofficially named, began on 26 June when USAF Douglas C-47 Skytrain s carried 80 tons of food into Tempelhof, far less than the estimated 4,500 tons of food, coal and other essential supplies needed daily to maintain a minimum level of existence. But this force was soon augmented by United States Navy and Royal Air Force cargo aircraft, as well as British European Airways (BEA) and some of Britain &apos;s fledgling wholly privately owned, independent airlines. { &apos;&apos;BEA in Berlin&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 10 August 1972, p. 180 } The latter included the late Sir Freddie Laker &apos;s Air Charter, Eagle Aviation { &apos;&apos; &quot; The Home Of Eagle &quot; &apos;&apos;... – Berlin Airlift commemorative stamp depicting Handley Page 61 Halifax 8 G-ALEF &apos;&apos;Red Eagle&apos;&apos; (c/n 1399) } and Skyways. On 15 October 1948, to promote increased safety and cooperation between the separate US and British airlift efforts, the Allies created a unified command – the Combined Airlift Task Force under Maj. Gen. William H. Tunner, USAF, was established at Tempelhof. To facilitate the command and control, as well as the unloading of aircraft, the USAF 53rd Troop Carrier Squadron was temporarily assigned to Tempelhof. { 1949 stamp from } { West Berlin with a } { Douglas C-54 Skymaster over Tempelhof airport } In addition to the airlift operations, American engineers constructed a new [ 6,000 ft m on ] runway at Tempelhof between July and September 1948 and another between September and October 1948 to accommodate the expanding requirements of the airlift. The last airlift transport touched down at Tempelhof on 30 September 1949. Tempelhof also became famous as the location of Operation Little Vittles: the dropping of candy to children living near the airport. The original Candy Bomber, Gail Halvorsen noticed children lingering near the fence line of the airport and wanted to share something with them. He eventually started dropping candy by parachute just before landing. His efforts were expanded by other pilots and eventually became a part of legend in the city of Berlin. [ Cold War ] [ West Berlin ] As the Cold War intensified in the late 1950s and 1960s, access problems to West Berlin, both by land and air, continued to cause tension. USAF aircraft were harassed as they flew in and out of the city. Throughout the Cold War years, Tempelhof was the main terminal for American military transport aircraft accessing West Berlin. In 1971 one of the pilots during the Berlin Airlift, and the original Candy Bomber, Gail Halvorsen, returned to Berlin as the commander of Tempelhof airbase. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the presence of American forces in Berlin ended. The USAF 7350th Air Base Group at Tempelhof was deactivated in June 1993. In July 1994, with President Clinton in attendance, the British, French, and American air and land forces in Berlin were deactivated in a ceremony on the Four Ring Parade field at Tempelhof in accordance with the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. The Western Allies returned a united city of Berlin to the unified German government. The U.S. Army closed its Berlin Army Aviation Detachment at TCA in August 1994, ending a 49-year American military presence in Berlin.

Following the end of the Berlin Blockade, AOA launched additional dedicated scheduled domestic services linking Tempelhof with Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel and Düsseldorf Lohausen from 6 March and 1 June 1950 respectively. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 4, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } On 25 September 1950, Pan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines. This merger resulted in Pan Am establishing a growing presence at Tempelhof. { Aviation News – Pan American World Airways: Part 2, Vol. 73, No. 11, p. 48, Key Publishing, Stamford, November 2011 } (In addition to continuing AOA&apos;s original, multistop Berlin – New York route and dedicated internal German services connecting Berlin with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf, between 1955 and 1959, Pan Am commenced regular, year-round scheduled services to Cologne, Stuttgart, Hanover, Munich and Nuremberg from Tempelhof. ) Pan Am&apos;s initial equipment for its new Berlin operation were unpressurise d, 60-seat Douglas DC-4 s as these were widely available at the time due to the large number of war-surplus C-54 Skymasters on the second-hand aircraft market. 1950 was also the year Air France joined Pan Am at Tempelhof. { Berlin Airport Company – Airline Portrait – Air France, March 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975 } Air France resumed operations to Tempelhof following their cessation during the war years. This was furthermore the time Allied restrictions on the carriage of local civilians on commercial airline services from/to West Berlin were lifted. It entailed transferring responsibility for processing all commercial flights to West Berlin&apos;s city government, including the operation and maintenance of associated passenger, cargo and mail handling facilities. These changes gave a major boost to West Berlin&apos;s fledgeling post-war scheduled air services. By mid-1951, BEA transferred its operations from Gatow to Tempelhof, thus concentrating all West Berlin air services at Berlin&apos;s iconic city centre airport. { Berlin Airport Company – Airline Portrait – British Airways, February 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975 } { Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 33, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 } From then on, several of the new, wholly privately owned UK independent { independent from } { government-owned corporation s } airlines and US supplemental { US non-scheduled airlines as classified by the } { United States Congress in 1963 } ( &quot; non-sked &quot; { US non-scheduled airlines prior to } { Congress &apos;s 1963 re-classification } ) carriers commenced regular air services to Tempelhof from the UK, the US and West Germany. These airlines initially carried members of the UK and US armed forces stationed in Berlin and their dependants as well as essential raw materials, finished goods manufactured in West Berlin and refugees from East Germany and Eastern Europe, who were still able to freely enter the city prior to the construction of the infamous Berlin Wall, on their flights. This operation was also known as the second Little Berlin Airlift. { The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 11 } One of these airlines, UK independent Dan-Air Services (operating as Dan-Air London), would subsequently play an important role in developing commercial air services from Tegel for a quarter century. { The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 9-11 } { &apos;&apos;Airline Profile: Number Forty-Three in the Series – Dan-Air&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 31 May 1973, p. 836 } During the early to mid-1950s, BEA lease d in aircraft that were bigger than its Tempelhof-based fleet of Pionair, Viking and Elizabethan piston -engined airliners from other operators to boost capacity, following a steady increase in the airline&apos;s passenger loads.

These aircraft&apos;s greater range and higher cruising speed enabled BEA to inaugurate a non-stop London Heathrow – Berlin Tempelhof service on 1 November 1965. For many years, this was the only non-stop international scheduled air service from Tempelhof. { until the launch in 1973 of daily, non-stop Berlin Tempelhof – } { Amsterdam Schiphol flights by Pan Am } On 19 November 1959, a Pan Am DC-4 became the first aircraft to operate a scheduled all-cargo service from West Berlin. This service linked Tempelhof with Rhein-Main Airport once-nightly, all year round. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 6, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } On 2 January 1960, Air France, which had served Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Nuremberg and its main base at Paris Le Bourget / Orly during the previous decade with DC-4, Sud-Est Languedoc and Lockheed Constellation piston-engined equipment, shifted its entire Berlin operation to Tegel because Tempelhof&apos;s runways were too short to permit the introduction of the Sud-Aviation Caravelle, the French flag carrier &apos;s new short-haul jet, with a viable payload. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 5, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } { &apos;&apos;The battle for Berlin&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 23 April 1988, pp. 19-21 } (Air France&apos;s Caravelle III s lacked thrust reverser s that would have permitted them to land safely on Tempelhof&apos;s short runways with a full commercial payload. { &apos;&apos;Commercial Aircraft Survey&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 23 November 1967, p. 871 } { Air France Sud SE-210 Caravelle III using brake chute while landing on wet runway at Berlin Tegel during 1964 (photo) } ) On 1 March 1960, Pan Am launched its second dedicated scheduled all-cargo flight from Berlin, linking Tempelhof with Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } 1960 was also the year Pan Am re-equipped its Tempelhof-based fleet with larger, pressurise d Douglas DC-6B propliner s. The first of these joined Pan Am&apos;s Berlin fleet on 27 June of that year. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 4, 5, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } Although the DC-6B was a less advanced aircraft than either the Viscount or the Caravelle, it was more economical. By the early 1960s, Pan Am had a fleet of 15 DC-6Bs stationed at its Tempelhof base, { Aeroplane – Tempelhof trials prelude to Pan Am 727 order, Vol. 108, No. 2773, p. 11, Temple Press, London, 10 December 1964 } { Aeroplane – Order Book continued, Pan Am 727s to serve Tempelhof, Vol. 109, No. 2788, p. 14, Temple Press, London, 25 March 1965 } which were configured in a higher-density seating arrangement than competing airlines&apos; aircraft. (Pan Am&apos;s DC-6Bs were originally configured in a 76-seat, all- economy layout. The subsequent introduction of subsidies for all scheduled internal German services from/to West Berlin resulted in steady network growth as well as service frequency and passenger load increases. To cope with the sharply higher traffic volumes, aircraft seat densities were increased twice – initially to 84 and subsequently 87 seats. ) This fleet eventually grew to 17 aircraft, which gave Pan Am the biggest aircraft fleet among the three main scheduled operators flying from West Berlin. It furthermore enabled it to compensate for the DC-6 &apos;s lack of sophistication with higher frequencies than its competitors, thereby attaining a higher market share (60%) and capturing a greater share of the lucrative business travel market than its rivals. During that period, Pan Am moreover achieved an industry-leading ultra short-haul load factor of 70% on its eight scheduled internal routes from Berlin, making the airline&apos;s Berlin routes the most profitable in its worldwide scheduled network. { &apos;&apos;Hot route in the Cold War&apos;&apos;, Friday, Jul. 03, 1964 } { &apos;&apos;Pan Am: Berlin balance&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 26 July 1973, pp. 124/5 } { Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 30, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 } Following the completion of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, the West German government introduced a route-specific subsidy of up to 20% for all internal German scheduled air services from and to West Berlin to help the airlines cope with the resulting falloff in traffic and maintain an economically viable operation on these lifeline routes. These came into effect on 1 March 1962 for all tickets sold in Germany, including Berlin. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 5, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } { &apos;&apos;Berlin subsidy cut opposed&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 2 October 1982, p. 971 } (To qualify for the subsidised rate under this system, the passenger was required to purchase a round-trip ticket for a scheduled internal German flight from/to West Berlin in Germany. Once he/she had checked-in at the airport, the airline collected a coupon attached to his/her ticket, which was subsequently handed in to the relevant German authorities for reimbursement. ) By the early 1960s, a number of UK independents and US supplementals began operating regular charter flight s from Tempelhof. These carried both inbound tourists from the US, the UK and other countries as well as local outbound tourists to the emerging holiday resorts in the Mediterranean. London Gatwick -based UK independent Overseas Aviation (CI) was among the first airlines the Allied Air Attachés in Bonn licensed to operate a series of regular charter flights from West Berlin. It used Vikings and Argonaut s on these services, which operated from Tempelhof under contract to the Berlin Senate and the city&apos;s Technical University as well as Berliner Flugring, a local package tour operator that began as a consortium of West Berlin travel agents arranging IT flights to holiday resorts in Europe. { &apos;&apos;Overseas Aviation (CI) in trouble&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 24 August 1961, p. 269 } { &apos;&apos;World Airlines Survey...&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 13 April 1961, p. 480 } { Berlin Airport Company, April 1968 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1968 } In 1964, US supplemental Saturn Airways began operating a comprehensive inclusive tour (IT) charter flight programme from Tempelhof under contract to local package holiday company Flug-Union Berlin, using Douglas DC-6A/C s and DC-7C s. { Aviation News — Saturn Airways, Vol. 74, No. 3, p. 49, Key Publishing, Stamford, March 2012 } { &apos;&apos;Detour via Schönefeld&apos;&apos; (translated article title), &apos;&apos;Aviation&apos;&apos; (translated section title), &apos;&apos;[[Der Spiegel ]&apos;&apos; vol. 29, 1971, 12 July 1971, p. 41] ) } { Saturn Airways Douglas DC-7C (photo) } On 2 December of that year, a Boeing 727-100 became the first jet aircraft to land at Tempelhof. Boeing had leased the aircraft to Pan Am for a special flight from Frankfurt to Berlin to demonstrate to the airline the 727 &apos;s ability to operate from Tempelhof&apos;s short runways. Pan Am indicated its intention to place an order for six 727s for its Berlin operation, as a result of the aircraft using only half the [ 5900 ft m on ] runway during landing. { &apos;&apos;A Jet into Berlin Tempelhof&apos;&apos;, Air Commerce..., Flight International, 17 December 1964, p. 1034 } { Aeroplane – The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, p. 15, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966 } 26 October 1965 marked British Aircraft Corporation &apos;s new One-Eleven jet&apos;s first arrival at Tempelhof when a British United 200 series operating a trooping flight under contract to the UK Ministry of Defence diverted from Gatow. { &apos;&apos;Berlin Tempelhof and the One-Eleven&apos;&apos; } { Aeroplane – Late News (Commercial), BAC One-Elevens are to take over trooping flights between the UK and Germany..., Vol. 110, No. 2815, p. 34, Temple Press, London, 30 September 1965 } 22 January 1966 marked the first appearance of a British trijet at Tempelhof when Hawker Siddeley flew in its HS 121 Trident { an improved version of the original } { Trident 1C BEA already operated, which lacked a } { short-field capability that would have made it suitable for the airline&apos;s Tempelhof operation } to demonstrate the aircraft to BEA. A week later, on 29 January, BEA began evaluating the BAC One-Eleven &apos;s suitability for its Berlin operations, with the start of a series of test flights conducted on its behalf by BAC &apos;s 400 series demonstrator. This included a number of takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof to test the aircraft&apos;s short-field performance. { Aeroplane – BEA Berlin services: new jet needed?, Vol. 111, No. 2834, p. 15, Temple Press, London, 10 February 1966 } On 18 March 1966, Pan Am became the first airline to commence regular, year-round jet operations from Tempelhof with the first examples of a brand-new fleet of an initial eight Boeing 727 100 series, one of the first jet aircraft with a short-field capability. { Aeroplane – Commercial continued, Pan Am 727s take over in Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2853, p. 11, Temple Press, London, 23 June 1966 } { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 4, 5, 6, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } { Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 34, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 } These aircraft were configured in a single class featuring 128 economy seats. Pan Am&apos;s move put BEA at a considerable competitive disadvantage, especially on the busy Berlin–Frankfurt route where the former out-competed the latter with both modern jet planes as well as a higher flight frequency. { One-Eleven 500 into service..., Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 742 } BEA responded to Pan Am&apos;s competitive threat by increasing the Berlin-based fleet to 13 Viscounts by winter 1966/7 to enable it to offer higher frequencies. { Aeroplane (Supplement: BEA&apos;s 20th anniversary) – BEA: German internals, Vol. 112, No. 2858, p. 42, Temple Press, London, 28 July 1966 } This also entailed re-configuring aircraft cabin s in a lower-density seating arrangement, as a result of which the refurbished cabins featured only 53, Comet -type first-class seats in a four-abreast layout instead of 66, five-abreast economy seats. In addition, BEA sought to differentiate itself from its main competitor by providing a superior in-flight catering standard. (BEA&apos;s Silver Star service included complimentary hot meals on all flights whereas Pan Am merely offered free on-board snacks. Sections of the local press dubbed the contrasting strategies of the two main protagonists plying the internal German routes from Berlin – estimated to be worth £ 15-20 million in annual revenues – the Dinner oder Düsen? (Dinner or Jet?) battle.) Henceforth, the airline marketed these services as Super Silver Star. { Aeroplane – The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, pp. 16/7, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966 } { Aeroplane – The Battle for Berlin: Round One a draw, Vol. 112, No. 2878, p. 4, Temple Press, London, 15 December 1966 } BEA furthermore responded by supplementing its Tempelhof-based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliner s from August 1968. Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof&apos;s short runways without payload restrictions, they were not suited to the airline&apos;s ultra short-haul operation from Berlin (average stage length: [ 230 mi km on ] ) given the high fuel consumption of the Comet, especially when operating at the mandatory [ 10,000 ft m on ] altitude inside the Allied air corridors. { &apos;&apos;En route with BEA&apos;&apos;, One-Eleven 500 into service..., Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 748 } { &apos;&apos;En route with BEA&apos;&apos;, One-Eleven 500 into service..., Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 749 } This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA&apos;s Berlin fleet was equipped with BAC One-Eleven 500 s. { the temporary use of } { Comet 4B s on BEA&apos;s Berlin routes enabled Viscount crews to undergo conversion training on the One-Eleven } The introduction of Pan Am&apos;s 727s to the Berlin market represented a major step change because of the aircraft&apos;s ability to carry more passengers than any other contemporary aircraft type used by scheduled carriers in the short-haul Berlin market, and its ability to take off from and land on Tempelhof&apos;s short runways with a full commercial payload as only light fuel loads were required on the short internal German services. Compared with BEA, Pan Am&apos;s 727s carried 20% more passengers than the British carrier&apos;s Comet 4Bs and up to 2½ times as many passengers as the latter&apos;s Viscounts (in Silver Star configuration). Within two years of Pan Am&apos;s introduction of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from/to West Berlin, its market share rose from 58% to 68%. Despite the huge increase in capacity over the DC-6B (128 vs. 87 seats), load factors dropped during the first year of operations only. (Pan Am&apos;s second year of jet operations from Tempelhof saw load factors steadying while the third saw a slight increase. { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 6, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } ) The lower seat density in BEA&apos;s re-configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies, superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am&apos;s new jets, which were laid out in a comparatively tight, [ 34 in cm on ] pitch seating configuration. This resulted in BEA&apos;s market share declining from 38% at the beginning of this period to 27% at its end. On the other hand, BEA&apos;s reduced capacity in the domestic air travel market between West Berlin and West Germany enabled it to attain higher load factors than its competitors. { Aeroplane – The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, p. 16, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966 } { Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 5-6, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 } (Air France, West Berlin&apos;s third scheduled carrier, which had suffered a continuous traffic decline ever since the transfer of Berlin operations to more distant Tegel at the beginning of 1960 due to Tempelhof&apos;s operational limitations that made it unsuitable for its Caravelles, { from a peak of 11% of all West Berlin scheduled air traffic prior to the move from Tempelhof } was worst affected by the equipment changes at the latter airport during the mid- to late 1960s. Over this period, the French airline&apos;s market share halved from 9% to less than 5% despite having withdrawn from Tegel–Düsseldorf in summer 1964 { Air France had already discontinued Berlin–Nuremberg services prior to its move to Tegel } and concentrated its limited resources on Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–Munich to maximise the competitive impact on the latter two routes. To reverse growing losses on its Berlin routes, Air France decided to withdraw from the internal German market entirely and instead enter into a joint venture with BEA. This arrangement entailed the latter taking over the former&apos;s two remaining German domestic routes to Frankfurt and Munich and operating these with its own aircraft and flightdeck crews from Tempelhof. The Air France-BEA joint venture became operational in spring 1969 and terminated in autumn 1972. { &apos;&apos;Berlin deal goes ahead&apos;&apos;, Air Transport..., Flight International, 3 October 1968, p. 520 } { &apos;&apos;Berlin Change&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 25 May 1972, p. 755 } { Berlin Airport Company, November 1972 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1972 } { &apos;&apos;British Airways Super One-Eleven Division – Internal German Services&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 1 August 1974, p. 104 } { &apos;&apos;The airline from Berlin&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 5 August 1989, p. 29 } ) On 1 September 1968, BEA began replacing its Berlin-based Viscounts with the new One-Eleven 500 s, which it called the Super One-Eleven. These aircraft featured a 97-seat, single-class configuration. { Flight International, 25 July 1968, p. 122 } { One-Eleven 500 into service..., Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 744/5 } { &apos;&apos;Bespoke for BEA&apos;&apos;, One-Eleven 500 into service..., Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 746 } 1968 was also the year all non-scheduled services, i.e. primarily the rapidly growing number of inclusive tour charter flights, were concentrated at Tegel to alleviate increasing congestion at Tempelhof and to make better use of Tegel, which was underutilised at the time. Commercial air traffic from/to Berlin Tempelhof peaked in 1971 at just above 5½ million passengers (out of a total of 6.12 million passengers for all West Berlin airports during that year { Tempelhof: 5,560,000; Tegel: 560,000 } ). This represented more than 90% of West Berlin&apos;s commercial air traffic and made its iconic city centre airport Germany&apos;s second-largest. { after Frankfurt, in terms of passengers handled per annum } With 3½ million passengers, Pan Am accounted for the bulk of this traffic while almost all of the remaining 2 million accrued to BEA. 1971 was also the year the latter&apos;s last Viscount departed Berlin. { &apos;&apos;Manchester gateway&apos;&apos;, Air Transport..., Flight International, 15 July 1971, p. 80 } { Berlin Airport Company, November 1971 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1971 } East Germany&apos;s relaxation of border controls affecting all surface transport modes between West Berlin and West Germany across its territory from 1972 onwards resulted in a decline of scheduled internal German air traffic from/to West Berlin. This was further compounded by the economic downturn in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The resulting fare increases that were intended to recover the airlines&apos; higher operating cost s caused by steeply rising jet fuel prices led to a further drop in demand. This in turn resulted in a major contraction of Pan Am&apos;s and BEA&apos;s/ British Airways &apos;s internal German operations, necessitating a reduction in both airlines&apos; Berlin-based fleets and workforces in an attempt to contain growing losses these once profitable routes generated by the mid-1970s. On 1 September 1975, Pan Am and British Airways moved their entire Berlin operation to the newly built terminal at Tegel Airport. Following Pan Am&apos;s and British Airways&apos;s move to Tegel, commercial operations at Tempelhof ceased, resulting in exclusive use by the US military. From 1978, Pan Am relocated its 727 flightdeck crew training from Miami International Airport to Berlin Tempelhof. This involved [re-]training all pilot s and flight engineer s who manned the flight decks of the airline&apos;s 727 fleet, which at the time operated out of Miami to the Caribbean and Central America, as well as on the IGS routes from Berlin and intra- Europe an feeder routes serving Frankfurt and Heathrow. { Berlin Airport Company – Summary of 1978 Annual Report, February 1979 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tegel Airport, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1979 } { Dix, Barry, &apos;&apos;Fly Past: Happy landings&apos;&apos;, Skyport Heathrow.co.uk, 14 April 2011 } Commercial operations restarted in 1981, when US- incorporated regional airline start-up Tempelhof Airways began a corporate shuttle between Tempelhof and Paderborn under contract to former German computer manufacturer Nixdorf whose main factories and offices were located in Paderborn and West Berlin respectively. Tempelhof Airways&apos;s initial equipment comprised Cessna Conquest and Piper Navajo executive aircraft. In 1985, the airline converted the Tempelhof–Paderborn corporate shuttle into a full-fledged scheduled service using a Nord 262 commuter turboprop. { &apos;&apos;Berlin&apos;s commuter market grows&apos;&apos;, Flight International, 2 April 1988, pp. 6, 8 } The end of the Cold War and German reunification opened Tempelhof for non-allied air traffic on 3 October 1990. US President Bill Clinton christened a new Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport plane (serial number 96-0006) the Spirit of Berlin at Tempelhof on 12 May 1998, to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949. Towards the end, commercial use was mostly in the form of small commuter aircraft flying regionally. Plans had been in place to shut down Tempelhof and Tegel, and make Schönefeld the sole commercial airport for Berlin. [ Closing down air traffic ] 100px 100px In 1996, the mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen, Brandenburg’s governor Manfred Stolpe and the federal transport minister Wissmann established the so-called “Consensus resolution”. The entire planning aimed at concentrating domestic and international air traffic in Berlin and Brandenburg at one airport: Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport. { Official public information brochure of the pros and cons of the referendum. } To ensure investment protection as well as to fend off opposition to Schönefeld International&apos;s expansion, it was mandated that first Tempelhof and then Tegel must be closed. On December 4, 2007, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany (Bundesverwaltungsgericht) made the final decision as court of last instance to close Tempelhof Airport. { Grünes Licht für Schließung des Flughafens Berlin-Tempelhof. Press release of the Federal Administrative Court of Germany, 4 Dec. 2007 (available at www.bundesverwaltungsgericht.de ) } [ Referendum against closing ] An initiative for a nonbinding referendum against the closure was held and failed, after the initial number of signatures required were collected. { Official public announcement of the call for support } According to the constitution of the state of Berlin, the number of supportive signatures that were required to be collected within four months in order to compel a referendum amounts to 7% of the population of Berlin entitled to vote, or 169,784. { Official page of the State of Berlin: see Article  63 (1), second sentence of the Berlin constitution; with regard to the figures, see the official referendum schedule, at the end of the page. } The four months period for the collection of signatures at the Berlin district townhalls ended on 14 February 2008. { Official referendum schedule, at A.  6. } 203,408 signatures were lodged. { Official information on the number of signatures lodged. } The referendum was held on 27 April 2008. { Official referendum schedule, at B.  2. } All eligible voters received an information brochure along with their notification. A majority of the votes was necessary to support the referendum, but this had to be at least one quarter of all eligible Berlin voters. { Official public information brochure of the pros and cons of the referendum } { Official press release on the referendum } The initiative for keeping Tempelhof open was supported by the ICAT (Interessengemeinschaft City-Airport Tempelhof) { ICAT Interessengemeinschaft City-Airport Tempelhof } along with a couple of opposition parties in the Berlin city parliament: the Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party citing primarily the need for an inner-city airport for business and private flyers as well as nostalgic reasons. Representatives from the ICAT suggested keeping the airport open just until Schönefeld Airport is completed in about 2012. The Berlin government insisted on the closure of the airport for legal, long-term economic, and environmental reasons, in particular to ensure the expansion of Schönefeld International. Environmental groups and the Green party supported them in this. Plans for the future would include for example an airlift museum in the old terminal building, commercial space for innovative businesses, new housing and industrial areas, sports facilities, and parks. Legally the decision in favour of closure at the end of October 2008 was irrevocable { BBI Press release: Berlin Airports welcome BBI decision by the Federal Constitutional Court on BBI } and the referendum was nonbinding. A subsequent reopening would have faced high legal barriers. However, some legal experts claimed there may be means to circumvent this. The referendum of 27 April 2008 failed. Although 60.2 % of the votes cast were for the initiative to keep the airport open, this was by only 21.7 % of the eligible voters; 25 % had been required. Support had been highest in western districts of Berlin (up to 80 %), but opposition (i.e. only 30 % approval) and disinterest was prevalent in eastern districts. Voter turnout of 36 % was low. { Official results of the referendum published by the municipal election supervisor } Air traffic at Tempelhof Airport thus ceased for good on 30 October and the expansion of Schönefeld Airport can continue unhindered. The official licence expired in mid-December. A “Goodbye Tempelhof” gala was held at Tempelhof airport for eight hundred invited guests in the last hours of 30 October. Meanwhile, protesters against the closing held a candle vigil in front on the Platz der Lufbrücke. The last commercial flight was a Cirrus Airlines Dornier 328 that departed at 22:17 towards Mannheim. { Klaus Kurpjuweit and Jan Oberländer, &quot; Ende der Legende &quot;, } { Der Tagesspiegel 31 October 2008 } “Time to say goodbye” was sung to the spectators on the tarmac at the conclusion. At precisely four and a half minutes before midnight, the last two airplanes – a historical Junkers Ju 52 and an airlift “ raisin bomber ” Douglas DC-3 – took off in parallel, waved their wings, and flew off south-east to Schönefeld airport. The runway and air field lights were switched off at midnight. Three Antonov An-2 airplanes flying under VFR were left stranded at the airport, as weather conditions prevented them from taking off on 30 October. They were allowed to take off on 24 November 2008, making them the last takeoffs from the airport. { &quot; Abflug in die Geschichtsbücher &quot;, Tagesspiegel Nov 25 2008 } [ Post-airport usage ] Former Tempelhof Airport in 2012 Tempelhof has been used since closing to host numerous fairs and events. The first major events included the BREAD &amp; BUTTER fashion tradeshow in July { BREAD &amp; BUTTER BERLIN Airport Berlin-Tempelhof } { SPIEGEL ONLINE International } and the Berlin Festival 2009 concert in August. { Berlin Festival 2009 website } It also hosts the Berlin Marathon fair in September, which is the main event preparation to runners. Fairs are held in the hangar. In September 2010, Tempelhof hosted the Popkomm, international world’s music and entertainment business meeting place and was one of the most important location of the first Berlin Music Week. In August 2009, Berlin city officials announced that Tempelhof would be opened in May 2010 as a city park. The city will spend an estimated €60 million on developing the park from 2010 to 2017. { &quot; Tempelhof to become enormous city park &quot;, [[The Local ], August 31, 2009] } On the weekend of 8/9 May 2010, the outfield was festively opened as Berlin&apos;s largest public park named &quot; Tempelhofer Feld &quot;. More than 200,000 Berliners visited the park to enjoy its wide open spaces for recreation ranging from biking and skating to baseball and kiting. { Article and photos &quot; Riesiger Andrang auf dem Flugfeld Tempelhof &quot; } { Berliner Morgenpost, 10 May 2010 } { &quot; Flughafen Tempelhof: Die neue Rollbahn &quot; flughafentempelhof.com, 9 May 2010 } { &quot; Tempelhof Kiteflyers Meeting 2010 am 9. Mai 2010 &quot; Flying Blog, May 2010, in German and English } The opening ceremonies were slightly marred by some protesters unhappy about the fence that closes off the park during the night. { &quot; Whistles for Wowereit at Tempelhof park opening &quot;, The Local, 8 May 2009 } Entrance is free and park hours are from 6 a.m. until sunset.The grounds are maintained by Grün Berlin, { Grün Berlin&apos;s Tempelhofer Feld Project } a company that also looks after several other gated parks in Berlin. The Tempelhof fields will be used as a park indefinitely. This is manifested for instance by plans to host the 2017 IGA, Germany’s world horticultural exhibition. { &quot; DBG elects Berlin as host for the 2017 IGA &quot; FloraCulture International, 20 November 2009 } About 80% of the former airfield was an important habitat for several redlisted birds, plants and insects. { &quot; Ein Lebensraum für Flora und Fauna &quot; } Usage of the park is restricted to limit disturbance of some of these habitats. [ Accidents and incidents ] On 29 April 1952, an Air France Douglas C-54A (registration F-BELI) operating a scheduled service from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport to Berlin Tempelhof came under sustained attack from two Soviet MiG 15 fighters while passing through one of the Allied air corridors over East Germany. Although the attack had severely damaged the plane, necessitating the shutdown of engines number three and four, the pilot in command of the aircraft managed to carry out a safe emergency landing at Tempelhof Airport. A subsequent inspection of the aircraft&apos;s damage at Tempelhof revealed that it had been hit by 89 shots fired from the Soviet MiGs during the preceding air attack. There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, 11 passengers) despite the severity of the attack. The Soviet military authorities defended this attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft by claiming the Air France plane was outside the air corridor at the time of attack. { ASN Aircraft accident description Douglas C-54A-DO F-BELI – near Berlin, Germany } On 19 January 1953, a Silver City Airways Bristol 170 Freighter Mark 21 (registration: G-AICM) operating a non-scheduled cargo flight from West Berlin crash-land ed near Tempelhof Airport as a result of fuel starvation when bad weather at the destination forced it to return to Berlin. Although the accident damaged the aircraft beyond repair, both pilots survived. { ASN Aircraft accident description Bristol 170 Freighter Mark 21 G-AICM – near Berlin Tempelhof, Germany } In 1978, LOT Polish Airlines flight 165 was hijacked and forced to land at Tempelhof. The US military authorities who were in charge of Tempelhof during the Cold War era arrested the East German hijacker on arrival. Following the hijacker&apos;s arrest, the US authorities returned the aircraft, its crew and those passengers who wished to resume their journey to Poland. { &apos;&apos;LOT Tu-134 hijacker faces trial in US court&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 9 September 1978, p. 934 } In 1981, a LOT Polish Airlines Antonov AN-24 operating an internal scheduled service from Katowice to Gdańsk was hijacked en route and forced to land at Tempelhof. Bernard Pietka, the hijacker, was on military service while taking over the aircraft. He was armed with a grenade and a single-shot pistol. The US military authorities arrested the hijacker on arrival and handed him over to the local police. At that time, he was expected to be sentenced to a five-year prison term under West German law. Following the hijacker&apos;s arrest, the US authorities released the aircraft, its crew and all 50 passengers to resume their flight to Gdańsk. { &apos;&apos;Short hauls...&apos;&apos;, Air Transport, Flight International, 29 August 1981, p. 609 } On 26 June 2010, a private Socata TB 10 Tobago had to perform an emergency landing on the now closed Tempelhof Airport due to engine failure. It was on a sightseeing flight and the pilot was looking for a free space to land safely. The aircraft was occupied by the pilot and three passengers and had taken off from Tegel Airport. Upon consultation with air traffic control in Schönefeld, it was agreed to land on a Tempelhof runway. No one was injured during the emergency landing as the visitors of the now Tempelhofer Park scurried aside to make room for the TB 10, which came to a halt after a very short distance. { Jörn Hasselmann, Pilot: &quot; Ich hatte Befürchtungen, dass ich nicht bis Tempelhof komme &quot;, Tagesspiegel 26 June 2010 ( &quot; I feared, I wouldn&apos;t reach Tempelhof &quot; ) } Four days later, the Socata TB 10 Tobago was transported – with wings removed – by lorry back to Tegel airport. The Senate of Berlin now intends to prohibit sightseeing flights over Berlin by single-engine planes for safety reasons. { &quot; Tempelhof-Maschine hat Flugfeld verlassen &quot;, Berliner Morgenpost 1 July 2010 &quot; Tempelhof plane has left airfield &quot; with pictures } It has been reported that the pilot had forgotten to switch over to the second fuel tank. { Notlandung: Pilot hatte Tankschalter vergessen, Berliner Morgenpost 2 July 2010, at Die Wahrheit über Berlin-Tempelhof &quot; Pilot forgot tank switch &quot; } [ In popular culture ] Templehof was shown in the History Channel series Life After People, depicting it as an area already devoid of human activity.
