Germplasm Resources Information Network United States Department of Agriculture 2007-10-05 2010-09-21 ] Scaevola is a genus of flowering plant s in the Goodenia family, Goodeniaceae. It consists of more than 130 tropical species, with the center of diversity being Australia and Polynesia, including Hawaii. Common names for Scaevola species include scaevolas, fan-flowers, half-flowers, and naupaka, the plant&apos;s Hawaiian name. The flower s are shaped as if they have been cut in half. Consequently, the generic name means &quot; left-handed &quot; in Latin. Many legend s have been told to explain the formation of the naupaka&apos;s unique half flowers. In one version a woman tears the flower in half after a quarrel with her lover. The Gods, angered, turn all naupaka flowers into half flowers and the two lovers remained separated while the man is destined to search in vain for another whole flower.

In at least six separate dispersals, about 40 species have spread throughout the Pacific Basin, with a few reaching the tropical coasts of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean s. The Hawaiian Islands are home to ten Scaevola species, nine of which are endemic. [ http://www.hawaiioirc.org/OIRC-SPECIES-PLANTS.htm Selected Plants Found on Hawaii&apos;s Offshore Islets Offshore Islet Restoration Committee ] Eight of the indigenous species are the result of a single colonization event. Scaevola glabra and Scaevola taccada arrived separately to produce a total of three colonizations of Hawaii by Scaevola. Some of the endemic species are of hybrid origin. [ Dianella G.

Beachberry or Inkberry ( Scaevola plumieri ) is widespread along the Atlantic coast of the tropical Americas and Africa; however, it is becoming rarer in areas where S. taccada is displacing native coastal plants. Most Australian Scaevola have dry fruit s and sprawling, herbaceous to shrub by habits. By contrast, nearly all species outside Australia have shrub habits with fleshy fruit making dispersal by frugivore s easy. The plant pathogen ic sac fungus Mycosphaerella scaevolae was discovered on a Scaevola fan-flower.
