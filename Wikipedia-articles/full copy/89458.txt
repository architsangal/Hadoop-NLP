An obituary in the Daily Telegraph described her as &quot; one of the most enchanting, accomplished and intelligent leading ladies on the post-war British stage. With her husky voice, deep brown eyes, wistful smile and sense of humour, she brought an enduring charm to all kinds of stage drama, ancient and modern, as well as to films and television plays in a career that spanned more than 40 years. &quot; { Daily Telegraph obituary – see External link } [ Biography ] Dorothy Tutin was born in London on 8 April 1930, daughter of John Tutin and his wife Adie Evelyn (Fryers), a couple who married the following year. Her year of birth was sometimes given as 1931, said to disguise the circumstances of her birth, but certainly not by herself. She was educated at St Catherine&apos;s School, Bramley, Surrey and studied for the stage at PARADA { Preparatory Academy to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, as listed by Tutin in her first biographical entry for Who&apos;s Who in the Theatre in 1957 } and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tutin was also a talented pianist, but chose acting rather than music as her vocation. She married the actor Derek Waring, and they had two children, Nicholas and Amanda, both of whom also became actors. Dorothy Tutin and Derek Waring remained married until her death in 2001 at the age of 71 from leukaemia. Waring died in 2007. Tutin was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1967, and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in 2000.
