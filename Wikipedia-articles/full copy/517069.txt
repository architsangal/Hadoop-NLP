The district includes most of southwestern Houston, including most of that city&apos;s share of Fort Bend County. It also includes most of Missouri City. [ Early life and career ] Green was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended FAMU and transferred to Tuskegee University, from which he earned a bachelor&apos;s degree. He later went on to receive his Juris Doctor in 1974 from Texas Southern University. After receiving his law degree and being admitted to the Texas Bar, he remained in Houston and currently lives in the Alief community. In 1978, Green was elected Justice of the Peace in Harris County, Texas in the Precinct 7, Place Two position. He held this position for 26 years. A former trial lawyer, Green co-founded the firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He also served as president of the Houston NAACP and, during his term as the organization&apos;s leader, membership increased sevenfold. While serving as NAACP leader, he focused on increasing minority hiring in Texas and forming alliances with Hispanic groups. Green is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

The fraternity has helped shape more than 175,000 young men into extraordinary leaders who contribute positively to their communities and the world. ] [ Political career ] While still serving as a Justice of the Peace, Green ran for mayor of Houston in 1981, finishing a distant fifth in the primary. In 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th District. The district had previously been the 25th, represented by freshman Democrat Chris Bell. However, Bell was placed in significant jeopardy as a result of the 2003 Texas redistricting. Although the district was heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger number of blacks and Latinos than its predecessor. The old 25th had been 65 percent white, while the new 9th was 17 percent white, 37 percent black and 33 percent Latino. This left Bell vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat, and prompted him to file an ethics challenge against Tom DeLay. In the March 9 primary, Green crushed Bell with 66 percent of the vote to Bell&apos;s 31 percent. He trounced Republican Annette Molina in November. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian in 2008. This is not surprising given this district&apos;s partisan tilt; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+22, it is the second-most Democratic district in Houston. While in Congress, Green has focused on issues similar to those that he worked for while with the NAACP. Fair housing and hiring practices for the poor and minorities are some of his greatest concerns. [ Political Positions ] Green is a supporter of the Federal Reserve &apos;s program of quantitative easing and claims that it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2008.
