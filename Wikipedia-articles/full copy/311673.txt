Today, Coil remains one of the most influential and best known industrial music groups. The group&apos;s first official release as Coil was a 1984 12 &quot; titled How to Destroy Angels released on the Belgian Les Disque de Crepuscule&apos;s sublabel LAYLAH Antirecords. Following the 12 &quot; s success, Coil produced a series of three albums, Scatology, Horse Rotorvator and Love&apos;s Secret Domain, which met with little commercial success, but were praised as innovative due to their blend of industrial music and acid house.

In 1999 the group gave their first live performance in sixteen years, and began a series of mini-tours which would last until 2004. [ http://www.brainwashed.com/coil/live/ Live Archive brainwashed.com(2004) 2007-02-12 ] Following the death of John Balance on 13 November 2004, Peter Christopherson announced via their official record label website Threshold House that Coil as an entity had ceased to exist. [ Beginning (1982–1984) ] Coil was formed in 1982 following Christopherson&apos;s departure from Psychic TV. Balance and Christopherson began working with John Gosling on the project Zos Kia, which resulted in four live performances and the 1984 cassette tape Transparent. Following Gosling&apos;s departure Balance and Christopherson teamed up with Boyd Rice, and under the alias Sickness of Snakes released the split album Nightmare Culture with the experimental group Current 93. While working on their first official release, 1984&apos;s 12 &quot; How to Destroy Angels, the group settled on the name Coil. According to the sleeve notes, the single track LP is &quot; ritual music for the accumulation of male sexual energy &quot; and was produced under a variety of technological, spiritual, and meteorological conditions which the band felt to be magick ally significant. Since its initial release, Transparent has been reissued in CD format, while How to Destroy Angels has been remixed by Nurse with Wound &apos;s Steven Stapleton and released on a full length CD. Tracks from Nightmare Culture have featured on the group&apos;s Unnatural History compilation series. [ Scatology, Horse Rotorvator, and Love&apos;s Secret Domain (1984–1992) ] Following the underground hit How to Destroy Angels, Coil left L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords for Some Bizzare and produced Scatology, released in 1984 as their first full length studio album. The album was largely based on the sound of industrial music as well as the Post-punk movement. While songs such as &quot; Restless Day &quot;, &quot; Panic &quot; and &quot; Tainted Love &quot; are representative of a mainstream style, other tracks preview what would become Coil&apos;s unique electronic style. The single Panic/Tainted Love became the first AIDS benefit music release, as the profits from sales of the single were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust.

Although songs such as &quot; The Anal Staircase &quot; and &quot; Circles of Mania &quot; sound like evolved versions of Scatology material, the album is characterized by slower tempos, and represented a new direction for the group. The album has a darker theme than previous releases; according to Balance, &quot; Horse Rotorvator was this vision I&apos;d had of this mechanical/flesh thing that ploughed up the earth and I really did have a vision of it —a real horrible, burning, dripping, jaw-like vision in the night...The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse killed their horses and use their jawbones to make this huge earth-moving machine. &quot; [ http://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/175/?show%3Dfull#print_description Keenan, David David Keenan Time Out Of Joint The Wire September 1998 April 19, 2010 ] The artwork features a photograph of the location of a notorious IRA bombing, in which a bomb was detonated on a military orchestra pavilion.

Love&apos;s Secret Domain (abbreviated LSD) followed in 1991 as the next &quot; proper &quot; Coil album, although a few minor releases had been produced since Horse Rotorvator. LSD represents a progression in Coil&apos;s style and became a template for what would be representative of newer waves of post-industrial music, blended with their own style of acid house. Although the album was more upbeat, it was not intended as a dance record, as Christopherson explained &quot; I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a party atmosphere, but it&apos;s more positive. &quot; [ http://brainwashed.com/common/sounds/mp3/coil-interview-vpro_radio-la_stampa_i_v-1991_04_17.mp3 La Stampa VPRO(1991 April 17) 2007-01-06 ] &quot; Windowpane &quot; and a Jack Dangers remix of &quot; The Snow &quot; were released as singles, both of which had music videos directed by Christopherson. The video for &quot; Windowpane &quot; was shot in the Golden Triangle, where, Balance claimed, &quot; the original Thai and Burmese drug barons used to exchange opium for gold bars with the CIA. &quot; Christopherson recalled &quot; John [Balance] discovered while he was performing that where he was standing was quicksand! In the video you can actually see him getting deeper and deeper. &quot; Furthermore, Thai friends of the group commented that they had known of several people that died where Coil had shot footage for the music video. A music video for the song &quot; Love&apos;s Secret Domain &quot; was also shot and is currently unreleased and unaired due to its nature: as Christopherson explained, &quot; We shot &apos;Love&apos;s Secret Domain&apos; in a go-go boy bar in Bangkok; with John [Balance] performing on stage with about 20 or 30 dancing boys, which probably won&apos;t get played on MTV, in fact! &quot; Stolen &amp; Contaminated Songs followed as a full length release. However, as with Gold Is the Metal..., it is a collection of outtakes and demos from the LSD era. [ Soundtracks and side projects (1993–1998) ] Coil separated their works into many side project s, publishing music under different names and a variety of styles. The pre-Coil aliases, Zos Kia and Sickness of Snakes, formed the foundation of a style that would evolve to characterize their initial wave of releases. Before embarking on their second wave of side projects and pseudonyms, Coil created a soundtrack for the movie Hellraiser, although they withdrew from the project when they suspected their music would not be used. { Dickie, Tony. &quot; Compulsion &quot;. brainwashed.com, Winter 1992. Retrieved on 23 February 2007. } Furthermore, Coil claimed inspiration for Pinhead was partly drawn from the piercing magazines director Clive Barker borrowed from the group. Beginning in 1993, Coil contributed music to two of Derek Jarman &apos;s films, Blue and The Angelic Conversation. In addition, they recorded soundtracks for the documentary Gay Man&apos;s Guide to Safer Sex as well as Sarah Dales Sensuous Massage, though both remain unreleased. [ http://brainwashed.com/coil/writings/compulsion.html Dickie, Tony Compulsion Compulsion Winter 1992 April 20, 2010 ] Much like the pre-Coil aliases, Coil&apos;s wave of side projects represent a sort of primordial soup from which the group evolved a different style of sound. While Nasa Arab —credited to the group&apos;s project &quot; The Eskaton &quot; —was Coil&apos;s farewell to the acid house genre, the following projects, ELpH, Black Light District, and Time Machines, were all based heavily on experimentation with drone, an ingredient which would define Coil&apos;s following work. These releases also kicked off the start of Coil&apos;s new label Eskaton. [ Late Coil (1998–2004) ] After the wave of experimental side projects, Coil&apos;s sound was completely redefined. Before releasing new material, the group released the compilations Unnatural History II, Windowpane &amp; The Snow and Unnatural History III. In March 1998, Coil began to release a series of four singles which were timed to coincide with the equinox and solstice s of that year. The singles are characterized by slow, drone-like instrumental rhythms, and electronic or orchestral instrumentation.

The second single, Summer Solstice: Bee Stings, also featured performances by Breeze, and also included the industrial - noise song &quot; A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz) &quot;, which was dedicated to a friend of Balance and Christopherson&apos;s who had committed suicide earlier that year. [ http://brainwashed.com/coil/news/news1998.html Coil News 1998 Brainwashed.com(1998) 2007-01-04 ] The third single, Autumn Equinox: Amethyst Deceivers includes the track &quot; Rosa Decidua &quot; which features vocals by Rose McDowall. The single also features the song &quot; Amethyst Deceivers &quot;, later reworked and performed throughout most of Coil&apos;s tour, and eventually re-made into an alternate version on the LP The Ape of Naples. The fourth single, Winter Solstice: North, also includes a track sung by Rose McDowall, and is partially credited to the side project Rosa Mundi. The series would later be re-released as the double- CD set Moon&apos;s Milk (In Four Phases). Astral Disaster was created with the assistance from new band member Thighpaulsandra and released in January 1999 via Sun Dial member Gary Ramon&apos;s label Prescription.

Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 1 followed in September 1999 and a few months later Coil performed their first concert in 16 years. Queens Of The Circulating Library followed in April 2000, with production credit given to Thighpaulsandra. The single track, full length drone album is the only Coil release without the assistance of Christopherson. Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2 followed in September 2000 and Coil began to perform live heavily, writing the music for Black Antlers in between a series of mini-tours.

Constant Shallowness Leads To Evil, a noise -driven experimental album reminiscent of Christopherson&apos;s work with Throbbing Gristle, was first sold at a live performance in September 2000. Coil finally released Black Antlers in June 2004. In contrast to many of their earlier releases, Coil&apos;s later material is characterized by a slower sound which relies more on drone than acid house. This change in sound was reflected in their live performances, as songs like &quot; Ostia &quot; and &quot; Slur &quot; were slowed down from their original pace as well as re-recordings of &quot; Teenage Lightning &quot; and &quot; Amethyst Deceivers &quot; which were later released on The Ape Of Naples.

The first live shows took place in 1983, but after only four performances, fifteen years would pass before they would play live again. Coil performed twice at the Royal Festival Hall in 1998 (as part of a weekend curated by Julian Cope) when they first performed as the full band line-up - and the first time for the &quot; fluffy suits &quot; - the show was called &apos;Time Machines&apos; at that point - then again in 2000 as part of the &quot; Outro &quot; week I curated for my departure from the South Bank - that time sharing a bill with Jim Thirlwell (as Foetus ). Both performances were full sets. On 14 December 1999 Coil performed elph.zwölf at Volksbuehne in Berlin. Although the performance lasted just under eighteen minutes, it marked the beginning of a new era of live performances. Coil would go on to perform close to fifty additional concerts, with varied set list s as well as performers. Coil&apos;s performances were surrealistic visually and audibly. Balance, Christopherson, Thighpaulsandra and Ossian Brown were known to dress in fluffy suits; an idea inspired by Sun Ra. [ Coil Coil Dungan, Myles.

Video screens projected footage and animations created by Christopherson, while fog machines created a thick eerie atmosphere. Balance would often screech and howl during performances, which would add to the effect. John Balance&apos;s problem with alcohol would often reflect the way in which the Coil performances were carried out. His drinking problem became so well known that during the 2003 All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties performance a fan asked if there is any &quot; blood in his alcohol &quot;, a reference to the Coil song &quot; Heartworms &quot;. Balance replied that there is no &quot; alcohol in my blood at the moment &quot;, later adding &quot; I&apos;ve got horse tranquillizer for later &quot;. The performance, including the dialogue, was released on...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms. Many Coil performances were released, including the widely available releases of Live Four, Live Three, Live Two, Live One and...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms, as well as several very limited editions such as Selvaggina, Go Back Into The Woods and Megalithomania!.

Threshold House 2005 2007-03-02 http://www.thresholdhouse.com/departures.html ] On 25 November 2004 Christopherson announced he was in agreement with Balance&apos;s partner, Ian Johnstone, that any releases, either as Coil or solo work that Balance was working on at the time of his death, would be put on hold. They decided that time was needed to mourn Balance&apos;s passing, recuperate from the loss, and assess the quality of the unreleased work. It was also decided that existing video, audio and other works that were in various states of completion at the time of Balance&apos;s death would eventually be released under the name Coil, and all other planned appearances and releases would be canceled. The already-planned live album...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms was released in April 2005, the name having been chosen by Balance before his death. Several tribute albums were released in memory of Balance including the compilations Full Cold Moon, The Loneliest Link In A Very Strange Chain (which had been started before Balance passed and was originally due to be called &quot; Never &quot;, but switched titles after the tragic event), Coilectif: In memory ov John Balance and homage to Coil,...It Just Is and X-Rated: The Dark Files. The album How He Loved The Moon (Moonsongs For Jhonn Balance) by Balance collaborator David Tibet was released under his group Current 93. A live album by Throbbing Gristle was also dedicated to Balance. On 23 December 2005, a memorial concert was held for Balance. Performers included Christopherson&apos;s new solo effort The Threshold HouseBoy&apos;s Choir, Alec Empire and CoH. The final studio album, The Ape of Naples, saw release on 2 December 2005. In August 2006 the rare CD-R releases The Remote Viewer and Black Antlers were &quot; sympathetically remastered &quot; and expanded into two disc versions, which included new and recently remixed material.

Some notable artists who appeared on these albums are Alec Empire, Chris Connelly and K.K. Null (see...It Just Is ). Nine Inch Nails front man Trent Reznor has also expressed his influence by the group.

It is possible that Trent Reznor named the track as a reference to Coil, since Coil also provided remixes for Further Down the Spiral.Furthermore, in 2010, Reznor, Mariqueen Maandig and Atticus Ross started a new band called How To Destroy Angels, the same title as Coil&apos;s first single.
