[ September 2009 ] Sacred geometry is the geometry used in the planning and construction of religious structures such as churches, temple s, mosque s, religious monuments, altar s, tabernacles; as well as for sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred grove s, village green s and holy well s, and the creation of religious art. In sacred geometry, symbolic and sacred meanings are ascribed to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. According to Paul Calter: { dartmouth.edu: Paul Calter, &apos;&apos;Polygons, Tilings, &amp; Sacred Geometry&apos;&apos; } [ In the ancient world certain numbers had symbolic meaning, aside from their ordinary use for counting or calculating... plane figures, the polygons, triangles, squares, hexagons, and so forth, were related to the numbers (three and the triangle, for example), were thought of in a similar way, and in fact, carried even more emotional value than the numbers themselves, because they were visual. ] [ As worldview and cosmology ] The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing &quot; Plato said God geometrizes continually &quot; (Convivialium disputationum, liber 8,2). In modern times the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss adapted this quote, saying &quot; God arithmetizes. &quot; { Cathérine Goldstein, Norbert Schappacher, Joachim Schwermer, The shaping of arithmetic, p235. } At least as late as Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), a belief in the geometric underpinnings of the cosmos persisted among scientists. See also Kepler conjecture, Mysterium Cosmographicum, Pythagoreanism { Platonic solid model of planetary spacing in the } { Solar system from &apos;&apos;Mysterium Cosmographicum&apos;&apos; (1596). } [ Natural forms ] According to Stephen Skinner, the study of sacred geometry has its roots in the study of nature, and the mathematical principles at work therein [ Skinner Stephen Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code Sterling 2009 978-1-4027-6582-7 ]. Many forms observed in nature can be related to geometry, for example, the chambered nautilus grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a logarithmic spiral to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, honeybee s construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey. These and other correspondences are seen by believers in sacred geometry to be further proof of the cosmic significance of geometric forms. These phenomena can be explained through natural principles. { Ivars Peterson, &apos;&apos;The Honeycomb Conjecture&apos;&apos; } [ Art and architecture ] Geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the design of Egyptian, ancient Indian, Greek and Roman architecture. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and fortification s on design plans of mandala and yantra. Many of the sacred geometry principles of the human body and of ancient architecture have been compiled into the Vitruvian Man drawing by Leonardo Da Vinci, itself based on the much older writings of the roman architect Vitruvius. [ Unanchored geometry ] Stephen Skinner suggests that it is possible to place a geometric diagram over virtually any image of a natural object or human created structure, and find some lines intersecting the image. If the geometric diagram does not intersect major physical points in the image, the result is what Skinner calls &quot; unanchored geometry. &quot; { Stephen Skinner, &apos;&apos;Sacred geometry: deciphering the code&apos;&apos;, p91 } [ Music ] Pythagoras is often credited for discovering that an oscillating string stopped halfway along its length produces an octave relative to the string&apos;s fundamental, while a ratio of 2:3 produces a perfect fifth and 3:4 produces a perfect fourth. However the Chinese already had instruments that were thousands of years older, such as the Guqin that also feature these tonal scales. Pythagoreans believed that these harmonic ratios gave music powers of healing which could &quot; harmonize &quot; an out-of-balance body [ February 2012 ].
