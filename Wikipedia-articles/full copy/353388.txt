He was born in Leeds. Stross specialises in hard science fiction and space opera. His contemporaries include Alastair Reynolds, Ken MacLeod, Liz Williams, Neal Asher and Richard Morgan. Between 1994 and 2004, he was also an active writer for the magazine Computer Shopper and was responsible for the monthly Linux column. Due to time constraints, he eventually had to stop writing for Computer Shopper so that he could devote more time to his novel-related works. As a consequence, he published all his articles on the Internet.

Martin &apos;s book, Dying of the Light ), githzerai, and slaad (a chaotic race notable for their rigid caste system ) were later published in the Fiend Folio monster compendium.
