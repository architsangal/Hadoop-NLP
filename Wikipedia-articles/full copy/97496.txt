It was nearby present day Bergman. Heavy rains flooded the town in 1883, which was a major factor in its decline by 1892. In the 1880s, both Lead Hill and Elixir were expecting a railroad but none materialized. This also helped the town&apos;s decline. Although the town is gone, the township of Elixir remains and currently contains Bergman.
