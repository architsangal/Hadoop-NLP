(NCL) was a controversial front company founded in Minnesota, United States in 1920 as a modest local transport company operating two buses which was reorganized into a holding company in 1936 with equity funding from General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum for the express purpose of acquiring local transit system s throughout the United States in what became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal.

In 1936, GM formed National City Lines and aggressively began to buy transit companies and substitute diesel buses for streetcars. ] The company formed a subsidiary, Pacific City Lines in 1937 to purchase streetcar systems in the western United States. [ http://www.streetcarcon.com/gorilla.pdf Before delving into the creation of National City Lines in 1936 NCL executives decided to push streetcar replacement efforts west. To do this a new subsidiary, Pacific City Lines was formed. If anyone would know how to come up with financial backing, it would be PCL executive Glenn Traer, who had been a successful Minneapolis investment banker. He and another financial expert, Matthew Robinson, prevented creditors from pulling the plug on the overextended Greyhound in the first full Depression year of 1930. ] National City Lines, and Pacific City Lines were indicted in 1947 on charges of conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, and of forming a transportation monopoly for the purpose of &apos;Conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines&apos;. They were convicted on the first charge but not the second in 1949. [ History ] The company was formed in 1920, operating two buses in Minnesota { United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (1951), para 6 &quot; It is undisputed that on April 1, 1939, defendant National City Lines, Inc., had grown from an humble beginning in 1920, consisting of the ownership and operation of two second-hand buses in Minnesota, to ownership or control of 29 local operating transportation companies located in 27 different cities in 10 states. &quot; } by E.

Pacific City Lines was organized for the purpose of acquiring local transit companies on the Pacific Coast and commenced doing business in January 1938. American was organized to acquire local transportation systems in the larger metropolitan areas in various parts of the country in 1943. It merged with National in 1946. &quot; } In 1938, National City Lines wished to purchase transportation systems in cities &quot; where street cars were no longer practicable &quot; and replace them with passenger bus es. To fund this expansion the company obtained equity funding from companies seeking to increase sales of commercial buses and supplies, including General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum. { United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (1951), para 9 &quot; In 1938, National conceived the idea of purchasing transportation systems in cities where street cars were no longer practicable and supplanting the latter with passenger buses. Its capital was limited and its earlier experience in public financing convinced it that it could not successfully finance the purchase of an increasing number of operating companies in various parts of the United States by such means. Accordingly it devised the plan of procuring funds from manufacturing companies whose products its operating companies were using constantly in their business. National approached General Motors, which manufactures buses and delivers them to the various sections of the United States. It approached Firestone, whose business of manufacturing and supplying tires extends likewise throughout the nation. In the middle west, where a large part of its operating subsidiaries were to be located, it solicited investment of funds from Phillips, which operates throughout that section but not on the east or west coast. Pacific undertook the procurement of funds from General Motors and Firestone and also from Standard Oil of California, which operates on the Pacific coast. Mack Truck Company was also solicited. Eventually each of the suppliers entered into a contract with City Lines defendants of the character we have described whereby City Lines companies agreed that they would buy their exclusive requirements from the contracting supplier and from no one else. &quot; } In 1936, they bought 13 transit companies in Illinois, Oklahoma and Michigan, then in 1937, they replaced streetcars in Butte, Montana and made purchases in Mississippi and Texas. Sometimes these systems were already run down, but not always. Major investment had recently been made with improvements to the streetcars systems in Butte and Beaumont, Texas. In 1938 the company entered into exclusive dealing arrangements and obtained equity funding from companies seeking to increase sales of commercial buses and supplies, including General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum. The company was indicted in 1947 and was later convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to the local transit companies that they controlled. Over 1938 and 1939 the company made purchases in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio. and by 1939, it owned or controlled 29 local transportation companies in 27 different cities in 10 states. By 1947 the company owned or controlled more than 100 electric streetcar systems in 45 cities including, but not limited to, Baltimore, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Oakland, Philadelphia and Tulsa. The company ultimately dismantled these systems and replaced them with bus systems in what became known as the &apos;Great American streetcar scandal&apos; and formed the inspiration for the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
