A rock and roll pioneer and a forefather of the Chicano rock movement, Valens&apos; recording career lasted only eight months. [ Ritchie Valens - the Pioneer of Rock and Roll http://www.efi-news.com/2011/12/ritchie-valens-pioneer-of-rock-and-roll.html EF News International 16 December 2011 ] During this time, however, he scored several hits, most notably &quot; La Bamba &quot;, which was originally a Mexican folk song that Valens transformed with a rock rhythm and beat that became a hit in 1958, { HOME - The Daily Breeze } { MIPUNTO.COM | TEMAS | Rock en Venezuela } making Valens a pioneer of the Spanish-speaking rock and roll movement. On February 3, 1959, on what has become known as The Day the Music Died, Valens was killed in a small-plane crash in Iowa, a tragedy that also claimed the lives of fellow musicians Buddy Holly and J.P. &quot; The Big Bopper &quot; Richardson. Valens was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. [ Early life ] Ritchie Valens was born in Pacoima, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, on May 13, 1941. { Beverly Mendheim (1987) Ritchie Valens: the first Latino rocker p.156. } His parents were Joseph Steven Valenzuela and Concepcion Reyes. Brought up hearing traditional Mexican mariachi music, as well as flamenco guitar, R &amp; B and jump blues, he expressed an interest in making music of his own by the age of 5. He was encouraged by his father to take up guitar and trumpet, and later taught himself the drums. One day, a neighbor came across Ritchie trying to play a guitar that had only two strings. He re-strung the instrument, and taught Ritchie the fingerings of some chords. While Ritchie was left-handed, he was so eager to learn the guitar that he mastered the traditionally right-handed version of the instrument. [ April 2012 ] Valens had attended Pacoima Junior High School (now Pacoima Middle School). { &quot; About Us. &quot; Pacoima Middle School. Retrieved on April 9, 2012. } By the time he was attending junior high school, his proficiency on the guitar was such that he brought the instrument to school and would sing and play songs to his friends on the bleachers. [ April 2012 ] When he was sixteen years old, he was invited to join a local band named The Silhouettes as a guitarist. Later, the main vocalist left the group and Ritchie assumed this position as well. In addition to the performances with The Silhouettes, he would play solo at parties and other social events. [ Career ] A completely self-taught musician, Valens was an accomplished singer and guitarist. At his appearances, he often improvised new lyrics and added new riffs to popular songs while he was playing. This is an aspect of his music that is not heard in his commercial studio recordings. In May 1958, Bob Keane, the owner and President of Del-Fi Records, a small Hollywood record label, was given a tip by San Fernando High student Doug Macchia about a young performer from Pacoima by the name of Richard Valenzuela (Little Richard of the Valley). Keane, swayed by the Little Richard connection, went to see Valenzuela play a Saturday morning matinée at a movie theater in San Fernando. Impressed by the performance, he invited Ritchie to audition at his home in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where he had a small recording studio in his basement. The recording equipment comprised an early stereo recorder—a two-track Ampex 601-2 portable, and a pair of Neumann U-47 condenser microphones. After this first &apos;audition&apos;, Keane decided to sign Ritchie to Del-Fi, and a contract was prepared and signed on May 27, 1958. It was at this point that he took the name Ritchie, because, as Keane said, &quot; There were a bunch of &apos;Richies&apos; around at that time, and I wanted it to be different. &quot; Similarly, it was Keane who decided to shorten his surname to Valens from Valenzuela, in order to broaden his appeal. Several songs that would later be re-recorded at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood were first demoed in Keane&apos;s studio. The demos were mostly just Ritchie singing and playing guitar. Some of them featured drums. These original demos can be heard on the Del-Fi album Ritchie Valens — The Lost Tapes. As well as the aforementioned demos, t wo of the tracks laid down in Keane&apos;s studio were taken to Gold Star and had additional instruments dubbed over to create full-band recordings. &quot; Donna &quot; was one track (although there are two other preliminary versions of the song, both available on The Lost Tapes), and the other was an instrumental entitled &quot; Ritchie&apos;s Blues &quot;. After several songwriting and demo recording sessions with Keane in his basement studio, Keane decided that Ritchie was ready to enter the studio with a full band backing him. Amongst the musicians were Rene Hall, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer. The first songs recorded at Gold Star, at a single studio session one afternoon in July 1958, were &quot; Come On, Let&apos;s Go &quot;, an original (credited to Valens/Kuhn, Keane&apos;s real name), and &quot; Framed &quot;, a Leiber and Stoller tune. Pressed and released within days of the recording session taking place, the record was a success. Valens&apos; next record, a double A-side which was the final record to be released in his lifetime, had the songs &quot; Donna &quot; (written about a real girlfriend), coupled with &quot; La Bamba &quot;. At this point, in the autumn of 1958, Valens quit high school to concentrate on his career. Keane booked appearances at venues all across the United States and performances on television programs. Valens, however, had a fear of flying brought on by a freak accident at his Pacoima Junior High School when two airplanes collided over the playground, killing or injuring several of his friends. { The Pacoima Plane Crash } Valens was not at school that day as he was attending his grandfather&apos;s funeral. He eventually succeeded in overcoming his fear enough to travel by airplane. One of his first stops was Philadelphia to appear on Dick Clark &apos;s American Bandstand television show on October 6, where he sang &quot; Come On, Let&apos;s Go. &quot; In November, Ritchie traveled to Hawaii and performed alongside Buddy Holly and Paul Anka. Valens found himself a last-minute addition on the bill of legendary disc jockey Alan Freed &apos;s Christmas Jubilee in New York City, singing with some of those who had greatly influenced his music, including Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, The Everly Brothers, Duane Eddy, Eddie Cochran and Jackie Wilson. December 27 saw a return to American Bandstand, this time for a performance of &quot; Donna. &quot; Upon his return to Los Angeles, Valens filmed an appearance in Alan Freed&apos;s movie Go Johnny Go!. In the film, he appears in a diner, miming his song &quot; Ooh! My Head &quot;, using a Gretsch 6120 guitar, the same model Eddie Cochran owned. In between the live appearances, Ritchie returned to Gold Star several times, recording the tracks that would comprise his two albums. In early 1959, Valens was traveling the Midwest on a multi-act rock and roll tour dubbed &quot; The Winter Dance Party. &quot; Accompanying him were Buddy Holly with a new back-up band, Tommy Allsup on guitar, Waylon Jennings on bass, and Carl Bunch on drums; Dion and the Belmonts; J.P. &quot; The Big Bopper &quot; Richardson; and Frankie Sardo. None of the other performers had backing bands, so Buddy&apos;s backup band filled in for all the shows. Conditions for the performers on the tour buses were abysmal, and the bitterly cold Midwest weather took its toll on the party; Carl Bunch had to be hospitalized with severely frostbitten feet, and several others (including Valens and The Big Bopper) caught colds. The show was split into two acts, with Ritchie closing the first act. After Bunch was hospitalized, a member of the Belmonts who had some drum experience (Carlo Mastrangelo) took over the drumming duties. When Dion and the Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Buddy Holly. There is a surviving color photograph of Ritchie at the drum kit. [ Death ] [ The Day the Music Died ] After the February 2, 1959, performance in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly, Richardson, and Valens flew out of the Mason City airport in a small plane that Holly had chartered. Valens was on the plane unwillingly because he had won a coin toss. The plane, a three-passenger Beechcraft Bonanza, departed for Fargo, North Dakota, and crashed shortly after takeoff in a snow storm. The crash killed all three passengers and the pilot; at 17, Valens was the youngest to die on the flight. The event, along with Buddy Holly&apos;s death, inspired singer Don McLean &apos;s popular 1971 ballad &quot; American Pie &quot;, and immortalized February 3 as &quot; The Day the Music Died &quot;. Ritchie Valens is interred at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California. [ Legacy ] Valens was a pioneer of Chicano rock, Latin rock and was an inspiration to many musicians of Latino heritage. He influenced the likes of Los Lobos, Los Lonely Boys and Carlos Santana among countless others at a time when there were very few Latinos in American rock and pop music. He is considered the first Latino ever to successfully cross over into rock mainstream. &quot; La Bamba &quot; would prove to be his most influential recording; not only by becoming a pop chart hit sung entirely in Spanish but also because of its successful blending of traditional Latin American music with rock. He was a pioneer and was an inspiration for many after his death. Valens was the first to capitalize on this formula which would later be adopted by such varied artists as Selena, Caifanes, Café Tacuba, Circo, El Gran Silencio, Aterciopelados, Gustavo Santaolalla and many others in the Latin Alternative scene. Ironically, the Valenzuela family spoke only English at home, and Ritchie knew very little Spanish. Ritchie learned the lyrics phonetically in order to record &quot; La Bamba &quot; in Spanish. &quot; Come On, Let&apos;s Go &quot; has been covered by Los Lobos, The Ramones and &quot; The Paley Brothers; &quot; (jointly, The Ramones on guitar, bass, and drums and The Paley Brothers on vocals), Tommy Steele, The Huntingtons and The McCoys; and in Australia by Johnny Rebb and his Rebels on Leedon/Canetoad Records &quot; Donna &quot; has been covered by artists as diverse as MxPx, Cliff Richard, The Youngbloods, Clem Snide, Cappadonna, and The Misfits among many others. Robert Quine has cited Valens&apos; guitar playing as an early influence on his style. Ritchie inspired the likes of Chan Romero, Carlos Santana, Chris Montez, Keith O&apos;Conner Murphy, Los Lobos, and Los Lonely Boys. Donna Ludwig Fox, Valens&apos;s girlfriend, is today still recognized as &quot; Ritchie&apos;s Donna. &quot; Her personalized license plate reads RIPRV [ December 2010 ]. Ritchie&apos;s nephew, Ernie Valens, has toured worldwide playing his uncle&apos;s songs, including a new version of the &quot; Winter Dance Party &quot; tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller. This tour has taken place at many of the original 1959 venues in the Midwest. Valens is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6733 Hollywood Blvd. in Hollywood, California. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Valens&apos; mother Connie, who died in 1987, is buried alongside him. { Find A Grave - Millions of Cemetery Records and Online Memorials } Valens has been the subject of several biopic films. He was depicted in the 1987 biopic film La Bamba, which was about his life. Primarily set in 1957-1959, it depicted Valens from age 16 to 17. It introduced Lou Diamond Phillips as Valens and co-starred Esai Morales as his older half-brother, Bob Morales. Los Lobos performed most of the music in the film. Valens was portrayed by Gilbert Melgar in the final scene of The Buddy Holly Story and Valens will also be depicted in the upcoming film &apos;&apos;The Day the Music Died&apos;&apos;. [ 2009 12 31 ] Valens will be portrayed by Joseph Thornhill in the 2011 film Lives and Deaths of the Poets. The novelization of the film Grease by Ron De Christiforo is set around the time of Ritchie Valens&apos; death. In one of the earlier chapters, the gang sit around in the character of Sonny&apos;s basement, upset at the death of some of their favorite stars in the plane crash. The songs &quot; Come on Let&apos;s Go &quot; and &quot; Donna &quot; can be heard through the radio in Mafia II. [ Tributes ] Monument at Crash Site, September 16, 2003. In 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the &apos;50s era, erected a stainless steel monument depicting a steel guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers. It is located on private farmland, about one quarter mile west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, approximately eight miles north of Clear Lake. He also created a similar stainless steel monument to the three musicians near the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin. That memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003. { The Day the Music Died - Music Articles } A park in Pacoima was renamed in Ritchie Valens&apos; honor. { Ritchie Valens Park } &quot; Boogie With Stu &quot; from Led Zeppelin &apos;s Physical Graffiti album was inspired by Valens&apos; song &quot; Oooh, My Head. &quot; It did not credit Ritchie Valens or Bob Keane. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed by Bob Keane and half of the award went to Valens&apos; mother, although she was not part of the suit. { Lehmer, Larry.
