Established in 1930 by the New York City Board of Higher Education, the College had its beginnings as the Downtown Brooklyn branches of Hunter College (then a women&apos;s college ) and the City College of New York (then a men&apos;s college ). With the merger of these branches, Brooklyn College became the first public coeducational liberal arts college in New York City. The [ 26 acre m2 on ] campus is known for its great beauty, and is often regarded as &quot; the poor man&apos;s Harvard &quot; because of its low tuition and reputation for academic excellence (former President, Robert Hess, responded to the moniker by saying &quot; I like to think of Harvard as the rich man&apos;s Brooklyn College &quot; ).

October 14, 2011 ] The 2003 edition of The Best 345 Colleges, published by The Princeton Review, ranked Brooklyn College #1 for Most Beautiful Campus and in the Top Ten for Best Academic Value, Diversity, and Location. The College ranked in the top 2 nationally for the second consecutive year in Princeton Review’s 2006 guidebook, America’s Best Value Colleges.

[ Campus history ] East Quad: Boylan Hall, LaGuardia Hall Library and Ingersoll Hall In 1932, the architect Randolph Evans drafted a plan for the college&apos;s campus on a large plot of land his employer owned in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. He sketched out a Georgian -style campus facing a central quadrangle, and anchored by a library building with a tall tower. Evans presented the sketches to the president of the college at the time, Dr. William A. Boylan. Boylan was pleased with the plans, and the lot of land was purchased for $1.6 million. Construction of the new campus began in 1935, with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by then Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and Brooklyn Borough President Raymond Ingersoll. In 1936, then-President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Brooklyn College to lay the cornerstone of the Brooklyn College Gymnasium. President Boylan, Borough President Ingersoll, and President Roosevelt all had buildings on Brooklyn College&apos;s campus named after them. The campus located in Midwood became the only Brooklyn College campus after the school&apos;s Downtown Brooklyn campus was shut down during the 1975 budget emergency. [ Modern campus history ] left Brooklyn College&apos;s campus today looks much as it did when it was originally constructed, but with extensions of Ingersoll Hall and Roosevelt Hall. The campus also serves as home to the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts complex and its four theaters, including the George Gershwin. The most recent construction to take place was the demolition of Plaza Building, due to its inefficient use of space, poor ventilation, and significant maintenance costs. To replace Plaza Building, the college has constructed a new West Quad, designed by the notable Uruguay an architect Rafael Viñoly. The new grounds contain a newly landscaped quadrangle with grassy areas and trees. Also, new façade s are being constructed on Roosevelt and James halls where they once connected with Plaza Building. In addition to these changes, a new West Quad Center has been completed. It contains classroom space, offices, and the Department of Physical Education and Exercise Science. The building also has new gymnasiums and a swimming pool. The 2009–10 CUNYAC championship men&apos;s basketball team now plays its home games in the new West Quad Center. This follows a major library renovation that saw the library moved to a temporary home while construction took place. The Brooklyn College library is now located in its original location in a completely renovated and expanded LaGuardia Hall. The Leonard &amp; Claire Tow Center for the Performing Arts is scheduled to be built on the site of Gershwin Hall.
