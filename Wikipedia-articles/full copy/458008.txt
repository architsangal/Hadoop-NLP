[ Products containing tartrazine ] [ Foods ] Many foods contain tartrazine in varying proportions, depending on the manufacturer or the cook in charge, although nowadays the trend is to avoid it or substitute a non-synthetic dyeing substance such as annatto, malt color, or betacarotene [ May 2009 ] (see &apos;&apos;Sensitivities &amp; Intolerance&apos;&apos;, below). Products including tartrazine commonly include confectionery, cotton candy, soft drinks ( Mountain Dew ), energy drinks, instant pudding s, flavored corn chips ( Doritos, nachos, etc.), cereals ( corn flakes, muesli, etc.), cake mixes, pastries, custard powder, yellow popcorn, soup s (particularly instant or &quot; cube &quot; soups ), sauces, some rice s (like paella, risotto, etc.), powdered drink mixes, sports drinks, ice cream, ice pop s, candy, Gummy Bears, Peeps marshmallow treats, chewing gum, marzipan, jam, jelly (particularly mint jelly), gelatins, marmalade, mustard, horseradish, yogurt, noodle s such as Kraft Dinner, pickles and other pickled products such as tartare sauce and dill pickle dip, certain brands of fruit squash, fruit cordial, potato chips, biscuits, and many convenience food s together with glycerin, lemon and honey products.

[ Sensitivities and intolerance ] [ July 2007 ] Tartrazine appears to cause the most allergic and intolerance reactions of all the azo dye s, particularly among asthmatics and those with an aspirin intolerance. [ E102 Tartrazine, FD &amp; C yellow No.5 UK Food Guide http://www.ukfoodguide.net/e102.htm 2007-11-30 ] Symptoms from tartrazine sensitivity can occur by either ingestion or cutaneous exposure to a substance containing tartrazine.

[ July 2007 ] In children, asthma attacks and hives have been claimed, as well as supposed links to thyroid tumor s, chromosomal damage, and hyperactivity. [ Donna McCann et al.

It is not clear to what extent these problems can be specifically linked to tartrazine in affected individuals. The existence of a sensitivity reaction is well-known, but the existence of more extreme effects remain controversial. The incidence of tartrazine intolerance is fairly low as indicated above, and there is much controversy about whether tartrazine has ill effects on individuals who are not clearly intolerant. Total avoidance is the most common way to deal with tartrazine sensitivity, [ Dipalma JR Tartrazine sensitivity American Family Physician 42 5 1347–50 1990 November 2239641 ] but progress has been made in reducing people’s tartrazine sensitivity in a study of people who are simultaneously sensitive to both aspirin and tartrazine.

Professor Jim Stevenson from Southampton University, and author of the report, said: &quot; This has been a major study investigating an important area of research. The results suggest that consumption of certain mixtures of artificial food colours and sodium benzoate preservative are associated with increases in hyperactive behaviour in children. &quot; However, parents should not think that simply taking these additives out of food will prevent hyperactive disorders. We know that many other influences are at work but this at least is one a child can avoid. &quot; The following additives were tested in the research: [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6979976.stm Parents warned of additives link BBC News 2007-09-06 2009-04-15 ] Sunset yellow (E110) (FD &amp; C Yellow #6) - Coloring found in squashes Carmoisine (E122) - Red coloring in jellies Tartrazine (E102) (FD &amp; C Yellow #5) - Yellow coloring Ponceau 4R (E124) - Red coloring Sodium benzoate (E211) - Preservative Quinoline yellow (E104) - Food coloring Allura red AC (E129) (FD &amp; C Red #40) - Orange / red food dye On April 10, 2008, the Food Standards Agency called for a voluntary removal of the colors (but not sodium benzoate) by 2009. { BBC Europe-wide food colour ban call April 10, 2008 } In addition, it recommended that there should be action to phase them out in food and drink in the European Union (EU) over a specified period. { FSA Board discusses colours advice April 10, 2008 } UK ministers have agreed that the six colorings will be phased out by 2009.(Needs an update, it&apos;s 2012) { BBC Ministers agree food colour ban November 12, 2008 } [ Research in mammals ] [ section March 2012 ] [ March 2012 What effect? ] [ Tanaka T, Takahashi O, Oishi S, Ogata A Effects of tartrazine on exploratory behavior in a three-generation toxicity study in mice Reproductive Toxicology 26 2 156–63 2008 October 18687399 10.1016/j.reprotox.2008.07.001 ] [ Tanaka T Reproductive and neurobehavioural toxicity study of tartrazine administered to mice in the diet Food and Chemical Toxicology 44 2 179–87 2006 February 16087284 10.1016/j.fct.2005.06.011 ] Tartrazine has a noticeable effect on the behavior of young mice.

[ Regulation ] Because of the problem of tartrazine intolerance, the United States requires the presence of tartrazine to be declared on food and drug products (21 CFR 74.1705, 21 CFR 201.20) and also the color batch used to be preapproved by the FDA. The FDA regularly seizes products if found to be containing undeclared tartrazine, declared but not tested by them, or if labeled other than FD &amp; C yellow 5 or Yellow 5.
