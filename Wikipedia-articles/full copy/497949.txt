Its abbreviated form name was [ Sōshū 総州 ] or [ Hokusō 北総 ]. Shimōsa is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. It was bordered by Kazusa Province to the south, Musashi and Kōzuke Province s to the west, and Hitachi and Shimotsuke Province s to the north. Under the Engishiki classification system, Shimōsa was ranked as a &quot; great country &quot; (大国) and a far country (遠国). [ History ] Shimōsa was originally part of a larger territory known as [ Fusa Province 総国, occasionally 捄国 Fusa-no-kuni ], which was divided into “upper” and “lower” portions (i.e. Kazusa and Shimōsa) during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku (645-654). It was well-known to the Imperial Court in Nara Period Japan for its fertile lands, and is mentioned in Nara period records as having supplied hemp to the Court. Shimōsa was divided into 11 (later 12) counties. The exact location of the capital of Shimōsa is not precisely known, but is believed to have been somewhere within the borders of the modern city of Ichikawa, Chiba, near [ Kōnodai ] Station where the ruins of the &apos;&apos;Kokubun-ji&apos;&apos; have been located. However, the Ichinomiya of Shimōsa Province is the Katori Jingu in what is now the city of Katori, Chiba on the opposite coast of the province. During the Heian period, the province was divided into numerous shōen controlled by local samurai clans, primarily the Chiba clan, which sided with Minamoto Yoritomo in the Genpei War. During the Kamakura period, much of the province was under the control of the Chiba clan. By the early Muromachi period, the area was a highly contested region highly fragmented by various samurai clans. However, by the Sengoku period, the Late Hōjō clan held sway following the Battle of Kōnodai (1538) against the Ashikaga clan and the Satomi clan. Following the installation of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Edo, after the Battle of Odawara, he created eleven han within the borders of Shimōsa to reward his followers, with the remaining area retained as tenryō territory owned directly by the Shogun and administered by various hatamoto. The entire province had an assessed revenue of 681,062 koku.Following the Meiji Restoration, these various domains and tenryō territories were transformed into short-lived prefectures in July 1871 by the abolition of the han system. Most of Shimōsa Province became part of the new Chiba Prefecture on June 15, 1873, with four districts ( Yūki, Toyoda, Sashima, Okada) going to the new Ibaraki Prefecture and the portion to the west of the Edogawa River going to the new Saitama Prefecture. The area of former Shimōsa Province was organized into nine districts by the Meiji cadastral reforms, later reduced to five: Higashikatsushika District :ja:東葛飾郡 Nishikatsushika District :ja:西葛飾郡; merged with Sashima District March 29, 1896 Chiba District :ja:千葉郡 Inba District :ja:印旛郡 Katori District :ja:香取郡 Kitasōma District :ja:北相馬郡 Minamisōma District :ja:南相馬郡; merged with Higashikatsushika District April 1, 1897 Kaijō District :ja:海上郡 Sōsa District :ja:匝瑳郡 Yūki District :ja:結城郡 Sashima District :ja:猿島郡 Toyoda District :ja:豊田郡 (下総国); merged with Yūki District March 29, 1896 Shimohabu District :ja:下埴生郡; merged with Inba District April 1, 1897 Okada District :ja:岡田郡 ); merged with Yūki District March 29, 1896 [ Edo period Domains in Shimōsa Province ] [ Koga Domain 古河藩 ] [ Sakura Domain 佐倉藩 ] [ Yūki Domain 結城藩 ] [ Sekiyado Domain 関宿藩 ] [ Oyumi Domain 生実藩 ] [ Takaoka Domain 高岡藩 ] [ Tako Domain 多胡藩 ] [ Omigawa Domain 小見川藩 ] [ Sogano Domain 曾我野藩 ] [ Yahagi Domain 矢作藩 ] [ Iwatomori Domain 岩富藩 ] [ Moriya Domain 守谷藩 ] [ Yamazaki Domain 下総山崎藩 ] [ Kurihara Domain 栗原藩 ] [ Usui Domain 臼井藩 ] [ Yamakawa Domain 山川藩 ] [ Ōwa Domain 大輪藩 ] Domain Daimyo Dates Revenue (koku) Type Doi 1590-1871 80,000 fudai Hotta 1590-1871 110,000 fudai Mizuno 1590-1871 18,000 fudai Kuze 1590-1871 43,000 fudai Morikawa 1627-1871 10,000 fudai Inoue 1640-1871 10,000 fudai Matsudaira (Hisamatsu) 1713-1871 10,000 fudai Uchida 1594-1871 10,000 fudai Toda 1871-1871 12,000 fudai Miura 1590-1639 10,000 fudai Hōjō 1590-1613 10,000 fudai Toki 1590-1617 10,000 fudai Okabe 1590-1609 12,000 fudai Naruse 1600-1638 16,000 fudai Sakai 1690-1604 30,000 fudai Ōta 1635-1638 15,600 fudai Doi 1658-1677 10,000 fudai [ Notes ] [ References ] Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric and Käthe Roth.
