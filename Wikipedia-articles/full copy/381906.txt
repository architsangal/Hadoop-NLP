[ International Cricket Council ICC logo.svg 150px Official logo of the ICC Great Sport Great Spirit 15 June 1909 Dubai, United Arab Emirates 105 member countries President Sharad Pawar David Richardson ( CEO ) ] The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989. The ICC has 105 members: 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 35 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket&apos;s major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referee s that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. It promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket, [ http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/code-of-conduct-for-players-and-officials.pdf International Cricket Council - ICC Events, ICC Cricket Rankings, Live Cricket Scores Icc-cricket.com 2011-05-08 ] and also co-ordinates action against corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all Test matches ), it does not govern domestic cricket in member countries, and it does not make the laws of the game, which remain under the control of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Sharad Pawar, former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is the President of the Council who succeeded David Morgan the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. The current CEO is Haroon Lorgat [ International Sports Security Conference Haroon Lorgat Profile of speakers at the conference 22 February 2012 ]. [ History ] On 15 June 1909 representatives from England, Australia and South Africa met at Lord&apos;s and founded the Imperial Cricket Conference. Membership was confined to the governing bodies of cricket within the British Empire where Test cricket was played. West Indies, New Zealand and India were elected as Full Members in 1926, doubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. That year it was also agreed to make a change in membership, with election being for; &quot; governing bodies of cricket in countries within the Empire to which cricket teams are sent, or which send teams to England. &quot; However the United States did not meet these criteria and was not made a member. { 1909 - 1963 - Imperial Cricket Conference } After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, it was given Test status in 1952, becoming the seventh Test-playing nation. In May 1961 South Africa left the Commonwealth and therefore lost membership. In 1965, the Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the International Cricket Conference and new rules adopted to permit the election of countries from outside the Commonwealth. This led to the expansion of the Conference, with the admission of Associate Members. Associates were each entitled to one vote, while the Foundation and Full Members were entitled to two votes on ICC resolutions. Foundation Members retained a right of veto. Sri Lanka was admitted as a Full Member in 1981, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, new rules were adopted and International Cricket Conference changed its name to the current name, the International Cricket Council. South Africa was re-elected as a Full Member of the ICC in 1991, after the end of apartheid; this was followed in 1992 by the admission of Zimbabwe as the ninth Test-playing nation. [ Location ] { Dubai. } { From its formation the ICC had } { Lord&apos;s Cricket Ground as its home, and from 1993 had its offices in the &quot; Clock Tower &quot; building at the nursery end of the ground. The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with England, it was necessary to protect cricket&apos;s revenues by creating a company [ICC Development (International) Pty Ltd - known as IDI] outside the UK. This was established in Jan 1994 and was based in Monaco. } For the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001–2008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council&apos;s cricket administrators, who remained at Lord&apos;s, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office whilst protecting their commercial income from tax. The option of staying at Lord&apos;s was investigated and a request was made, through Sport England, to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London - but be given special exemption from paying UK corporation tax on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. In August 2005 the ICC moved its offices to Dubai, and subsequently closed its offices at Lord&apos;s and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11-1 vote by the ICC&apos;s Executive Board in favour. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm BBC News Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai 7 March 2005 ] Whilst the principal driver of the ICC&apos;s move to Dubai was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord&apos;s had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the MCC (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC ) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord&apos;s to a more neutral venue. { Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan } [ Rules and regulation ] The International Cricket Council overlooks playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. Even though the ICC doesn&apos;t have copyright to the laws of cricket and only the MCC may change the laws, nowadays this would usually only be done after discussions with the game&apos;s global governing body, the ICC. The ICC also has a &quot; Code of Conduct &quot; to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008 the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players. { 2008: Penalties imposed on players for breaches of ICC Code of Conduct } [ Tournaments and income generation ] Variant ICC Logo The ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the Cricket World Cup, and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$ 1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC’s main source of income. [ http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/271994.html ICC rights go to ESPN-Star &amp; #124; Cricket News &amp; #124; Global &amp; #124; ESPN Cricinfo Content-usa.cricinfo.com 2011-05-08 ] [ http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/276853.html ICC set to cash in on sponsorship rights &amp; #124; Cricket News &amp; #124; Global &amp; #124; ESPN Cricinfo Content-usa.cricinfo.com 2011-05-08 ] In the nine month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating income of USD 12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast event income was USD 285.87 million, including USD 239 million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of USD 6.695 million in the period. The ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ( Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals ), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Super Series played in Australia in 2005. However these expansion has not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006 [ http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html Melbourne The Age Biggest player in the game flexes muscle 7 January 2006 ] The Champions Trophy 2004 event was referred to in Wisden 2005 by the editor as a &quot; turkey of a tournament &quot; and a &quot; fiasco &quot;; although the 2006 edition was seen as a greater success due to a new format. { ICCchampionstrophy.indya.com } [ http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html When the cricket did all the talking &amp; #124; Cricket Features &amp; #124; Global &amp; #124; ESPN Cricinfo Content-usa.cricinfo.com 2011-05-08 ] The ICC World Twenty20, first played in 2007, was a success. The ICC&apos;s current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the Olympic Games, and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin in 2010, thus the Twenty20 World Cup will be played for a second consecutive year in that year. [ Umpires and referees ] [ June 2011 ] The ICC appoints international umpires and Match referee s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the Elite Panel, the International Panel, and the Associates and Affiliates Panel. As of January 2009, the Elite Panel includes eleven umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, whilst one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire first-class cricket in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 12 Test matches and 15 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days per year. The International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup in order to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiates in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a &quot; third umpire &quot; who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel. The newest panel of umpires, set up in February 2005, is the Associates and Affiliates Umpires Panel. It was designed to offer a pathway to top level umpiring for officials from the ICC&apos;s 104 Associate and Affiliate Member countries. As of January 2009, it has 10 members from countries such as Nepal and Fiji. These umpires officiate ODIs between Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments such as the ICC World Cup Qualifier. There is also an Elite Panel of ICC Referees who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases. [ Members ] { ICC member nations. Full Members, that play } { Test cricket, are shown in orange, Associate Members in yellow and Affiliate Members in purple. } [ List of International Cricket Council members ] The ICC has three classes of membership: Full Members, the ten governing bodies of teams that play official Test matches; Associate Members, the 34 governing bodies in countries where cricket is firmly established and organised but which do not qualify for Full Membership; and Affiliate Members, the 60 governing bodies in countries where the ICC recognises that cricket is played according to the Laws of Cricket. [ Regional bodies ] These regional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket: African Cricket Association Americas Cricket Association Asian Cricket Council ICC East Asia-Pacific European Cricket Council [ Defunct Bodies ] East and Central Africa Cricket Council West Africa Cricket Council [ Competitions and awards ] The ICC organises various First-Class and One-Day cricket competitions: ICC Test Championship (test league) ICC Intercontinental Cup (first class for non test nations) { One Day } ICC ODI Championship (one-day league) ICC Cricket World Cup (50 over tournament) ICC World Twenty20 (twenty20 tournament) ICC Champions Trophy (miniature version of the world cup) ICC World Cricket League (league for associate &amp; affiliate members) ICC World Cup Qualifier (qualifier for the world cup) The ICC has instituted the ICC Awards to recognise and honour the best international cricket players of the previous 12 months. The inaugural ICC Awards ceremony was held on 7 September 2004, in London. [ Anti-corruption and security ] The ICC has also had to deal with drugs and bribery scandals involving top cricketers. Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal bookmaking markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, Lord Condon. Amongst the corruption on which they have reported was that of former South African captain Hansie Cronje who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively). The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced which for example prohibit the use of mobile telephone s in dressing room s. Prior to the 2007 Cricket World Cup ICC Chief Executive Malcolm Speed warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it. { The Jamaica Star :: Sport :: Speed warns against corruption during World Cup :: February 13, 2007 } In 2010, 3 Pakistani players, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively. [ Global Cricket Academy ] [ ICC Global Cricket Academy ] The ICC Global Cricket Academy (GCA) is located at Dubai Sports City in the United Arab Emirates. The GCA&apos;s facilities include two ovals, each with 10 turf pitches, outdoor turf and synthetic practice facilities, indoor practice facilities including hawk eye technology and a cricket specific gymnasium. Rod Marsh has been appointed as the Academy&apos;s Director of Coaching. The opening, originally planned for 2008, took place in 2010. [ Cricket World Cup ] [ ICC Cricket World Cup ] The ICC Cricket World Cup is held every 4 years and is one of the biggest cricket events in the history of the sport. It is watched by millions from all over the Cricket Nations.The most recent World Cup was held between the 19 February 2011 and the 2nd of April 2011, jointly by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. { Official Website of ICC World Cup Cricket 2011 } [ ICC Cricket World Program ] [ ICC Cricket World Program ] The International Cricket Council telecasts a weekly program on television called ICC Cricket World. It is produced by Sportsbrand. It is a weekly 30 minute program providing the latest cricket news, recent cricket action including all Test and One-Day International matches, as well as off-field features and interviews [ Criticism ] Sports journalist Peter Della Penna has criticized the ICC for what he has perceived as attempts to minimize reports of security issues relating to unruly fans at matches.
