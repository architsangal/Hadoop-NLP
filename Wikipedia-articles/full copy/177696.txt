[ Ecological economics Environmental economics Natural resource economics Thermoeconomics ] Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies. { Sickles, Robin (2008). &quot; energy economics. &quot; } { The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. } Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of academic discipline s, energy economics does not present itself as a self contained academic discipline, but it is an applied subdiscipline of economics. From the list of main topics of economics, some relate strongly to energy economics: Econometrics Environmental economics Finance Industrial organization Microeconomics Macroeconomics Resource economics Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy engineering, geology, political sciences, ecology etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues: Climate change and climate policy Risk analysis and security of supply Sustainability Energy market s and electricity market s - liberalisation, (de- or re-) regulation Demand response Energy and economic growth Economics of energy infrastructure Environmental policy Energy policy Energy derivative s Forecasting energy demand Elasticity of supply and demand in energy market Energy elasticity Some institutions of higher education ( universities ) recognise energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a curriculum. The University of Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are the top three research universities, and Resources for the Future the top research institute. { IDEAS/RePEc } There are numerous other research departments, companies and professionals offering energy economics studies and consultations. [ History ] World prices for energy, 1991-2010. 2000=100. Energy related issues have been actively present in economic literature since the 1973 oil crisis, but have their roots much further back in the history. As early as 1865, W.S. Jevons expressed his concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book The Coal Question. { Online Library of Liberty - Titles } { Jevons, &apos;&apos;The Coal Question&apos;&apos;: Library of Economics and Liberty } One of the best known early attempts to work on the economics of exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by H. Hotelling, who derived a price path for non-renewable resources, known as Hotelling&apos;s rule.

Much progress in energy economics has been made through the conferences of the International Association for Energy Economics, the model comparison exercises of the (Stanford) Energy Modeling Forum and the meetings of the International Energy Workshop. IDEAS/RePEc has a list of energy economists, a ranking of the same, and a collection of recent working papers.
