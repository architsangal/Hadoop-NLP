New Brunswick was incorporated as a city by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1784. { Snyder, John P. &apos;&apos;The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968&apos;&apos;, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 171. Accessed March 26, 2012. } New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one quarter of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city and in the 1930s one out of three city residents were Hungarian. { Weiss, Jennifer. &quot; REDEVELOPMENT; As New Brunswick Grows, City&apos;s Hungarians Adapt &quot;, } { The New York Times, July 16, 2006.

[ History ] [ Origins of the name ] Originally inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans, the first European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The settlement here was first called Prigmore&apos;s Swamp (1681–97) then Inian&apos;s Ferry (1691–1714). { Staff. &quot; NEW-JERSEY.; Miscellaneous Notes about New-Brunswick. &quot;, } { The New York Times, July 27, 1854. Accessed April 18, 2012. &quot; If the &apos;desperately hot&apos; weather permit, I purpose to give you a few items of general interest respecting this ancient Dutch settlement. However, with the mercury ranging from 78° to 98° in the shade, during the sixteen hours of sunshine, you will not expect much exertion on my part. DANIEL COOPER (says GORDON,) was the first recorded inhabitant of &apos;Prigmore&apos;s Swamp.&apos; &quot; } In 1714, the village was given the name New Brunswick after the city of Braunschweig, in state of Lower Saxony, in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League, later in the Holy Roman Empire, and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Elector of Hanover, of the House of Hanover (also known as the House of Brunswick), became King George I of Great Britain (1660–1727). [ During the Colonial and Early American periods ] Early nineteenth century drawing of Old Queen&apos;s Centrally located between New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania along an early thoroughfare known as the King&apos;s Highway and situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub for Colonial travelers and traders. New Brunswick was incorporated as a town in 1736 and chartered as a city in 1784. It was occupied by the British in the winter of 1776-1777 during the Revolutionary War. The Declaration of Independence received one of its first public readings in New Brunswick in the days following its promulgation by the Continental Congress. { Declaration of Independence: First Public Readings } { Harper&apos;s New Monthly Magazine, July 1892, 251 } The Trustees of Queen&apos;s College (now Rutgers University ), founded in 1766, voted to locate the young college in New Brunswick, selecting this city over Hackensack, in Bergen County, New Jersey. Classes began in 1771 with one instructor, one sophomore, Matthew Leydt, and several freshmen at a tavern called &quot; The Sign of the Red Lion &quot; on the corner of Albany and Neilson Streets (now the grounds of the Johnson &amp; Johnson corporate headquarters). Classes were held through the American Revolution in various taverns and boarding houses, and at a building known as College Hall on George Street, until Old Queens was erected in 1808. It remains the oldest building on the Rutgers University campus. The Queen&apos;s College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School ) was established also in 1766, and shared facilities with the College until 1830, when it located in a building (now known as Alexander Johnston Hall) across College Avenue from Old Queens. After Rutgers University became the state university of New Jersey in 1956, the Trustees of Rutgers divested it of the Rutgers Preparatory School, which relocated in 1957 to an estate purchased from the Colgate-Palmolive Company in Franklin Township in neighboring Somerset County. The New Brunswick Theological Seminary, founded in 1784, moved to New Brunswick in 1810, sharing its quarters with the fledgling Queen&apos;s College (Queens would close from 1810 to 1825 due to financial problems, and reopen in 1825 under the name Rutgers College). The Seminary, due to overcrowding and differences over the mission of Rutgers College as a secular institution, moved to a seven  acre (28,000  m 2 ) tract of land less than one-half  mile (800  m) west, which it still occupies, although the land is now in the middle of Rutgers University&apos;s College Avenue campus. [ Hungarian community ] { Hungarian Revolution of 1956. } New Brunswick began attracting a Hungarian immigrant population around the turn of the 20th century. Hungarians were primarily attracted to the city by employment at Johnson &amp; Johnson factories located in the city. Hungarians settled mainly in what today is the second ward. The immigrant population grew until the end of the early century immigration boom. During the Cold War, the community was revitalized by the decision to house refugees from the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution at Camp Kilmer, in nearby Edison. Even though the Hungarian population has been largely supplanted by newer immigrants, there continues to be a Hungarian Festival in the city held on Somerset Street on the first Saturday of June each year. Many Hungarian institutions set up by the community remain and active in the neighborhood, including: Magyar Reformed Church, Ascension Lutheran Church (Elso Magyar Evangélikus Egyhaz) St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church, Hungarian American Athletic Club, Aprokfalva Montessori Preschool (Aprokfalva Mindennapos Magyar Óvoda), Széchenyi Hungarian Community School &amp; Kindergarten (Széchenyi Magyar Iskola és Óvoda), Teleki Pál Scout Home, Hungarian American Foundation, Vers Hangja, Hungarian Poetry Group, Bolyai Lecture Series on Arts and Sciences (Bolyai Kör), Hungarian Alumni Association (Magyar Öregdiák Szövetség - Bessenyei György Kör), Hungarian Radio Program, Hungarian Civic Association, Committee of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick, Csűrdöngölő Folk Dance Ensemble. Several landmarks in the city also testify to its Hungarian heritage. There is a street and a recreation park named after Lajos Kossuth, the famous leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The corner of Somerset Street and Plum Street is named Mindszenty Square where the first ever statue of Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty was erected. A stone memorial to the victims of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution also stands nearby. [ Latino community ] Since the 1960s, many of the new residents of New Brunswick have come from Latin America. Many citizens moved from Puerto Rico in the 1970s. In the 1980s, many immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and still later from Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Mexico. There are many Latino businesses on and around French Street ( NJ Rt. 27 ). [ October 2008 ] [ Demolition, revitalization and redevelopment ] Gateway Project under construction New Brunswick contains a number of examples of urban renewal in the United States. In the 1960s-1970s, the downtown area became blighted as middle class residents moved to newer suburbs surrounding the city, an example of the phenomenon known as &quot; white flight &quot;. Beginning in 1975, Rutgers University, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the local government collaborated through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to form the New Brunswick Development Company (DevCo), with the goal of revitalizing the city center and redeveloping neighborhoods considered to be blighted and dangerous (via demolition of existing buildings and construction of new ones) { Devco spends $1.6 billion since 1970s, } { The Daily Targum, January 25, 2006. } Johnson &amp; Johnson decided to remain in New Brunswick and built a new World Headquarters building in the area between Albany Street, Amtrak&apos;s Northeast Corridor, Route 18, and George Street, requiring many old buildings and historic roads to be removed. The Hiram Market area, a historic district which by the 1970s had become a mostly Puerto Rican and Dominican-American neighborhood, was demolished to build a Hyatt hotel and conference center, and upscale housing. { Raids by Housing Inspectors Anger Jersey Neighborhood, } { The New York Times, March 12, 1988. } Johnson &amp; Johnson guaranteed Hyatt Hotels&apos; investment as they were wary of building an upscale hotel in a run-down area. The redevelopment process has been controversial. Devco, the hospitals, and the city government continue to draw ire from both historic preservation ists, those opposing gentrification, { Students protest DevCo redevelopment, } { The Daily Targum, September 15, 1999. } and those concerned with eminent domain abuses, and tax abatements for developers. { Tenants&apos; place is uncertain, } { The Daily Targum, November 9, 1999. } The Gateway tower, a 16 story redevelopment project next to the train station, was completed in 2012.
