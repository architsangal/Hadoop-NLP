Cavite is surrounded by Laguna to the east, Metro Manila to the northeast, and Batangas to the south. To the west lies the South China Sea. [ Etymology ] The name &quot; Cavite &quot; comes the Hispanicized form of kawit or it is a corruption of kalawit, Tagalog words for &quot; hook, &quot; in reference to the small hook-shaped peninsula jutting into Manila Bay. { Official Website of the Provincial Government of Cavite - Cavite City } The name originally only applied to the peninsula (Cavite La Punta, now Cavite City ) and the adjacent lowland coastal area (Cavite Viejo, now Kawit ). Cavite City used to serve as the capital of the province until 1954, and as with many other provinces organized during the Spanish colonial era, the name of the capital was applied to the whole province. Another theory proposes that the name is a Hispanicized form of kabit, Tagalog for &quot; joined, &quot; &quot; connected, &quot; or &quot; attached, &quot; referring to the peninsula&apos;s topographical relation to the mainland. [ Geography ] Cavite is located within the Greater Manila Area, not to be confused with adjacent Metro Manila, the defined capital district. The urban influence of the metropolis together with easy accessibility, adequate infrastructure and comparatively fresh natural setting makes the picturesque province an ideal refuge. [ Land area ] Cavite occupies land area of [ 1427.06 km2 ] which is approximately 8.72 percent of CALABARZON ’s total land area, 2.74 percent of the regional area and 0.48 per cent of the total land area of the Philippines. The municipalities of Maragondon and Silang have the biggest land areas comprising [ 165.49 km2 ] and [ 156.41 km2 ] respectively, while the municipality of Noveleta has the smallest land area as indicated by [ 5.41 km2 ] or 0.38 percent of the provincial total and area. { http://www.cavite.gov.ph/SocioEconomic_Profile/2009/Physical%20and%20Natural%20Resources.pdf } [ Islands of Cavite ] Balot Island, located at the mouth of Ternate River &quot; Ternate Website &quot;.

[ Topography and slope ] Situated at the entrance of Manila Bay, Cavite is characterized by rolling hinterlands punctuated by hills; shoreland fronting Manila Bay at sea level; and rugged portion at the boundary of Batangas where the Dos Picos mountains are located. The province has two principal rivers and two mountain ranges. Cavite is divided into four physiographical areas, namely: the lowest lowland area, lowland area, the central hilly area and the upland mountainous area. The lowest lowland area is the coastal plain in particular. These areas have extremely low ground level of EL. 0m to EL. 2m compared to the high tide level of about EL. 0.8m from the Mean Sea Level (MSL). These are the city of Cavite City and the municipalities of Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, northern part of Carmona and eastern part of Ternate. The lowland area consists of the coastal and alluvial plains. These areas have flat ground slope of less than 0.5% and low ground elevation of EL. 2m to EL. 30m. The alluvial plain can be found in the municipality of Imus and southern part of General Trias. Into these municipalities forms the transition area between the coastal plain and the central hilly area. It also covers some areas of Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza and Carmona. The third topography type is the central hilly area, generally found on the mountain foot slope. It forms the rolling tuffaceous plateau. This topography includes steep hills, ridges and elevated inland valley. The plateau is characterized with ground elevation ranging from 30m to nearly 400m. Its ground slope ranges from 0.5 to 2%. The city of Trece Martires and Dasmariñas and the municipalities of General Emilio Aguinaldo, General Mariano Alvarez, Indang, Maragondon, Ternate, Silang and Carmona have this kind of topography. [ 2000 ft flip ] [ 14 8 31.71 N 121 1 19.02 E Mount Sungay ] [ 716 m ] The last topography type is upland mountainous area, found in Magallanes, Amadeo, Tagaytay City, Mendez, Alfonso, southern part of Maragondon and Carmona. They are situated at a very high elevation above EL. 400m with slopes of more than 2%. &quot; Physical and Natural Resources &quot;. Province of Cavite Official Website.

Retrieved on 2012-02-04. The mountain was much higher before, topped by rock formations that resembled horns (Sungay in Tagalog) hence the name. Unfortunately, the prominence of the mountain was leveled in half during the construction of Peoples Park in the Sky during the Marcos administration. [ Land resources and distribution ] Cavite’s land resources are categorized into two: forest lands and alienable and disposable lands. Forest lands are being maintained as they play a great role for the ecological balance of the Province aside from the fact that they are home to numerous flora and fauna that needs to be protected and preserved. Correspondingly, the alienable and disposable lands are the built-up areas as well as production areas. These lands are intended for urban, economic and demographic developments. Forest Lands Cavite Province lies in the western monsoon forest zone. This location is very beneficial for the formation of tropical rainforests which are characteristically made through natural vegetation. In 2007, the existing for estarea within the province totalled to 8,624.956 hectares. These forest areas were categorized as Protected Landscape under R.A.7586 otherwise known as National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS) and the unclassified forest (Non-N I P A S ). By virtue of Proclamation Number 1594 on 26 October 1976, a total of 4,000 hectares located in Ternate and Maragondon, Cavite was proclaimed as national park, now known as the Mts. Palay-Palay and Mataas na Gulod Protected Landscape. The park lies in the border of Cavite and Batangas and has three peaks, Palay-Palay, Pico de Loro and Mataas na Gulod. Still, there were five (5) unclassified forests found along Tagaytay Ridge, Maragondon, Magallanes, Ternate and Alfonso. With regards to the records of mountains, seven were named such as Pico de Loro, Mt. Palay-Palay, Mt. Buntis, Mt. Mataas na Gulod, Mt. Nagpatong, Mt. Hulog and Mt. Gonzales. The richness of Cavite’s forest provides the abundance of different forest products. Grass in nature, bamboo, is one of the most available forest products being found in the municipalities of Ternate, Magallanes, Maragondon and General Aguinaldo throughout the year. Alienable and Disposable Lands These lands are being used in various ways, either for agriculture, residences, open areas, etc. These actual uses are termed as land-u s e. Based on the Cavite Provincial Physical Framework Plan 2005-2010, Cavite’s alienable and disposable lands are further classified into production lands and built-up areas. Production lands in Cavite are intended for agriculture, fishery and mining. On the other hand, built-up areas are mainly for residential areas, commercial, industrial and tourism areas. Production Land-Use Majority of production land-use is into agriculture. Considering that 50.33% of the total provincial land area is engaged into agriculture, it can be generalized that in spite of rapid urbanization in the province, Cavite remains to have an agricultural economy that makes food security attainable. Some of the major crops being produced in the province are rice, corn, coffee, coconuts, cutflowers and vegetables. Included in the agricultural land use are livestock farms that range from piggeries, poultries, goat farms and cattle farms. The climatic suitability of Cavite makes the province ideal for integrated farming, having crops and livestock rising in one farm. Fishery is also another major component of the agricultural sector. Having rich marine resources and long coastlines, the province is home to numerous fishery activities. This industry has provided livelihood to many Caviteños. In some lowland and even upland areas, fishery, in the form of fish ponds are also producing considerable amount of fish products. Some areas in Cavite are also engaged in fish processing and production of fish products like fish sauce. Mining is the third component of production land-use in the province. As of 2009, there are 15 mining and quarrying areas operating in Cavite. Extraction includes filling materials, gravel and sand. Built-up Areas The built-up areas are mainly composed of residential and industrial sites. This also includes commercial and business areas where commerce is transpiring. According to the 2007 Census of Population and Housing by the National Statistics Office, there are 611,450 occupied housing units in Cavite. Moreover, according to the Housing and Land-Use Regulatory Board, there are around 1,224 housing subdivisions with issued license to sell in the province until 2009 which occupies an area of 9,471 hectares. Meanwhile, the industrial sector also develops rapidly in the Province. For 2009, operational industrial estates cover around 2,939 hectares. Tourism establishments are also considered built-up areas such as golf courses, leisure farms, resorts and the likes. [ Water resources ] Six major rivers are identified in Cavite. Numerous springs, waterfalls and rivers found in the upland areas of the province are observed to be useful for domestic, tourism, and industrial users. The province is also endowed with waterfalls. The hydrological network of the province is composed of main rivers and tributaries. These rivers and tributaries generally have a flowing direction from the highlands of Tagaytay City going to Manila Bay with stretches from the Municipality of Bacoor up to Ternate. In the lowland areas covering the towns of Bacoor, Imus, General Trias, Dasmariñas, Naic, Tanza, Ternate, hundreds of artesian wells and deepwells provide water supply for both domestic and irrigation purposes. Cavite boasts a stretch of about 123 kilometers of shoreline. These can be found along Cavite City, Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate. The richness of Cavite’s coastal resources paved the way for our recognition as major producer of oysters and mussels. The fisherfolks are also active producers of sugpo/bangus. On the western coastlines lie the breathtaking beaches with pale gray sand. Thus, basically, coastal resource of the province contributes to the economic activities related to fishery and tourism. { http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/General%20Information.pdf } Major Rivers These rivers are known to have various tributaries passing through the municipalities of the province. Maragondon River Labac River Cañas River San Juan River Bacoor River Imus River Springs Balite Spring (Amadeo) Saluysoy Spring (Alfonso) Matang Tubig Spring (Tagaytay City) Malakas Spring ( General Aguinaldo) Ulo Spring (Mendez) Waterfalls Palsajingin Falls (Indang) Balite Falls (Amadeo) Malibiclibic Falls (Gen. Aguinaldo) Talon-Butas Falls (Gen. Aguinaldo) Saluysoy Falls (Alfonso) Tala River (Gen. Aguinaldo) [ Soil properties ] Cavite is composed of several soil types according to soil surveys conducted by the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM). Classification of soil types in a specific area is a very important consideration in identifying its most fitted land-use. This way, utmost productivity can be achieved. The lowland area of Cavite is generally composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while those in the upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant in the southern part of Bacoor and Imus bordering Dasmariñas. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand. The central area principally consists of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This is recommended for diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta. The type of soils that dominate the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate. [ Mineral resources and reserves ] The greater parts of Cavite are composed of volcanic materials, tuff, cinders, basalt, breccias, agglomerate and interbeddings of shales, and sandstones. The dormant and active volcanoes (Taal) are within these volcanic areas and have been the sources of volcanic materials which form the Tagaytay Cuesta. The drainage systems are deeply entrenched in the tuffs, eroding thin interbedded sandstones and conglomerate rocks which are the sources of little reserves of sand and gravel in the larger stream. Adobe stone quarries also flourish in the tuff areas. Cavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of western part of the province. Black sands are found in Kawit while Noveleta has its own salt products. Magallanes has gravel deposits while reserves of sand and gravel materials are found in Alfonso, Carmona, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, Naic, Ternate, Maragondon and Silang. [ Climate ] Cavite belongs to Type 1 climate based on the Climate Map of the Philippines by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Being a Type 1, Cavite has two pronounced seasons – the dry season, which usually begins in November and ends in April, and the rainy season, which starts in May and ends in October. Cavite’s cool periods are from December to February while summer months are from April to May. [ Economy ] Cavite is one of the most industrialized and one of the fastest growing provinces in the country due to its close proximity to Metro Manila. Many companies, such as Intel, have established manufacturing plants in numerous industrial parks in the province. As of 2003, there are thirty-one (31) industrial estates in the province. A total of 973 investors have poured their investments in the 718 existing industrial establishments. Most of the investors have established partnership with their Filipino counterparts in varying levels of equity participation. Since the 1990s when the provincial government launched the Second Revolution with industrialization as one of its priority thrusts, Cavite has become a preferred destination of both local and foreign investors. Rapid urbanization has transformed Cavite into an industrial and commercial area in CALABARZON. [ Agriculture ] Cavite is predominantly an agriculture province. Cavite’s economy is largely dependent to agriculture. Despite urbanization and industrialization, still, a significant number of Caviteños are engaged into agribusinesses. Data gathered from Office of the Provincial Agriculturist shows that though the province lies in the industrial belt, the agricultural land is about 49.38 percent or 70,466.53 hectares of the total land area of the Province. This is 1,176.5 hectares bigger than that of the declared agricultural lands in 2008 (69,290.03 hectares). The municipality of Maragondon has the biggest area intended for agriculture, accounts for 14.57% of the total provincial agricultural lands while Cavite City has no longer available land for agriculture related activities and industries. If based on total agricultural lands, we may say that the major players in agriculture in the Province are Maragondon, Silang, Indang, Naic and Alfonso. Of the seven districts in the province, the top three with the widest agricultural area are District VII comprising 43,587.01 hectares or 61.85 percent of the total agricultural areas with 27,115 farmers followed by District VI with 17.40 percent or 12,257.71 hectares having 8,701 farmers and District V comprising 10,248.55 hectares with 10,295 farmers. The municipality of Silang has the most number of farmers. The municipality of Maragondon only ranks 3rd in terms of number of farmers. This can be attributed to highly mechanized operation and vast plantation of rice. The same is true with Gen. Trias and Naic, known as the rice producing municipalities in Cavite. The number of farmers increased by 6.5% that corresponds to around 3,097 farmers. The increase in the number of farmers was due to worldwide recession which led to work displacement of some Caviteños. Silang is dominated by pineapple and coffee plantations as well as with cutflower production. { http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/Economic%20Sector-Agriculture.pdf } [ Industry and commerce ] Despite the challenges of the worldwide economic crisis, the province of Cavite was able to maintain the number of industrial locators in the province. The crisis had a minimal effect in terms of number of industrial establishments f rom 805 in 2008 down to 798 in 2009. Majority of these industrial establishments have been operating in District V (266) followed by District I (262) and District IV ranks third with 123. Among the cities and municipalities, Rosario has a record of the highest number of these industrial establishments (259), followed by the municipalities of Carmona with 194 and Dasmariñas City with 123. As observed, more businessmen have been encouraged to establish business outsource manufacturing jobs in Cavite knowing that the province offers lower cost of labor and shows higher manpower capability The number of industrial establishments is stable at 798 in 2009. This is 0.87% l ower than that of 2008 (805). Despite the worldwide economic crisis, Cavite managed to maintain the number of its industrial locators. Though in some industrial estates, there are companies who shut down their operations, still there are other s that opted to locate in the Province. Despite the decr ease, the total number of industri al locator s remains higher than i ts value from the year 2002 to 2009. This only shows the confidence that the industri es have to the province of Cavite as one of the most sought location for industrial establishments. Land use plan of the province defines the location of industrial zones for the strategic provision and optimization of support facilities needed by industries. Cavite has established a total of 46 economic zones/industrial estates, 27 are operating, 7 are proclaimed and 12 are still in the process of development. In terms of number of economic zones, District V has the majority of these with 16 industrial zones/estates followed by District VI with 15. Cavite has twelve (1 2) economic zones with status of development in progress. These are economic zones that are still doing some land development and are not yet fully occupied by locators. The largest economic zone under development is located in Gen. Trias, the PEC Industrial Park with 177 hectares intended for garments, textiles, semiconductors, food processing and pharmaceuticals. The total area of economic zones which development is still in progress is 1,095.5 hectares. This would mean a lot of available resources to accommodate the incoming investments and industrial locators in Cavite.

Bambao [ History ] Cavite Hymn Cavite is named as the Historical Capital of the Philippines. It is the cradle of Philippine Revolution, and the birthplace of Philippine Independence. [ Spain 1785 ] { Filipino workers and military personnel } [ Spain 1785 ] { Felipe Ginoves } { Sgt. Ferdinand La Madrid } { One regiment, four cannons } { Around 200 soldiers and laborers } Cavite got its name from a Tagalog word kawit (which means hook) owing to the hook-shaped land on the Old Spanish map. The land was formerly known as &quot; Tangway &quot; where Spanish authorities constructed a fort from which the city of Cavite rose. Archeological evidence in coastal areas show prehistorical settlements. According to local folklore, the earliest settlers of Cavite came from Sulu or Borneo. In the 17th century, encomiendas or Spanish Royal land grants were given in Cavite and Maragondon. Jesuit priests brought in settlers from Mollucas. These settlers, known as &quot; Mardicas, &quot; setOther settlements grew and by the turn of the century, Cavite towns were already trading with one another. Traditional industries began to thrive as Manila&apos;s commerce grew. In 1872, Filipinos launched their revolt against Spain. Three Filipino priests— Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora —were implicated in the Cavite mutiny when 200 Filipinos staged a rebellion within Spanish garrisons. On August 28, 1896, when the revolution against Spain broke out, Cavite became a bloody theater of war. Led by Emilio Aguinaldo, Caviteños made lightning raids on Spanish headquarters, and soon liberated the entire province. Aguinaldo commanded the Revolution to its successful end: the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, on June 12, 1898 in Kawit, the first constitutional republic in Asia, and third established overall, after the Lanfang Republic in 1777, and the Republic of Formosa in 1895. Cavite proudly stands as a place with a glorious past. Its warm and friendly people, whose ancestors came down with a noble cause, manifest industry and patience in various skills and professions, openly receptive to the entry and exchange of culture and technology that are of value to the province. In 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces entered Cavite, which was long the site of a major US naval base serving the United States Asiatic Fleet. The military built of founding general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active on 1942 to 1946 and the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active again on 1944 to 1946 and stationed in Cavite during the Japanese Occupation.

After the conflict insurgencies in Cavite on 1944, local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units and Caviteňo resistance was over to retreating by the Japanese forces.

Remulla, Jr. (2010 - present) [ People and culture ] [ Culture and Traditions ] Caviteños are very proud of their majestic and interesting cuture and traditions. Aside from the celebrations of town fiestas, the province of Cavite celebrates festivals as forms of thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest and in honor of its patron saints. Some of these festivals are also observed in honor of the historical legacies passed from one generation to another generation. In fact, the province fetes the renowned Kalayaan Festival which is given a great social importance in commemoration of the heroism of its people. [ Population ] Cavite has a total population of 2,856,765 recorded in the 2007 Census, within an area of 1,512.4  km² making it the most populous (if independent cities are excluded from Cebu and Negros Occidental ), and the second most densely-populated province in the country. The tremendous increase can be observed in the year 1990 when industrialization was introduced in the province. Investors established their businesses in different industrial estates that magnetized people to migrate to Cavite due to job opportunities the province offers. Another factor attributed to the increase of population is the mushrooming of housing subdivisions. Since Cavite is proximate to Metro Manila, people working in the metropolitan area choose to live in the province together with their families. Natural increase also contributes to the increase in population. As of January 2011, Cavite is estimated by the Provincial Population Office to have 3.3 million people, giving a density of 2,182 people per square km. { http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/297358/cavite-population-balloons-33-million Cavite population balloons to 3.3 million } Among the cities and municipalities in Cavite, the city of Dasmariñas has the biggest population with 556,330 people while the municipality of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo has registered the smallest population with 17,818 people. Cavite is a highly urbanized growth center of the country. It is classified as predominantly urban having 90.69 percent of the population are concentrated in the urban areas, while 9.21 percent of the population reside in rural areas. Since year 2000, urban population increased which can be attributed to in-migration due to expansion of residential areas as well as influx of commercial establishments, services and facilities. [ Languages ] The main languages spoken are Tagalog, Chabacano and English. Chabacano, sometimes spelled as Chavacano, is a creole originally spoken by majority of the Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after the arrival of the Spaniards three centuries ago. Around 30000 Caviteños speak Chabacano. Due to Cavite&apos;s proximity to Metro Manila a large number of people have moved from farther provinces, resulting in a significant usage of Bikol, Cebuano and Ilokano. [ Religion ] In line with national statistics, the majority (70%) of the population are Roman Catholic while adherents of the Aglipayan Church account for 20% and the Iglesia ni Cristo account for 4% of the population. Other Christian sects and Muslims comprise the remainder. However, the strong presence of the Christian Churches such as the mainline Evangelical Churches (UNIDA, IEMELIF, Methodist, UCCP, Baptist and Assemblies Of God), Christian Fellowships (Jesus Is Lord, Bread of Life, Christ&apos;s Commission Fellowship, Jesus Christ Spreading the Good News), and other Christian Churches such as the United Pentecostal Churches and numerous Oneness groups, have increased the population of the other Christian Churches. This may now account for about 5% of the total Cavite population. [ Notable people ] [ April 2012 ] [ April 2012 ] [ April 2012 ] Kaye Abad ( Imus, Cavite ) is a Filipina actress.

Provincial roads made stretch to an approximate total length of 335.1 kilometers. Most of these roads are concrete, some are paved with asphalt and the rest remain gravel roads. Majority of the municipal/city roads are paved with concrete, while barangay roads consist of 46.7% concrete and asphalt roads and 53.3% earth and gravel roads. } There are three main highways transversing through the province: the Aguinaldo Highway that runs in a general north-south direction; the Governor&apos;s Drive the runs in a general east-west direction and the A. Soriano Highway that runs within the coastal towns on the west. The existing road length computed in terms of road density with respect to population at the standard of 2.4 kilometers per 1,000 population has a deficit of 3,532.71 kilometers. Cavite&apos;s transport infrastructure has not kept in pace with the mushrooming of industrial and commercial activities resulting to quilts of urban sprawl, traffic congestion and increased road accidents. The section of Aguinaldo Highway (at Bacoor, Imus and Dasmariñas) serving as a major link between the province and the national capital Manila is currently experiencing traffic volume 20% in excess of its designed capacity. Without any drastic improvements in the road network of Cavite, this same section will be saddled with traffic volumes 5 times more than its capacity in 2005 and 11 times more in 2015. Current entrance and exit routes to and from Cavite are no longer sufficient to decongest traffic along major thoroughfares. The lack of transportation facilities, traffic control systems and insufficient road signages, substandard road structures, prioritization of intersecting streets/alleys against major roads, dangerous electric posts at outer lanes in some areas further aggravate to the worsening transportation situation. Likewise, observed mixed traffic (pedestrian, public transport modes – jeepneys, tricycles, cars) along streets/roads, especially in the business districts add up to the traffic problem. The national and local government is taking the serious transportation problems lightly which results to stress and dismay of many Cavite residents. Everyday, hordes of employees eager to go for work trooped and lined up for hours along major roads in Bacoor and Imus municipalities. Public transports like buses, jeepneys, and AUs bound to and from the province are always jam-packed like sardine cans. It usually takes a staggering two (2) hours to travel from Imus to Baclaran/Pasay Rotonda (Metro Manila) and vice versa, which is only around 20 kilometers. But, in 2011, under the administration of Governor Juanito Victor C. Remulla, Jr.,the Cavite Express Way (Cavitex) was opened, which lessened the heavy volume of vehicles passing in Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor. Residents living near the coasts of Cavite like Cavite City and Noveleta, can now swiftly travel from Metro Manila into their towns and vice versa, using Cavitex and not-needing to pass in the original heavy traffic route (which passes from Aguinaldo Highway and to Tirona Highway). This project lessened the traffic in Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor, so travel time from Imus to Baclaran/Pasay now only takes one hour of travel.

The project aims to expand the existing LRT Line 1 service southward to the cities of Parañaque and Las Piñas and the adjoining municipalities of Bacoor, Imus and the city of Dasmariñas, in the Cavite Province. The 27-km route of the light railway system was planned to carry a capacity of 40,000 passengers per direction per hour. The extension will have 48 air-conditioned coaches, 12-four car trains, 10 passenger stations and a satellite depot in Cavite.
