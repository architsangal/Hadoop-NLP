He was elected as Labour Member of Parliament for West Bromwich East in 1974, after which he moved to live in Buglawton. He retained links with the Bredbury area, serving for a time as a director of Stockport County football club, which he is now once again as of 2010. He held a number of government posts. He was the member who formally proposed Michael Martin to be the new Speaker in 2000. He stood down in the 2001 election and was made a life peer as Baron Snape, of Wednesbury in the County of West Midlands in 2004. During the 1992 General Election campaign, Conservative MP Edwina Currie poured a glass of orange juice over Snape shortly after an edition of the Midlands -based debate show Central Weekend had finished airing.

Whitney 29 March 1992 3 June 2009 ] Speaking about the incident later, Currie said, &quot; I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought &apos;I know how to shut you up.&apos; &quot; Snape subsequently won £15,000 after Currie &quot; falsely suggested in her memoirs that it happened after Snape had been &apos;drinking vodka in a club with cronies&apos;. &quot; [ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1133037/BLACK-DOG-Edwina-slur-Snape-sue.html BLACK DOG: Edwina slur that made Snape sue Daily Mail 31-1-2009 3-12-2010 ] [ Controversy ] [ September 2011 ] [ 2009 cash for influence scandal ] In late-January 2009 it was alleged by the Sunday Times newspaper that Lord Snape was one of 4 Labour Lords who had agreed to back legislative changes in the House of Lords that were favourable to &quot; big business &quot; in exchange for a cash retainer. Two Sunday Times reporters, posing as lobbyists for a foreign company looking to set up a chain of shops in the UK, had approached several peers to see if they could be bribed to help the company to obtain an exemption from the Business Rates Supplements Bill. Snape reportedly agreed to do so, in exchange for a fee of £24,000. { Whispered over tea and cake: price for a peer to fix the law, Sunday Times, 25 January 2009 } [ Acquittal ] Although the Lords&apos; Sub-Committee found that Lord Snape &quot; expressed a clear willingness to breach the Code of Conduct &quot;, { The Conduct of Lord Moonie, Lord Snape, Lord Truscott and Lord Taylor of Blackburn Lords&apos; Committee on Privileges } the Privileges Committee considered the matter and took further evidence, concluding that he did not &quot; express clear willingness to [act] in return for financial inducement, &quot;.
