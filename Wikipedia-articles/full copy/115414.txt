The city population was 11,196 according to the 2010 census. [ History ] Somerset was first settled in 1798 by Thomas Hansford and several members of the Jasper family and it received its name from Somerset County, New Jersey, the place where some of the settlers once lived. Somerset became the county seat of Pulaski County in 1802 and was incorporated as a city in 1887. A significant Civil War battle was fought at Mill Springs (now &quot; Nancy &quot; ) about [ 8 mi km ] west of Somerset, and a museum exists at the site of the battle. The completion of Lake Cumberland in 1950 transformed Somerset from a sleepy rural community into one of the largest recreation centers in Kentucky drawing more than 1.7 million visitors yearly, the bulk of which occurs between the Memorial and Labor Day holidays. Lake Cumberland is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world (101 miles in length, with an average depth of [ 85 ft m ] and a normal pool containing more than 2 trillion gallons of water). Somerset is also close to Cumberland Falls and the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area; its tourism industries are, in part, due to its scenic and varied landscape. [ 6 ]. [ Geography and climate ] Somerset is located at [ 37 4 59 N 84 36 34 W type:city ] (37.082966, -84.609387) [ 1 ], and the downtown (central) part of the city is at an elevation of around 750–800 feet above sea level. The city is located at the eastern end of Kentucky&apos;s &quot; Mississippian Plateau &quot; (or &quot; Pennyroyal &quot; ); however, the micropolitan area extends eastward into the &quot; Appalachian Plateau &quot; (or &quot; Eastern Kentucky Coalfields &quot; ), and northward to Kentucky&apos;s &quot; Outer Bluegrass &quot; region. Thus, the area shows significant variations in landform and scenery. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 11.3 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 11.3 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and 0.09% is water.

The micropolitan area, as compared to the incorporated city, is more suburban in flavor and has a significantly younger housing stock, a higher income, and contains most of the area&apos;s school age population. Over the last 20 years, significant housing growth has occurred along the Fishing Creek tributary of Lake Cumberland, which lies just to the west of the City of Somerset, and along the main body of Lake Cumberland between the City of Burnside and Fishing Creek. Much of the Somerset area housing growth in the last 20 years is decidedly lake-oriented. As of the census [ 2 ] of 2000, there were 11,352 people, 4,831 households, and 2,845 families residing within the City of Somerset (proper). The population density for the city proper was 1,007.1 persons per square mile (388.9/km²). A large karst valley occupies the south-central portion of the city, taking up about 25% of the land area; this valley is quasi-industrialized and also contains parks and recreational facilities; most of the population lies to the east and north of this valley in fairly compact and well-kept residential neighborhoods that have a real population density of about 1,800 persons per square mile.

[ Local Economy ] Tourism is economic for Somerset, due to its proximity to Lake Cumberland and other events. Lake Cumberland alone generates approximately $150 million dollars in revenue each year. { The Governor’s Interagency Services Office for the Lake Cumberland Region 2007-2008 Report. Retrieved on 2008-04-06. } The city holds the annual Master Musician&apos;s Festival. Somerset is home to the Somernites Cruise, the largest monthly car show in the state. The Civil War Battle of Mill Springs took place in nearby Nancy, KY and the reenactments held there often draw large crowds. In November 2006, the Mill Springs Battlefield Visitor Center and Museum opened. Their efforts focus on the preservation of the battlefield while providing educational resources to visitors. Commerce, driven in part by the area&apos;s tourism, thrives in Somerset. The city is home to a small mall and several shopping centers. Most of these stores, as well as many restaurants and hotels are located along U.S. Route 27, making up the state&apos;s longest stretch of businesses outside of Louisville and Lexington. Just outside Somerset, located off Highway 461, is the Valley Oak Technology Complex, a key industrial center in the region. [ February 2009 ] Housed there are such companies as Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Safeauto, Blackboard Student Services and others. Somerset&apos;s location along Lake Cumberland has caused it to become a major houseboat manufacturing center. The city also has auto-associated, flooring, wood-associated, and other industries. Somerset has also increasingly been taking on the functions of a major medical center. In 2006, a new [ 58 acre m2 on ] medical park, called MedPark West, was finished near the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital (LCRH). Since completion, several new medical practices have opened there. LCRH is one of the largest in the state and is surrounded by many doctor&apos;s offices and pharmacies. LCRH is regional hub for the region&apos;s only advanced medical services. LCRH is a JACHO accredited hospital with 304 beds.

[ Local schools ] There are several schools in the county, served by two main school systems - Somerset Independent and Pulaski County. Students living within the city limits typically fall under the Somerset Independent school district. The Pulaski County School System contains Pulaski County High School (PCHS) and Southwestern High School (SWHS), which was built in 1993 to alleviate overcrowding. There are several other smaller schools, including Tabernacle Christian Academy, Science Hill Independent, Somerset Christian School, and Saline Christian Academy. The four main high schools are Southwestern, Pulaski County, Somerset, and Somerset Christian. There is a local two-year college, Somerset Community College, part of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS).
