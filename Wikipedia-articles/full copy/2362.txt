[ Immunoglobulin the immunoglobulin family Immunoglobulin superfamily ] [ Antibodies the film Antibodies (film) ] Each antibody binds to a specific antigen; an interaction similar to a lock and key. An antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin, is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cell s that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and virus es. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen. [ Charles Janeway Immunobiology. 5th Garland Publishing 2001 (electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf), 2 0-8153-3642-X ] [ Litman GW, Rast JP, Shamblott MJ, Haire RN, Hulst M, Roess W, Litman RT, Hinds-Frey KR, Zilch A, Amemiya CT Phylogenetic diversification of immunoglobulin genes and the antibody repertoire Mol. Biol. Evol. 10 1 60–72 1993 January 8450761 ] Each tip of the &quot; Y &quot; of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system. [ Pier GB, Lyczak JB, Wetzler LM Immunology, Infection, and Immunity ASM Press 2004 1-55581-246-5 ] Antibodies are produced by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cell s, or memory B cell s that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. [ Borghesi L, Milcarek C From B cell to plasma cell: regulation of V(D)J recombination and antibody secretion Immunol. Res. 36 1–3 27–32 2006 17337763 10.1385/IR:36:1:27 ] In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. [ 10.1146/annurev.iy.11.040193.001555 Parker D T cell-dependent B cell activation Annu Rev Immunol 11 1 331–360 1993 8476565 ] Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretion s to continue to survey for invading microorganisms. Antibodies are glycoprotein s belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. [ Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG Human Physiology 4th Thomson Learning 2002 0-534-42174-1 ] Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chain s and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. [ Market E, Papavasiliou FN V(D)J recombination and the evolution of the adaptive immune system PLoS Biol. 1 1 E16 2003 October 14551913 212695 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000016 ] Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different target, known as an antigen. [ Charles Janeway Immunobiology. 5th Garland Publishing 2001 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call%3Dbv.View..ShowTOC%26amp%3Brid%3Dimm.TOC%26amp%3Bdepth%3D10 978-0-8153-3642-6, 2 ] This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. [ Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG Human Physiology 4th Thomson Learning 2002 978-0-534-42174-8 ] The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutation s in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. [ Diaz M, Casali P Somatic immunoglobulin hypermutation Curr Opin Immunol 14 2 235–240 2002 11869898 10.1016/S0952-7915(02)00327-8 ] Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system. [ Forms ] Surface immunoglobulin (Ig) is attached to the membrane of the effector B cells by its transmembrane region, while antibodies are the secreted form of Ig and lack the trans membrane region so that antibodies can be secreted into the bloodstream and body cavities. As a result, surface Ig and antibodies are identical except for the transmembrane regions. Therefore, they are considered two forms of antibodies: soluble form or membrane-bound form (Parham 21-22). The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It is part of the B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. [ Parker D T cell-dependent B cell activation Annu. Rev. Immunol. 11 1 331–360 1993 8476565 10.1146/annurev.iy.11.040193.001555 ] The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimer s, which are capable of signal transduction.

Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors. These patches may improve the efficiency of the cellular immune response. [ Tolar P, Sohn HW, Pierce SK Viewing the antigen-induced initiation of B-cell activation in living cells Immunol.

It has been shown to activate basophils and mast cells to produce antimicrobial factors.

IgM 1 Expressed on the surface of B cells (monomer) and in a secreted form (pentamer) with very high avidity. Eliminates pathogens in the early stages of B cell mediated (humoral) immunity before there is sufficient IgG. Antibodies can come in different varieties known as isotypes or classes. In placental mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. They are each named with an &quot; Ig &quot; prefix that stands for immunoglobulin, another name for antibody, and differ in their biological properties, functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted in the table. [ Woof J, Burton D Human antibody-Fc receptor interactions illuminated by crystal structures. Nat Rev Immunol 4 2 89–99 2004 15040582 10.1038/nri1266 ] The antibody isotype of a B cell changes during cell development and activation. Immature B cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, are known as naïve B cells and express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form. B cells begin to express both IgM and IgD when they reach maturity—the co-expression of both these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell &apos;mature&apos; and ready to respond to antigen. [ Goding J Allotypes of IgM and IgD receptors in the mouse: a probe for lymphocyte differentiation Contemp Top Immunobiol 8 203–43 1978 357078 ] B cell activation follows engagement of the cell bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and differentiate into an antibody producing cell called a plasma cell. In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a secrete d form rather than a membrane -bound form. Some daughter cell s of the activated B cells undergo isotype switching, a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system. [ Structure ] Antibodies are heavy (~150  k Da ) globular plasma protein s. They have sugar chains added to some of their amino acid residues. [ Mattu T, Pleass R, Willis A, Kilian M, Wormald M, Lellouch A, Rudd P, Woof J, Dwek R The glycosylation and structure of human serum IgA1, Fab, and Fc regions and the role of N-glycosylation on Fc alpha receptor interactions J Biol Chem 273 4 2260–2272 1998 9442070 10.1074/jbc.273.4.2260 ] In other words, antibodies are glycoprotein s. The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) monomer (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be dimeric with two Ig units as with IgA, tetrameric with four Ig units like teleost fish IgM, or pentamer ic with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM. [ Roux K Immunoglobulin structure and function as revealed by electron microscopy Int Arch Allergy Immunol 120 2 85–99 1999 10545762 10.1159/000024226 ] { β-strand s. } The variable parts of an antibody are its V regions, and the constant part is its C region. [ Immunoglobulin domains ] The Ig monomer is a &quot; Y &quot; -shaped molecule that consists of four polypeptide chains; two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains connected by disulfide bond s. Each chain is composed of structural domain s called immunoglobulin domain s. These domains contain about 70-110 amino acid s and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function. [ Barclay A Membrane proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains - a master superfamily of interaction molecules Semin Immunol 15 4 215–223 2003 14690046 10.1016/S1044-5323(03)00047-2 ] They have a characteristic immunoglobulin fold in which two beta sheet s create a “sandwich” shape, held together by interactions between conserved cysteine s and other charged amino acids. [ Heavy chain ] [ Immunoglobulin heavy chain ] There are five types of mammalian Ig heavy chain denoted by the Greek letters : α, δ, ε, γ, and μ. The type of heavy chain present defines the class of antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively. Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, while μ and ε have approximately 550 amino acid s. { Fab region 2. } { Fc region 3. } { Heavy chain (blue) with one variable (V H ) domain followed by a constant domain (C H 1), a hinge region, and two more constant (C H 2 and C H 3) domains. 4. } { Light chain (green) with one variable (V L ) and one constant (C L ) domain 5. Antigen binding site (paratope) 6. Hinge regions. } In bird s, the major serum antibody, also found in yolk, is called IgY. It is quite different from mammalian IgG. However, in some older literature and even on some commercial life sciences product websites it is still called &quot; IgG &quot;, which is incorrect and can be confusing. Each heavy chain has two regions, the constant region and the variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain. [ Light chain ] [ Immunoglobulin light chain ] In mammals there are two types of immunoglobulin light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in lower vertebrate s like sharks ( Chondrichthyes ) and bony fishes ( Teleostei ). [ CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc Regions ] Some parts of an antibody have unique functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind two antigens (in general identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the Fab (fragment, antigen binding) region. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody. [ Putnam FW, Liu YS, Low TL Primary structure of a human IgA1 immunoglobulin. IV. Streptococcal IgA1 protease, digestion, Fab and Fc fragments, and the complete amino acid sequence of the alpha 1 heavy chain J Biol Chem 254 8 2865–74 1979 107164 ] The paratope is shaped at the amino terminal end of the antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the F V region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. More specifically, variable loops of β-strands, three each on the light (V L ) and heavy (V H ) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining region s (CDRs).The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al. [ 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1354 Al-Lazikani B, Lesk AM, Chothia C Standard conformations for the canonical structures of immunoglobulins J Mol Biol 273 4 927–948 1997 9367782 ] and more recently by North et al. [ North B, Lehmann A, Dunbrack RL A new clustering of antibody CDR loop conformations J Mol Biol 406 2 228–256 2010 21035459 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.10.030 3065967 ] In the framework of the immune network theory, CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes. The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of Fc receptor s, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of opsonized particles, lysis of cells, and degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. [ Heyman B Complement and Fc-receptors in regulation of the antibody response Immunol Lett 54 2–3 195–199 1996 9052877 10.1016/S0165-2478(96)02672-7 ] [ Function ] [ Immune system ] Activated B cells differentiate into either antibody-producing cells called plasma cell s that secrete soluble antibody or memory cells that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.

Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: they prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune response s such as the complement pathway. [ Ravetch J, Bolland S IgG Fc receptors Annu Rev Immunol 19 1 275–290 2001 11244038 10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275 ] { IgM has five Ig units. Each Ig unit (labeled 1) has two epitope binding } { Fab region s, so IgM is capable of binding up to 10 epitopes. } [ Activation of complement ] Antibodies that bind to surface antigens on, for example, a bacterium attract the first component of the complement cascade with their Fc region and initiate activation of the &quot; classical &quot; complement system. This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways. First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by phagocyte s in a process called opsonization; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade. Secondly, some complement system components form a membrane attack complex to assist antibodies to kill the bacterium directly. [ Rus H, Cudrici C, Niculescu F The role of the complement system in innate immunity Immunol Res 33 2 103–112 2005 16234578 10.1385/IR:33:2:103 ] [ Activation of effector cells ] To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, causing them to agglutinate. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region. Those cells which recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors which, as the name suggests, interacts with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cell s and neutrophil s will degranulate, natural killer cell s will release cytokine s and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens. [ Natural antibodies ] Humans and higher primates also produce “natural antibodies” which are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or passive immunization. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide galactose α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut. [ Racaniello, Vincent http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ 2009-10-06 Natural antibody protects against viral infection Virology Blog 2010-01-22 http://www.webcitation.org/5uJzysytc 2010-11-17 no ] Rejection of xenotransplantated organs is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.

Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. [ Mian I, Bradwell A, Olson A Structure, function and properties of antibody binding sites J Mol Biol 217 1 133–151 1991 1988675 10.1016/0022-2836(91)90617-F ] It has been estimated that humans generate about 10  billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. [ Fanning LJ, Connor AM, Wu GE Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 79 1 1–14 1996 8612345 10.1006/clin.1996.0044 ] Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of gene s available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes. [ Nemazee D Receptor editing in lymphocyte development and central tolerance Nat Rev Immunol 6 10 728–740 2006 16998507 10.1038/nri1939 ] [ Domain variability ] The complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are shown in red ( 1IGT ) The region (locus) of a chromosome that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct genes for each domain of the antibody—the locus containing heavy chain genes ( IGH@ ) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes ( IGL@ and IGK@ ) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining region s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below. { Peter Parham. &quot; The Immune System. 2nd ed. Garland Science: New York, 2005. pg.47-62 } [ V(D)J recombination ] [ V%28D%29J recombination ] Simplified overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genome s of mammal s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different paratopes, and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (e.i. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells. [ 22234685 ] After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as allelic exclusion ) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain. [ Bergman Y, Cedar H A stepwise epigenetic process controls immunoglobulin allelic exclusion Nat Rev Immunol 4 10 753–761 2004 15459667 10.1038/nri1458 ] [ Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation ] For more details on this topic, see Somatic hypermutation and Affinity maturation Following activation with antigen, B cells begin to proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains. This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody’s antigen-binding affinity. [ Honjo T, Habu S Origin of immune diversity: genetic variation and selection Annu Rev Biochem 54 1 803–830 1985 3927822 10.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.004103 ] Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity). [ Or-Guil M, Wittenbrink N, Weiser AA, Schuchhardt J Recirculation of germinal center B cells: a multilevel selection strategy for antibody maturation Immunol. Rev. 216 130–41 2007 17367339 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00507.x ] B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cell s. [ Neuberger M, Ehrenstein M, Rada C, Sale J, Batista F, Williams G, Milstein C Memory in the B-cell compartment: antibody affinity maturation Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 355 1395 357–360 2000 March 10794054 1692737 10.1098/rstb.2000.0573 ] Mechanism of class switch recombination that allows isotype switching in activated B cells [ Class switching ] Isotype or class switching is a biological process occurring after activation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naïve B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function, therefore, after activation, an antibody with a IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment. [ Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT Evolution of isotype switching Semin. Immunol. 16 4 257–275 2004 15522624 10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005 ] Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of enzyme s at two selected S-regions.

If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected, or the infection occurred a very long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed. In clinical immunology, levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient.

For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis. Autoimmune disorder s can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body&apos;s own epitope s; many can be detected through blood test s.

During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother&apos;s system. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. [ Urbaniak S, Greiss M RhD haemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn Blood Rev 14 1 44–61 2000 10805260 10.1054/blre.1999.0123 ] Rho(D) immune globulin antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D (RhD) antigen.

Treatment of a mother with Anti-RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother&apos;s system from the fetus. Importantly, this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to &quot; remember &quot; Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rhesus antigens of the current or subsequent babies. Rho(D) Immune Globulin treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to Rh disease, but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.
