[ September 2011 ] Number of Governors of Minnesota by party affiliation Table lists John Lind as a member of the Democratic Party. He was also endorsed by the Populist Party and the Silver Republican Party. Jesse Ventura left the Reform Party in the middle of his term and later joined the Independence Party of Minnesota. Party Governors Republican / Independent-Republican 25 Democratic-Farmer-Labor 6 Democratic 5 Farmer-Labor 3 Reform / Independence 1 The following is a list of Governors of the state of Minnesota and Minnesota Territory. The governor serves as head of the executive branch of the state&apos;s government and is charged with ensuring the faithful execution of the state&apos;s laws. [ con a 1 ] He or she is empowered to name state commissioners and department heads and to approve or veto bills passed by the legislature. [ amend b 1 ] The governor also serves as commander-in-chief of the state&apos;s military and navy forces. Henry H. Sibley was elected the first governor in a statewide election held on October 13, 1857 and took office following Minnesota&apos;s entry into the Union as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858. [ blue [c] ] At the time, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected on separate ballots to terms lasting two years. Prior to 1886, statewide elections were held on odd years. Because of this change (the result of an 1883 state constitutional amendment), Lucius F. Hubbard&apos;s second term as governor lasted three years. With the passage of a 1958 state constitutional amendment, the terms of governor and lieutenant governor increased to four-years in 1963. [ amend b 2 ] A 1972 state constitutional amendment provided for the joint election of the governor and lieutenant governor starting in 1974. The numerals indicate the consecutive time in office served by a single person. For example, William R. Marshall served two consecutive terms and is counted as the fifth state governor (not the fifth and sixth). Henry A. Swift assumed the governorship after the resignation of Alexander Ramsey, serving out the remainder of what would have been Ramsey&apos;s second term. The fact that Swift was not voted into office does not affect the numbering, which makes him the 3rd governor. Rudy Perpich served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 34th and the 36th governor. Because of this, the list below contains 40 governorships, but only 39 people. Prior to its organization as a territory, portions of Minnesota were part of the Northwest Territory, Indiana Territory, Louisiana Territory (later renamed Missouri Territory ), Illinois Territory, Michigan Territory, Wisconsin Territory, and Iowa Territory; see the lists of governors of Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa for this period. Four governors were born outside the United States; Knute Nelson in Norway, John Lind and Adolph O. Eberhart in Sweden and Hjalmar Petersen in Denmark. Only 16 of the 40 governors of Minnesota have been born in Minnesota. Five governors have resigned from office and three have died in office.
