Stantonbury is a district of Milton Keynes, ceremonial Buckinghamshire, England. { Parishes in Milton Keynes - Milton Keynes Council. } It is situated at the northern edge, between Great Linford and Wolverton. It is largely residential, but the greater proportion is taken up by two secondary school s ( Stantonbury Campus and Bury Lawn ), a leisure centre with a 25m swimming pool, and an all-weather, competition standard, athletics track. Stantonbury is one of the former village s of Buckinghamshire that were absorbed into the new city of Milton Keynes in the 1960s.

The brook valley here is part of the flood control system and there is a permanent wetland with associated plants and wild-life. Bancroft Park The foundations of a Romano-British farm known as Bancroft Roman Villa are to be seen in what is now the North Loughton Park, overlooking the Shenley Brook. [ R.J. Williams R. Zeepvat A late Bronze Age/Iron Age Settlement, Roman Villa and Temple/Mausoleum Monograph 7 Buckinghamshire Archaeological Society 1994 Aylesbury ] The famous Concrete Cows are at the southern end of the park. Bancroft is a haven for birds and one of the best places to see the bright but elusive Kingfisher. This is because of the wide variety of habitats the The Parks Trust has created, from old grassland managed as wildflower meadows, through patches of thorn scrub to extensive marsh. In the spring and you can see cowslips and salad burnet, giving way in summer to the colourful flowers of traditional hay meadow: ladies’ bedstraw and birdsfoot trefoil. Bancroft Petanque Piste, which can be found near the Roman villa site, is provided by the Parks Trust, free of charge, for anyone who fancies trying this popular game. Also known as Boule, Petanque is a traditional game played with steel balls on any sandy or gravelly surface across a large part of Europe. The Bancrofts comprise just half the H2/H3/V5/V6 grid square, which is divided by the West Coast Main Line that also is the parish boundary, with Stacey Bushes (in Wolverton and Greenleys parish) on the other side of the track. Monks Way (H3, A422 ) bounds the parish from the neighboring Bradwell.
