{ Computer components } Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer systems. [ IEEE Computer Society IEEE Computer Society ACM Computer Engineering 2004: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_ieeecs/ieeecs/education/cc2001/CCCE-FinalReport-2004Dec12-Final.pdf 2006-04-21 12 December 2004 iii Computer System engineering has traditionally been viewed as a combination of both electronic engineering (EE) and computer science (CS). ] Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering ), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microprocessor s, personal computer s, and supercomputer s, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. [ Trinity College Dublin http://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/about/what_is_eng/computer_eng_intro.html What is Computer System Engineering 2006-04-21 ] {, &quot; Computer engineers need not only to understand how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. Consider the car. A modern car contains many separate computer systems for controlling such things as the engine timing, the brakes and the air bags. To be able to design and implement such a car, the computer engineer needs a broad theoretical understanding of all these various subsystems &amp; how they interact. &quot; } Usual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and firmware for embedded microcontroller s, designing VLSI chips, designing analog sensors, designing mixed signal circuit board s, and designing operating system s. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motor s, communications, and sensor s. The first accredited computer engineering degree program in the United States was established at Case Western Reserve University in 1971. [ October 2004 ], there were 170 ABET -accredited computer engineering programs in the US.

As of October 2004, ABET has accredited over 170 computer engineering or similarly named programs. ] In Europe, accreditation of computer engineering schools is done by a variety of agencies part of the EQANIE network.Due to increasing job requirements for engineers, who can concurrently design hardware, software, firmware, and manage all forms of computer systems used in industry, some tertiary institutions around the world offer a bachelor&apos;s degree generally called computer engineering. Both computer engineering and electronic engineering programs include analog and digital circuit design in their curricula. As with most engineering disciplines, having a sound knowledge of mathematics and sciences is necessary for computer engineers. In many institutions, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year, because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one year of General Engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.
