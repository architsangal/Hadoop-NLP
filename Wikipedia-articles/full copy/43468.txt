E. Lawrence, was a British Army officer renowned especially for his liaison role during the Arab Revolt against Ottoman Turkish rule of 1916–18. The extraordinary breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as Lawrence of Arabia, a title which was used for the 1962 film based on his World War I activities. Lawrence was born illegitimate in Tremadog, Wales, in August 1888 to Sir Thomas Chapman and Sarah Junner, a governess who was herself illegitimate. Chapman had left his wife and first family in Ireland to live with Sarah Junner, and they called themselves Mr and Mrs Lawrence. In the summer of 1896 the Lawrences moved to Oxford, where in 1907–10 young Lawrence studied history at Jesus College, graduating with First Class Honours. He became a practising archaeologist in the Middle East, working at various excavations with David George Hogarth and Leonard Woolley. In 1908 he joined the OUOTC (Oxford University Officer Training Corps), undergoing a two-year training course.

Lawrence&apos;s public image was due in part to the sensationalised reportage of the revolt by an American journalist, Lowell Thomas, as well as to Lawrence&apos;s autobiographical account, Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1922).

Lawrence graduated with First Class Honours after submitting a thesis entitled The influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture – to the end of the 12th century based on his field research with Beeson in France, notably in Châlus, and his solo research in the Middle East.

Lawrence at Carchemish, ca. 1912 } On completing his degree in 1910, Lawrence commenced postgraduate research in mediaeval pottery with a Senior Demy, a form of scholarship, at Magdalen College, Oxford, which he abandoned after he was offered the opportunity to become a practising archaeologist in the Middle East. Lawrence was a polyglot whose published work demonstrates competence in French, Ancient Greek, and Arabic. { Leonard Woolley (&apos;&apos;right&apos;&apos;) at } { Carchemish, spring 1913 } In December 1910 he sailed for Beirut, and on arrival went to Jbail ( Byblos ), where he studied Arabic. He then went to work on the excavations at Carchemish, near Jerablus in northern Syria, where he worked under D. G. Hogarth and R. Campbell Thompson of the British Museum. He would later state that everything that he had accomplished, he owed to Hogarth. { T. E. Lawrence letters, 1927 } As the site lay near an important crossing on the Baghdad Railway, knowledge gathered there was of considerable importance to the military. While excavating ancient Mesopotamia n sites, Lawrence met Gertrude Bell, who was to influence him during his time in the Middle East. In late 1911, Lawrence returned to England for a brief sojourn. By November he was en route to Beirut for a second season at Carchemish, where he was to work with Leonard Woolley. Prior to resuming work there, however, he briefly worked with Flinders Petrie at Kafr Ammar in Egypt. Lawrence continued making trips to the Middle East as a field archaeologist until the outbreak of the First World War. In January 1914, Woolley and Lawrence were co-opted by the British military as an archaeological smokescreen for a British military survey of the Negev Desert. They were funded by the Palestine Exploration Fund to search for an area referred to in the Bible as the &quot; Wilderness of Zin &quot;; along the way, they undertook an archaeological survey of the Negev Desert. The Negev was of strategic importance, as it would have to be crossed by any Ottoman army attacking Egypt in the event of war. Woolley and Lawrence subsequently published a report of the expedition&apos;s archaeological findings, { http://web.archive.org/web/20061018191000/http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/WildZin.htm } but a more important result was an updated mapping of the area, with special attention to features of military relevance such as water sources. Lawrence also visited Aqaba and Petra. From March to May 1914, Lawrence worked again at Carchemish. Following the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914, Lawrence did not immediately enlist in the British Army; on the advice of S.F. Newcombe he held back until October, when he was commissioned on the General List. [ Arab revolt ] { Rabigh, north of } { Jidda, 1917 } [ Arab Revolt ] At the outbreak of the First World War Lawrence was a university post-graduate researcher who had for years travelled extensively within the Ottoman Empire provinces of the Levant ( Transjordan and Palestine ) and Mesopotamia ( Syria and Iraq ) under his own name. As such he became known to the Turkish Interior Ministry authorities and their German technical advisors. Lawrence came into contact with the Ottoman–German technical advisers, travelling over the German-designed, -built, and -financed railways during the course of his researches. [ December 2011 ] With his first-hand knowledge of Syria, the Levant, and Mesopotamia, Lawrence was in 1914 posted to Cairo on the Intelligence Staff of the GOC Middle East. { http://telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/life/chron_1914.shtml Outline Chronology: 1914 } Contrary to later myth, it was neither Lawrence nor the Army that conceived a campaign of internal insurgency against the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, but rather the Arab Bureau of Britain&apos;s Foreign Office. The Arab Bureau had long felt it likely that a campaign instigated and financed by outside powers, supporting the breakaway-minded tribes and regional challengers to the Turkish government&apos;s centralised rule of their empire, would pay great dividends in the diversion of effort that would be needed to meet such a challenge. The Arab Bureau had recognised the strategic value of what is today called the &quot; asymmetry &quot; of such conflict. The Ottoman authorities would have to devote from a hundred to a thousand times the resources to contain the threat of such an internal rebellion compared to the Allies&apos; cost of sponsoring it. [ March 2011 ] At that point in the Foreign Office&apos;s thinking, the region was not considered candidate territories for incorporation in the British Empire but only as an extension of the range of British Imperial influence and the weakening and destruction of a German ally, the Ottoman Empire. [ March 2011 ] During the war, Lawrence fought with Arab irregular troops under the command of Emir Faisal, a son of Sherif Hussein of Mecca, in extended guerrilla operations against the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire. He persuaded the Arabs not to make a frontal assault on the Ottoman stronghold in Medina but allowed the Turkish army to tie up troops in the city garrison. The Arabs were then free to direct most of their attention to the Turks&apos; weak point, the Hejaz railway that supplied the garrison. This vastly expanded the battlefield and tied up even more Ottoman troops, who were then forced to protect the railway and repair the constant damage. [ April 2012 ] [ Capture of Aqaba ] { Aqaba, 1917 } [ Battle of Aqaba ] In 1917, Lawrence arranged a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces under Auda Abu Tayi (until then in the employ of the Ottomans) against the strategically located but lightly defended { &apos;The bombardment of Akaba.&apos; The Naval Review. Volume IV. 1916. p.101-103 } { &apos;Egyptian Expeditionary Force. HMS Raven II Operations in the Gulf of Akaba. Red Sea. July–August 1916. National Archives, Kew London.

On 6 July, after a surprise overland attack, Aqaba fell to Lawrence and the Arab forces. After Aqaba, Lawrence was promoted to major. Fortunately for Lawrence, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, General Sir Edmund Allenby, agreed to his strategy for the revolt, stating after the war: &quot; I gave him a free hand. His cooperation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign. &quot; Lawrence now held a powerful position, as an adviser to Faisal and a person who had Allenby&apos;s confidence. [ Fall of Damascus ] The following year, Lawrence was involved in the build up to the capture of Damascus in the final weeks of the war. Much to his disappointment, and contrary to instructions he had issued, he was not present at the city&apos;s formal surrender, arriving several hours after the city had fallen. Lawrence entered Damascus around 9am on 1 October 1918, but was only the third arrival of the day, the first being the 10th Australian Light Horse Brigade, led by Major A.C.N. &apos;Harry&apos; Olden who formally accepted the surrender of the city from acting Governor Emir Said. { Barker, A. (1998) &quot; The Allies Enter Damascus &quot;, History Today, Volume 48 } { http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ReiKaOr-t1-g1-t9-body1-d3-d4.html } { Mitchell, Elyne (1971) Light Horse to Damascus } { http://www.jill-hamilton.com/pdf/first-to-damascus.pdf } { http://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2007/01/15/seeing-is-believing-more-on-the-taking-of-damascus/ } Despite his absence for the formal surrender, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in late 1918 for the role he had played in the capture of Damascus. Lawrence was reportedly embittered by having been beaten into the city by the Australians, and resented them for it later in his life. In his own recollections of the capture of Damascus he completely omitted the key role played by the Australians, and this error was widely believed and later repeated by many historians. { Mitchell, Elyne (1971) Light Horse to Damascus } { http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1572464/Australia-claims-it-captured-Damascus-first.html } In newly liberated Damascus—which he had envisaged as the capital of an Arab state—Lawrence was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal. Faisal&apos;s rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the battle of Maysaloun, when the French Forces of General Gouraud, under the command of General Mariano Goybet, entered Damascus, destroying Lawrence&apos;s dream of an independent Arabia. As was his habit when travelling before the war, Lawrence adopted many local customs and traditions (many photographs show him in the desert wearing white Arab dishdasha and riding camel s ). During the closing years of the war he sought, with mixed success, to convince his superiors in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests. The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work.

During this time Thomas and his cameraman Harry Chase shot a great deal of film and many photographs, which Thomas used in a highly lucrative film that toured the world after the war.

He served for much of 1921 as an advisor to Winston Churchill at the Colonial Office. On 17 May 1919, the Handley Page Type O carrying Lawrence on a flight to Egypt crashed at the airport of Roma-Centocelle. The pilot and co-pilot were killed; Lawrence came off with a broken shoulder blade and two broken ribs. { Friends of the Protestant Cemetery (Rome) newsletter, 2008 } During his brief hospitalisation, he was visited by King Victor Emanuel III. { RID Marzo 2012, Storia dell&apos;Handley Page type 0 } In August 1919, the American journalist Lowell Thomas launched a colourful photo show in London entitled With Allenby in Palestine which included a lecture, dancing, and music. { Murphy, David The Arab Revolt 1916-18, London: Osprey, 2008, page 86 } Initially, Lawrence played only a supporting role in the show, but when Thomas realized that it was the photos of Lawrence dressed as a Bedouin that had captured the public&apos;s imagination, he shot some more photos in London of him in Arab dress. With the new photos, Thomas re-launched his show as With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia in early 1920; it was extremely popular. Thomas&apos; shows made Lawrence, who until then had been rather obscure, into a household name. In August 1922, Lawrence enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman under the name John Hume Ross, at RAF Uxbridge. He was soon exposed and, in February 1923, was forced out of the RAF. He changed his name to T. E. Shaw and joined the Royal Tank Corps in 1923. He was unhappy there and repeatedly petitioned to rejoin the RAF, which finally readmitted him in August 1925. [ http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid%3D8998 T.E. Lawrence 23 October 2007 London Borough of Hillingdon 12 September 2010 ] A fresh burst of publicity after the publication of Revolt in the Desert (see below) resulted in his assignment to a remote base in British India in late 1926, where he remained until the end of 1928. At that time he was forced to return to Britain after rumours began to circulate that he was involved in espionage activities. { Emir Abdullah, Air Marshal Sir } { Geoffrey Salmond, Sir } { Herbert Samuel H.B.M. } { high commissioner and Sir } { Wyndham Deedes and others in } { Jerusalem. } He purchased several small plots of land in Chingford, built a hut and swimming pool there, and visited frequently. This was removed in 1930 when the Chingford Urban District Council acquired the land and passed it to the City of London Corporation, but re-erected the hut in the grounds of The Warren, Loughton, where it remains, neglected, today. Lawrence&apos;s tenure of the Chingford land has now been commemorated by a plaque fixed on the sighting obelisk on Pole Hill. He continued serving in the RAF based at Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, specialising in high-speed boats and professing happiness, and it was with considerable regret that he left the service at the end of his enlistment in March 1935. Lawrence was a keen motorcyclist, and, at different times, had owned seven Brough Superior motorcycles. { Title: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, Editor: Erwin Tragatsch, Publisher: New Burlington Books, Copyright: 1979 Quarto Publishing, Edition: 1988 Revised, Page 95, ISBN 0-906286-07-7 } His seventh motorcycle is on display at the Imperial War Museum. Among the books Lawrence is known to have carried with him on his military campaigns is Thomas Malory &apos;s Morte D&apos;Arthur. Accounts of the 1934 discovery of the Winchester Manuscript of the Morte include a report that Lawrence followed Eugene Vinaver —a Malory scholar—by motorcycle from Manchester to Winchester upon reading of the discovery in The Times. { Walter F. Oakeshott, &quot; The Finding of the Manuscript, &quot; Essays on Malory, J. A. W. Bennett, ed. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963 &amp; #93;: 1–6) } [ Death ] { Brough Superior SS100 } { Brough Superior, } { Imperial War Museum, } { London } At the age of 46, two months after leaving the service, Lawrence was fatally injured in an accident on his Brough Superior SS100 motorcycle in Dorset, close to his cottage, Clouds Hill, near Wareham. A dip in the road obstructed his view of two boys on their bicycles; he swerved to avoid them, lost control and was thrown over the handlebars. He died six days later on 19 May 1935. The spot is marked by a small memorial at the side of the road. The circumstances of Lawrence&apos;s death had far-reaching consequences. One of the doctors attending him was the neurosurgeon Hugh Cairns. He was profoundly affected by the incident, and consequently began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle dispatch riders through head injuries. His research led to the use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists. { Lawrence of Arabia, Sir Hugh Cairns, and the Origin of Motorcycle Helmets (accessed 2008-05-09) } Moreton Estate, which borders Bovington Camp, was owned by family cousins, the Frampton family. Lawrence had rented and later bought Clouds Hill from the Framptons. He had been a frequent visitor to their home, Okers Wood House, and had for years corresponded with Louisa Frampton. On Lawrence&apos;s death, his mother arranged with the Framptons for him to be buried in their family plot at Moreton Church. [ Kerrigan Michael Who Lies Where – A guide to famous graves 1998 Fourth Estate Limited London 1-85702-258-0 51 ] His coffin was transported on the Frampton estate&apos;s bier. Mourners included Winston and Clementine Churchill and Lawrence&apos;s youngest brother, Arnold. A bust of Lawrence was placed in the crypt at St Paul&apos;s Cathedral and a stone effigy by Eric Kennington remains in the Anglo-Saxon church of St Martin, Wareham. [ Writings ] Throughout his life, Lawrence was a prolific writer. A large portion of his output was epistolary; he often sent several letters a day. Several collections of his letters have been published. He corresponded with many notable figures, including George Bernard Shaw, Edward Elgar, Winston Churchill, Robert Graves, Noël Coward, E. M. Forster, Siegfried Sassoon, John Buchan, Augustus John and Henry Williamson. He met Joseph Conrad and commented perceptively on his works. The many letters that he sent to Shaw&apos;s wife, Charlotte, offer a revealing side of his character. [ T. E. Lawrence Correspondence with Bernard and Charlotte Shaw, 1922–1926 1 Jeremy and Nicole Wilson Castle Hill Press 2000 ] { Foreword by Jeremy Wilson. } In his lifetime, Lawrence published four major texts. Two were translation s : Homer &apos;s Odyssey, and The Forest Giant — the latter an otherwise forgotten work of French fiction. He received a flat fee for the second translation, and negotiated a generous fee plus royalties for the first. [ English translations of Homer#Lawrence ] [ Seven Pillars of Wisdom ] 14 Barton Street, London S.W.1, where Lawrence lived while writing &apos;&apos;Seven Pillars&apos;&apos;. Lawrence&apos;s major work is Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences. In 1919 he had been elected to a seven-year research fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, providing him with support while he worked on the book. In addition to being a memoir of his experiences during the war, certain parts also serve as essays on military strategy, Arabian culture and geography, and other topics. Lawrence re-wrote Seven Pillars of Wisdom three times; once &quot; blind &quot; after he lost the manuscript while changing trains at Reading railway station. The list of his alleged &quot; embellishments &quot; in Seven Pillars is long, though many such allegations have been disproved with time, most definitively in Jeremy Wilson &apos;s authorised biography. However Lawrence&apos;s own notebooks refute his claim to have crossed the Sinai Peninsula from Aqaba to the Suez Canal in just 49 hours without any sleep. In reality this famous camel ride lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping which Lawrence omitted when he wrote his book. { Asher, M (1998)&apos; Lawrence :The Uncrowned King of Arabia.&apos; Page 259. } Lawrence acknowledged having been helped in the editing of the book by George Bernard Shaw. In the preface to Seven Pillars, Lawrence offered his &quot; thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Shaw for countless suggestions of great value and diversity: and for all the present semicolon s. &quot; The first public edition was published in 1926 as a high-priced private subscription edition, printed in London by Roy Manning Pike and Herbert John Hodgson, with illustrations by Eric Kennington, Augustus John, Paul Nash, Blair Hughes-Stanton and his wife Gertrude Hermes. Lawrence was afraid that the public would think that he would make a substantial income from the book, and he stated that it was written as a result of his war service. He vowed not to take any money from it, and indeed he did not, as the sale price was one third of the production costs. { Graves, Robert, Lawrence and the Arabs, ch. 30. Jonathan Cape: London, 1927 } This left Lawrence in substantial debt. [ Revolt in the Desert ] { Augustus John, 1919 } Revolt in the Desert was an abridged version of Seven Pillars, which he began in 1926 and was published in March 1927 in both limited and trade editions. He undertook a needed but reluctant publicity exercise, which resulted in a best-seller. Again he vowed not to take any fees from the publication, partly to appease the subscribers to Seven Pillars who had paid dearly for their editions. By the fourth reprint in 1927, the debt from Seven Pillars was paid off. As Lawrence left for military service in India at the end of 1926, he set up the &quot; Seven Pillars Trust &quot; with his friend D. G. Hogarth as a trustee, in which he made over the copyright and any surplus income of Revolt in the Desert. He later told Hogarth that he had &quot; made the Trust final, to save myself the temptation of reviewing it, if Revolt turned out a best seller. &quot; The resultant trust paid off the debt, and Lawrence then invoked a clause in his publishing contract to halt publication of the abridgment in the UK. However, he allowed both American editions and translations, which resulted in a substantial flow of income. The trust paid income either into an educational fund for children of RAF officers who lost their lives or were invalided as a result of service, or more substantially into the RAF Benevolent Fund. [ Posthumous ] Lawrence left unpublished The Mint, { Doubleday,Doran &amp; Co, New York,1936; rprnt Penguin,Harmondsworth,1984 ISBN 0-14-004505-8 } a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force. For this, he worked from a notebook that he kept while enlisted, writing of the daily lives of enlisted men and his desire to be a part of something larger than himself: the Royal Air Force. The book is stylistically very different from Seven Pillars of Wisdom, using sparse prose as opposed to the complicated syntax found in Seven Pillars. It was published posthumously, edited by his brother, Professor A. W. Lawrence. After Lawrence&apos;s death, A. W. Lawrence inherited all Lawrence&apos;s estate and his copyrights as the sole beneficiary. To pay the inheritance tax, he sold the U.S. copyright of Seven Pillars of Wisdom (subscribers&apos; text) outright to Doubleday Doran in 1935. Doubleday still controls publication rights of this version of the text of Seven Pillars of Wisdom in the USA. In 1936 Prof. Lawrence split the remaining assets of the estate, giving Clouds Hill and many copies of less substantial or historical letters to the nation via the National Trust, and then set up two trusts to control interests in T. E. Lawrence&apos;s residual copyrights. To the original Seven Pillars Trust, Prof. Lawrence assigned the copyright in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, as a result of which it was given its first general publication. To the Letters and Symposium Trust, he assigned the copyright in The Mint and all Lawrence&apos;s letters, which were subsequently edited and published in the book T. E. Lawrence by his Friends (edited by A. W. Lawrence, London, Jonathan Cape, 1937). A substantial amount of income went directly to the RAF Benevolent Fund or for archaeological, environmental, or academic projects. The two trusts were amalgamated in 1986 and, on the death of Prof. A. W. Lawrence, the unified trust also acquired all the remaining rights to Lawrence&apos;s works that it had not owned, plus rights to all of Prof. Lawrence&apos;s works.

[ Sexuality ] Lawrence&apos;s biographers have discussed his sexuality at considerable length, and this discussion has spilled into the popular press. [ Simpson Colin Knightley Phillip Sunday Times June 1968 ] { The pieces appeared on the 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th of June, and were based mostly on the narrative of John Bruce. } There is no reliable evidence for consensual sexual intimacy between Lawrence and any person. His friends have expressed the opinion that he was asexual, [ T.E. Lawrence by his Friends 1937 ] { essay by E.H.R. Altounyan } [ The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia 1969 Knightley Phillip Simpson Colin 29 ] and Lawrence himself specifically denied, in multiple private letters, any personal experience of sex. [ The Letters of T.E. Lawrence Brown Malcolm 1988 ] { Letters to E.M. Forster, 21 Dec. 1927; to Robert Graves, 6 Nov. 1928; to F.L. Lucas, 26 March 1929. } While there were suggestions that Lawrence had been intimate with Dahoum, who worked with Lawrence at a pre-war archaeological dig in Carchemish, [ T.E. Lawrence by his Friends 1937 Lawrence A.W. 89 ] { Section by C. Leonard Woolley. } and fellow-serviceman R.A.M. Guy, [ Wilson Jeremy 1989 The Authorized Biography of T.E. Lawrence ] { Chapter 32. } his biographers and contemporaries have found them unconvincing. [ Wilson Jeremy 1989 The Authorized Biography of T.E. Lawrence ] { Chapter 27. } The dedication to his book Seven Pillars is a poem entitled &quot; To S.A. &quot; which opens: [ 10 ] [ 10 ] [ 10 ] [ 10 ] [ 10 ] [ 10 ] [ 10 ] I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into my hands and wrote my will across the sky in stars To earn you Freedom, the seven-pillared worthy house, that your eyes might be shining for me When we came. Lawrence was never specific about the identity of &quot; S.A. &quot; There are many theories which argue in favour of individual men, women, and the Arab nation. [ Yagitani Ryoko An &apos;S.A.&apos; Mystery http://yagitani.jpn.cx/tel/tpc_en12.htm ] The most popular is that S.A. represents (at least in part) his companion Selim Ahmed, &quot; Dahoum &quot;, who apparently died of typhus prior to 1918. Although Lawrence lived in a period during which official opposition to homosexuality was strong, his writing on the subject was tolerant. In Seven Pillars, when discussing relationships between young male fighters in the war, he refers on one occasion to &quot; the openness and honesty of perfect love &quot; [ Seven Pillars of Wisdom 1935 Lawrence T.E. 508–509 ] { Book VIII, Chapter XCII. The passage, in the front-matter, is referred to with the single-word tag &quot; Sex &quot;. } and on another to &quot; friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot limbs in supreme embrace &quot;. { Seven Pillars (1935), featured prominently on Page 2 of Chapter I. } In a letter to Charlotte Shaw he wrote &quot; I&apos;ve seen lots of man-and-man loves: very lovely and fortunate some of them were. &quot; [ A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E. Lawrence Mack John E. 425 1976 ] { Letter to Charlotte Shaw } In both Seven Pillars and a 1919 letter to a military colleague, [ The Letters of T.E. Lawrence Brown Malcolm 1988 ] { Letter to W.F. Stirling, Deputy Chief Political Officer, Cairo, June 28, 1919 } Lawrence describes an episode in November 1917 in which, while reconnoitring Dera&apos;a in disguise, he was captured by the Turkish military, heavily beaten, and sexually abused by the local Bey and his guardsmen. The precise nature of the sexual contact is not specified. Although there is no independent evidence, the multiple consistent reports, and the absence of evidence for outright invention in Lawrence&apos;s works, make the account believable to his biographers. [ Wilson Jeremy 1989 The Authorized Biography of T.E. Lawrence 1084 ] { In Note 49 to Chapter 21. } At least three of Lawrence&apos;s biographers (Malcolm Brown, John Mack, and Jeremy Wilson ) have argued this episode had strong psychological effects on Lawrence which may explain some of his unconventional behaviour in later life. There is considerable evidence that Lawrence was a masochist. In his description of the Dera&apos;a beating, Lawrence wrote &quot; a delicious warmth, probably sexual, was swelling through me &quot;, and also included a detailed description of the guards&apos; whip in a style typical of masochists&apos; writing. [ The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia 1969 Knightley Phillip Simpson Colin 221 ] In later life, Lawrence arranged to pay a military colleague to administer beatings to him, and to be subjected to severe formal tests of fitness and stamina. { Knightley and Simpson, p. 29 } While John Bruce, who first wrote on this topic, included some other claims which were not credible, Lawrence&apos;s biographers regard the beatings as established fact. [ Wilson Jeremy 1989 The Authorized Biography of T.E. Lawrence ] { Chapter 34. } John E. Mack sees a possible connection between T.E.&apos;s masochism and the childhood beatings he had received from his mother { John E. Mack, A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E. Lawrence, 1976, p. 420. } for routine misbehaviours. { John E. Mack, A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E. Lawrence, 1976, p. 33. } His brother Arnold thought the beatings had been given for the purpose of breaking T.E.&apos;s will. { John E. Mack, A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E. Lawrence, 1976, p. 33. } [ Awards ] Lawrence was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath and awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the French Légion d&apos;Honneur, though in October 1918 he refused to be made a Knight Commander of the British Empire. [ Portrayals ] Film Lawrence was portrayed by Peter O&apos;Toole in the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. Television He was portrayed by Judson Scott in the 1982 TV series Voyagers! Ralph Fiennes portrayed Lawrence in the 1990 made-for-TV movie A Dangerous Man: Lawrence after Arabia. Joseph A. Bennett and Douglas Henshall portrayed him in the 1992 TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. In Young Indiana Jones, Lawrence is portrayed as being a life-long friend of the title character. He was also portrayed in an Arabic series, directed by Thayer Musa, called &quot; Lawrence Al Arab &quot;. The series consisted of 37 episodes, each between 45 minutes and one hour in length. Online at Istikana.com] Theatre [ Kevin Brownlow Kevin Brownlow David Lean. A Biography 1996 Richard Cohen Books 1-86066-042-8 ] Lawrence was the subject of Terence Rattigan &apos;s controversial play Ross, which explored Lawrence&apos;s alleged homosexuality. Ross ran in London in 1960–61, starring Alec Guinness, who was an admirer of Lawrence and Gerald Harper as his blackmailer, Dickinson. The play had originally been written as a screenplay, but the planned film was never made, although large sections of the play&apos;s script can be identified in the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, in which Alec Guinness plays Prince Faisal. In January 1986 at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth on the opening night of the revival of Ross, Marc Sinden, who was playing Dickinson (the man who recognised and blackmailed Lawrence, played by Simon Ward ), was introduced to the man that the character of &apos;Dickinson&apos; was based on. Sinden asked him why he had blackmailed Ross, and he replied, &quot; Oh, for the money. I was financially embarrassed at the time and needed to get up to London to see a girlfriend. It was never meant to be a big thing, but a good friend of mine was very close to Terence Rattigan and years later, the silly devil told him the story &quot;. Western Morning News 1986 Alan Bennett &apos;s Forty Years On (1968) includes a satire on Lawrence; known as &quot; Tee Hee Lawrence &quot; because of his high-pitched, girlish giggle. &quot; Clad in the magnificent white silk robes of an Arab prince  ... he hoped to pass unnoticed through London. Alas he was mistaken. &quot; The section concludes with the headmaster confusing him with D. H. Lawrence. The character of Private Napoleon Meek in George Bernard Shaw &apos;s 1931 play Too True to Be Good was inspired by Lawrence. Meek is depicted as thoroughly conversant with the language and lifestyle of tribals. He repeatedly enlists with the army, quitting whenever offered a promotion. T. E. Lawrence&apos;s first year back at Oxford after the Great War to write his Seven Pillars of Wisdom was portrayed by Tom Rooney in a play, The Oxford Roof Climbers Rebellion, written by Canadian playwright Stephen Massicotte (premiered Toronto 2006). The play explores Lawrence&apos;s political, physical and psychological reactions to war, and his friendship with poet Robert Graves. Urban Stages presented the American premiere in New York City in October 2007; Lawrence was portrayed by actor Dylan Chalfy. Lawrence&apos;s final years are portrayed in a one-man show by Raymond Sargent, The Warrior and the Poet.
