The club won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 2001. [ History ] Atlético Paranaense was born as the result of a merge between two older Curitiba teams, Internacional-PR and América-PR. The merger was announced on March 21, 1924 and formalized five days later, on March 26, when the club changed its name and its colors; the new board of directors also assumed the administration of the club. The chosen club&apos;s field was Internacional&apos;s old field, called Água Verde. The club&apos;s first match was played on April 6, when Atlético Paranaense beat Universal FC 4-2 { http://www.furacao.com/80anos/historia/1924.php (in Portuguese). }. Its first competitive match was on the 1924 Campeonato Paranaense, when they were beaten 6-3 by arch-rivals Coritiba. By participating in several championships with a good team, the club won its first state championship title in 1925, establishing the club as one of the main clubs in its state. In 1934, Atlético Paranaense acquired the groundplot where the Arena da Baixada is located. In 1949, the club won its ninth Paranaense State Championship, which gave them the nickname of Furacão (meaning hurricane, in English ) - attributed to the club for its great campaign in the competition. Since then, Furacão has been the club&apos;s nickname. In 1995 after Coritiba beat Atlético Paranaense 5-1, a new board of directors took over the control of the club, and started a strategic project called &quot; Atlético Total &quot;. Atlético Paranaense was the first Paranaense club to participate in the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa, today known as the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. In 2001, Atlético Paranaense won its first Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, after defeating São Caetano; and in 2004 was runner-up, with the striker Washington scoring a record 34 goals in a single edition of the Série A. So far, Atlético Paranaense has participated in three editions of the Copa Libertadores, in 2000, 2002 and 2005. In the 2000 edition the club was eliminated in the second round and in 2005, Atlético Paranaense was the runner-up of the competition after being defeated by São Paulo. A survey taken in 2005 by Paraná Pesquisas Institute showed that Atlético Paranaense has the largest amount of supporters in Curitiba.
