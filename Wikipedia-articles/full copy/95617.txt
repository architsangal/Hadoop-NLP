He settled near Louisville, Kentucky in 1785, and was killed by Native Americans in southern Indiana in 1786. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America was born in Fairview, Christian County, as was Adlai E. Stevenson I. Joshua Grant was an early settler of Christian County. He married into the McNeil family. Almost all of Joshua&apos;s sons had &quot; McNeil &quot; as their middle name. Joshua Grant was a descendant of James Grant and Anne Diskin of Caswell County, North Carolina. Many of the Grants in Montgomery County, Tennessee and Jefferson County, Illinois were also descendants of James Grant and Anne Diskin. Contrary to what is stated in publications dating back to the 1880s, this is a southern Grant family that was not related to General Ulysses S. Grant, at least on this Continent.
