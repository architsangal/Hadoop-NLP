Bismarck is situated on the east bank of the Missouri River, directly across the river from Mandan. [ Murphy Edward C. Groenewold Gerald H. Geology of the Bismarck-Mandan Area https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/Publication_List/pdf/geoinv/GI_3.pdf Geologic Investigations No. 3 North Dakota Geological Survey February 28, 2012 PDF ] The two cities make up the core of the Bismarck-Mandan Metropolitan Statistical Area. The North Dakota State Capitol, the tallest building in the state, towers over the central part of Bismarck. The state government employs more than 4,000 in the city. As a hub of retail and health care, Bismarck is the economic center of a large portion of south-central North Dakota and north-central South Dakota. [ History ] [ History of Bismarck, North Dakota ] Before the arrival of white settlers, present-day central North Dakota was inhabited by the Mandan Native American tribe. { PBS Online - Lewis and Clark: Native Americans } In 1872 the future capital city was founded at what was then called Missouri Crossing, since the Lewis and Clark Expedition has crossed the river there. The new town was called Edwinton, after Edwin Ferry Johnson (1803–1872), engineer-in-chief for the Northern Pacific Railway. In 1873, however, the Northern Pacific Railway renamed the city Bismarck, in honor of German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, in hopes of attracting German investment.

Bismarck became a freight-shipping center on the &quot; Custer Route &quot; from the Black Hills. In 1883 Bismarck became the capital of the Dakota Territory, and in 1889 the state capital of North Dakota. [ Geography ] Bismarck is located at [ 46 48 48 N 100 46 44 W type:city ] (46.813343, -100.779004). [ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city occupies [ 27.4 sqmi km2 ], with [ 26.9 sqmi km2 ] land, and [ 0.5 sqmi km2 ] (1.90%) being water. [ Cityscape ] { Patterson Place (built in 1911 as the McKenzie Hotel) was the tallest building in the state until construction of the capitol building. Once a noted luxury hotel, it now has senior housing and a restaurant. } Downtown Bismarck is near the center of the city, and is distinctive because the city&apos;s major shopping center, Kirkwood Mall, is there rather than in a suburban setting. Several other major retail stores are in the vicinity of Kirkwood Mall, as is the Bismarck Civic Center. The two Bismarck hospitals, St. Alexius Medical Center and Medcenter One Health Systems are both downtown, and the streets are lined with small stores and restaurants. Much recent commercial and residential growth has happened in the northern section of the city, largely because of expanding retail centers. Among the shopping centers in northern Bismarck are Gateway Fashion Mall, Northbrook Mall, Arrowhead Plaza, and the new Pinehurst Square &quot; power center &quot; mall. The North Dakota State Capitol complex is just north of downtown Bismarck. The 19-story Art Deco capitol is the tallest building in the city, at a height of 241.75 feet (74 m). The capitol building towers over the central part of the city and is easily seen from 20  miles  (30  km) away on a clear day. Completed during the Great Depression in 1934, it replaced an earlier capitol building which burned to the ground in 1930. The capitol grounds house the North Dakota Heritage Center, the North Dakota State Library, the North Dakota Governor&apos;s Residence, the State Office Building, and the Liberty Memorial Building. The North Dakota State Penitentiary is in eastern Bismarck. The Cathedral District is a historic neighborhood near downtown Bismarck. The neighborhood gets its name from the art deco Cathedral of the Holy Spirit which stands in the district. Some homes in this neighborhood date back to the 1880s, although many were built in the first decades of the 20th century. For years, the city [ June 2009 ] has put forth controversial proposals to widen the streets in the neighborhood, but any such project would require the removal of many of the towering American elm s which line the streets. The south side of town grew significantly after the creation of the Garrison Dam by local developers, including the Wachter family. Garrison Dam provided some insurance against heavy flooding, which made living, working and owning businesses there a viable option. [ Climate ] [ Climate of Bismarck, North Dakota ] Situated in the middle of the Great Plains, between the geographic centers of the United States and North America, Bismarck displays a highly variable four-season humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfb) with strong semi-arid influences.
