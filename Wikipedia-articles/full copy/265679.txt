The stars represent the constellation of Crux, the Southern Cross. { Beehive in Wellington. } New Zealand&apos;s first flag, the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, was adopted before New Zealand became a British colony. Chosen by an assembly of Māori chiefs in 1834, the flag was of a St George&apos;s Cross with another cross in the canton containing four stars on a blue field. After the formation of the colony in 1841, British ensigns began to be used. The current flag was designed and adopted for restricted use in 1869 and became the national flag in 1902. It is the British Blue Ensign, incorporating a stylised representation of the Southern Cross showing the four brightest stars in the constellation. Each star varies slightly in size. The Union Flag in the canton recalls New Zealand&apos;s colonial ties to Britain.

The ship had been sailing without a flag, a violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was not a colony at the time and had no flag. Among the passengers on the ship were two high-ranking Māori chiefs, believed to be Patuone and Taonui. The ship&apos;s detainment was reported as arousing indignation among the Māori population. Unless a flag was selected, ships would continue to be seized.

The United Tribes later made the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand at Waitangi in 1835. Three flags were proposed, all designed by the missionary Henry Williams, who was to play a major role in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The chiefs rejected two other proposals which included the Union Flag, in favour of a modified St George&apos;s Cross or the White Ensign, which was the flag used by Henry Williams on the Church Missionary Society ships.

[ 1 a ] The need for a flag was pressing, not only because New Zealand-built ships were being impounded in Sydney for not flying a national flag, but also as a symbol of the independence declared by the Māori chiefs. The flag is still flown on the flag pole at Waitangi, and can be seen on Waitangi Day.

New Zealand did not have a Colonial badge, or indeed a Coat of Arms of its own at this stage, and so the letters &quot; NZ &quot; were simply added to the blue ensign.
