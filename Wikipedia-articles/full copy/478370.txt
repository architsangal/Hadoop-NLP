[ 25 February 2013 yes ] Photo of an empty bottle of Buckfast Tonic Wine in a park in Glasgow { A38 in } { Devon transporting a large quantity of Buckfast Wine. } Buckfast Tonic Wine, commonly known as Buckfast, Buckie or Tonic, is a fortified wine licensed by Buckfast Abbey in Devon, south west England. It is distributed by J. Chandler &amp; Company. [ History ] The wine, which is still manufactured using many of the same ingredients, is based on a traditional recipe from France. The Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey first made the tonic wine in the 1890s. It was originally sold in small quantities as a medicine using the slogan &quot; Three small glasses a day, for good health and lively blood &quot;. In 1927 the Abbey lost its license to sell wine. As a result, the Abbot allowed wine merchants to distribute on behalf of the Abbey. At the same time, the recipe was changed to increase the appeal of the product. These changes resulted in increased sales. Modern bottles carry a notice stating that the wine does not have tonic properties of the type claimed by the former slogan. The wine, which comes into distinct brands depending on the market, has achieved popularity in working class, student and bohemian communities in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Buckfast (packaged in a darker bottle) has a slightly lower alcoholic strength and lacks vanillin flavouring of the British version. Buckfast sold in Northern Ireland is the same as the rest of the UK.

Its high strength (15% ABV/14.8% in the Republic of Ireland), relatively low price and sweetness are characteristics that are thought to appeal to underage drinkers.

Although Buckfast accounts for only 0.5% of alcohol sales in Scotland, the figure is markedly higher in Lanarkshire.

In 2005 Scottish Justice Minister, Cathy Jamieson MSP, suggested that retailers should stop selling the wine. On a subsequent visit to Auchinleck within her constituency, she was greeted by teenagers chanting, &quot; Don&apos;t ban Buckie &quot;. [ December 2010 ] Jamieson then received correspondences from lawyers acting for Buckfast distributors, J Chandler &amp; Co., in Andover.

In September 2006, Andy Kerr, the Scottish Executive &apos;s Health Minister described the drink as &quot; an irresponsible drink in its own right &quot; and a contributor to anti-social behaviour. The distributors denied the claims and accused him of showing &quot; bad manners &quot; and a &quot; complete lack of judgement &quot; regarding the drink.

Three months later, Jack McConnell, First Minister of Scotland stated that Buckfast had become a &quot; a badge of pride amongst those who are involved in antisocial behaviour. &quot; [ Macdonell Hamish http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id%3D1715022006%26amp%3Bbad%3D178112 McConnell joins the war of words on Buckfast, &apos;a seriously bad drink&apos; The Scotsman 2006-11-20 2010-12-27 ] In response the distributors accused the Scottish Executive of trying to avoid having to deal with the consequences of failed social policy and the actual individuals involved in antisocial behaviour by blaming it all on the drinks industry. However in January 2010 a BBC investigation revealed that Buckfast had been mentioned in 5,638 crime reports in the Strathclyde area of Scotland from 2006–2009, equating to an average of three per day. One in 10 of those offences had been violent and 114 times in that period a Buckfast bottle was used as a weapon. A survey at a Scottish young offenders’ institution showed of the 117 people who drank alcohol before committing their crimes, 43 percent said they had drunk Buckfast. In another study of litter around a typical council estate in Scotland, 35 percent of the items identified as rubbish were Buckfast bottles.

They also point out that the areas identified with its acute misuse have been economically deprived for decades and Buckfast represents less than one percent of the total alcohol sales in these places - actual figure 0.58% of alcohol sales.

Both glycerol-3-phosphate and its close relative 3-Phosphoglycerate are intermediaries in the glycolysis pathway, the major biochemical pathway for energy production in animals. They are downstream from glucose and therefore can be converted more quickly into energy than glucose. They therefore have a tonic property in people who are depleted of energy. Glycerophosphate is used in intravenous drip solutions as a source of phosphate, a biologically important ion used in energy-requiring reactions. { New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority, &apos;&apos;Data Sheet: Glycophos&apos;&apos;.
