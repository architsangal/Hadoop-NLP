[ antigenic drift genetic drift ] { NIAID illustration of potential influenza antigenic shift } Antigenic shift is the process by which two or more different strains of a virus, or strains of two or more different viruses, combine to form a new subtype having a mixture of the surface antigen s of the two or more original strains. The term is often applied specifically to influenza, as that is the best-known example, but the process is also known to occur with other viruses, such as visna virus in sheep. [ Narayan O Antigenic shift of visna virus in persistently infected sheep 1977 197 4301 376–378 Science.) 10.1126/science.195339 195339 Griffin DE Chase J ] { ) } Antigenic shift is a specific case of reassortment or viral shift that confers a phenotypic change. In terms of virology, the marine ecosystem has been largely unstudied, but due to its extraordinary volume, high viral density (100 million viruses per mL in coastal waters, 3 million per mL in the deep sea) [ Denny How the Ocean Works: An Introduction to Oceanography How the Ocean Works Princeton University Press 2008 illustrated 0-691-12647-X, 9780691126470 ] { ) } and high cell lysing rate (as high as 20% on average), marine viruses&apos; antigenic shift and genetic recombination rates must be quite high. [ Suttle CA Marine viruses — major players in the global ecosystem 2007 5 10 801–812 Nature. 17853907 10.1038/nrmicro1750 ] This is most striking when one considers that the coevolution of prokaryotes and viruses in the aquatic environment has been going on since before eukaryotes appeared on earth. Antigenic shift is contrasted with antigenic drift, which is the natural mutation over time of known strains of influenza (or other things, in a more general sense) which may lead to a loss of immunity, or in vaccine mismatch. Antigenic drift occurs in all types of influenza including influenzavirus A, influenza B and influenza C. Antigenic shift, however, occurs only in influenzavirus A because it infects more than just humans. [ Treanor John Influenza vaccine--outmaneuvering antigenic shift and drift New England Journal of Medicine January 2004-01-15 350 3 218–220 14724300 2008-01-07 http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/3/218 10.1056/NEJMp038238 ] Affected species include other mammal s and bird s, giving influenza A the opportunity for a major reorganization of surface antigens. Influenza B and C principally infect humans, minimizing the chance that a reassortment will change its phenotype drastically. [ Epidemiology and pathogenesis of influenza Zambon Maria C. Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/44/suppl_2/3.pdf 1999 November 44 Supp B 3–9 10877456 2008-01-09 10.1093/jac/44.suppl_2.3 PDF ] Antigenic shift is important for the emergence of new viral pathogen s as it is a pathway that viruses may follow to enter a new niche. It could occur with primate viruses and may be a factor for the appearance of new viruses in the human species such as HIV. Due to the structure of its genome, HIV does not undergo reassortment, but it does recombine freely and via superinfection HIV can produce recombinant HIV strains that differ significantly from their ancestors. Flu strains are named after their types of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface protein s, so they will be called, for example, H3N2 for type-3 hemagglutinin and type-2 neuraminidase. When two different strains of influenza infect the same cell simultaneously, their protein capsid s and lipid envelopes are removed, exposing their RNA, which is then transcribed to mRNA. The host cell then forms new viruses that combine their antigens; for example, H3N2 and H5N1 can form H5N2 this way. Because the human immune system has difficulty recognizing the new influenza strain, it may be highly dangerous. Influenza viruses which have undergone antigenic shift have caused the Asian Flu pandemic of 1957, the Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968, and the Swine Flu scare of 1976. Until recently, such combinations were believed to have caused the infamous Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918 which killed 40~100 million people worldwide; however more recent research suggests the 1918 pandemic was caused by the antigenic drift of a fully avian virus to a form that could infect humans efficiently. [ Aoki FY Sitar, DS Clinical pharmacokinetics of amantadine hydrochloride Clinical Pharmacokinetics 1988 January 14 1 35–51 3280212 10.2165/00003088-198814010-00003 ] [ Johnson NP Mueller, J Updating the accounts: global mortality of the 1918-1920 &quot; Spanish &quot; influenza pandemic 2002 Spring 76 1 105–115 Bulletin of the History of Medicine. 11875246 10.1353/bhm.2002.0022 ] One increasingly worrying situation is the possible antigenic shift between avian influenza and human influenza. This antigenic shift could cause the formation of a highly virulent virus. [ Role in transmission of influenza viruses from animals to people ] Influenza A viruses are found in many different animals, including ducks, chickens, pigs, whales, horses, and seals. Influenza B viruses circulate widely principally among humans, though it has recently been found in seals. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/744945.stm Seals pose influenza threat 2000-05-11 Carrington Damian BBC ] There are 16 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 different neuraminidase subtypes, all of which have been found among influenza A viruses in wild birds. Wild birds are the primary natural reservoir for all subtypes of influenza A viruses and are thought to be the source of influenza A viruses in all other animals. Most influenza viruses cause asymptomatic or mild infection in birds; however, the range of symptoms in birds varies greatly depending on the strain of virus. Infection with certain avian influenza A viruses (for example, some strains of H5 and H7 viruses) can cause widespread disease and death among some species of wild and especially domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys. Pigs can be infected with both human and avian influenza viruses in addition to swine influenza viruses. Infected pigs get symptom s similar to humans, such as cough, fever, and runny nose. Because pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses, they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species (e.g., ducks and humans) at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. For example, if a pig was infected with a human influenza virus and an avian influenza virus at the same time, an antigenic shift could occur, producing a new virus that had most of the genes from the human virus, but a hemagglutinin or neuraminidase from the avian virus. The resulting new virus would likely be able to infect humans and spread from person to person, but it would have surface proteins (hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase) not previously seen in influenza viruses that infect humans, and therefore to which most people have little or no immune protection. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic can occur. The most recent 2009 H1N1 outbreak was a result of antigenic shift and reassortment between human, avian, and swine viruses. [ Smith G. J. D. D. Vijaykrishna, J. Bahl, S. J. Lycett, M. Worobey, O. G. Pybus, S. K. Ma, C. L. Cheung, J. Raghwani, S. Bhatt, J. S. M. Peiris, Y. Guan, A. Rambaut Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A epidemic. Nature 2009 459 1122–1125 ] The reason why influenza virus can undergo genetic shift is because it contains a segmented genome composed of 8 pieces. Therefore, a simultaneous infection of one host with two viral strains can produce a new strain via recombination of the genome segments. This produces novel viral strains that the human immune system has never encountered before.
