The student participates in regular drills during the school year, and extended training activities during the summer. Army ROTC units are organized as brigades, battalions, and companies. Air Force ROTC units are detachments with the students organized into wings, groups, squadrons, and flights. Army and Air Force ROTC students are referred to as cadets. Navy ROTC units are organized as battalions, and also include Marine ROTC students. Marine ROTC students may be formed in a separate company when the program includes sufficient numbers. [ August 2009 ] Navy ROTC students are referred to as midshipmen. The term of obligatory service varies among the services. Army ROTC students who receive an Army ROTC scholarship or enter the Army ROTC Advanced Course must agree to complete an eight-year period of service. This can include three years active duty (four years for scholarship winners), with the balance in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR).

Part of the federal government&apos;s requirement for these schools was that they include military tactics as part of their curriculum, forming what became known as ROTC. The college from which ROTC originated is Norwich University in Northfield, Vermont. Norwich was founded in 1819 at Norwich, Vermont, as the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. [ http://www.norwich.edu/about/history.html Images of Its Past 2006-11-20 2004 History of Norwich University Norwich University ] Until the 1960s, many major universities required compulsory ROTC for all of their male students. However, because of the protests that culminated in the opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, compulsory ROTC was dropped in favor of voluntary programs.

Some schools believed this legal mandate would require them to waive or amend their non-discrimination policies. In recent years, concerted efforts are being made at some Ivy League universities that have previously banned ROTC, including Columbia, to return ROTC to campus.

These institutions grant baccalaureate degrees (at a minimum) and organize all or some of their students into a corps of cadets under some sort of military discipline. Those participating in the cadet program must attend at least 2 years of ROTC education. The second are programs at &quot; civilian colleges. &quot; As defined under Army regulations, these are schools that grant baccalaureate or graduate degrees and are not operated on a military basis. The third category is programs at military junior colleges (MJC). These are military schools that provide junior college education (typically A.S. or A.A. degree). These schools do not grant baccalaureate degrees but they meet all other requirements of military colleges (if participating in the Early Commissioning Program ), and cadets are required to meet the same military standards as other schools (if enrolled in ECP), as set by Army Cadet Command. Cadets can be commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army Reserve/Army National Guard as graduating sophomores. Upon commissioning, these lieutenants are required to complete their bachelors degree at another institution (of the lieutenant&apos;s choosing) while serving in their units. Upon receiving their bachelors, ECP lieutenants can assess active duty and go onto active duty as a first lieutenant. Only the Army currently offers an Early Commissioning Program. In time of war, MJC&apos;s have played a significant role in producing officers for the Army. During the Vietnam war, the requirement to complete one&apos;s bachelor degree was not in effect. Therefore, upon commissioning, LT&apos;s went straight onto active duty. One difference between civilian colleges and the senior or junior military colleges is enrollment option in ROTC. ROTC is voluntary for students attending civilian colleges and universities; however, with few exceptions (as outlined in both Army regulations and federal law), it is required of students attending the senior and junior military colleges. Another major difference between the senior military colleges and civilian colleges is that under federal law, graduates of the SMCs are guaranteed active duty assignments if requested.

AROTC offers two-year and two-and-a-half-year scholarships. The two-year scholarship is available for students with two academic years of college remaining.

The naval NROTC program is offered at over 150 colleges nation wide. [ U.S. Air Force ROTC ] [ Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps ] The first Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (then Air ROTC) units were established between 1920 and 1923 at the University of California, Berkeley, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois, the University of Washington, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Texas A &amp; M University. After World War II, the Air Force established ROTC units at 77 colleges and universities throughout the United States. [ Controversy ] The Solomon Amendment denies federal funding to any university with a &quot; policy or practice &quot; that prevents the military from &quot; maintaining, establishing or operating &quot; ROTC on its campus. Such universities are allowed to require that ROTC adhere to the same policies as the university&apos;s other academic programs. According to Diane Mazur of the Palm Center, the military has withdrawn ROTC from a number of universities rather than adapt to those policies or accept extracurricular status. In her analysis, both the military and academe, as of the fall of 2010, preferred not to dispute the public perception that elite universities had banned ROTC programs. She wrote: [ http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/25/opinion/25Mazur.html The New York Times Diane H. Mazur The Myth of the R.O.T.C.

[C]olleges may also be more comfortable when they go along with the fiction of banning R.O.T.C., because then they don&apos;t have to answer to people upset about &quot; don&apos;t ask, don&apos;t tell. &quot; Everyone buys into the myth, but at the expense of military readiness. The military needs to return to the colleges it walked away from, and everyone needs to stop pretending that R.O.T.C. programs ended because of a ban. ] Others argue that universities effectively ban ROTC by erecting procedural hurdles motivated by anti-military sentiment and objections to discrimination based on sexual orientation that only serve to &quot; discourage their own presumably egalitarian, intelligent, and enlightened students from joining. &quot; { Stanford Review: Yishai Kabaker, &quot; Stanford’s Anti-ROTC Policy is Self-Contradictory, &quot; April 27, 2007, accessed March 12, 2012 } ROTC programs were subject to the military&apos;s ban on service by open gays and lesbians known as &quot; Don&apos;t ask don&apos;t tell. &quot; LGBT students occasionally protested ROTC as a proxy for the policy. { Columbia Spectator: Robert McCaughey, &quot; Don&apos;t wait, don&apos;t stall, &quot; February 18, 2010, accessed March 12, 2012 } { Harvard Crimson: Eric S.

[ Non-U.S. ROTC programs ] Some other national armed forces in countries with strong historical ties to the United States have ROTC programs. The Republic of the Philippines established its ROTC program in 1912, during American colonial rule, with the creation of the first unit at the University of the Philippines. The National ROTC Alumni Association (NRAA) of the Philippines estimates that 75 percent of the officer corps of the Armed Forces of the Philippines come from ROTC. { GMA&apos;s Speech - National ROTC Alumni Assoc } ROTC in Canada was raised as an independent training cooperative in 1974 with links to other ROTC and Cadet training programs in the US and UK.
