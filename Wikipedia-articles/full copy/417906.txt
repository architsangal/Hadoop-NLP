[ 24 June 1831 ] { Grosvenor Square, } { London } [ 29 June 1890 ] { Portman Square, } { London } { British } { Conservative } { Christ Church, Oxford } { (1) Lady Evelyn Stanhope (1834-1875) (2) Elizabeth Howard (1856-1929) } Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, PC, DL, FSA, FRS (24 June 1831 – 29 June 1890), known as Lord Porchester from 1833 to 1849, was a British politician and a leading member of the Conservative Party. He was twice Secretary of State for the Colonies and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. [ Background and education ] Born at Grosvenor Square, London, Carnarvon was the eldest son of Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon, by his wife Henrietta Anna, daughter of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard. The Hon. Auberon Herbert was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1849 he succeeded his father in the earldom. His nickname was &quot; Twitters &quot;, { John Charmley (1999) Splendid Isolation? Britain and the Balance of Power 1874-1914 } apparently on account of his nervous tics and twitchy behaviour. [ Political career ] Carnarvon served under Lord Derby, as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1858 to 1859. [ First Term as Colonial Secretary ] In 1866 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies by Derby. In 1867 he introduced the British North America Act, which conferred self-government on Canada, and effectively created a confederation. Later that year, he resigned (along with Lord Cranborne and Jonathan Peel ) over Benjamin Disraeli &apos;s Reform Bill to enfranchise the working classes. [ Second Term as Colonial Secretary ] Returning to the office of the British colonial secretary in 1874, he submitted a set of proposals, known as the &quot; carnarvon terms &quot;, to settle the dispute between British Columbia and Canada over the construction of the transcontinental railroad and the Vancouver Island railroad and train bridge. Vancouver Island had been promised a rail link as a precondition of its entry into British North America confederation. In 1874 he attempted to impose a confederation on the various states of Southern Africa as he had on Canada. However the times were not ripe and his confederation scheme collapsed, leaving a trail of wars across southern Africa. { Illustrated History of South Africa, South Africa: The Readers Digest Association, 1992, &quot; Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun &quot;, p. 182 } He addressed the concept of Imperialism in Africa many times while holding the title, but resigned in 1878, in opposition to Disraeli&apos;s policy on the Eastern Question. [ Lord Lieutenant of Ireland ] On his party&apos;s return to power in 1885, Carnarvon became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His short period of office, memorable for a conflict on a question of personal veracity between himself and Charles Stewart Parnell as to his negotiations with the latter in respect of Home Rule, was terminated by another premature resignation. He never returned to office. [ Other public appointments ] Carnarvon also held the honorary posts of Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire between 1887 and 1890 and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. He was regarded as a highly cultured man and was a president and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a Fellow of the Royal Society as well as was high steward of Oxford University. He was also a prominent freemason, having been initiated in the Westminster and Keystone Lodge, and with his permission a number of subsequently founded lodges bore his name in their titles. [ Family ] Lord Carnarvon married firstly Lady Evelyn, daughter of George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield, in 1861. They had one son and three daughters. After her death in 1875 he married secondly his first cousin Elizabeth Catherine, daughter of Henry Howard, in 1878. They had two sons, of whom the eldest was the Hon. Aubrey Herbert and the youngest George. His eldest daughter Lady Winifred married as her second husband Lord Burghclere and was the mother of the Hon. Evelyn, first wife of the novelist Evelyn Waugh. Carnarvon&apos;s son Aubrey was the father of Laura Herbert, who was the second wife of Evelyn Waugh. Lord Carnarvon died at Portman Square, London, in June 1890, aged 59. His second wife survived him by almost forty years and died in February 1929, aged 72. [ References ] Roberts, Andrew. Salisbury: Victorian Titan. London: Orion Books, 2000 [c1999].
