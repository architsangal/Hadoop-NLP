[ ſ ] { United States Bill of Rights. } The long, medial or descending s (ſ) is a form of the minuscule letter s formerly used where s occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word, for example &quot; ſinfulneſs &quot; ( &quot; sinfulness &quot; ). The modern letterform was called the terminal, round, or short s. [ History ] The medial &apos;s&apos; in Old Roman cursive { Title page of } { John Milton &apos;s } { Paradise Lost, featuring an &quot; ſt &quot; } { ligature } The long s was derived from the old Roman cursive medial s. When the distinction between upper case (capital) and lower case (small) letter-forms became established, towards the end of the eighth century, it developed a more vertical form. { Lyn Davies. A is for Ox, London: 2006. Folio Society. } In this period it was occasionally used at the end of a word, a practice which quickly died out but was occasionally revived in Italian printing between about 1465 and 1480. Thus the general rule that the long &apos;s&apos; &quot; never occurred at the end of a word &quot; is not strictly correct, although the exceptions are rare and archaic. In German written in Blackletter, the rules are more complicated: short s also appears at the end of each word within a compound word. The long s is subject to confusion with the lower case (or minuscule) f, sometimes even having an f-like nub at its middle, but on the left side only, in various roman typeface s and in blackletter. There was no nub in its italic typeform, which gave the stroke a descender curling to the left —not possible with the other typeforms mentioned without kerning. For this reason, the short s was also normally used in combination with f: for example, in &quot; ſatisfaction &quot;. The nub acquired its form in the blackletter style of writing. What looks like one stroke was actually a wedge pointing downward, whose widest part was at that height ( x-height ), and capped by a second stroke forming an ascender curling to the right. Those styles of writing and their derivatives in type design had a cross-bar at the height of the nub for letters f and t, as well as k. In roman type, these disappeared except for the one on the medial s. The long s was used in ligatures in various languages. Three examples were for si, ss, and st, besides the German letter ß. The long s fell out of use in roman and italic typefaces well before the middle of the 19th century. In Spain the change was mainly accomplished between the years 1760 and 1766; in France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793; in Britain and the United States, between 1795 and 1810. For example, in Spain, the multi-volume work España Sagrada made the switch with volume 16 (1762); The Times of London switched to the short s with its issue of September 10, 1803; and in the United States, acts of Congress were published with the long s throughout 1803, switching to the short s in 1804. But Britain&apos;s colony Nova Scotia&apos;s statutes used the long &quot; s &quot; as late as 1816. This change may have been spurred by the fact that long s looks somewhat like an f (in both its roman and italic forms), whereas short s did not have this disadvantage, making it easier to identify, especially for people with problems of vision. Despite its disappearance from printed works, in England the long s survived in handwriting into the 1860s. The long s survives in Fraktur typefaces. When a font containing the long s is used, German typographic rules require the common s to be used when it occurs singly at the end of a syllable, while the long s is used at the beginning of a syllable (more detailed rules are given for other cases). Greek also features a normal sigma σ and a special terminal form ς, which may have supported the idea of such specialized s forms. In Renaissance Europe a significant fraction of the literate class was familiar with Ancient Greek. The present-day German letter ß (das Eszett &quot; the ess-zed &quot;, or scharfes-ess &quot; the sharp S &quot;; also used in Low German and historical Upper Sorbian orthographies) is considered to have originated in a ligature of ſz (which is supported by the fact that the second part of the ß glyph usually resembles a Fraktur z), of ſs (see ß for more), or some Tironian notes Max Bollwage: Ist das Eszett ein lateinischer Gastarbeiter?.

Grimma (Germany) 2006, ISBN 3-933629-17-9. Some old orthographic systems of Slavonic and Baltic languages used ſ and s as two separate letters with different phonetic value. For example, the Bohorič alphabet of Slovene language included ſ /s/, s /z/, ſh /ʃ/, sh /ʒ/. In the original version of the alphabet, uppercase S was shared by both letters, later a modified character Ş became counterpart of ſ. Also, some Latin alphabets devised in the 1920s for some Caucasian languages used the ſ for some specific sounds { Proposal to encode Latin letters used in the Former Soviet Union (in Unicode) }. These orthographies were in actual use until 1938 { Andreas Frings: Sowjetische Schriftpolitik zwischen 1917 und 1941 – eine handlungstheoretische Analyse. Stuttgart (Germany) 2007, ISBN 978-3-515-08887-9 }. Some of these had developed a capital form which roughly resembles a smoothed variant of the letter [ 0295 LATIN LETTER PHARYNGEAL VOICED FRICATIVE ]. { Udi alphabet table from a 1934 book, showing a capital long s near the end of the 3 rd column } [ Modern usage ] { Berlin, 2002 } The long s is represented in Unicode at the code point U+017F in the Latin Extended-A range, and it may be represented in HTML as &amp; amp;#x17F; or &amp; amp;#383;. The long s survives in elongated form, and with an italic-style curled descender, as the integral symbol [ ∫ ] used in calculus; Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz based the character on the Latin word summa ( &quot; sum &quot; ), which he wrote ſumma. This use first appeared publicly in his paper De Geometria, published in Acta Eruditorum of June 1686, { Mathematics and its History, John Stillwell, Springer 1989, p. 110 } but he had been using it in private manuscripts at least since 1675. { Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz, J. M. Child, Open Court Publishing Co., 1920, pp. 73–74, 80. } The following represents the integral of a function of x over the interval [a,b]: \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx In linguistics a similar character ( [ ʃ ], called &quot; esh &quot; ) is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet, in which it represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative, the first sound in the English word shun. In Scandinavian and German-speaking countries, relics of the long s continue to be seen in signs and logos that use various forms of fraktur typefaces. Examples include the logos of the Norwegian newspapers Aftenpoſten and Adresſeaviſen; the packaging logo for Finnish Siſu pastilles; and the Jägermeiſter logo. The similarity between the printed long s (ſ) and f and modern-day unfamiliarity with the former letter-form has been the subject of much humour based on the intentional misreading of s as f, e.g. pronouncing Greensleeves as Greenfleeves and song as fong in a Flanders and Swann monologue. [ http://www.beachmedia.com/gorbuduc.html The Greensleeves Monologue Annotated ] Another survival of the long s was the abbreviation used in British English for shilling, as in &quot; 5/– &quot;, where the shilling mark &quot; / &quot; stood in for the long s which had been long forgotten by all but antiquarians.
