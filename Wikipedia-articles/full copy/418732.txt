On March 5, 2007, SeaWorld Orlando announced addition of the Aquatica water park to its adventure park family, which already includes SeaWorld and Discovery Cove. { Aquatica Press Release Kit, retrieved March 5, 2007. } On February 28, 2008, Busch Entertainment announced plans to open a fourth SeaWorld park in Dubai, UAE, { C&apos;mon in, Shamu: The Dubai water is fine, retrieved July 14, 2008, } but these plans have been shelved for now due to the international credit freeze. { No Busch Gardens, SeaWorld for Dubai, retrieved Feb. 4, 2009. } SeaWorld parks also feature a variety of thrill rides, including roller coaster s like Kraken and Manta at SeaWorld Orlando and Steel Eel and The Great White at SeaWorld San Antonio. Journey to Atlantis, a combination roller coaster and splashdown ride, can be found at all three US parks. The parks were owned by Busch Entertainment Corp., the family entertainment division of Anheuser-Busch, which is best known for brewing beer. In November, 2009, Busch Entertainment was sold to the Blackstone Group and subsequently renamed SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment. One of the biggest attractions is the Shark Encounter, in which guests are carried through a submerged acrylic tube into the sharks&apos; tank. Another famous ride is Wild Arctic, simulating a helicopter ride to the Arctic. After the ride, the guests arrive at a simulated base station, where they can observe polar bear s, Pacific walrus es, and beluga whale s. During the Christmas holiday season, SeaWorld Orlando&apos;s Wild Arctic is transformed into the Polar Express Experience which offers the park&apos;s guests the opportunity to ride the Polar Express to the North Pole and meet Santa Claus in addition to the polar bear s, Pacific walrus es, and beluga whale s that are at the Wild Arctic exhibit year round. Another attraction is the Penguin Encounter, showcasing a variety of penguin s. In addition, an attraction features endangered Florida manatee s. The park has an extensive playground for children, named Shamu’s Happy Harbor, formerly known as Cap&apos;n Kids World.

After considering other locations in the midwest, including the Lake Milton/ Newton Falls area west of Youngstown, Ohio, it was decided that Aurora, Ohio would be the new home of a SeaWorld. The Aurora site was approximately [ 15 mi km ] northwest of the Lake Milton site, and [ 30 mi km ] southeast of Cleveland.

The Ohio site would prove to be difficult to maintain. The harsh winter climate permitted the park to be open only from mid-May until mid-September. However, the vast population of the Midwest and Northeastern states lived within a day&apos;s drive of the park, which would eventually add to the success of SeaWorld of Ohio. The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida opened near the end of the second operating season of SeaWorld of Ohio. The success of Disney in Orlando provided another ideal spot to capitalize on the mass number of tourists that would make their way to central Florida for vacations. Since opening day in 1973, SeaWorld Orlando has thrived in a place known as &apos;the theme park mecca of the world&apos;. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. (HBJ) purchased the company in 1976 and 12 years later they ventured deep into the heart of Texas. In 1988, SeaWorld San Antonio opened just a few miles outside of San Antonio.

The park was open year-round like its sister parks in California and Florida in 1988 and 1989, then went to a seasonal schedule. The stress and financial resources it took to build and maintain a state-of-the-art marine mammal facility in the late &apos;80s eventually took its toll on the company. HBJ, whose primary focus was producing school books, needed to reduce its assets in order to avoid a bankruptcy. The Anheuser-Busch Company made an offer to purchase the SeaWorld parks. However, HBJ also owned and operated two other parks, Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball, and out of fear of not being able to find a buyer for the two other parks, HBJ refused to sell the parks individually. Despite a long negotiation, Anheuser-Busch bought all six parks in 1989: SeaWorld in San Diego, Aurora, Orlando and San Antonio as well as Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven and Boardwalk and Baseball in Haines City. Soon after the sale was final, Busch sold Cypress Gardens to the park&apos;s management and closed Boardwalk and Baseball.

[ SeaWorld Ohio sale, re-birth, and eventual transition ] In February 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the SeaWorld Ohio park to Six Flags, Inc., operators of neighboring &quot; Six Flags Ohio &quot; ( Geauga Lake until the end of 1999, reverting to the &quot; Geauga Lake &quot; name in 2004). Upon completion of the sale, the two parks were combined in spring 2001 as the so-called &quot; mega-park &quot; &quot; Six Flags Worlds Of Adventure &quot;, which boasted its &quot; Three parks in one &quot; uniqueness: a waterpark, an amusement park, and a wildlife animal park - all included in one price of admission. Sea World executives replied that their park had been sold because of the short season of the animal park, because of Northeastern Ohio&apos;s cold winter months, and also because they were not able to get the rights to build roller coaster s like the other Sea World properties had been able to. In March 2004, Six Flags, Inc., announced that it had sold &quot; Six Flags Worlds of Adventure &quot; to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the operators of the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Cedar Fair took the park back to its original &quot; Geauga Lake &quot; name, which had a history dating back to 1888. Since the Six Flags company retained ownership of the animals, the majority of the animal portion of the park, including all of the exhibits and animal stadiums, was either emptied or fenced off for the 2004 season. After a nearly season-long wait, the Cedar Fair company announced its plans for the non-operational side of the former Sea World Ohio/Six Flags Worlds of Adventure-Wildlife Side. That entire portion of the land would become an immense waterpark, named &quot; Wildwater Kingdom &quot;, opening in two phases, with the first phase in 2005, followed by the second phase in 2006. This decision marked the end of the marine-life park permanently. All of the animal stadiums and buildings were next torn down or converted into other venues. Some of the SeaWorld property remained intact, albeit hidden or modified. What remained included the former seal and sea lion area, the Ski Stadium (to be used in a Lumberjack show in 2006), the Aquarium (to be used for unknown purposes), and two movie theater houses/simulators, once housing 3D/4D movies. The Ski Stadium was removed in off-season 2008 to make way for &quot; Coconut Cove &quot;, a refreshment station/observation area. All of these except for the &quot; Wildwater Kingdom &quot; closed permanently in 2007. [ SeaWorld Dubai ] Busch and UAE-based developer Nakheel had planned to together build a SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Discovery Cove and Aquatica water park on a man-made island in Dubai. The parks would be built on The Palm Jebel Ali, part of Dubai&apos;s ambitious &quot; Palm Islands &quot; complex. The first phase of the project was projected to open in 2012. The Worlds of Discovery resort on the Palm Jebel Ali would include hotels, spas, shops and restaurants. The project was put on hold in February 2009 however due to the global economic downturn, but may be resumed once the economic situation improves. { Beth Kassab for the } { Orlando Sentinel, No Busch Gardens, SeaWorld for Dubai, article retrieved February 5, 2009. } [ Animals at SeaWorld ] Takara demonstrating a breaching move during the Believe show at SeaWorld Orlando.

[ Criticism ] [ section March 2010 ] [ Captivity and treatment issues ] Organizations such as the World Society for the Protection of Animals and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the captivity of dolphins and killer whales; SeaWorld, which holds most of the world&apos;s captive killer whales, is cited for its role. Killer whales are believed to have a shorter lifespan in captivity than in the wild; however, recent studies have shown that the average age of killer whales in captivity has extended due to better care. { J.D. van der Toorn (1999), Survival rate study of marine mammals in captivity, retrieved November 1, 2006. } [ May 2012 ] While different types of killer whales are held in captivity, only a pre-killed fish-based diet is offered to them. Wild killer whales, depending on where they live and if they are resident, transient, or offshore subtypes, eat a huge variety of sealife. Their food can include a selection of the following: thirty different species of fish, sharks, squid, seals, sea lions, walruses, sea otters, birds, and other species of whales. Aggression in captivity is also not uncommon. In August 1989, a dominant female killer whale, Kandu V, tried to rake a newcomer killer whale, Corky II, with her mouth during a live show. { A Whale Bleeds to Death at Sea World, Aggression towards tank members and trainers, page retrieved June 6, 2007. } Corky II had been imported from Marineland California just months prior to the incident. According to reports, when Kandu V tried to rake Corky II, she missed, and as a result swam into a wall. It is reported [ February 2010 ] that a loud smack was heard across the stadium. Although trainers tried to keep the show rolling, the blow severed an artery near Kandu V&apos;s jaw, and she began spouting blood. The crowd was quickly ushered out, and after a 45-minute hemorrhage, Kandu V died. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at Sea World Orlando was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a lunchtime presentation in Shamu Stadium.
