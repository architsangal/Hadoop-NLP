Proteins with similar structure exist in virtually all living organisms. The Hsp70s are an important part of the cell&apos;s machinery for protein folding, and help to protect cells from stress.

When examining the chromosomes, Ritossa found a &quot; puffing pattern &quot; that indicated the elevated gene transcription of an unknown protein. [ Ritossa F A new puffing pattern induced by temperature shock and DNP in drosophila Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences (CMLS) 18 12 571–573 1962 10.1007/BF02172188 ] [ Ritossa F Discovery of the heat shock response Cell Stress Chaperones 1 2 97–8 1996 June 9222594 248460 10.1379/1466-1268(1996)001 &lt; 0097:DOTHSR &gt; 2.3.CO;2 ] This was later described as the &quot; Heat Shock Response &quot; and the proteins were termed the &quot; Heat Shock Proteins &quot; (Hsps). [ Structure ] The Hsp70 proteins have three major functional domains : N-terminal ATPase domain – binds ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ) and hydrolyzes it to ADP ( Adenosine diphosphate ). The exchange of ATP drives conformational changes in the other two domains. Substrate binding domain – contains a groove with an affinity for neutral, hydrophobic amino acid residues. The groove is long enough to interact with peptides up to seven residues in length. C-terminal domain – rich in alpha helical structure acts as a &apos;lid&apos; for the substrate binding domain. When an Hsp70 protein is ATP bound, the lid is open and peptides bind and release relatively rapidly. When Hsp70 proteins are ADP bound, the lid is closed, and peptides are tightly bound to the substrate binding domain. [ Function and regulation ] When not interacting with a substrate peptide, Hsp70 is usually in an ATP bound state. Hsp70 by itself is characterized by a very weak ATPase activity, such that spontaneous hydrolysis will not occur for many minutes. As newly synthesized proteins emerge from the ribosome s, the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 recognizes sequences of hydrophobic amino acid residues, and interacts with them. This spontaneous interaction is reversible, and in the ATP bound state Hsp70 may relatively freely bind and release peptides. However, the presence of a peptide in the binding domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70, increasing its normally slow rate of ATP hydrolysis. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP the binding pocket of Hsp70 closes, tightly binding the now-trapped peptide chain. Further speeding ATP hydrolysis are the so-called J-domain cochaperones: primarily Hsp40 in eukaryotes, and DnaJ in prokaryotes. These cochaperones dramatically increase the ATPase activity of Hsp70 in the presence of interacting peptides. By binding tightly to partially synthesized peptide sequences (incomplete proteins), Hsp70 prevents them from aggregating and being rendered nonfunctional. Once the entire protein is synthesized, a nucleotide exchange factor ( BAG-1 and HspBP1 are among those which have been identified) stimulates the release of ADP and binding of fresh ATP, opening the binding pocket. The protein is then free to fold on its own, or to be transferred to other chaperones for further processing. HOP (the Hsp70/Hsp90 Organizing Protein) can bind to both Hsp70 and Hsp90 at the same time, and mediates the transfer of peptides from Hsp70 to Hsp90. [ Wegele H, Müller L, Buchner J Hsp70 and Hsp90 – a relay team for protein folding Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 151 1–44 2004 14740253 10.1007/s10254-003-0021-1 Reviews of Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology 978-3-540-22096-1 ] Hsp70 also aids in transmembrane transport of proteins, by stabilizing them in a partially folded state. Hsp70 proteins can act to protect cells from thermal or oxidative stress. These stresses normally act to damage proteins, causing partial unfolding and possible aggregation. By temporarily binding to hydrophobic residues exposed by stress, Hsp70 prevents these partially denatured proteins from aggregating, and allows them to refold. Low ATP is characteristic of heat shock and sustained binding is seen as aggregation suppression, while recovery from heat shock involves substrate binding and nucleotide cycling. In a thermophile anaerobe (Thermotoga maritima) the Hsp70 demonstrates redox sensitive binding to model peptides, suggesting a second mode of binding regulation based on oxidative stress. Hsp70 seems to be able to participate in disposal of damaged or defective proteins. Interaction with CHIP (Carboxyl-terminus of Hsp70 Interacting Protein)–an E3 ubiquitin ligase –allows Hsp70 to pass proteins to the cell&apos;s ubiquitin ation and proteolysis pathways.

Chem. 275 7 4613–7 2000 February 10671488 10.1074/jbc.275.7.4613 ] Finally, in addition to improving overall protein integrity, Hsp 70 directly inhibits apoptosis. [ Beere HM, Wolf BB, Cain K, Mosser DD, Mahboubi A, Kuwana T, Tailor P, Morimoto RI, Cohen GM, Green DR Heat-shock protein 70 inhibits apoptosis by preventing recruitment of procaspase-9 to the Apaf-1 apoptosome Nat. Cell Biol. 2 8 469–75 2000 August 10934466 10.1038/35019501 ] One hallmark of apoptosis is the release of cytochrome c, which then recruits Apaf-1 and dATP/ATP into an apoptosome complex. This complex then cleaves procaspase-9, activating caspase-9 and eventually inducing apoptosis via caspase-3 activation. Hsp 70 inhibits this process by blocking the recruitment of procaspase-9 to the Apaf-1/dATP/cytochrome c apoptosome complex. It does not bind directly to the procaspase-9 binding site, but likely induces a conformational change that renders procaspase-9 binding less favorable. Hsp70 is shown to interact with Endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor protein IRE1alpha thereby protecting the cells from ER stress - induced apoptosis. This interaction prolonged the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA thereby inducing transcriptional upregulation of targets of spliced XBP-1 like EDEM1, ERdj4 and P58IPK rescuing the cells from apoptosis. [ Gupta S, Deepti A, Deegan S, Lisbona F, Hetz C, Samali A HSP72 Protects Cells from ER Stress-induced Apoptosis via Enhancement of IRE1α-XBP1 Signaling through a Physical Interaction PLoS Biol. 8 7 e1000410 2010 July 20625543 2897763 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000410 Kelly Jeffrey W. ] Other studies suggest that Hsp 70 may play an anti-apoptotic role at other steps, but is not involved in Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis (although Hsp 27 is). Therefore, Hsp 70 not only saves important components of the cell (the proteins) but also directly saves the cell as a whole. Considering that stress-response proteins (like Hsp 70) evolved before apoptotic machinery, Hsp 70’s direct role in inhibiting apoptosis provides an interesting evolutionary picture of how more recent (apoptotic) machinery accommodated previous machinery (Hsps), thus aligning the improved integrity of a cell’s proteins with the improved chances of that particular cell’s survival.

All share the common domain structure, but each has a unique pattern of expression or subcellular localization. These are, among others: Hsc70 (Hsp73/HSPA8) is a constitutively expressed chaperone protein. It typically makes up one to three percent of total cellular protein. &apos;&apos;&apos;Hsp70&apos;&apos;&apos; (encoded by three very closely related paralogs: HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L) is a stress-induced protein. High levels can be produced by cells in response to hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and changes in pH. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP or Grp78) is a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in protein folding there, and can be upregulated in response to stress or starvation. mtHsp70 or Grp75 is the mitochondrial Hsp70.
