She is best known for her roles as the original moderator of the ABC talk program The View and co-host of the long-running NBC News morning news program, Today. She currently contributes to Dateline NBC and Rock Center with Brian Williams, and hosts the syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, having replaced Regis Philbin in 2002. She also presented Intimate Portrait, a series on Lifetime. [ Early years ] Meredith Vieira was born in East Providence, Rhode Island, to Mary Louisa Elsie Rosa Silveira Vieira (née Costa) (October 28, 1904 – November 5, 2004) and Dr. Edwin Vieira (May 15, 1904 – February 1987), both first-generation Portuguese Americans. She is the youngest of four children, with three older brothers.

They all left for a better life in New England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, settling around Providence, Rhode Island. Vieira was reared in the Catholic faith, but has stated in recent interviews that she has &quot; spirituality, not a religion. &quot; [ http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/celebrity/meredith-vieira-counting-blessings-5 Counting Her Blessings Lesley Dormen Good Housekeeping 2007 2010-04-10 ] She attended the Lincoln School, a Quaker all-girls school in Providence. She graduated magna cum laude with a degree in English from Tufts University. [ February 2012 ] [ Career ] Vieira began her broadcasting career in 1975 as a news announcer for WORC radio in Worcester, Massachusetts, doing afternoon drive news during the B. J. Dean Show. She began a career in television working as a local reporter and anchor at WJAR-TV in Providence, eventually making her way into the newsroom at WCBS-TV in New York City where she was an investigative reporter from 1979 to 1982. Vieira first gained national recognition as a CBS reporter based in their Chicago bureau from 1982 to 1984. She later became a correspondent for nationwide news-magazine shows including West 57th (1985 –89) and 60 Minutes (1989 –91). Her final assignment at CBS was as co-anchor of the CBS Morning News (1992 –93). She moved to ABC initially as a correspondent for the news-magazine show Turning Point (1993 –97). Following the cancellation of Turning Point, Vieira realized: [ I was a reporter who didn&apos;t want to report because it required a tremendous amount of travel, nobody was too interested in having me work for them. I had to reinvent myself... ] [ The View ] Vieira served as the original moderator and co-host of ABC&apos;s The View from its debut in 1997 through the spring of 2006. As moderator, she introduced &quot; Hot Topics, &quot; guided conversations, and broke to commercials. She began each live episode saying &quot; Hello! And welcome to The View! &quot; Vieira&apos;s final appearance on The View was June 9, 2006. Her co-hosts gave her a roast to commemorate her final appearance. In August 2006, Vieira told Time that she hasn&apos;t watched The View since she left the show, except the episode when Star Jones announced she was leaving. She said it was &quot; very sad &quot; what&apos;s happened to it: &quot; I&apos;m proud of the work we did there, but it&apos;s not a good time in the history of the show... It&apos;s hard to watch. It sort of became a joke. &quot; [ TMZ Staff http://www.tmz.com/2006/08/28/meredith-calls-the-view-a-joke/ Meredith Calls &quot; The View &quot; A &quot; Joke &quot; TMZ 28 August 2006 2008-09-08 ] On August 29, 2006, Vieira told the New York Post that she didn&apos;t mean that The View was a joke. She said the interview was taken out of context. &quot; I felt that the media was turning [The View] into a joke, not that the show was a joke, &quot; she says. Time added a clarification to its website, saying &quot; [Vieira] assures Time that in no way were her comments meant to be insensitive or derogatory... &quot; [ TMZ Staff http://www.tmz.com/2006/08/29/meredith-view-not-a-joke-actually/ Meredith: &quot; View &quot; Not A Joke, Actually TMZ 29 August 2006 2008-09-08 ] In 1999, Vieira began hosting Lifetime&apos;s Intimate Portrait, which chronicles the lives of women in art, entertainment, politics, business, science, journalism, and sports. [ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ] Vieira has hosted the American syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire since 2002 —a continuation of the primetime show hosted by Regis Philbin. The daytime quiz show is syndicated by Buena Vista Television, a division of ABC. In 2005 and again in 2009, Vieira won a Daytime Emmy Award as Outstanding Game Show Host for her role on Millionaire, being the second woman to ever win an Emmy in this category (after Betty White for Just Men! in 1983 ), and the first to win multiple times. As an executive producer, Vieira has a financial investment in the show. Vieira was a celebrity contestant on the Philbin version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire before she hosted the syndicated version, winning $250,000 for her charity. She even made an appearance on the ABC version during the show&apos;s 10th anniversary series, hosting its final segment while Philbin himself was given the opportunity to answer one question in order to win $50,000 for his selected charity. [ Today ] { Michael Bublé } Vieira accepted an offer to succeed Katie Couric as co-anchor of Today on April 6, 2006, the day after Couric announced that she would depart the show to become anchor of the CBS Evening News. The following day, Vieira announced on The View that she would be leaving the show to be co-anchor of Today, a role View co-host and ABC News journalist Barbara Walters had filled nearly four decades earlier during her tenure at NBC during the 1960s and 1970s. Vieira hosted the show with Matt Lauer from September 13, 2006, through June 8, 2011, also becoming a contributing anchor for Dateline NBC. [ MSNBC staff 7 April 2006 http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12185893/ Vieira chosen as Couric&apos;s &apos;Today&apos; Successor MSNBC 2008-09-08 ] [ http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6322541.html?display%3DBreaking%2BNews NBC Preps for Vieira Announcement Broadcasting &amp; Cable 6 April 2006 2008-09-08 ] Vieira continued as host of Millionaire while appearing on Today. As part of her contract with Millionaire, Vieira agreed not to appear on Today during hours that would conflict with the airing of the game show on competing stations. As a result, she rarely appeared on the third or fourth hours of Today. Her first appearance during the third hour came on June 25, 2008, for &quot; Today Throws a Wedding &quot;. She also appeared during the entire third hour during the Beijing Olympics, Vancouver Olympics and the Barack Obama inauguration on January 20, 2009. Vieira announced on May 9, 2011, that she would depart as co-host in the following month, but would remain at NBC News in an as-yet undetermined role. Her last appearance as co-host was on June 8; she returned to Today on October 31, 2011, for the show&apos;s Halloween episode. She is currently a contributor to Dateline NBC and a correspondent on Rock Center with Brian Williams. She continues to take on special assignments for The Today Show, such as reporting on from London on Queen Elizabeth&apos;s Diamond Jubilee, in 2012.

But after two years, she became pregnant again and asked to continue the part-time arrangement. Hewitt declined her request, deciding instead to hire someone who would work full-time. Her departure from the show garnered headlines, as a national debate started to take place about whether women could balance both family and career. She turned down opportunities to co-host The Early Show on CBS, and ABC&apos;s Good Morning America when her children were young. Vieira discusses her family and career decisions in the book Divided Lives: The Public and Private Struggles of Three American Women by Elsa Walsh.
