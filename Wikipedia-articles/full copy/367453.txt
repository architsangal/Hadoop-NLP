He developed an &quot; energy booster &quot; drink containing B vitamins, caffeine and cane sugar. After placing a notice in a trade magazine seeking a bottler, he formed a partnership with Charles Gordon of Tri-Cities Beverage to produce and distribute the soda. { Sauceman, Fred W. The Place Setting, p.89-97 (2009) } Dr. Enuf is still being manufactured in Johnson City, TN and sold sparsely throughout the nation. In Japan, the energy drink dates at least as far back as the early 1960s, with the release of the Lipovitan. However, most such products in Japan bear little resemblance to soft drinks, and are sold instead in small brown glass medicine bottles or cans styled to resemble such containers. These &quot; eiyō dorinku &quot; (literally, &quot; nutritional drinks &quot; ) are marketed primarily to salaryman. In 1985, Jolt Cola was introduced in the United States. Its marketing strategy centered on the drink&apos;s caffeine content, billing it as a means to promote wakefulness. The initial slogan was, &quot; All the sugar and twice the caffeine. &quot; {, Official Jolt website, 10 Nov 2011. } In 1995, PepsiCo launched Josta, the first energy drink introduced by a major US beverage company (one that had interests outside just energy drinks), but Pepsi discontinued the product in 1999. [ July 2011 ] { Red Bull cans } In Europe, energy drinks were pioneered by the S. Spitz Company and a product named Power Horse, before the business savvy of Dietrich Mateschitz, an Austrian entrepreneur, ensured his Red Bull product became far better known, and a worldwide best seller. Mateschitz developed Red Bull based on the Thai drink Krating Daeng, itself based on Lipovitan. Red Bull is the dominant brand in the US after its introduction in 1997, with a market share of approximately 47%. { Soda With Buzz, Forbes, Kerry A. Dolan, 03.28.05 } In New Zealand and Australia, the current leading energy drinks product in those markets V was introduced by Frucor Beverages. [ July 2011 ] By 2001, the US energy drink market had grown to nearly 8 million per year in retail sales. Over the next 5 years, it grew an average of over 50% per year, totaling over $3 billion in 2005. { Mintel Energy Drink Report 2006, 07.05.06 } Diet energy drinks are growing at nearly twice that rate within the category, as are 16-ounce sized energy drinks. The energy drink market became a $5.4 billion dollar market in 2007, and both Goldman Sachs and Mintel predicted that it would hit $10 billion by 2010. Major companies such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Molson, and Labatt have tried to match smaller companies&apos; innovative and different approach, with marginal success. [ July 2011 ] Energy drinks are typically attractive to young people. Approximately 66% percent of its drinkers are between the ages of 13 and 35 years old, with males being approximately 65% of the market. A 2008 statewide Patient Poll conducted by the Pennsylvania Medical Society&apos;s Institute for Good Medicine found that: 20% of respondents ages 21–30 had used energy drinks in high school or college to stay awake longer to study or write a paper; 70% of respondents knew someone who had used an energy drink to stay awake longer to study or work. { Energy Drinks – Busting Your Health for the Buzz Newswise, Retrieved on September 21, 2008. } Energy drinks are also popular as drink mixer s.

In 2001, Coca-Cola marketed two Powerade brand energy drinks in bullet-shaped, screw-top aluminum bottle cans produced by Exal Corporation of Youngstown, Ohio. Powerade, [ July 2011 ] similar to Gatorade, is better known as a sports drink.In 2002, CCL Container and Mistic Brands, Inc., part of the Snapple Beverage Group, worked together on the national launch of Mistic RĒ, which used a recyclable aluminum bottle. Since its introduction, many energy drinks are now packaged in the aluminum bottles or bottle cans. Capri Sun targeted 16-25 year-olds with its Island Refreshers line, graduating from a foil pouch design to a bottlecan or aluminum bottle. In the UK, Coca-Cola has marketed a direct Red Bull competitor, &apos;Sprite 3G&apos;, in a similar 250 mL can and has also launched &apos;Relentless&apos;, a juice-based energy drink in 500 mL cans. [ July 2011 ] UK supermarkets have launched their own brands of energy drinks at lower prices than the major soft drink manufacturers. These are mostly produced by Canadian beverage maker Cott. Tesco supermarkets sell &apos;Kx &quot; &apos;(used to be known as &apos;Kick&apos;) in 250 mL cans and 1 L bottles, Sainsbury&apos;s sell &apos;Blue Bolt&apos; in similar packaging, Asda sell &apos;Blue Charge&apos; in similar packaging and Morrison&apos;s sell &apos;Source&apos; in 250 mL cans. Cott sells a variety of other branded energy drinks to independent retailers in various containers. [ July 2011 ] Since 2002 there has been a growing trend for packaging energy drink in bigger cans. Since in many countries, including the US and Canada, there is a limitation on the maximum caffeine per serving in energy drinks, this allows manufacturers to include a greater amount of caffeine by including multiple servings per container. Popular brands such as Red Bull, Hype Energy Drinks and Monster have increased the amount of ounces per can. Conversely, the emergence of energy shots has gone the opposite way with much smaller packaging. [ July 2011 ] In 2007, energy drink powders and effervescent tablets were introduced, in the form of a tablet or powder that can be added to water to create an energy drink. These can offer a more portable option to cans and shots. [ July 2011 ] As of 2009, the industry has moved towards the use of natural stimulants and reduced sugar. [ May 2010 ] [ Ingredients ] Energy drinks generally contain methylxanthine s (including caffeine ), B vitamins, and herb s. Other commonly used ingredients are carbonated water, guarana, yerba mate, açaí, and taurine, plus various forms of ginseng, maltodextrin, inositol, carnitine, creatine, glucuronolactone, and ginkgo biloba. Some contain high levels of sugar, and many brands offer artificially sweetened &apos;diet&apos; versions. A common ingredient in most energy drinks is caffeine (often in the form of guarana or yerba mate ). Caffeine is the stimulant that is found in coffee and tea.Energy drinks contain about three times the amount of caffeine as cola.

Whereas most energy drinks are generally sold in cans or bottles, energy shots are usually sold in 50ml bottles. Energy shots can contain the same total amount of caffeine, vitamin s or other functional ingredients as their larger siblings, and therefore they may be considered concentrated forms of energy drinks. The marketing of energy shots generally focuses on their convenience and availability as a low-calorie &quot; instant &quot; energy drink that can be taken in one swallow (or &quot; shot &quot; ), as opposed to energy drinks that encourage users to drink an entire can (which may contain 250 calories or more) { “Little competition: energy shots aim for big” profits }.
