In Lithuania, the President&apos;s tenure lasts for five years; Adamkus&apos; first term in office began on February 26, 1998 and ended on February 28, 2003, following his defeat by Rolandas Paksas in the next presidential election. Paksas was later impeached and removed from office by a parliamentary vote on April 6, 2004. Soon afterwards, when a new election was announced, Adamkus again ran for president and was re-elected. His approval ratings were high { V. Adamkus išlieka populiariausiu Lietuvos politiku (Adamkus Remains the Most Popular Politician in Lithuania), Baltic News Service (BNS), 22 July 2006, } { Delfi.lt. Accessed 7 September 2006. } and he was regarded as a moral authority in the state. { Leonidas Donskis, Užsikimšusios politinės lyderystės arterijos (Clogged Arteries of Political Leadership), Klaipėda, 24 April 2006, Delfi.lt. Accessed 7 September 2006. } He chose not to run for re-election during the Lithuanian presidential election in 2009 and was succeeded on 12 July 2009 by Dalia Grybauskaitė. He is married to Alma Adamkienė, who is involved in charitable activities in Lithuania. The President remains involved in international development, and is a member of the Club de Madrid, an organization that works to strengthen democratic leadership and governance worldwide. { http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/miembro/valdas_adamkus } [ Biography ] Adamkus was born into a Roman Catholic family in Kaunas. His father was one of the first heads of the Lithuanian Air Force School in the Republic of Lithuania. As a young man, Adamkus joined the underground against the first Soviet occupation of 1940. During World War II, his family fled Lithuania in order to avoid the second Soviet occupation in 1944. He attended the University of Munich in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1949. Fluent in five languages — Lithuanian, Polish, English, Russian, and German — he served as a senior non-commissioned officer with the 5th Army Reserve &apos;s military intelligence unit in the 1950s. During his youth, Adamkus was interested in track and field. He also set national record at 100 metres running. [ Knygoje - V.

However, they have no children. After arriving in Chicago, Illinois as a displaced person, he worked in an automobile factory and later as a draftsman. Adamkus graduated as a civil engineer from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1961. While a student, Adamkus, together with other Lithuanian Americans, collected about 40,000 signatures petitioning the United States Government to intervene in the ongoing deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia by the Soviets. [ 74-114275 ] { 16 } The petition was presented to then-Vice President Richard Nixon. Adamkus also raised concerns about other Soviet activities in occupied Lithuania to United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld in 1958, and to President John F. Kennedy in 1962. [ Career in the United States Environmental Protection Agency ] He joined the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at its inception in 1970, working in Cincinnati. In 1981, he was appointed regional administrator by President Ronald Reagan, and was responsible for all air, water, hazardous waste, and other pollution control programs in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 1985, President Reagan presented him with the Distinguished Executive Presidential Rank Award the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a civil servant. In 1972, Adamkus visited Lithuania for the first time in almost thirty years. He was a member of the official delegation from the United States attending an environmental conference in Moscow. As perestroika took root in the Soviet Union, Adamkus&apos;s visits to his homeland became more frequent. Valdas Adamkus served as regional administrator of the EPA for sixteen years, and retired in 1997, after twenty-nine years of service. Upon his retirement, he received a congratulatory letter from President Clinton and a Distinguished Career Award from EPA Administrator Carol Browner. EPA Region 5 presented him with the newly established &quot; Valdas V. Adamkus Sustained Commitment to the Environment Honor Award &quot;. [ Lithuanian presidency, 1998 &amp; amp;ndash; 2003 ] Shortly after leaving the EPA, Valdas Adamkus moved back to Lithuania. Soon after his decision to run for presidency in 1998, he faced a legal battle in the Lithuanian courts, as doubts arose whether Adamkus was eligible to run for presidency due to the length of time he had spent abroad and the possibility that he might not meet minimum residency requirements. However, the court resolved the case in Adamkus&apos; favor and no other obstacles remained other than his U.S. citizenship, which he officially renounced at the American Embassy in Vilnius. [ http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-633714.html Lithuanian Return U.S. Passport The Washington Post 26 February 1988 ] He was elected as President of Lithuania in 1998, defeating Artūras Paulauskas in the runoff, serving from then until 2003, when he ran for re-election, but was unexpectedly defeated by Rolandas Paksas. He returned to politics as surprisingly as he had left, after the presidential scandal of 2003/2004, when his former rival Paksas was impeached and removed from office. Adamkus ran for the presidency again and was re-elected. The first round of the 2004 election was held on June 13, 2004, with Adamkus securing 30% of the vote - more than any other candidate. Paksas could not run for office again, because a ruling from Lithuania&apos;s Constitutional Court disallowed him from running for public office and he was, therefore, unable to register as a candidate. A runoff election was held on June 27, 2004, which Adamkus won with about 52% of the votes against Kazimira Prunskienė. By 2009 he had served the two presidential terms permitted by the Constitution of Lithuania and was succeeded as president by Dalia Grybauskaite. In 2003 Valdas Adamkus was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Construction of Knowledge Societies. The Director-General of UNESCO, Koïchiro Matsuura, noted that Valdas Adamkus was named as Ambassador &quot; in recognition of his dedication to the Organization&apos;s aims and ideals and with a view to benefiting for the construction of knowledge societies from his wisdom and extensive experience in many of UNESCO&apos;s areas of concern, in particular promotion of social development, cultural diversity, dialogue and international cooperation. &quot; { Roni Amelan, Valdas Adamkus to be named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Knowledge Societies, Bureau of Public Information, } { UNESCO. Accessed 7 September 2006. } [ Lithuanian presidency, 2004–2009 ] [ Foreign affairs ] Under the presidency of Valdas Adamkus, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and Ján Kubiš, served as a mediator during Ukraine&apos;s political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled in an interview that &quot; when I asked what we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop whatever they were doing and come to Kiev immediately. &quot;. { Steven Paulikas, A House Divided, } { Newsweek, 24 January 2006. Accessed 7 September 2006. } The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held. Valdas Adamkus and his Estonian counterpart Arnold Rüütel rejected an invitation to participate in a commemorative celebration of the end of World War II in Europe in 2005. President Adamkus expressed the view that the war&apos;s end, in Lithuania, marked the beginning of a fifty-year Soviet occupation and repression. In response, on July 22, the United States Congress unanimously passed a resolution that Russia should &quot; issue a clear and unambiguous statement of admission and condemnation of the illegal occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991 of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania &quot;, { http://jbanc.org/hres128.html Russia should admit occupation } but Russia refused. President Adamkus supported an active dialogue between European Union member states and those former Soviet republics such as Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, that are actively seeking membership in the EU. He expressed support for these candidate members during the Community of Democratic Choice in 2005, at the Vilnius Conference 2006, and on several other occasions. Valdas Adamus is a member of the Club of Madrid. { The Club of Madrid is an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries. It constitutes the world´s largest forum of former Heads of State and Government, who have come together to respond to a growing demand for support among leaders in democratic leadership, governance, crisis and post-crisis situations. All lines of work share the common goal of building functional and inclusive societies, where the leadership experience of our Members is most valuable. } He is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation as well. [ Domestic affairs ] Valdas Adamkus enjoys a very high approval rating in Lithuania. He was also recognized for the second time for his support of Lithuanian youth. President Adamkus was actively involved in government reorganizations in 2004 and 2006. In his 2006 State of the Nation address, { Valdas Adamkus, State of the Nation 2006 (PDF), Office of the President of Lithuania. Accessed 7 September 2006. } Adamkus stated that his top priorities were: Increasing public participation in the political realm Targeted and transparent use of the EU funds and opportunities for building a greater well-being in Lithuania Reforms in public governance, education and science, social support and health care The development of professional competence among civil servants, especially in assessing regulatory impacts Approval of a political code of ethics Direct mayoral elections, and elimination of the county system Construction of a new nuclear power unit in Ignalina Legislation regulating the selection, appointment, and promotion of judges Controlling &quot; brain drain &quot; by supporting research and higher education infrastructure [ Awards ] Valdas Adamkus has been honored with the following decorations: [ January 2011 ] [ January 2011 ] [ January 2011 ] [ January 2011 ] [ January 2011 ] Year Award Issuer 1985 President&apos;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service United States 1998 The Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon Iceland 1998 The Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav Norway 1998 The First Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Ukraine 1999 The Collar of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana Estonia 1999 Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer Greece 1999 Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic Italy 1999 The Order of the White Eagle Poland 1999 The Grand Cross of the Order for the Services Malta 1999 Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary Hungary 2000 The Grand Cross of the Order of Friendship Kazakhstan 2001 The Collar and the Grand Cross of the Order of Three Stars Latvia 2001 The Grand Cross of the Order of the French Legion of Honour France 2001 The Collar of the Order of the Star of Romania Romania 2002 Order of St. Meshrop Mashtots Armenia 2002 The Collar and the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose Finland 2002 The Order For Special Merits Uzbekistan 2002 St Andrew &apos;Dialogue of Civilisation&apos; prize laureate Russia 2003 The Order of Vytautas the Great with Golden Chain Lithuania 2004 The Collar of the Order of the White Star Estonia 2005 Order of Isabel the Catholic with the collar Kingdom of Spain 2005 The Special Class of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Germany 2006 Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold Kingdom of Belgium 2006 Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath United Kingdom 2006 The First Class of the Order of Merit Ukraine 2007 Order of Mother Theresa Albania 2007 The Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum Japan 2007 The St. George&apos;s Victory Order Georgia 2007 European of the Year 2008 The Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion Netherlands 2008 Collar of the Order of the Merit of Chile Republic of Chile 2009 Grand Star of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria Austria 2009 Order of Stara Planina Bulgaria 2009 Order of Liberty Ukraine [ Honorary doctorates ] Valdas Adamkus holds honorary doctorates at universities in Lithuania, the United States and other countries, including: Vilnius University, 1989.
