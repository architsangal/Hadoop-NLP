New England and the Bavarian Illuminati. Columbia University, 1918. } in Gotha ) was a German philosopher and founder of the Order of Illuminati, a secret society with origins in Bavaria. [ Early life ] Adam Weishaupt was born on 6 February 1748 in Ingolstadt { Engel 22. } in the Electorate of Bavaria. Weishaupt&apos;s father Johann Georg Weishaupt (1717–1753) died when Adam was five years old. After his father&apos;s death he came under the tutelage of his godfather Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt { Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Vol. 13, pp. 740–741. } who, like his father, was a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt. { Freninger, Franz Xaver, ed. Das Matrikelbuch der Universitaet Ingolstadt-Landshut-München. München: A. Eichleiter, 1872. 31. } Ickstatt was a proponent of the philosophy of Christian Wolff and of the Enlightenment, { Hartmann, Peter Claus. Bayerns Weg in die Gegenwart. Regensburg: Pustet, 1989. 262. Also, Bauerreiss, Romuald. Kirchengeschichte Bayerns. Vol. 7. St. Ottilien: EOS Verlag, 1970. 405. } and he influenced the young Weishaupt with his rationalism. Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven &lt; ref name= &quot; ref name= &quot; ADB Vol. 41 &quot; / &gt; at a Jesuit school. He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768 { Freninger 47. } at age 20 with a doctorate of law. { Engel 25–28. } In 1772 { Freninger 32. } he became a professor of law. The following year he married Afra Sausenhofer { Engel 31. } of Eichstätt. After Pope Clement XIV ’s suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, Weishaupt became a professor of canon law, { Engel 33. Also, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Vol. 41, p. 540. } a position that was held exclusively by the Jesuits until that time. In 1775 Weishaupt was introduced { Engel 61–62. } to the empirical philosophy of Johann Georg Heinrich Feder { Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Vol. 6, pp. 595–597. } of the University of Göttingen. Both Feder and Weishaupt would later become opponents of Kantian idealism. { Beiser, Frederick C. The Fate of Reason. Harvard University Press, 1987. 186–88. } [ Founder of the Illuminati ] [ Schneider Heinrich Quest for Mysteries: The Masonic Background for Literature in 18th Century 2005 1947 Kessinger Publishing 1-4191-8214-5 24 n.49 ] On 1 May 1776 Weishaupt formed the &quot; Order of Perfectibilists &quot;. He adopted the name of &quot; Brother Spartacus &quot; within the order. Though the Order was not egalitarian or democratic, its mission was the abolition of all monarchical governments and state religions in Europe and its colonies. { Catholic Encyclopedia: Illuminati, sourcing Illuminati papers } The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know, a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups. Weishaupt was initiated into the Masonic Lodge &quot; Theodor zum guten Rath &quot;, at Munich in 1777. His project of &quot; illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice &quot; was an unwelcome reform. Soon however he had developed gnostic mysteries of his own, with the goal of &quot; perfecting human &quot; nature through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. He began working towards incorporating his system of Illuminism with that of Freemasonry. He wrote: &quot; I did not bring Deism into Bavaria more than into Rome. I found it here, in great vigour, more abounding than in any of the neighboring Protestant States. I am proud to be known to the world as the founder of the Illuminati. &quot; [ May 2008 ] Weishaupt&apos;s radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria, in 1784. Weishaupt lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria. [ Activities in exile ] He received the assistance of Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1745–1804), and lived in Gotha writing a series of works on illuminism, including A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria (1785), A Picture of Illuminism (1786), An Apology for the Illuminati (1786), and An Improved System of Illuminism (1787). Adam Weishaupt died in Gotha on 18 November 1830. He was survived by his second wife, Anna Maria (née Sausenhofer), and his children Nanette, Charlotte, Ernst, Karl, Eduard, and Alfred. Weishaupt was buried next to his son Wilhelm who preceded him in death in 1802.. [ Contemporary opinion ] [ Illuminati ] John Robison, a professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University in Scotland and a member of a Freemason Lodge there, said he had been asked to join the Illuminati. After consideration he concluded that the Illuminati were not for him. In 1798 he published a book called Proofs of a Conspiracy in which he wrote: &quot; An association has been formed for the express purposes of rooting out all the religious establishments and overturning all existing governments... the leaders would rule the World with uncontrollable power, while all the rest would be employed as tools of the ambition of their unknown superiors. &quot; This book was sent to George Washington, who replied: It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation).

Snyder, 24 October 1798 [ Quotes about Weishaupt ] [ http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem%2Fmtj%3A%40field%28DOCID%2B%40lit%28tj090050%29%29 Thomas Jefferson to Reverend James Madison, January 31, 1800,The Thomas Jefferson Papers (American Memory from the Library of Congress) 2011-02-12 ] [ Wishaupt [sic] believes that to promote this perfection of the human character was the object of Jesus Christ. That his intention was simply to reinstate natural religion, &amp; by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves. His precepts are the love of god &amp; love of our neighbor. And by teaching innocence of conduct, he expected to place men in their natural state of liberty &amp; equality. He says, no one ever laid a surer foundation for liberty than our grand master, Jesus of Nazareth. He believes the Free masons were originally possessed of the true principles &amp; objects of Christianity, &amp; have still preserved some of them by tradition, but much disfigured. The means he proposes to effect this improvement of human nature are &quot; to enlighten men, to correct their morals &amp; inspire them with benevolence. Secure of our success, sais he, we abstain from violent commotions. To have foreseen, the happiness of posterity &amp; to have prepared it by irreproachable means, suffices for our felicity. The tranquility of our consciences is not troubled by the reproach of aiming at the ruin or overthrow of states or thrones. &quot; As Wishaupt [sic] lived under the tyranny of a despot &amp; priests, he knew that caution was necessary even in spreading information, &amp; the principles of pure morality. He proposed therefore to lead the Free masons to adopt this object &amp; to make the objects of their institution the diffusion of science &amp; virtue. He proposed to initiate new members into his body by gradations proportioned to his fears of the thunderbolts of tyranny. This has given an air of mystery to his views, was the foundation of his banishment, the subversion of the masonic order, &amp; is the colour for the ravings against him of Robinson, Barruel &amp; Morse, whose real fears are that the craft would be endangered by the spreading of information, reason, &amp; natural morality among men. This subject being new to me, I have imagined that if it be so to you also, you may receive the same satisfaction in seeing, which I have had in forming the analysis of it: &amp; I believe you will think with me that if Wishaupt [sic] had written here, where no secrecy is necessary in our endeavors to render men wise &amp; virtuous, he would not have thought of any secret machinery for that purpose. Thomas Jefferson ] In harmony with Jefferson&apos;s assessment of Weishaupt, and contrary to present-day popular myth, Weishaupt was not seeking to create a secret society whose aim was to enslave mankind, but one which sought to liberate man and cultivate his freedom and morality. Weishaupt writes of how any person wishing to join the Order of the Illuminati out of a thirst for power is acting contrary to the society&apos;s aims: &apos;If you seek power, might, false honour, excess, then... we shall leave you to the consequences of your folly: our inner sanctum will remain closed to such a person. But if you wish to learn wisdom, if you wish to learn how to make people more clever, better, free and happy, then you are welcome amongst us three times over.&apos; { Adam Weishaupt, Die neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Philo in dem Illuminaten-Orden, Munich, 1794, pp. 9-10. } Far from wanting to set up a tyrannical state, Weishaupt wished to see man realise his highest possessions - equality and freedom - and believed that they could be realised if man would only control his immoderate passions and take a hint from nature; man would then realise:&apos;... a state, in which man will enjoy his two most exquisite possessions - equality and freedom - in full plenitude, and would continue to enjoy them eternally, if only he would follow the hint given by nature and understand the art of not abusing his powers and of preventing the immoderate outbreak of his passions.&apos; { Adam Weishaupt, Die neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Philo in dem Illuminaten-Orden, Munich, 1794, p. 21 } Weishaupt subscribed to a belief in man&apos;s steady progress towards moral perfection, and in the highest state of humanity&apos;s moral development Weishaupt believed that people will see the folly of appropriating unto themselves the rights of others and of trying to tyrannise over others, but will instead learn what it means to be truly human; man will understand:&apos;... what an unhappy calamity it is to arrogate unto oneself the rights of others, to exalt oneself over others through mere external advantages, in order to use one&apos;s superiority to the disadvantage of others: only then will one understand, believe and feel what an honour it is, what happiness, to be a human being.&apos; { Adam Weishaupt, Die neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Philo in dem Illuminaten-Orden, Munich, 1794, p.20 } [ References in pop culture ] Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in The Illuminatus! Trilogy, written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, as the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati and as an imposter who killed George Washington and took his place as the first president of the United States. Washington&apos;s portrait on the U.S. one-dollar bill is said to actually be Weishaupt&apos;s. Another version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel Cerebus the Aardvark by Dave Sim, as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the Cerebus and Church &amp; State I volumes. His motives are republic an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church. Weishaupt is also mentioned among the mish-mash of complicated conspiracies in the PC game Deus Ex. During JC Denton&apos;s escape from Versalife labs in Hong Kong, he recovers a virus engineered with the molecular structure in multiples of 17 and 23. Tracer Tong notes &quot; 1723... the birthdate of Adam Weishaupt &quot; Weishaupt was in fact born in 1748. Adam Weishaupt is also mentioned ( &quot; Bush got a ouija to talk to Adam Weishaupt &quot; ) by the New York rapper Cage in El-P &apos;s &quot; Accidents Don&apos;t Happen &quot;, the ninth track on his album Fantastic Damage (2002).
