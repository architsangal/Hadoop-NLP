[ the raft used by Thor Heyerdahl to sail across the Pacific Kontiki (disambiguation) ] Kon-Tiki, 1947 Kon-Tiki was the raft used by Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl in his 1947 expedition across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands. It was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, for whom &quot; Kon-Tiki &quot; was said to be an old name. Kon-Tiki is also the name of Heyerdahl&apos;s book and the Academy Award-winning documentary film chronicling his adventures.It is also the title of the space settlement 2012 winner.Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times, although most anthropologists now believe they did not. { Wade Davis, The Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World, Crawley: University of Western Australia Publishing, p.46. } [ Andrew Lawler http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.summary Andrew Lawler, &apos; &amp; #39;Beyond Kon-Tiki: Did Polynesians Sail to South America&apos; &amp; #39;, Journal &apos; &amp; #39;Science&apos; &amp; #39; Vol. 328 no. 5984 pp. 1344–1347 11 June 2010 Sciencemag.org 2011-11-09 ] [ Andrew Lawler http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1346.short Andrew Lawler, &apos; &amp; #39;Changing Time in the South Pacific&apos; &amp; #39;, Journal &apos; &amp; #39;Science&apos; &amp; #39; Vol. 328 no. 5984 p. 1346 11 June 2010 Sciencemag.org 2010-06-11 2011-11-09 ] His aim in mounting the Kon-Tiki expedition was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, sextant, and metal knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving that the raft itself could make the journey. The Kon-Tiki expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the United States Army. Heyerdahl and a small team went to Peru, where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities, they constructed the raft out of balsa logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations by Spanish conquistadores. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over 4,300 miles across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a reef at Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands on August 7, 1947. The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely. Thor Heyerdahl&apos;s book about his experience became a bestseller. It was published in 1948 as The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas, later reprinted as Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft. A documentary motion picture about the expedition, also called Kon-Tiki was produced from a write-up and expansion of the crew&apos;s filmstrip notes and won an Academy Award in 1951. It was directed by Thor Heyerdahl and edited by Olle Nordemar. The voyage was also chronicled in the documentary TV-series The Kon-Tiki Man: The Life and Adventures of Thor Heyerdahl, directed by Bengt Jonson. { &apos;&apos;The Kon-Tiki Man&apos;&apos; episode breakdown } [ November 2011 ] The original Kon-Tiki raft is now on display in the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo. [ Crew ] The Kon-Tiki had six men on its crew. Thor Heyerdahl, Erik Hesselberg, Bengt Danielsson, Knut Haugland, Torstein Raaby, and Herman Watzinger. [ http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3D2ysYAQAAMAAJ%26amp%3Bq%3DWatzinger%2BRaaby%2BHaugland%26amp%3Bdq%3DWatzinger%2BRaaby%2BHaugland%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bei%3DgPF9T7OUD6WX0QWKn_maDg%26amp%3Bved%3D0CDgQ6AEwAQ The Kon-Tiki Expedition Thor Thor Heyerdahl Rand McNally 1968 5 April 2012 ] All were Norwegian except for Bengt Danielsson, a Swede. Thor Heyerdahl (1914–2002) was the expedition leader. He was also the author of the book and the narrator of the story. Heyerdahl had studied the ancient people of South America and Polynesia and believed that there was a link between the two. Erik Hesselberg (1914–1972) was the navigator and artist. He painted the large Kon-Tiki figure on the raft&apos;s sail. His delightful children&apos;s book &quot; Kon-Tiki and I &quot; appeared in Norwegian in 1949 and has since been published in more than 15 languages. Bengt Danielsson (1921–1997) took on the role of steward, in charge of supplies and daily rations. Danielsson was a Swedish sociologist interested in human migration theory. He also served as translator, as he was the only member of the crew who spoke Spanish. He was also a voracious reader; his box aboard the raft contained many books. Knut Haugland (1917–2009) was a radio expert, decorated by the British in World War II for actions in the Norwegian heavy water sabotage that stalled what were believed to be Germany&apos;s plans to develop an atomic bomb. Torstein Raaby (1918–1964) was also in charge of radio transmissions. He gained radio experience while hiding behind German lines during WWII, spying on the German battleship Tirpitz. His secret radio transmissions eventually helped guide in Allied bombers to sink the ship. Herman Watzinger (1910–1986) was an engineer whose area of expertise was in technical measurements. He was the first to join Heyerdahl for the trip. He collected and recorded all sorts of data on the voyage. Much of what he recorded, such as weather data, was sent back to various people, since this area of the ocean was largely understudied. [ Construction ] { Kon-Tiki Museum, Oslo } The main body of the float was composed of nine balsa tree trunks up to 13.7 metres (45 ft) long, 60  cm (2 ft) in diameter, lashed together with 3.175  cm (1¼ inch) hemp ropes. Cross-pieces of balsa logs 5.5 m (18 ft) long and 30  cm (1 ft) in diameter were lashed across the logs at 1 m (3 ft) intervals to give lateral support. Pine splashboards clad the bow, and lengths of pine 2.5  cm (1 inch) thick and 60  cm (2 ft) wide were wedged between the balsa logs and used as centerboard s. The main mast was made of lengths of mangrove wood lashed together to form an A-frame 8.8 m (29 ft) high. Behind the main-mast was a cabin of plaited bamboo 4.2 m (14 ft) long and 2.4 m (8 ft) wide was built about 1.21–1.51 m (4–5 feet) high, and roofed with banana leaf thatch. At the stern was a 5.8 m (19 ft) long steering oar of mangrove wood, with a blade of fir. The main sail was 4.6 m by 5.5 m (15 by 18 feet) on a yard of bamboo stems lashed together. Photographs also show a top-sail above the main sail, and also a mizzen-sail, mounted at the stern. The raft was partially decked in split bamboo. The main spars were a laminate of wood and reeds and Heyerdahl tested more than twenty different composites before settling on one that proved an effective compromise between bulk and torsional rigidity. No metal was used in the construction. [ Supplies ] The Kon-Tiki carried 275 gallons of drinking water in fifty-six water cans. For food they took 200 coconut s, sweet potato es, bottle gourds and other assorted fruit and roots. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps provided field ration s, tinned food and survival equipment. In return, the Kon-Tiki explorers reported on the quality and utility of the provisions. They also caught plentiful numbers of fish, particularly flying fish, &quot; dolphin fish &quot;, yellowfin tuna, bonito and shark. [ Communications ] The expedition, with the amateur radio call sign of LI2B, maintained regular communication with a number of American, Canadian, and South American stations that kept the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C., abreast of Kon-Tiki&apos;s efforts. The success of these contacts was due to the skill of former World War II Norwegian underground radio operators Knut Haugland and Torstein Raaby. On August 5, Haugland contacted Oslo, Norway, for a circuit of about 10,000 miles. { &apos;&apos;An LA, as in Norway, Story, by Bob Merriam, W1NTE&apos;&apos;, March 5, 2003 } { &apos;&apos;Thor Heyerdahl of Kon-Tiki fame dies at 87&apos;&apos;, April 24, 2002 } The raft carried three waterproof radio transmitters. The first operated on the 40- and 20-meter bands, the second on the 10-meter band, and the third on the 6-meter band. Each unit was made up entirely of 2E30 vacuum tubes providing 10 watt s of RF input. As an emergency backup they also carried a German Mark V transceiver originally re-created by the SOE in 1942. Power was supplied by batteries and a hand-cranked generator. The Kon-Tiki&apos;s radio receiver was a National Radio Company NC-173. In his book Kon-Tiki (Rand-McNally 1950, p. 263), Heyerdahl describes the NC-173 slowly drying out on an uninhabited South Sea island after getting soaked in a shipwreck, gradually receiving at higher and higher frequencies until eventually settling on the 13.990 MHz frequency needed to make contact. [ http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~postr/bapix/NC173.htm Boatanchor Pix, National NC-173 Oak.cats.ohiou.edu 2011-11-09 ] The crew used their hand-cranked emergency transmitter to send out an &quot; all well, all well &quot; message via LI2B just in time to head off a massive rescue attempt. { &apos;&apos;Thor Heyerdahl of Kon-Tiki fame dies at 87&apos;&apos; April 24, 2002, } The call sign LI2B was used by Heyerdahl again in 1969–70, when he built a papyrus reed raft and sailed from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to show a possible link between the civilization of ancient Egypt and the New World. [ Thor Heyerdahl The Ra Expeditions English Edition 1971 New York Doubleday and Company 270 ] [ The voyage ] The Kon-Tiki left Callao, Peru, on the afternoon of April 28, 1947. To avoid coastal traffic it was initially towed 50 miles out by the Fleet Tug Guardian Rios of the Peruvian Navy, then sailed roughly west carried along on the Humboldt Current. [ http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DLxMNAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bq%3DGuardian%2BRios%26amp%3Bdq%3DGuardian%2BRios%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bei%3DogJ-T--xFejK0QWt342hDg%26amp%3Bredir_esc%3Dy Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft 98 Thor Heyerdahl Rand McNally 1984 5 April 2012 ] The crew&apos;s first sight of land was the atoll of Puka-Puka on July 30. On August 4, the 97th day after departure, the Kon-Tiki reached the Angatau atoll. The crew made brief contact with the inhabitants of Angatau Island, but were unable to land safely. Calculations made by Heyerdahl before the trip had indicated that 97 days was the minimum amount of time required to reach the Tuamotu islands, so that the encounter with Angatau showed that they had made good time. On August 7, the voyage came to an end when the raft struck a reef and was eventually beached on an uninhabited islet off Raroia Island in the Tuamotu group. The team had travelled a distance of around 3,770 nautical miles (c. [ 6980 km on ] ) in 101 days, at an average speed of 1.5 knots. After spending a number of days alone on the tiny islet, the crew were greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The crew were taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the crew were taken off Raroia to Tahiti by the French schooner Tamara, with the salvaged Kon-Tiki in tow. [ Anthropology ] In 2011 Professor Erik Thorsby of the University of Oslo presented DNA evidence to the Royal Society which whilst agreeing with the west origin also identified a distinctive but smaller genetic contribution from South America.

Again based on records of ancient vessels, this raft used relatively sophisticated square sail s that allowed sailing into the wind, or tacking. It was [ 16 m on ] long by [ 8 m on ] wide. It also included a set of modern navigation and communication equipment, including solar panel s, portable computers, and desalination equipment. The crew posted to their website. [ http://www.tangaroa.no www.tangaroa.no www.tangaroa.no 2011-11-09 ] The crew of six was led by Torgeir Higraff, and included Olav Heyerdahl, grandson of Thor Heyerdahl.
