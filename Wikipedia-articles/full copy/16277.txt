Ruby was involved with major figures in organized crime; conspiracy theorist s claim that he killed Oswald as part of an overall plot surrounding the assassination of Kennedy. Others have disputed this, arguing that his connection with gangsters was minimal at most and that he was not the sort to be entrusted with such an act within a high-level conspiracy. [ Alleged links to organized crime ] Ruby was known to have been acquainted with both the police and the Mafia, specifically the Italian Mafia. The House Select Committee on Assassinations said that Ruby had known restaurateurs Sam (1920–1970) and Joseph Campisi (1918–1990) since 1947, and had been seen with them on many occasions. { HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, p. 336, par. 917, Joseph Campisi.

There was no indication that Campisi had engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities. HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, p. 336, par. 916, Joseph Campisi. ] Similarly, a PBS Frontline investigation into the connections between Ruby and Dallas organized crime figures reported the following: [ In 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. Jack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The Campisis were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President.

Many Cuban exiles and Mafia bosses disliked Kennedy, blaming him for the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. { Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 178.

Ruby considered McWillie, who had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, to be one of his closest friends. { Testimony of Jack Ruby, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, p. 201. } At the time Ruby visited him, in August 1959, McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana &apos;s Tropicana Club. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie. The House Select Committee on Assassinations would later conclude that Ruby &quot; …most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests. &quot; { HSCA Final Assassinations Report, House Select Committee on Assassinations, p. 152. } { Possible Associations Between Jack Ruby and Organized Crime, House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 5, p. 177. } The committee also found &quot; circumstantial, &quot; but not conclusive, evidence that &quot; …Ruby met with [Mafia boss] Santo Trafficante in Cuba sometime in 1959. &quot; { HSCA Final Assassinations Report, House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 152-153. } About an hour after President Kennedy was shot, White House correspondent Seth Kantor (who was a passenger in the motorcade) arrived at Parkland Hospital where Kennedy was receiving medical care. As Kantor was entering the hospital through a stairway, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand. { Testimony of Seth Kantor, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 15, pp. 78-82. } { Kantor, Seth.

In a later published book Who Was Jack Ruby?, Kantor wrote: [ The mob was Ruby&apos;s &quot; friend. &quot; And Ruby could well have been paying off an IOU the day he was used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. Remember: &quot; I have been used for a purpose, &quot; the way Ruby expressed it to Chief Justice Warren in their June 7, 1964 session.

Without our even resorting to his family and roommate, all of whom think the suggestion of Ruby being connected to the mob is ridiculous, those who knew him, unanimously and without exception, think the notion of his being connected to the Mafia, and then killing Oswald for them, is nothing short of laughable. Bugliosi, Vincent, Reclaiming History: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy p. 1130. ] Bill Alexander, who prosecuted Ruby for Oswald&apos;s murder, equally rejected any suggestions that Ruby was part-and-parcel of organized crime, claiming that conspiracy theorists based it on the claim that &quot; A knew B, and Ruby knew B back in 1950, so he must have known A, and that must be the link to the conspiracy. &quot; Ruby&apos;s brother Earl denied allegations that Jack was involved in racketeering Chicago nightclubs, and author Gerald Posner suggests that Ruby may have been confused [ August 2011 ] with Harry Rubenstein, a convicted Chicago felon.

At 11:21 am CST — while authorities were preparing to transfer Oswald by armored car from the police basement to the nearby county jail — Ruby stepped out from a crowd of reporters and fired his.38 revolver into Oswald&apos;s abdomen, fatally wounding him. The shooting was broadcast live nationally, and millions of television viewers witnessed it. There is some evidence that Ruby&apos;s actions were on a whim, as he left his favorite dog, Sheba, in the car before shooting Oswald.

Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby&apos;s intentions… The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting… There is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby&apos;s entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer. HSCA Final Assassinations Report, House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 157-158. ] When Ruby was arrested immediately after the shooting, he told several witnesses that he helped the city of Dallas &quot; redeem &quot; itself in the eyes of the public, and that Oswald&apos;s death would spare &quot; …Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial. &quot; { Testimony of Jack Ruby, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198–200. } At the time of the shooting Ruby said he was taking phenmetrazine, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Ruby&apos;s explanation for killing Oswald would be &quot; exposed … as a fabricated legal ploy &quot;, according to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. In a private note to one of his attorneys, Joseph Tonahill, Ruby wrote: &quot; Joe, you should know this. [My first lawyer] Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn&apos;t have to come to Dallas to testify. OK? &quot; { &quot; A Note from Jack Ruby &quot;, Newsweek, March 27, 1967. } Ruby&apos;s ploy was confirmed by attorney Melvin Belli. In his book, Dallas Justice, Belli wrote that Ruby told him: &quot; We know I did it for Jackie and the kids… Maybe I ought to forget this silly story that I&apos;m telling, and get on the stand and tell the truth. &quot; { Belli, Melvin. Dallas Justice: The Real Story of Jack Ruby and His Trial, (New York: David McKay Co., Inc., 1964), p. 39. } Another motive was put forth by Frank Sheeran, allegedly a hitman for the Mafia, in a conversation he had with the then-former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. During the conversation, Hoffa claimed that Ruby was assigned the task of coordinating police officers who were loyal to Ruby to murder Oswald while he was in their custody. As Ruby evidently mismanaged the operation, he was given a choice to either finish the job himself or forfeit his life. { Brandt, Charles.

Ruby responded that there would be a problem if a man by the name of &quot; Davis &quot; should come up. Ruby told his attorney that he &quot; …had been involved with Davis, who was a gunrunner entangled in anti-Castro efforts. &quot; { Kantor, Seth.

ISBN 978-1-4391-9388-4 } Later, Ruby replaced attorney Tom Howard with prominent San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli who agreed to represent Ruby pro bono. Some observers thought that the case could have been disposed of as a &quot; murder without malice &quot; charge (roughly equivalent to manslaughter ), with a maximum prison sentence of five years. Belli attempted to prove, however, that Ruby was legally insane and had a history of mental illness in his family (the latter being true, as his mother had been committed to a mental hospital years before). On March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of murder with malice, for which he received a death sentence. During the six months following the Kennedy assassination, Ruby repeatedly asked, orally and in writing, to speak to the members of the Warren Commission. The commission initially showed no interest. Only after Ruby&apos;s sister Eileen wrote letters to the commission (and her letters became public) did the Warren Commission agree to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren, then-Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, and other commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby. Ruby asked Warren several times to take him to Washington D.C., saying &quot; my life is in danger here &quot; and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements. { Testimony of Jack Ruby, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 194-196. } He added: &quot; I want to tell the truth, and I can&apos;t tell it here. &quot; { Testimony of Jack Ruby, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, p. 194. } Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply, because many legal barriers would need to be broken and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the commission would have no way of protecting him, since it had no police powers. Ruby said he wanted to convince President Lyndon Johnson that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy. { Testimony of Jack Ruby, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, p. 209-212. } [ Alleged conspiracies ] Following Ruby&apos;s March 1964 conviction for murder with malice, Ruby&apos;s lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby&apos;s lawyers argued that he could not have received a fair trial in the city of Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated: &quot; Everything pertaining to what&apos;s happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I&apos;m in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world. &quot; When asked by a reporter, &quot; Are these people in very high positions Jack? &quot;, he responded &quot; Yes. &quot; [ we2eucWXqjg Jack Ruby Press conference ] Dallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: &quot; Ruby told me, he said, &apos;Well, they injected me for a cold.&apos; He said it was cancer cells. That&apos;s what he told me, Ruby did. I said you don&apos;t believe that bullshit. He said, &apos;I damn sure do!&apos; [Then] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm… [In this note] he said it was a conspiracy and he said … if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you&apos;re gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him. &quot; [ TUiZBmm9xUA Ruby&apos;s Letter From Prison ] Not long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London Sunday Times, he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was &quot; an act of overthrowing the government &quot; and that he knew &quot; who had President Kennedy killed. &quot; He added: &quot; I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane.

Ruby&apos;s conviction and death sentence were overturned. Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when on December 9, 1966, Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital in Dallas, suffering from pneumonia. A day later, doctors realized he had cancer in his liver, lungs, and brain. Three weeks later, he died. According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19 that he alone had been responsible for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald.

When asked by the House Select Committee on Assassinations if Ruby could have known about his cancer, Dallas County medical examiner Dr. Earl Rose, who performed the autopsy on Ruby, replied, &quot; No &quot;. [ August 2011 ] [ Popular culture ] Ruby&apos;s shooting of Oswald, and his behavior both before and after the Kennedy assassination, have been the topic of numerous films, TV programs, books, and songs. [ Film ] In Oliver Stone &apos;s 1991 film JFK, Ruby was portrayed by veteran actor Brian Doyle-Murray. Stone&apos;s perspective on events draws heavily from conspiracy theory researchers such as Jim Marrs and L. Fletcher Prouty. At least three scenes further detailing Ruby were removed from the film and are only available on DVD. One scene expanded the Oswald shooting by showing corrupt police letting Ruby enter through a restricted entrance. The 1992 feature film Ruby speculated on Ruby&apos;s more complex motivations. Among the impulses explored by the film that might have propelled Ruby into shooting Oswald were Ruby&apos;s reputation among family and friends as an assiduous, emotionally volatile publicity-seeker, and the influence of his long-time organized crime and Dallas police connections. Ruby was played by Danny Aiello. [ Literature ] Ruby is one of the main characters of James Ellroy &apos;s novel, The Cold Six Thousand. The plot revolves around the aftermath of the assassination of John Kennedy, and the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. It speculates about the links of many historical characters with Mafia and anti- Castroist groups with the assassinations. In his 1989 novel Libra, Don DeLillo portrays Ruby as being part of a larger conspiracy surrounding the president&apos;s assassination, imagining that an FBI agent persuades Ruby to kill Oswald. [ Music ] &quot; Bicentennial &quot; is a song from the 1976 album, T Shirt, by Loudon Wainwright III. The verse referring to Ruby is: &quot; You know we have our heroes. I mean Washington and Lincoln, including Audie Murphy, including old Jack Ruby. Wasn&apos;t Jack wonderful? Oh, you know he certainly was. &quot; &quot; Jack Ruby &quot; is a song from the 1989 album, Key Lime Pie by Camper Van Beethoven. In the song, Ruby is described as, &quot; …the kind of man who beats his horses or the dancers who work at a bar. &quot; &quot; Jack Ruby &quot; is a song by British rock group Deep Purple from their 1998 album Abandon. [ Television ] The 1978 made-for-television movie, Ruby and Oswald generally followed the official record, as presented by the Warren Commission. Ruby&apos;s actions and dialogue (as well as those of the people he comes in contact with) are nearly verbatim re-enactments of testimony given to the Warren Commission by those involved, as per the opening narration. Ruby was played by Michael Lerner. In the television show Mad Men, the footage of Ruby shooting Oswald was shown in the third-season episode, &quot; The Grown-Ups, &quot; that dealt with Kennedy&apos;s assassination.
