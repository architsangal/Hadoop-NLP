As of November 2007 this conversation continues, as the Michael group continues to conduct closed sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area. A core concept of the teachings is: &quot; all choices made are equally valid. &quot; Chelsea Quinn Yarbro&apos;s book presented a heavily fictionalized version of Sarah Chambers&apos; group, identifying her under the pseudonym of Jessica Lansing. Ms. Yarbro owns the copyright to the group&apos;s work and published three more books on the subject, containing edited channeling transcripts as well as additional background material.
