When asked about watching daughter Juliet&apos;s career evolve, Bain told Attention Deficit Delirium: &quot; I think it&apos;s wonderful. She wants it, she&apos;s very good at it, so she should do it. She&apos;s very gifted. I&apos;ve seen her in the theater, and we&apos;ve been on stage together. We did a play in Los Angeles together. It was gorgeous because I was in the wings and could watch her, and she could be in the wings and watch me. I handed her a handkerchief at the end of her big crying scene. I&apos;ve never been nervous about her because she knows what she&apos;s doing, so I&apos;m very calm when I watch her and very excited to see what she&apos;s doing. I don’t take pride because it doesn’t seem like anything that I did. It seems more exquisite pleasure, but not pride. I didn&apos;t do anything, she did it. In kindergarten she said she wanted to be a singer/dancer/actress. She does sing and did dance. She didn&apos;t mess around. She went right after what she was going to do. &quot; [ http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/04/27/barbara-bain-looks-back-but-stays-forward-focused Barbara Bain Looks Back But Stays Forward Focused Bryan Reesman April 27, 2011 Attention Deficit Delirium January 25, 2012 ] [ References ] [ External links ] [ 828 ] [ Bain, Barbara Fogel, Millicent Actor September 13, 1931 Chicago, Illinois, U.S. ] Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Chicago, Illinois Category:American Jews Category:American television actors Category:Emmy Award winners Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign alumni de:Barbara Bain es:Barbara Bain fr:Barbara Bain it:Barbara Bain nl:Barbara Bain pl:Barbara Bain ru:Барбара Бэйн sh:Barbara Bain fi:Barbara Bain
