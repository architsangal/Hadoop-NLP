[ April 2010 ] A Maraschino cherry. A maraschino cherry ( [ icon m ær ə ˈ s k iː n oʊ ] [ marr-ə SKEE noh ] or [ m ær ə ˈ ʃ iː n oʊ ] [ marr-ə SHEE noh ] ) is a preserved, sweetened cherry, typically made from light-colored sweet cherries such as the Royal Ann, Rainier, or Gold varieties. In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a brine solution usually containing sulfur dioxide and calcium chloride to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a suspension of food coloring (common red food dye, FD &amp; C Red 40 ), sugar syrup, and other components. Green maraschino cherries use a mint flavoring. [ Blech Zushe Yosef Kosher Food Production 2009 John Wiley and Sons 0-8138-2093-6 266 ] Maraschino cherries are an ingredient in many cocktail s. As a garnish, they often are used to decorate frozen yogurt, baked ham, pork pie s, cake s, pastry, parfait s, milkshake s, ice cream sundae s, and ice cream soda s. They are also used as an accompaniment to sweet paan. They are also sometimes put into a glass of Coca-Cola to make an old-fashioned or homemade &quot; Cherry Coke &quot;. [ History ] The name maraschino refers to the marasca cherry of Croatian origin and the maraschino liqueur made from it, in which marasca cherries were crushed and sweetened. Whole cherries preserved in this liqueur were known as &quot; maraschino cherries &quot;. They were, at first, produced for and consumed as a delicacy by royalty and the wealthy. [ In the U.S. ] The cherries were first introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, where they were served in fine bars and restaurant s. By the turn of the century, American producers were experimenting with flavors such as almond extract and substituting Queen Anne cherries for marasca cherries. In 1912, the USDA defined &quot; maraschino cherries &quot; as &quot; marasca cherries preserved in maraschino &quot; under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The artificially-colored and sweetened Royal Anne variety were required to be called &quot; Imitation Maraschino Cherries &quot; instead.

Ernest H. Wiegand, a professor of horticulture at Oregon State University, developed the modern method of manufacturing maraschino cherries using a brine solution rather than alcohol. [ maraschino_cherries Verzemnieks, Inara ] Accordingly, most modern maraschino cherries have only a historical connection with maraschino liqueur. According to Bob Cain, who worked with Wiegand at OSU, Prohibition had nothing to do with Wiegand&apos;s research: his intention was to develop a better brining process for cherries that would not soften them. When Wiegand began his research, there were several ways to preserve maraschino cherries without alcohol, long before Prohibition went into effect. Wiegand took a process that people had their own recipes for— &quot; and who knows what they were putting in there &quot; (frequently not alcohol)—and turned it into a science, something replicable. [ The fruit that made Oregon famous Inara Verzemnieks 2006-02-12 The Oregonian http://blog.oregonlive.com/oregoniantest/2007/04/the_fruit_that_made_oregon_fam.html 2007-07-04 http://web.archive.org/web/20070930040753/http%3A//blog.oregonlive.com/oregoniantest/2007/04/the_fruit_that_made_oregon_fam.html 2007-09-30 ] When Wiegand began his research, sodium metabisulfite was being used to preserve maraschino cherries. Some accounts indicate that this preservation method was being used long before Prohibition. Some manufacturers used maraschino or imitation liqueurs to flavor the cherries, but newspaper stories from the early part of the century suggest that many manufacturers stopped using alcohol and artificial dyes before Prohibition. After Prohibition was repealed in 1933 the Food and Drug Administration revisited federal policy toward canned cherries. It held a hearing in April 1939 to establish a new standard of identity. Since 1940, &quot; maraschino cherries &quot; have been defined as &quot; cherries which have been dyed red, impregnated with sugar and packed in a sugar sirup flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor &quot;. Red Numbers 1 and 4, and Yellow Numbers 1 through 4 were removed from the approved list in 1960. The ban on Red Number 4 was lifted in 1965 to allow the coloring of maraschino cherries, which is considered mainly decorative and not a foodstuff (Pavia, et al., Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques).
