Proponents had sent two informational mailings to all Leagues before convention, and spirited debate on the convention floor persuaded the convention to concur with the statement proposed by the LWV of Illinois. Following the convention action, the LWVUS wrote to all members of Congress, announcing the League’s new position on gun control and urging passage of federal legislation to control the proliferation of handguns and semi-automatic assault weapons in the United States.

[ Controversies ] [ Attack ads ] In May 2011 the League televised advertisements showing a young girl wearing a facemask with a voice-over saying “when Scott Brown voted to eliminate clean air standards…just imagine what it could have done to her.” [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D7vTd9nmSpbI People Not Polluters - Scott Brown LeagueofWomenVoters LWV April 29, 2011 February 14, 2012 ] The decision to sponsor these ads was made by the executive committee of the national League.

But in reality, all that the senators voted to curb was the government&apos;s attempt to regulate carbon dioxide and other &quot; greenhouse &quot; gasses, which have no direct connection to asthma, and an indirect connection that is a matter of debate in the medical community. To sum up, we find the League of Women Voters&apos; ads to be deceptive primarily because they lead viewers to think Sens. Brown and McCaskill voted to ease restrictions on the kinds of &quot; emissions &quot; that everybody agrees are health-threatening pollutants. That&apos;s not what the senators did. We would not have called the ads deceitful had they honestly said that the senators voted to block regulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, the health effects of which are less certain. ] The League Cape Area board of directors, however, took the view that the ads were NOT appropriate. The League found them to violate their understanding of nonpartisanship. Nonpartisanship is a hallmark of all the work the League does. The controversy had the head of the Andover/North Andover League chapter handing in her resignation that read in part, “I do not agree with the direction in which the national and state Leagues seem to be headed… [Recent actions have] muted the effectiveness of the League as a non-partisan voter service provider.” [ http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/05/12/andover-league-of-women-voters-head-quits-over-scott-brown-ad/ Andover League Of Women Voters Head Quits Over Scott Brown Ad Jon Keller KBZ-TV May 12, 2011 February 14, 2012 ] [ See also ] U.S. Presidential Debate Sponsorship Becky Cain - President, Minnie Fisher Cunningham - First executive secretary of LWV [ References ] [ 30em ] [ Further reading ] [ Handbook for Members League of Women Voters of Massachusetts Boston ] [ Impact On Issues: 2004 - 2006 League of Women Voters of the United States Washington,D.C. 0-89959-446-8 ISBN status=May be invalid - please double check ] [ Lee, Percy Maxim; Young, Louise Merwin; Young, Ralph B.
