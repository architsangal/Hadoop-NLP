It is one of the most popular breeds in the United Kingdom. Since 2000, it has been growing in popularity in the United States. It is a smaller breed of spaniel, and Cavalier adults are often the same size as adolescent dogs of other spaniel breeds. It has a silky coat and commonly an undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours (Blenheim, Tricolour [black/white/tan], Black and Tan, and Ruby). The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals. The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed, a dog resembling Charles II &apos;s King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration. Various health issues affect this particular breed, most notably mitral valve disease, which leads to heart failure. This will appear in most Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. The breed may also suffer from Syringomyelia, in which cavities are formed in the spinal cord, possibly associated with malformation of the skull that reduces the space available for the brain. Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniel s of various types, and they can suffer from such other general maladies as hip dysplasia, which are common across many types of dog breeds. [ History ] { Anthony van Dyck, featuring a spaniel of the era at the bottom right. } During the 16th century, a small type of spaniel was popular among the nobility in England. The people of the time believed that these dogs could keep fleas away, and some even believed that they could prevent forms of stomach illnesses. These dogs were sometimes called the &quot; Spaniel Gentle &quot; or &quot; Comforter &quot;, as ladies taking a carriage ride would take a spaniel on their laps to keep them warm during the winter. { Moffat (2006) : p. 30 } Charles I kept a spaniel named Rogue while residing at Carisbrooke Castle; however, it is with Charles II that this breed is closely associated and it was said of him that &quot; His Majesty was seldom seen without his little dogs &quot;. There is a myth that he even issued an edict that no spaniels of this type could be denied entry to any public place. [ http://www.barkbytes.com/history/cavking.htm Cavalier King Charles Spaniel History Dupre, Malcolm Barkbytes.com 2009-11-14 ] During the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the long nosed style of spaniel went out of fashion. The Pug was the favoured dog at the time in the Netherlands, and with William&apos;s Dutch origin, they became popular in England too. At this time interbreeding may have occurred with the Pug, or other flat nosed breeds, as the King Charles took on some Pug-like characteristics, but in any event the modern King Charles Spaniel emerged. { Moffat (2006) : p. 19 } In The Dog in 1852, William Youatt was critical of the change in the breed: [ The King Charles&apos;s breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent, as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which the character of the dog too accurately corresponds. Still there is the long ear, and the silky coat, and the beautiful colour of the hair, and for these the dealers do not scruple to ask twenty, thirty, and even fifty guineas. Youatt: p.61 ] During the early part of the 18th  century, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim. Attempts were made to recreate the original King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniel s. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book &quot; Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians &quot; published under the name of the &quot; Hon. Mrs Neville Lytton &quot; in 1911.

Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named &quot; Ann&apos;s Son &quot; owned by Mostyn Walker, { Moffat (2006) : p. 22 } and the The Kennel Club recognised the breed as &quot; King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type &quot;. World War II caused a drastic setback to the breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of the hardship. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of sixty dropped to three during the 1940s. [ http://www.thecavalierclub.co.uk/club/history.html A Potted History 2009 The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club 2009-11-17 ] Following the war, just six dogs would be the starting block from which all Cavaliers descend. These dogs were Ann&apos;s Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh. [ http://www.cavalierclubbc.com/history.htm History The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club of BC 2009-11-17 ] The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945 The Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The history of the breed in America is relatively recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised in 1997, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers. { Moffat (2006) : p. 23 } [ Description ] Cavalier King Charles Spaniels traditionally come in four colours. Blenheim, Tricolour and Ruby are shown here, respectively. See below for Black and Tan. Closeup of Blenheim markings The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is one of the largest toy breeds. Historically it was a lap dog, and modern day adults can fill a lap easily. Nonetheless, it is small for a spaniel, with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. Breed standards state that height of a Cavalier should be between [ 12 to 13 in cm ] with a proportionate weight between [ 10 to 18 lb kg ]. The tail is usually not docked, and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed&apos;s features. [ http://www.cavalierkingcharlesspanielclub.co.za/ Cavalier King Charles Spaniel CavalierKingCharlesSpanielClub.co.za 2009-11-15 ] The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can be often confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel while in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago. There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between [ 10 to 18 lb kg ], the King Charles is smaller at [ 9 to 12 lb kg ]. In addition their facial features while similar, are different; the Cavalier&apos;s ears are set higher and its skull is flat while the King Charles&apos;s is domed. Finally the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin. { Coile (2008) : p. 9 } [ Colour ] The fourth colour, Black and Tan is seen on this dog. The breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour.

Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over, although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules. [ http://www.akc.org/breeds/cavalier_king_charles_spaniel/ AKC MEET THE BREEDS: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel American Kennel Club 2010-04-05 ] The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail. This colour is referred to as &quot; Prince Charles &quot; in the King Charles Spaniel. [ Popularity ] According to statistics released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year.

Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs make them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. The breed is great with people of all ages, from children to seniors, making them a very versatile dog. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren &apos;s The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience.

Cavaliers can often suffer from some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders. As today&apos;s Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. { Coile (2008) : p. 69 } The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataract s and retinal dysplasia.

This condition is polygenic (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It is the leading cause of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%).

It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally  – one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems  – mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The &quot; hinge &quot; on the heart&apos;s mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve&apos;s flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age. [ http://cavalierhealth.net/mitral_valve_disease.htm Mitral Valve Disease and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels CavalierHealth.org 2009-11-14 ] Veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines.

It is caused by a malformation in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid&apos;s pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90% of cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30–70% have syrinxes. [ http://cavalierhealth.net/syringomyelia.htm Syringomyelia (SM) and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel CavalierHealth.org 2009-11-14 ] However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. Scratching is often unilateral  – restricted to one side of the body. Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ( &quot; air scratching &quot; ). The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking  – without stopping  – in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ( &quot; bunny hopping &quot; ). Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night. [ PhD thesis Chiari-Like Malformation and Syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2007-0320-201201/index.htm Rusbridge Clare 2007 Utrecht University 2009-11-14 123300926 978-90-393-4456-9 ] This Blenheim&apos;s coat has rich chestnut markings on a white pearly coat. Not all dogs with SM show scratching behavior. Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition. A veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mite s, flea s, and allergies, and then, primary secretory otitis media (PSOM  – glue ear), as well as spinal or limb injuries, before assuming that a Cavalier has SM. PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and cheaper to treat. [ http://cavalierhealth.net/psom.htm Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel CavalierHealth.org 2009-11-14 ] Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms. An MRI scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM (and also will reveal PSOM). If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan. Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade. [ Episodic Falling (EF) ] A ruby Cavalier in the snow Episodic Falling causes &quot; exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity &quot; meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously thought to be a muscular disorder it is now known to be neurological; recently it has been discovered to be caused by a single recessive gene and a genetic test is available. Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode. [ http://cavalierhealth.net/episodic_falling.htm Episodic Falling Syndrome (Muscle Hypertonicity): Cavaliers Collapse Suddenly After Exercise CavalierHealth.org 2009-11-14 ] Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours.

Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.

This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.

PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM. [ http://www.cavalierhealth.net/psom.htm Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel CavalierHealth.org 2009-11-14 ] Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness, which is present at birth, due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare. In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppyhood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years. The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.
