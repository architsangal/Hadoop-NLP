Sizes to scale } A terrestrial planet, telluric planet or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rock s or metal s. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun. The terms are derived from Latin words for Earth (Terra and Tellus), so these planets are, in a certain way, &quot; Earth-like &quot;. Terrestrial planets have solid planetary surface making them substantially different from gas giant s, which are composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical state s. [ Structure ] Terrestrial planets all have approximately the same type of structure: a central metallic core, mostly iron, with a surrounding silicate mantle. The Moon is similar, but has a much smaller iron core. Terrestrial planets have canyon s, craters, mountain s, and volcano es. Terrestrial planets possess secondary atmosphere s — atmospheres generated through internal volcanism or comet impacts, as opposed to the gas giants, which possess primary atmosphere s — atmospheres captured directly from the original solar nebula. [ 2004 Primary Atmospheres (Astronomy 121: Lecture 14 Terrestrial Planet Atmospheres) Department of Physics University of Oregon Dr. James Schombert http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec14.html 22 December 2009 ] Theoretically, there are two types of terrestrial or rocky planets, one dominated by silicon compounds and another dominated by carbon compounds, like carbonaceous chondrite asteroids. These are the silicate planets and carbon planet s (or &quot; diamond planets &quot; ) respectively (the Solar System does not include any carbon planets). [ Solar terrestrial planets ] Relative masses of the terrestrial planets of the Solar System, including the Moon Earth&apos;s Solar System has four terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Only one terrestrial planet, Earth, is known to have an active hydrosphere. During the formation of the Solar System, there were probably many more &quot; terrestrial &quot; planetesimals, but they have all merged with or been destroyed by the four remaining worlds in the solar nebula. Plutoid s, objects like Pluto, are similar to terrestrial planets in the fact that they do have a solid surface, but are, on average, composed of more icy materials ( Ceres &apos;s density is about that of Pluto, and Haumea &apos;s is similar to Pallas &apos;s). [ Density trends ] The uncompressed density of a terrestrial planet is the average density its materials would have at zero pressure. A greater uncompressed density indicates greater metal content. Uncompressed density is used rather than true average density because compression within planet cores increases their density (making average density depend on planet size as well as composition). The uncompressed densities of the solar terrestrial planets, the Moon, and the three largest asteroid s are shown below. Densities generally trend towards lower values as the distance from the Sun increases. Object mean density uncompressed density semi-major axis Mercury ☿ 5.4 g cm −3 5.3 g cm −3 0.39 AU Venus ♀ 5.2 g cm −3 4.4 g cm −3 0.72 AU Earth ⊕ 5.5 g cm −3 4.4 g cm −3 1.0 AU Moon 3.3 g cm −3 3.3 g cm −3 1.0 AU Mars ♂ 3.9 g cm −3 3.8 g cm −3 1.5 AU Vesta 3.4 g cm −3 3.4 g cm −3 2.3 AU Ceres 2.1 g cm −3 2.1 g cm −3 2.8 AU Pallas 2.8 g cm −3 2.8 g cm −3 2.8 AU The main exception to this rule is the density of the Moon, which probably owes its lesser density to its unusual origin. It is unknown whether extrasolar terrestrial planets in general will also follow this trend. E.g. Kepler-10b does: it has a density of 8.8 [ 2.1 2.9 ]  g  cm −3, and orbits its star much closer than Mercury orbits the Sun. [ Extrasolar terrestrial planets ] [ Super-Earth Pulsar planet ] Artist&apos;s rendering of an Earthlike planet The majority of planets found outside the Solar System have been gas giant s since they produce more pronounced wobbles in the host stars and are thus more easily detectable { Carole Haswell, Transiting Exoplanets } { Michael Perryman, The Exoplanet Handbook } { Sara Seager, Exoplanets }. However, a number of extrasolar planets are suspected to be terrestrial. During the early 1990s, the first extrasolar planets were discovered orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 with masses of  0.02, 4.3, and 3.9 times that of Earth&apos;s. They were discovered by accident: their transit caused interruptions in the pulsar&apos;s radio emissions (had they not been orbiting around a pulsar, they would not have been found). When 51 Pegasi b, the first planet found around a star still undergoing fusion, was discovered, many astronomers assumed it must be a gigantic terrestrial, as it was assumed no gas giant could exist as close to its star (0.052  AU) as 51  Pegasi  b did. However, subsequent diameter measurements of a similar extrasolar planet ( HD  209458  b ), which transited its star showed that these objects were indeed gas giants. { carbon planet } In June 2005, the first planet around a fusing star that may be terrestrial was found orbiting around the red dwarf star Gliese  876, 15  light years away. That planet, Gliese  876  d, has a mass 7 to 9 times that of Earth and an orbital period of just two Earth days. But the radius and composition of the planet is unknown. On 10 August 2005, Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork / Robotic Telescope Network (PLANET/RoboNet) and Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) observed the signs of a cold planet designated OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, about 5.5  times the mass of Earth, orbiting a star about 21,000 light year s away in the constellation Scorpius. The newly discovered planet orbits its parent star at a distance similar to that of the Solar System&apos;s asteroid belt. The planet revealed its existence through a technique known as gravitational microlensing, currently unique in its capability to detect planets with masses down to that of Earth. In April 2007, a team of 11 European scientists announced the discovery of a planet outside the Solar System that is potentially habitable, with Earth-like temperatures. The planet was discovered by the European Southern Observatory &apos;s telescope in La  Silla, Chile, which has a special instrument that splits light to find wobbles in different wave lengths. Those wobbles can reveal the existence of other worlds. What they revealed is planets circling the red dwarf star, Gliese  581. Gliese  581  c was considered to be habitable at first, but more recent study (April 2009) [ 21 April 2009 Lightest exoplanet yet discovered ESO (ESO 15/09 - Science Release) http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-15-09.html 15 July 2009 ] suggests Gliese  581  d is a better candidate. Regardless, it has increased interest in examining planets circling dimmer stars. About 80 percent of the stars near Earth are red dwarfs. The Gliese  581 (c  and  d) planets are about five to seven times heavier than Earth, classifying them as super-Earth s. Gliese 581 e is only about 1.9 Earth mass, but could have 2 orders of magnitude more tidal heating than Jupiter’s volcanic satellite Io.

However, its discovery has been called into doubt - recent analyses of the data by different researchers have yielded different conclusions as to the existence of the planet.

The acceleration of gravity is 1.4 times that on Earth. The orange dwarf star orbited by HD85512b is 5.6 billion years old and resides 36 light years from the solar system in the constellation Vela.

The Kepler spacecraft was launched on 6  March 2009. The duration of the mission will need to be about three and a half years long to detect and confirm an Earth-like planet orbiting at an Earth-like distance from the host star. Since it will take intervals of one year for a truly Earth-like planet to transit (cross in front of its star), it will take about four transits for a reliable reading. Dimitar Sasselov, the Kepler mission co-investigator, recently mentioned at the 2010 TED Conference that there have been hundreds more candidate terrestrial planets discovered since Kepler went online. If these planets are confirmed via further investigation, then it will represent the largest find of extrasolar planets to date. The Kepler science teams are, for now, keeping the initial results of any candidate planets a secret so they can confirm their results. The first public announcement of any such results is expected during the early part of 2011.

These include the Terrestrial Planet Finder, Space Interferometry Mission, Darwin, New Worlds Mission, and Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. [ Types ] [ May 2011 ] Several possible classifications for terrestrial planets have been proposed { http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2476/all-planets-possible } : Silicate planet The standard type of terrestrial planet seen in the Solar System, made primarily of silicon-based rocky mantle with a metallic (iron) core. Iron planet A theoretical type of terrestrial planet that consists almost entirely of iron and therefore has a greater density and a smaller radius than other terrestrial planets of comparable mass. Mercury in the Solar System has a metallic core equal to 60–70% of its planetary mass. Iron planets are believed to form in the high-temperature regions close to a star, like Mercury, and if the protoplanetary disk is rich in iron. Coreless planet A theoretical type of terrestrial planet that consists of silicate rock but has no metallic core, i.e. the opposite of an iron planet. The Solar System contains no coreless planets, but chondrite asteroids and meteorites are common in it. Coreless planets are believed to form farther from the star where volatile oxidizing material is more common. Carbon planet A theoretical class of planets, composed of a metal core surrounded by primarily carbon-based minerals. They may be considered a type of terrestrial planet if the metal content dominates. The Solar System contains no carbon planets, but does have carbonaceous asteroids. Super-Earth Super-Earths are planets with masses between Earth&apos;s and Neptune&apos;s. They may be gas planet s or terrestrial, depending on their mass and other parameters. The latter represent the upper-end of the terrestrial-planet mass range.
