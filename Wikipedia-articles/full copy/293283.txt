She was a founding member of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in the 1960s, and served as its director. She has taught music at Mills College, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Oliveros has written books, formulated new music theories and investigated new ways to focus attention on music including her concepts of &quot; Deep Listening &quot; and &quot; sonic awareness &quot;. [ Early career ] Oliveros earned degrees from Moores School of Music at the University of Houston and San Francisco State University where her teachers included composer Robert Erickson. At the University of Houston, she was a member of the band program and was a founding member of the local chapter of Tau Beta Sigma Honorary Band Sorority. Oliveros is one of the original members of the San Francisco Tape Music Center, which was an important resource on the U.S. west coast for electronic music during the 1960s. { Amirkhanian, Charles. &quot; Women in Electronic Music - 1977 &quot;.

In 1973, Oliveros conducted studies at UCSD&apos;s one-year-old Center for Music Experiment; she served as the Center&apos;s director from 1976 to 1979.

[ Deep Listening ] Oliveros coined the term &quot; Deep Listening &quot; in 1991, a term which she then applied to her group The Deep Listening Band and to the Deep Listening program of Deep Listening Institute, Ltd. (formerly The Pauline Oliveros Foundation, founded in 1985). The Deep Listening program includes annual listening retreats in Europe, New Mexico and in upstate New York, as well as apprenticeship and certification programs. The Deep Listening Band, which includes Oliveros, David Gamper, and Stuart Dempster, specializes in performing and recording in resonant or reverberant spaces such as caves, cathedrals and huge underground cistern s. They have collaborated with Ellen Fullman and her long string instrument, as well as countless other musicians, dancers, and performers. [ Sonic awareness ] Von Gunden (1983, p.105-107) describes and names a new musical theory, developed by Oliveros in the &quot; Introductions &quot; to her Sonic Meditations and in articles, called &quot; sonic awareness. &quot; Sonic awareness is the ability to consciously focus attention upon environmental and musical sound, requiring continual alertness and an inclination towards always listening, and comparable to John Berger &apos;s concept of visual consciousness (as in his Ways of Seeing ). &quot; Sonic awareness is a synthesis of the psychology of consciousness, the physiology of the martial arts, and the sociology of the feminist movement &quot; and describes two ways of processing information, focal attention and global attention, which may be represented by the dot and circle, respectively, of the mandala Oliveros commonly employs in composition. Later this representation was expanded, with the mandala quartered and the quarters representing actively making sound, imagining sound, listening to present sound, and remembering past sound. This model was used in the composition of her Sonic Meditations. Practice of the theory creates &quot; complex sound masses possessing a strong tonal center &quot;, as focal attention creates tonality and the global attention creates masses of sound, flexible timbre, attack, duration, intensity, and sometimes pitch, as well as untraditional times and spaces for performance such as requiring extended hours or environmental settings. The theory promotes easily created sounds such as vocal ones, and &quot; says that music should be for everyone anywhere. &quot; [ Composer, teacher, author ] In 1994, Oliveros was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, the Grants to Artists award. Oliveros currently teaches at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Mills College. She is openly lesbian.
