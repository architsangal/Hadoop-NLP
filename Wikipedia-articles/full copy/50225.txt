For the prime meridian commonly used for locations on the Earth since the 20th century see IERS Reference Meridian. [ 0 ] A prime meridian is a meridian, i.e. a line of longitude, at which longitude is defined to be 0°. A prime meridian and its opposite in a 360°-system, the 180th meridian (at 180° longitude), form a great circle. This great circle divides the sphere, e.g. the Earth, into two hemisphere s. If one uses directions of East and West from a defined prime meridian, then they can be called Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere. An international conference in 1884 decided the Prime Meridian passes through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in southeast London, United Kingdom, { International Prime Meridian was chosen by the International Meridian Conference, Washington DC, October 1884. } [ TIME from Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics McCarthy Dennis Dennis McCarthy (scientist) Seidelmann P. Kenneth 244 –5 Weinheim Wiley-VCH 2009 ] known as the International Meridian or Greenwich meridian. As of 2012 the most used prime meridian for the Earth is the IERS Reference Meridian (IRM). It passes 5.31 arcsecond s east of Airy&apos;s transit circle or 102.5 metres (336.3  feet) at the latitude of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, London. { History of the Prime Meridian -Past and Present } { IRM on grounds of Royal Observatory from Google Earth Accessed 30 March 2012 } { The astronomic latitude of the Royal Observatory is 51°28&apos;38 &quot; N whereas its latitude on the European Terrestrial Reference Frame (1989) } { datum is 51°28&apos;40.1247 &quot; N. } A current convention on the earth uses the opposite of the IRM as the basis for the International Date Line. [ Greenwich meridian ] Greenwich meridian in London { Gerardus Mercator in his &apos;&apos; } { Atlas Cosmographicae &apos;&apos; (1595) uses a prime meridian in the } { Atlantic, intended to separate the } { Old World (Eurasia and Africa) and the } { New World (the Americas) into two hemispheres.

Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975 } By 1884, over two-thirds of all ships and tonnage used it as the reference meridian on their maps. In October of that year, at the behest of U.S. President Chester A. Arthur, 41 delegates from 25 nations met in Washington, D.C., for the International Meridian Conference. This conference selected the Greenwich meridian as the official Prime meridian due to its popularity. However, France abstained from the vote and French maps continued to use the Paris meridian for several decades. [ IERS Reference Meridian ] [ IERS Reference Meridian ] The IERS Reference Meridian (IRM), also called the International Reference Meridian, is the prime meridian (0° longitude) maintained by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). It passes 5.31 arcsecond s east of Airy&apos;s transit circle or 102.5 metres (336.3  feet) at the latitude of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, London. It is also the reference meridian of the Global Positioning System operated by the United States Department of Defense, and of WGS84 and its two formal versions, the ideal International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and its realization, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).

Often a landmark such as a crater is used, other times a prime meridian is defined by reference to another celestial object, or by magnetic fields.The prime meridians of the following planetographic systems have been defined: [ http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/WGCCRE/constants/iau2000_table1.html 22 October 2009 USGS Astrogeology: Rotation and pole position for the Sun and planets (IAU WGCCRE) ] [ http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O80-Carringtonheligrphccrdnts.html Carrington heliographic coordinates ] [ http://documents.wolfram.com/applications/astronomer/AdditionalInformation/PlanetographicCoordinates.html Planetographic Coordinates 2009-06-19 ] The prime meridian of the Moon lies directly in the middle of the face of the moon visible from Earth and passes near the crater Bruce. The prime meridian of Mars is defined by the crater Airy-0. The prime meridian of Venus passes through the central peak in the crater Ariadne. Two different heliographic coordinate system s are used on the Sun. The first is the Carrington heliographic coordinate system. In this system, the prime meridian passes through the center of the solar disk as seen from the Earth on 9 November 1853, which is when Richard Christopher Carrington started his observations of sunspots. The second is the Stonyhurst heliographic coordinates system. Jupiter has several coordinate systems because its cloud tops -- the only part of the planet visible from space -- rotate at different rates depending on latitude. It is unknown whether Jupiter has any internal solid surface that would enable a more Earth-like coordinate system. Scientific Astronomer uses System II coordinates, based on the mean atmospheric rotation of the north and south Equatorial belts. System III coordinates use Jupiter&apos;s magnetic field. Titan, like the Earth&apos;s moon, always has the same face towards Saturn, and so that face is 0 longitude.
