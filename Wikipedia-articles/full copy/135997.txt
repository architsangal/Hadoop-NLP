January 23, 2010. Retrieved on January 24, 2010. } Bellaire was founded in 1908 by William Wright Baldwin, who was the president of the South End Land Company. Baldwin, a native of Iowa, was well known as the vice president of the Burlington Railroad. Bellaire was founded on what was part of William Marsh Rice &apos;s [ 9,449 acre km2 ] ranch. Baldwin surveyed the eastern [ 1,000 acre km2 ] of the ranch into small truck farms. He named those farms &quot; Westmoreland Farms &quot;. Baldwin started Bellaire in the middle of &quot; Westmoreland Farms &quot; to serve as a residential neighborhood and an agricultural trading center. South End Land Company advertised to farmers in the Midwestern United States. Baldwin stated that the town was named &quot; Bellaire &quot;, or &quot; Good Air &quot; for its breezes &quot;. Bellaire may have been named after Bellaire, Ohio, a town served by one of Baldwin&apos;s rail lines. Six miles of prairie was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally the town was bounded by Palmetto, First, Jessamine, and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets. In 1910 Edward Teas, a horticulturist, moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so Teas could implement Sid Hare&apos;s landscaping plans. Bellaire was incorporated as a city with a general charter in 1918, ten years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time. Because of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire&apos;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. { Lee, Renée C. &quot; Annexed Kingwood split on effects. &quot; } { Houston Chronicle.

After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population explosion in the post- World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire&apos;s land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city&apos;s residents had numbered 10,150. Bellaire High School was established in 1955. According to a Bellaire resident quoted in the Houston Post, prior to 1992, the tax base of the city of Bellaire had been decreasing. After neighbor West University Place eased restrictions on developers, new houses were constructed in West University Place, and the city gained a larger tax base. Bellaire decided to also liberalize its development restrictions to allow for new development by streamlining its no-growth building permit process. According to Karl Lewis, a vice president and sales manager at John Daugherty Realtors, when the prices of West University Place land reached about $20 per square foot, area home buyers began to consider Bellaire, which had an average price of $10–12 per square foot. Don Stowers of the Houston Press said that Bellaire and West University Place had &quot; comparable &quot; attributes such as independent fire and police departments, zoning, recreation facilities and parks, and schools &quot; among the best in Houston. &quot; Michael Blum, president of Blum &amp; Associates Realty, said &quot; Bellaire is a bargain. &quot; Blum added that Bellaire was affordable compared to similar American neighborhoods and that Bellaire had proximity to business districts, &quot; excellent &quot; municipal services, and &quot; superior &quot; schools. { Stowers, Don. &quot; Bellaire small-town flavor, big-city convenience. &quot; } { Houston Post.

A Bellaire lot can accommodate a house with a detached garage and a swimming pool, while the typical West University Place lot could accommodate a newly constructed Georgian house described by Don Stowers of the Houston Post as &quot; lot-hugging. &quot; The more spacious and inexpensive housing lots prompted area home seekers to consider Bellaire. The original Bellaire housing stock typically consisted of 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom post- World War II houses described by Stowers as &quot; smallish. &quot; Because of the attributes, developers did not hesitate to tear these houses down and build new houses. Some individuals chose to renovate their houses instead of having them torn down. Many individuals who would otherwise renovate the houses reconsidered their decisions as the land value increased. In some cases the land value was higher than the value of the structure on the lot. Some subdivisions had larger houses, particularly the Carroll subdivision south of Bellaire Boulevard and the Braeburn Country Club Estates subdivision between Chimney Rock and Rice. Many of the houses in those subdivisions were built in the 1950s and early 1960s, and many were on [.5 acre ha ] lots. Karl Lewis, the vice president and sales manager of John Daugherty Realtors, said that many of the houses were &quot; still quite attractive &quot; and &quot; similar to the large Tanglewood homes. &quot; In 1992 smaller lots in Bellaire were about $50,000 and up, while larger lots were $300,000 to $500,000.
