[ Early life ] Clara Barton was the youngest child of Stephen Barton: veteran of the Indian Wars in Ohio and Michigan, and a selectman in Oxford, Massachusetts; and his wife, Sarah. Her siblings were Dorothy, Sally, Stephen and David. [ Clara Barton Birthplace Museum Clara&apos;s Family http://www.clarabartonbirthplace.org/life/family.html 7 April 2012 ] Barton always had a passion for being a nurse. She took care of her dog when he hurt his leg. But the best example was her brother, David Barton. When Barton was 11, David was fixing the barn roof, and he fell off. The doctor said that he would die within a matter of time. But young Barton was determined to save him. She nursed him back to health. The doctors didn&apos;t know how she did it, but David knew that she had a gift. [ Early professional life ] Clara Barton became a school teacher in 1837 teaching in the area for a dozen years in schools at Oxford, N. Oxford, Charlton, and West Millbury. In 1850, Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. Following these studies, Barton opened a free school in New Jersey. The attendance under her leadership grew to 600 but instead of hiring Barton to head the school, the board hired a man instead. Frustrated, in 1854 she moved to Washington D.C. and began work as a clerk in the US Patent Office; { Clara Barton, Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography } this was the first time a woman had received a substantial clerkship in the federal government and at a salary equal to a man&apos;s salary. Subsequently, under political opposition to women working in government offices, her position was reduced to that of copyist, and in 1857, under the administration of James Buchanan, eliminated entirely. { Clara Barton, www.civilwaracademy.com } After the election of Abraham Lincoln, having lived with relatives and friends in Massachusetts for three years, she returned to work at the patent office in the autumn of 1860, now as temporary copyist, in the hope she could pioneer to make way for more women in government service. [ American Civil War ] Clara Barton circa 1866. On April 21, 1861, American Civil War, a trainload of Union soldiers was mobbed by Confederate sympathizers in Baltimore, MD and arrived in Washington DC full of dead and wounded with no baggage or supplies. Barton tended to wounded soldiers (some from Massachusetts) quartered in the U.S. Senate chamber in Washington. [ http://www.nps.gov/clba/forkids/chron2.htm Clara Barton Chronology 1861–1869 Clara Barton National Historic Site 8 September 2011 ] [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3DLC5x31cCf_sC The Life of Clara Barton Percy Harold Epler Macmillan 1915 2010-09-28 ] Then after the First Battle of Bull Run, July 21, Barton established the main agency to obtain and distribute supplies to wounded soldiers. She was given a pass by General William Hammond to ride in army ambulances to provide comfort to the soldiers and nurse them back to health and lobbied the U.S. Army bureaucracy, at first without success, to bring her own medical supplies to the battlefields. Finally, on August 3, 1862, she obtained permission to travel to the front lines, eventually reaching some of the grimmest battlefields of the war and serving during the Siege of Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. In 1864 she was appointed by Union General Benjamin Butler as the &quot; lady in charge &quot; of the hospitals at the front of the Army of the James. Among her more harrowing experiences was an incident in which a bullet tore through the sleeve of her dress without striking her and killed a man to whom she was tending.She is known as the &quot; Angel of the Battlefield. &quot; [ American Red Cross ] After the war, she ran the Office of Missing Soldiers, at 437 Seventh Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. in the Gallery Place neighborhood. { Clara Barton. dcwriters.poetrymutual.org } Barton then achieved widespread recognition by delivering lectures around the country about her war experiences. She met Susan B. Anthony and began a long association with the woman&apos;s suffrage movement. She also became acquainted with Frederick Douglass and became an activist for black civil rights. In 1869, during her trip to Geneva, Switzerland, Barton was introduced to the Red Cross and Henry Dunant &apos;s book A Memory of Solferino, which called for the formation of national societies to provide relief voluntarily on a neutral basis. At the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, in 1870, she assisted the grand duchess of Baden in the preparation of military hospitals, and gave the Red Cross society much aid during the war. At the joint request of the German authorities and the Strasbourg Comité de Secours, she superintended the supplying of work to the poor of Strasbourg in 1871, after the Siege of Freaking Paris, and in 1872 had charge of the public distribution of supplies to the destitute people of Paris. At the close of the war she was decorated with the golden cross of Baden and the iron cross of Germany. [ Barton, Clara 1900 1 ] When Clara Barton returned to the United States, she inaugurated a movement to gain recognition for the International Committee of the Red Cross by the United States government.[5] When she began work on this project in 1873, most Americans thought the U.S. would never again face a calamity like the Civil War, but Barton finally succeeded during the administration of President Chester Arthur, using the argument that the new American Red Cross could respond to crises other than war. Barton naturally became President of the American branch of the society, which held its first official meeting at her I Street apartment in Washington, DC May 21, 1881. The first local society was founded August 22, 1881 in Dansville, Livingston County, New York, where she maintained a country home. [ History Marks Mary Jo American Red Cross Clara Barton #1 http://www.redcrossclara.com/History.html 2009-01-11 ] The society&apos;s role changed with the advent of the Spanish-American War during which it aided refugees and prisoners of the civil war. In 1896, responding to the humanitarian crisis in the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of the Hamidian Massacres, Barton sailed to Constantinople and after long negotiations with Abdul Hamid II, opened the first American International Red Cross headquarters in the heart of Turkey. Barton herself traveled along with five other Red Cross expeditions to the Armenian provinces in the spring of 1896, providing relief and humanitarian aid. Barton also worked in hospitals in Cuba in 1898 at the age of seventy-seven. [ A Woman of Valor Oates Stephen B. Macmillan 1994 0-02-923405-0 382 ] Barton&apos;s last field operation as President of the American Red Cross was the relief effort for the victims of the Galveston hurricane of September 1900. The operation established an orphanage for children of the 6,000 dead, helped to acquire lumber for rebuilding houses, and teamed with the New York World newspaper to accept contributions for the relief effort. As criticism arose of her management of the American Red Cross, plus her advancing age, Barton resigned as president in 1904, at the age of 83. After resigning, Barton founded the National First Aid Society.On April 12, 1912 at the age of 90 she died in Glen Echo, Maryland with all her friends by her side. Cause of death was tuberculosis which she contracted two years earlier and had been bedridden one month earlier. [ Religious beliefs ] Various authorities [ May 2011 ] have called Barton a “Deist-Unitarian &quot; or freethinker or deist. Although not formally a member of the Universalist Church of America, { Russell E. Miller -The larger hope: the first century of the Universalist Church in America 1979 &quot; Although not formally a Universalist by church membership, she had come of a Universalist family, was sympathetic to the tenets of the denomination, and has always been claimed by it.124 Known as &quot; the Florence Nightingale of our war &quot;, } in a 1905 letter to the widow of Carl Norman Thrasher, she identified herself with her parents&apos; church as a &quot; Universalist”. [ Positive Atheism website http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml8886.htm 2007-05-25 ] source taken from The Universalist Leader 120/49 1938My dear friend and sister: Your belief that I am a Universalist is as correct as your greater belief that you are one yourself, a belief in which all who are privileged to possess it rejoice. In my case, it was a great gift, like St. Paul, I &apos;was born free&apos;, and saved the pain of reaching it through years of struggle and doubt. My father was a leader in the building of the church in which Hosea Ballow preached his first dedication sermon. Your historic records will show that the old Huguenot town of Oxford, Mass. erected one of, if not the first Universalist Church in America. In this town I was born; in this church I was reared. In all its reconstructions and remodelings I have taken a part, and I look anxiously for a time in the near future when the busy world will let me once more become a living part of its people, praising God for the advance in the liberal faith of the religions of the world today, so largely due to the teachings of this belief. Give, I pray you, dear sister, my warmest congratulations to the members of your society. My best wishes for the success of your annual meeting, and accept my thanks most sincerely for having written me. Fraternally yours, (Signed) Clara Barton. [ Clara Barton National Historic Site ]   In 1975, Clara Barton National Historic Site, located at 5801 Oxford Road, Glen Echo, Maryland, was established as a unit of the National Park Service at Barton&apos;s home, where she spent the last 15 years of her life. One of the first National Historic Sites dedicated to the accomplishments of a woman, it preserves the early history of the American Red Cross, since the home also served as an early headquarters of the organization. She was born in a house which is now a museum. The National Park Service has restored eleven rooms, including the Red Cross offices, the parlors and Barton&apos;s bedroom. Visitors to Clara Barton National Historic Site can gain a sense of how Barton lived and worked. Guides lead tourists through the three levels, emphasizing Barton&apos;s use of her unusual home. Modern visitors can come to appreciate the site in the same way visitors did in Clara Barton&apos;s lifetime.
