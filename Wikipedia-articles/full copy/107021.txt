[ History ] Named after Malvern Hill in Virginia, Malvern was founded in 1870 by the Cairo and Fulton Railroad as a city site [ 21 mi km ] south of Hot Springs. On October 15, 1878, Malvern officially became the county seat of Hot Spring County. The original inhabitants of the county were Native Americans, trappers, hunters, and farmers. The Hot Springs Railroad, often referred to as the Diamond Jo line, was established as a narrow-gauge railroad by Chicago businessman Joseph Reynolds in 1874. { http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1 &amp; res=9E06E4D81230E633A25755C2A96E9C94699FD7CF &amp; oref=slogin } { http://www.arkansas.com/city-listings/city_detail/city/Malvern } Reynolds began building the Hot Springs Railroad, which extends north from Malvern Junction, a station on the Cairo &amp; Fulton, to Hot Springs, after he had endured unsatisfactory stagecoach rides to Hot Springs, AR. Because Malvern was the closest railroad station to Hot Springs, it became an important junction point for passengers transferring from rail to stagecoach to complete their journey to the spas in Hot Springs. This was the only railroad into Hot Springs for 15 years. The opening of the Little Rock, Hot Springs &amp; Western Railroad in April 1900 provided a more direct access to Hot Springs from Little Rock and the north, and both the Choctaw, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf and the Iron Mountain took advantage of this route, effectively cutting the volume of interchange traffic into Malvern. By 1902 passenger train shuttle service through Malvern had essentially ended. { http://www.railserve.com:80/jump/jump.cgi?ID=17496 } The Malvern Police Department has lost three officers in the line of duty, all shot to death during the 1930s. They were Clyde Davis, { http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=3846 } Leslie Lee Potts, { http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=10789 } and Hiram Potts. { http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=10788 } Davis and Leslie Lee Potts were both shot during a domestic dispute on April 21, 1933, a shootout in which they killed the suspect. Hiram Potts, who was related to Leslie Lee Potts, was shot and killed during his March 4, 1935 attempt to arrest two men who were boarding a train illegally. [ Media ] The city&apos;s daily newspaper is the Malvern Daily Record, which was established in 1916. It publishes an afternoon edition Tuesday through Friday with a Saturday morning &quot; Weekend Edition &quot;. { http://www.malvern-online.com/ } The city also has two radio stations, namely KIXV (101.5), which plays oldies, and KBOK-AM (1310), which plays country music. [ Transportation ] Malvern is connected on road by Interstate 30, U.S. Route 270, and U.S. Route 67. Amtrak &apos;s Texas Eagle provides daily passenger train service to Malvern on a route extending from Chicago to Dallas and Los Angeles, and railroad freight service to Malvern is provided by Union Pacific Railroad and the Arkansas Midland Railroad, the latter operating over the route of the original Hot Springs Railroad.
