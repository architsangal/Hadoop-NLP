[ Synopsis ] The show followed neighbors Pebbles Flintstone (voiced by Sally Struthers and in Season 2 by Mickey Stevens) and Bamm-Bamm Rubble (voiced by Jay North ) as teen sweethearts. The episodes were set mainly in the duo&apos;s activities at Bedrock High School in the prehistoric town of Bedrock with their friends Moonrock (the school genius and resident inventor), Penny (a slightly overweight girl obsessed with being thin), Wiggy (who planned her day according to what it said in the daily horoscope ), snobby Cindy (Pebbles&apos;s rival) and her equally snobby boyfriend Fabian, Bad Luck Schleprock (whose favorite catchphrase was, &quot; Oh wowsie wowsie woo woo. Miserable day, isn&apos;t it? &quot; ), and a motorcycle gang called the Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub, and Zonk). Bronto&apos;s favorite catchphrase was, &quot; Wait for your leader, you dummies! &quot; (said whenever his gang took off without him). Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty were also featured on the show in supporting roles. Their favorite hangout was a fast food joint called Brontoburgers&apos;. A running gag that occurred throughout the run of the series was whenever Pebbles came up with an idea (good or not-so-good), she would say, &quot; Yabba Dabba Dooozie! &quot; (a play on her father&apos;s, &quot; Yabba Dabba Doo! &quot; from the earlier series) and Bamm Bamm would become exasperated with Pebbles&apos; &quot; crazy hair-brained schemes &quot;. Among Bamm Bamm&apos;s favorite catchphrases was, &quot; Oh no! She&apos;s got that look in her eye! &quot; (said whenever Pebbles came up with one of her nutty ideas). The series was produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, animation directed by Charles A. Nichols, and written by Neal Barbera, Walter Black, Larz Bourne, Tom Dagenais, Bob Ogle, Larry Rhine, Richard Robbins, Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. The music was composed by Hoyt Curtin. A second season of four new 8-minute episodes aired as part of The Flintstone Comedy Hour in 1972; episodes from both seasons were later featured as segments on the syndicated weekday series Fred Flintstone and Friends in 1977. In the late 1980s, repeats were shown on USA Cartoon Express and later resurfaced on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained an inferior laugh track created by the studio.
