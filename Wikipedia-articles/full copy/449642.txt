[ #6495ED Carel Fabritius Carel Fabritius - Zelfportret.jpg Baptized 27 February 1622 Middenbeemster, Dutch Republic 12 October 1654 (age 32) Delft, Dutch Republic Rembrandt Pieter de Hooch, Johannes Vermeer ] Carel Fabritius (bapt. 27 February 1622 - 12 October 1654) was a Dutch painter and one of Rembrandt &apos;s most gifted pupils. [ Biography ] Fabritius was born in Beemster, the ten-year old polder, as the son of a schoolteacher. Initially he worked as a carpenter (Latin fabritius). In the early 1640s he studied at Rembrandt&apos;s studio in Amsterdam, along with his brother Barent Fabritius. In the early 1650s he moved to Delft, and joined the Delft painters&apos; guild in 1652. He died young, caught in the explosion of the Delft gunpowder magazine on October 12, 1654, which destroyed a quarter of the city, along with his studio and many of his paintings. Only about a dozen paintings have survived. According to Houbraken, his student Mattias Spoors and the church deacon Simon Decker died with him, since they were working on a painting together at the time. In a poem written by Arnold Bon to his memory, he is called Karel Faber. { Karel Fabricius biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by } { Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the } { Digital library for Dutch literature } Of all Rembrandt&apos;s pupils, Fabritius was the only one to develop his own artistic style. A typical Rembrandt portrait would have a plain dark background with the subject defined by spotlighting. In contrast, Fabritius&apos; portraits feature delicately lit subjects against light-coloured, textured backgrounds. Moving away from the Renaissance focus on iconography, Fabritius became interested in the technical aspects of painting. He used cool colour harmonies to create shape in a luminous style of painting. Fabritius was also interested in complex spatial effects, as can be seen in the exaggerated perspective of A View in Delft, with a Musical Instrument Seller&apos;s Stall (1652). He also showed excellent control of a heavily loaded brush, as in The Goldfinch (1654). All these qualities appear in the work of Delft&apos;s most famous painters, Vermeer and de Hooch; it is likely that Fabritius was a strong influence on them.
