Along with tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid, phenelzine is one of the few non-selective MAOIs still in widespread clinical use. [ Indications ] Phenelzine is used primarily in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with depressive symptomology characterized as &quot; atypical &quot;, &quot; nonendogenous &quot;, and/or &quot; neurotic &quot;, have been reported to respond particularly well to phenelzine. { Parke-Davis Division of Pfizer Inc. (2007). Nardil(R) (Phenelzine sulfate tablets, USP), labeling information. Retrieved December 14, 2009 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&apos;s Web site: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/011909s038lbl.pdf } The medication has also been found to be useful in patients who do not respond favorably to first and second-line treatments for depression, or are said to be &quot; treatment-resistant &quot;. [ 15552546 ] In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, phenelzine has been found in studies to be effective in treating dysthymia, [ 3446308 ] bipolar depression (BD), [ 7028797 ] panic disorder (PD), [ 3542985 ] social anxiety disorder (SAD), [ 12900950 ] bulimia, [ 3282482 ] and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [ 3048121 ] [ Pharmacology ] [ Pharmacodynamics ] Phenelzine is a non-selective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It inhibits both of the respective isoform s of MAO, MAO-A and MAO-B, and does so almost equally, with slight preference for the former. By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine prevents the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitter s serotonin, melatonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, as well as the trace amine neuromodulator s such as phenethylamine, tyramine, octopamine, and tryptamine. This leads to an increase in the extracellular concentration s of these neurochemical s and therefore an alteration in neurochemistry and subsequently neurotransmission. It is this action that is thought to be the primary mediator in phenelzine&apos;s therapeutic benefit s. Phenelzine and its metabolites also inhibit at least two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are alanine transaminase (ALA-T), [ 11775064 ] and γ-Aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), [ 7931216 ] the latter of which is not caused by phenelzine itself, but by a phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, phenelzine causes an increase in the alanine and GABA levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety and stress, as well as keeping depression at bay. It is thought that phenelzine&apos;s action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have typically been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including phenelzine) which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of hepatitis and liver failure. Phenelzine has also been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA). [ Dyck LE, Durden DA, Boulton AA Formation of beta-phenylethylamine from the antidepressant, beta-phenylethylhydrazine Biochemical Pharmacology 34 11 1925–9 1985 June 4004908 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90310-7 http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-2952%2885%2990310-7 ] PEA acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine, and produces effects very similar to those of amphetamine, though with markedly different pharmacokinetics such as a far shorter duration of action. Phenelzine&apos;s enhancement of PEA levels may contribute further to its overall antidepressant effects to some degree. In addition, phenethylamine is a substrate for MAO-B, and treatment with MAOIs that inhibit MAO-B such as phenelzine have been shown to consistently and significantly elevate its concentrations. Like many other antidepressants, phenelzine usually requires several weeks of treatment to achieve full therapeutic effects. The reason for this delay has not fully been elucidated, but it is believed to be due to many factors, including achieving steady-state levels of MAO inhibition and the resulting adaptations in mean neurotransmitter levels, the possibility of necessary desensitization of autoreceptor s which normally inhibit the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and also the upregulation of enzymes such as serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Typically, a therapeutic response to MAOIs is believed to be associated with an inhibition of at least 80-85% of monoamine oxidase activity. [ 7231652 ] [ Pharmacokinetics ] Phenelzine 15 mg tablets. Phenelzine is administered orally in the form of phenelzine sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes and half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, phenelzine irreversibly disables MAO, and as a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon phenelzine treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not actually wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2–3 weeks. Phenelzine is metabolized primarily in the liver and its metabolite s are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of phenelzine in the urine over the course of 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N 2 -acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. Phenelzine may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of phenelzine, as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine. [ Chemistry ] Phenelzine is made relatively easily through the reaction of 2-phenylethylbromide with hydrazine. { J.H. Biel, } [ 3,000,903 ] { (1961). } { J.H. Biel, A.E. Drukker, et al.. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 81, 2805 (1959). } { T.S. Gardner, E. Wenis, } [ 2,908,688 ] { (1959). } [ Adverse effects ] Common side effects of phenelzine may include dizziness, blurry vision, dry mouth, headache, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, insomnia, anorexia, weight gain or loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary retention, mydriasis, muscle tremor s, hyperthermia, sweating, hypertension or hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, paresthesia, hepatitis, and sexual dysfunction (consisting of loss of libido and anorgasmia ). Rare side effects usually only seen in susceptible individuals may include hypomania or mania, psychosis, and acute liver failure, the latter of which is usually only seen in people with pre-existing liver damage, old age, alcohol consumption, or viral infection. [ 8607601 ] [ Interactions ] [ Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Dangers ] [ Foods containing tyramine ] The MAOIs are infamous for their problematic food restrictions and drug interactions. Hypertensive crisis may result from the overconsumption of tyramine -containing foods. As a result, patients on phenelzine and other MAOIs must avoid excess quantities of certain foods that contain tyramine such as aged cheese s and cured meat s, among others. Serotonin syndrome may result from an interaction with certain drugs which increase serotonin activity such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and pethidine (known as meperidine in the US). Several deaths have been reported due to drug interaction-related serotonin syndrome such as the case of Libby Zion. As is the case with other MAOIs there is a concern regarding Phenelzine and the use of both Local and General anesthetic s. Anyone taking Phenelzine should inform their Psychiatrist before proceeding with dental surgery, and surgery in any other contexts. See the MAOI page for further information on this particular concern. Phenelzine has also been linked to vitamin B 6 deficiency. [ 7803366 ] It (or possibly its metabolites such as phenylethylidenehydrazine ) reacts with vitamin B 6 via an unknown enzyme to form a biologically inert metabolite. Transaminases such as GABA transaminase have been shown to be dependent upon vitamin B6 { http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1ohw } and may be involved in this process, since the phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) is a GABA transaminase inhibitor. [ 15207360 ] Both phenelzine and vitamin B 6 are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. For this reason, it may be recommended to supplement with vitamin B 6 while taking phenelzine.
