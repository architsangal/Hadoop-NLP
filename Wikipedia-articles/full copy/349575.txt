Generally, in modern language, wands are ceremonial and/or have associations with magic but there have been other uses, all stemming from the original meaning as a synonym of rod and virge, both of which had a similar development. [ Symbolism ] In ecclesiastical and formal government ceremonial, special officials may carry a wand of office or staff of office representing their power. Compare in this context the function of the ceremonial mace, the sceptre, and the staff of office. Its age may be even greater, as Stone Age cave paintings show figures holding sticks, which may be symbolic representations of their power. { David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter, p 195, ISBN 0-9708442-0-4 } [ Mystical, occult, and religious usage ] { Brooklyn Museum. } In Pharaonic Egypt, toilette articles, weapons against possible enemies, amulets against serpents, were also left in the tomb, together with magic texts and a magic wand which enabled the ba (soul) to use them.

In Zoroastrianism, there is a similar ritual implement called a barsom. In Wicca and Ceremonial magic, practitioners use several magical tools including wands for the channeling of energy —they serve a similar purpose to the athame although the two have their distinct uses. While an athame is generally used to command, a wand is seen as more gentle and is used to invite or encourage. Though traditionally made of wood, they can also consist of metal or crystal. Practitioners usually prune a branch from an Oak, Hazel, or other tree, or may even buy wood from a hardware store, and then carve it and add decorations to personalize it; however, one can also purchase ready-made wands. In Wicca the wand usually represents the element air, or sometimes fire, although contemporary wand makers also create wands for the elements of earth and water as well. The wand is most often used by modern Pagans, witches, Shamans and others in rituals, healing and spell casting. There is some scholarly opinion that the magic wand may have its roots as a symbol of the phallus. It may also have originated as the drumming stick of a shaman, especially in Central Asia and Siberia, as when using it to bang on his drum or point, to perform religious, healing, and magical ceremonies. { Ivar Lissner, &apos;&apos;Man, God and Magic&apos;&apos;, New York, Putnam, 1961 } [ Tarot cards ] &quot; Wands &quot; is also another name for the suit of Batons or Rods, a suit of the minor arcana of the Tarot. It is normally associated with the element of fire, again as a symbol of the phallus. [ Other uses ] In music, the term sometimes applies to the modern model of conductor &apos;s baton (the earlier staff and baton cantoral being heavier and thus unfit for precise gestures). In literary language, &quot; wand &quot; can be a synonym for rod as an implement for corporal punishment, in the generic sense: either a multiple rod or a single branch (switch or cane), but not a specific physical type.

Magic wands commonly feature in works of fantasy fiction as spell -casting tool s. Few other common denominators exist, so the capabilities of wands vary wildly. Note that wands fill basically the same role as wizards&apos; staffs, though staffs generally convey a more &apos;serious&apos; image; a fairy godmother would often use a wand, possibly with a star or some form of decoration on the end, while Gandalf would most likely not (however, in The Hobbit, he is said to use a wand, referring to his staff, to fight the goblins of the Misty Mountains and their Wargs). Gandalf&apos;s name is Northern Mannish (one of Tolkien &apos;s invented languages, similar to North Germanic languages) for &quot; Elf of the Wand &quot;, a reference to the staff he carries.
