It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm. [ http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/cropglossary.html Ag 101: Crop Glossary U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last updated: September 10, 2009 April 4, 2012 ] The term cash crop is applied exclusively to the agricultural production of plant s; animal agriculture is not a part of the terminology. The term is used to differentiate marketed crops from subsistence crops, which are those fed to the producer&apos;s own livestock or grown as food for the producer&apos;s family. In earlier times cash crops were usually only a small (but vital) part of a farm&apos;s total yield, while today, especially in the developed countries, almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue. In least developed countries, cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value. [ April 2012 ] Prices for major cash crops are set in commodity market s with global scope, with some local variation (termed as &quot; basis &quot; ) based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance. A consequence of this is that a nation, region, or individual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a bumper crop elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets. This system has been criticized by traditional farmers. Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commmodity futures price variations.

Many developing countries take the position that the current international trade system is unfair because it has caused tariff s to be lowered in industrial goods while allowing for low tariffs and agricultural subsidies for agricultural goods. [ April 2012 ] This makes it difficult for a developing nation to export its goods overseas, and forces developing nations to compete with imported goods which are exported from developed nations at artificially low prices. The practice of exporting at artificially low prices is known as dumping, [ Van den Bossche Peter 2005 The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization 42 Cambridge University Press Cambridge, UK 978-0-511-12392-4 Dumping, i.e. bringing a product onto the market of another country at a price less than the normal value of that product is condemned but not prohibited in WTO law. ] and is illegal in most nations. Controversy over this issue led to the collapse of the Canc√∫n trade talks in 2003, when the Group of 22 refused to consider agenda items proposed by the European Union unless the issue of agricultural subsidies was addressed. [ Per climate zones ] [ Arctic ] The Arctic climate is generally not conducive for the cultivation of cash crops. However, one potential cash crop for the Arctic is Rhodiola rosea, a hardy plant used as a medicinal herb that grows in the Arctic.

[ Temperate ] Cash crops grown in regions with a temperate climate include many cereals ( wheat, rye, corn, barley, oat s ), oil-yielding crops (e.g. oilseed rape ), vegetables (e.g. potato es ), tree fruit or top fruit (e.g. apple s, cherries ) and soft fruit (e.g. strawberries, raspberries ). { tea plantation in the } { Cameron Highlands in } { Malaysia } [ Subtropical ] In regions with a subtropical climate, grain crops (e.g. rice, millet ), oil-yielding crops (e.g. soybean s ) and some vegetable s and herb s are the predominant cash crops. [ Tropical ] In regions with a tropical climate, coffee, cocoa, sugar cane, banana s, oranges, cotton and jute (a soft, shiny vegetable fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads), are common cash crops. The oil palm is a tropical palm tree, and the fruit from it is used to make palm oil. [ Reeves James B. Weihrauch John L.

These farms, typically operated by large corporations, cover tens of square kilometres and employ large numbers of laborers.

[ April 2012 ] These countries protect their own agricultural sectors with high import tariff s and offer subsidies to their farmers, which some have contended as leading to the overproduction of commodities such as cotton, grain and milk. [ April 2012 ] The result of this is that the global price of such products is continually reduced until Africans are unable to compete in world markets, except in cash crops that do not grow easily in temperate climates.
