Appearing as a serial in the manga magazine Hana to Yume from 1994 to 2000, the chapters were collected and published in twenty tankōbon volumes by Hakusensha from February 1995 to February 2001. It focuses on Setsuna Mudo, a teenager who learns that he is the reincarnation of an angel. After the death of his sister, he travels through Hell and Heaven to reunite with her. The manga was adapted into a three-episode original video animation (OVA) by Bandai Visual and Hal Film Maker. Originally licensed by Central Park Media, the OVA is currently licensed by Media Blasters. A series of drama CD s based on the other story arcs was also released. Angel Sanctuary is licensed by Viz Media for an English-language release in North America. Viz published it from March 2004 to June 2007. [ Plot ] [ List of Angel Sanctuary characters ] Beginning in late twentieth-century Japan, Angel Sanctuary focuses on Setsuna Mudo, a 16-year-old troubled high-school student who is in love with his 15-year-old sister Sara. While struggling with his incestuous feelings for his sister, he learns that he is the reincarnation of Organic Angel Alexiel, who led a rebellion against her fellow angels after witnessing their slaughter of the Evils, a group of demons, after God&apos;s disappearance. At the conclusion of the revolt, she sealed away her younger twin brother, Inorganic Angel Rosiel, within the Earth, emotionally unable to fulfill his request to be killed before he became insane and destructive. Captured and branded a fallen angel, Alexiel is punished by having her body frozen and her soul endlessly reincarnated as a human whose life is full of misery. While Rosiel is freed by his subordinate Katan, Setsuna finds his life and Sara&apos;s endangered by various attempts to awaken Alexiel&apos;s dormant soul within him. Realizing they cannot bear to be separated, Setsuna and Sara run away together and consummate their love, in hope of starting a new life together. Sara eventually dies protecting Setsuna from one of Rosiel&apos;s subordinates. Devastated, Setsuna awakens Alexiel&apos;s soul, causing widespread damage. Adam Kadamon, the angel closest to God, intervenes by turning back time to just after Alexiel&apos;s awakening and freezing time on Earth; she then tasks him with freeing her from her imprisonment. To search for Sara&apos;s soul, sent to Hell for incest, Setsuna&apos;s body enters a near-death state, and his soul searches for hers, eventually learning that it has been taken to Heaven. Sara, meanwhile, awakens in the body of Jibriel, the archangel of water held captive; revealed to be her reincarnation, Sara is eventually returned to her original body, but finds herself impregnated by the angel Sandolphon, whose soul resides in his brother&apos;s body and hopes that she will bear him a body. After Rosiel absorbs him to gain his power, an act which speeds up his physical and mental decay, Sandolphon&apos;s remnants possess her, causing her to see Setsuna as a monster. Assisted by Lucifer, ruler of the demons who loves Alexiel, Rosiel unseals the Tower of Etenamenki, where God rests, with Alexiel&apos;s body. Intent on restoring the Earth, Setsuna follows him, with Kurai and the archangels of fire and earth; along the way, he aids an injured Katan, who hopes to save Rosiel before he loses his free will to do so. At the tower, Rosiel kills Katan, only to realize that he had killed the one he loved and tried to protect from himself; he then goes into a state of destructive despair. Awakening in her own body with Setsuna&apos;s help, Alexiel reveals to him that she had always loved him: because he had been born the opposite of his healthy sister, she bargained with God to save his life in exchange for her imprisonment, from which she later escaped with Lucifer, and an agreement to never show him any compassion. She then kills him, and absorbs him into her womb so that they will never be apart again. Before dying, Rosiel passes along his power to Setsuna. Setsuna and his group find Adam Kadamon&apos;s head, used to nourish the unborn angels, and learn that she attempted to prevent God&apos;s plan of destroying humanity by hiding him and the tower from the angels and freezing time in hopes that Alexiel&apos;s reincarnation could save them. Because God draws power through Adam Kadamon, the archangels and Kurai seal her up, while Setsuna confronts God and encounters Sara and Lucifer there. Sara overcomes her possession to cast out Sandolphon, and Setsuna defeats God with Lucifer&apos;s help. Time returns to normal on Earth, where Setsuna and Sara joyfully reunite at last. [ Development ] According to manga artist Kaori Yuki, the concept for Angel Sanctuary has been with her &quot; for the longest time. &quot; [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 1 Viz Media San Francisco 2004 978-1-59116-245-2 55628452 ] [ p.119 ] As a middle-school student in her second year, she found the story of fallen angel s, particularly Lucifer, fascinating; in Angel Sanctuary, she offered her own interpretation of fictional angels, which differed from her thoughts on actual angels. [ p.29 ] In Angel Sanctuary, Yuki drew on a variety of material, [ p.189 ] and occasionally included quotes from the Bible in it. [ Manga:The Complete Guide Jason Thompson (writer) Thompson Jason 2007 Del Ray Books New York 0-345-48590-4 ] [ p.12 ] She decided to set Angel Sanctuary in Japan in &quot; near future, &quot; partially because the setting would be largely unchanged and partially because she had a wish to draw modern clothing styles and sailor uniforms. [ p.57 ] She considered &quot; forbidden love &quot; to be manga&apos;s theme. [ p.57 ] She used assistants to help her; [ Angel Sanctuary 20 73 2007 Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki San Francisco Viz Media 1-4215-0978-4 1421509784 73 ] for example, one was in charge of drawing Michael &apos;s facial tattoo. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 8 Viz Media San Francisco 2005 1-59116-799-X 60746505 ] [ p.41 ] Her editor wrote the captions for the chapters. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 6 41 Viz Media San Francisco ] Because she had been already working on a serial, the gothic mystery manga Earl Cain, others opposed her wish to begin another. [ p.204 ] Initially, only ten chapters of Angel Sanctuary were scheduled, which led her to worry about being able to properly end the story; she was eventually allowed to continue the series. [ p.204 ] She worked on both serials simultaneously, [ p.204 ] and later put Earl Cain on hiatus, which prompted some fans to send her letters asking her to resume the serial instead. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Afterword Angel Sanctuary 2 185 Viz Media San Francisco 2004 978-1-59116-312-1 55798579 ] During the serialization of Angel Sanctuary, she mistakingly titled the Gehenna story arc as the Yetzirah arc, and was unable to correct it as several chapters had already appeared under the title; she corrected it for the tankōban release. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 7 Afterword 39 Viz Media San Francisco 2005 1-59116-745-0 59111165 ] As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 14 13 Viz Media San Francisco 2006 ] For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor of a happy one, because she thought that it would be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes. [ p.215 ] She wrote in her final afterword that Setsuna and Sara have reached emotional maturity after their adventures and will live happily together. [ p.215 ] [ Characters ] Yuki considered Setsuna an easily understood protagonist, in contrast to her previous one, Cain. [ p.157 ] According to her, the meaning of Setsuna&apos;s family name, Mudo— &quot; injustice &quot; and &quot; to stray from the path of man &quot; —was a perfect fit for his character. [ p.157 ] She described Sara as a heroine, and considered both protagonists &quot; easy to draw &quot;. [ p.157 ] She foreshadow ed Kato&apos;s greater involvement in the story by drawing close-up s of him early on. [ p.157 ] [ Cultural references and influences ] The series made references to Greek mythology. When Setsuna descends into Hell to search for Sara&apos;s soul, he is compared to Orpheus by his friend Kira, [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 4 Viz Media San Francisco 2004 1-59116-495-8 56954710 ] [ p.76 ] and the series describes Orpheus&apos; descent to the underworld to bring back Eurydice, his deceased wife, a few pages later. [ p.82 ] Additionally, the transgender demon Arachne takes his name from a female weaver whom the goddess Minerva turned into a spider. [ p.155 ] Other references include Pandora&apos;s box, [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 16 70 Viz Media San Francisco 2006 1-4215-0522-3 73352736 ] and the eternal torment of Prometheus. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 13 Viz Media San Francisco 2006 1-4215-0389-1 65471520 ] [ p.66 ] References to Western literature also appear in the series. Sara reads the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot; Rapunzel &quot; while imprisoned. [ p.92–3 ] Yuki also incorporated references to music. The character Kira&apos;s name is a reference to Japanese music group Zabadak &apos;s Tomohiko Kira, while the minor character Kirie takes her name from a Mister Mister song. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 3 179 Viz Media San Francisco 2004 ] Moonlil, another minor character, was based on idol singer Hirosue. [ Yuki, Kaori Kaori Yuki Angel Sanctuary 11 175 Viz Media San Francisco ] Carlsen Verlag, Yuki&apos;s German publisher, wrote that the Goth subculture in Tokyo, Japan, and rock bands of androgynous musicians influenced the clothing of the angels and demons in the series.
