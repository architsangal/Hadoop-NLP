In some cases, organizations under study have partially funded research into themselves. Not all profession al researchers view LGATs favorably. Researchers such as psychologist Philip Cushman, { Cushman, &quot; Iron Fists/Velvet Gloves: A Study of A Mass Marathon Psychology Training &quot;, Psychotherapy vol 26, Spring 1989. } for example, found that the program he studied &quot; consists of a pre-meditated attack on the self &quot;. A 1983 study on Lifespring { Haaken, J. and Adams, R., &quot; Pathology as &apos;Personal Growth&apos;: A Participant-Observation Study of Lifespring Training &quot;, Psychiatry, vol 46, August 1983. } found that &quot; although participants often experience a heightened sense of well-being as a consequence of the training, the phenomenon is essentially pathological &quot;, meaning that, in the program studied, &quot; the training systematically undermines ego functioning and promotes regression to the extent that reality testing is significantly impaired &quot;. Lieberman&apos;s 1987 study, { Lieberman, &quot; Effects of Large Group Awareness Training on Participants&apos; Psychiatric Status &quot;, American Journal of Psychiatry v 144 p 460-464, April 1987. } funded partially by Lifespring, noted that 5 out of a sample of 289 participants experienced &quot; stress reactions &quot; including one &quot; transitory psychotic episode &quot;. He commented: &quot; Whether [these five] would have experienced such stress under other conditions cannot be answered. The clinical evidence, however, is that the reactions were directly attributable to the large group awareness training. &quot; In Coon&apos;s psychology textbook (Introduction to Psychology) the author references many other studies, which postulate that many of the &quot; claimed benefits &quot; of Large Group Awareness Training actually take the form of &quot; a kind of therapy placebo effect &quot;.
