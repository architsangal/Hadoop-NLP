From 1640 to 1864 Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent city until 1937. In 2006 the population was 243,972. [ History ] Founded in 1535 as a village of fishermen, in 1664 Altona received city rights from Danish King Frederik III. Until 1864, Altona was one of the Danish monarchy&apos;s most important harbour towns. The railroad from Altona to Kiel, the Christian VIII Baltic Sea Rail Line (Christian VIII Østersø Jernbane), was opened in 1844. Because of the severe restrictions on the number of Jew s allowed to live in Hamburg (with the exception of the period of 1811–15,) until 1864, [ September 2008 ] a major Jewish community developed in Altona. [ Lowenthal Marvin The Memoirs of Glückel of Hameln 1977 Shocken Books New York 978-0-8052-0572-5 5–10 ] Members did business both in Hamburg and in Altona itself. All that remains after the Nazi Holocaust during World War II is the Jewish cemetery, but in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the community was a major center of Jewish life and scholarship. The Danes had lower taxes and placed fewer civil impositions on their Jewish community than did the government of Hamburg. The wars between Denmark and the Kingdom of Prussia, such as the First Schleswig War (1848–1851) and the Second War of Schleswig (February 1864 – October 1864) followed by the Gastein Convention (1864), led to Denmark&apos;s cession of the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg to Prussian and Austrian administration, respectively. In 1867 Altona became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1871 Altona and the nearby city Hamburg were hit by cholera, with a minimum of 16 casualties.

Inflation in Germany was a major problem. In 1923 Max Brauer, the mayor of Altona, directed that city personnel be paid in part with gas meter tokens, as these coins did not lose value from inflation. [ Verg Erich Verg Martin Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt 2007 158 Hamburg Ellert &amp; Richter 4th 978-3-8319-0137-1 ] The most notable event at this time is the Altona Bloody Sunday (German: Altonaer Blutsonntag) on July 17, 1932 when several persons were shot by the police force during a demonstration of Nazi groups. After police raids and a special court, on August 1, 1933 Bruno Tesch and others were found guilty and executed by beheading with a hand-held axe. [ Back to the Axe! 1933-08-14 The Time Magazine http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C745905-2%2C00.html 2008-08-14 ] { Stolpersteine in Hamburg |url=http://87.106.6.17/stolpersteine-hamburg.de/en.php? &amp; LANGUAGE=EN &amp; MAIN_ID=7 &amp; BIO_ID=234| } In the 1990s, the Federal Republic of Germany reversed the convictions of Tesch and the other men who were executed, clearing their names. The Greater Hamburg Act removed Altona from the Free State of Prussia in 1937 and merged it (and several surrounding cities) with the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg in 1938.
