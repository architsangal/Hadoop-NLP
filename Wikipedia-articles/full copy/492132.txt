The Waldorf-Astoria was the first hotel to offer room service, making a huge impact for the future of the hotel industry. The hotel is now branded as the Waldorf=Astoria, with a double hyphen, but originally a single hyphen was employed between &quot; Waldorf &quot; and &quot; Astoria, &quot; as recalled by a popular expression and song, &quot; Meet Me at the Hyphen. &quot; The equal sign was chosen to signify the equality between the Waldorf and Astor families. It also visually represents &quot; Peacock Alley, &quot; the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today. The modern hotel has three American and classic European restaurants, and a beauty parlor located off the main lobby. Several boutiques surround the lobby. A &quot; hotel within a hotel &quot; in its upper section is known as The Waldorf Towers.The hotel has its own railway platform as part of Grand Central Terminal, used by Franklin D.

[ History ] { Joseph Pennell, ca. 1904-1908. } The hotel&apos;s name with the double hyphen on the awning over the Park Avenue entrance An Astor family feud contributed to the events which led to the construction of the original Waldorf-Astoria on Fifth Avenue. It started as two hotels: one owned by William Waldorf Astor, whose 13-story Waldorf Hotel was opened in 1893 and the other owned by his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, called the Astoria Hotel and opened four years later in 1897, four stories higher. William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt, Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, built the original Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father&apos;s mansion and today&apos;s Empire State Building. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt; he and his wife Louise had become known as the owners and operators of the Bellevue, an elite boutique hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Broad Street, subsequently expanded and renamed the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue (and, later, the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel) even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed. Engraved 1916 letterhead of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia including vignettes of that hotel as well as those of both the Waldorf and Astoria Hotels in New York all of which were then operating under the management of George Boldt. William Astor&apos;s construction of a hotel next to his aunt&apos;s house worsened his feud with her, but, with Boldt&apos;s help, John Astor persuaded his mother to move uptown. John Astor then built the Astoria Hotel and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by Peacock Alley. The combined Waldorf=Astoria became the largest hotel in the world at the time, while maintaining the original Waldorf&apos;s high standards.

The Waldorf-Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. Founding proprietor, George C. Boldt, became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, &quot; Oscar of the Waldorf. &quot; Boldt built one of America&apos;s most ambitious houses, Boldt Castle, on one of the Thousand Islands. George Boldt&apos;s wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events.

Boomer, the manager of the old Waldorf, a cast of furnishers and decorators with good reputations was assembled, to give it a grand yet domestic atmosphere. Lucius M. Boomer had retired to Florida after the old Waldorf-Astoria was demolished, but he retained exclusive rights to use the name &quot; Waldorf-Astoria &quot;, which he transferred to the new hotel. Boomer died in an airplane crash during 1947 and Conrad Hilton bought the Waldorf-Astoria in 1949.
