Congestion in Kharkov. { Himalayas ( } { Garhwal hills, India) } { Bangkok is notorious for its traffic congestion. } { Jakarta, } { Indonesia } Traffic congestion is a condition on road networks that occurs as use increases, and is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. The most common example is the physical use of roads by vehicles. When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream, this results in some congestion. As demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the road), extreme traffic congestion sets in. When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is colloquially known as a traffic jam or traffic snarl-up. [ Causes ] { Taipei consisting primarily of } { motorcycles. } Congestion caused by a road accident, Algarve, Portugal. { Hurricane Rita. Traffic in all lanes of the highway is traveling in the same direction. } { Bayda, } { Libya in 2010. } Traffic congestion occurs when a volume of traffic or modal split generates demand for space greater than the available road capacity; this point is commonly termed saturation. There are a number of specific circumstances which cause or aggravate congestion; most of them reduce the capacity of a road at a given point or over a certain length, or increase the number of vehicles required for a given volume of people or goods. About half of U.S. traffic congestion is recurring, and is attributed to sheer weight of traffic; most of the rest is attributed to traffic incidents, road work and weather events. [ Congestion: A National Issue 2008-08-29 2008-09-25 ] Traffic research still cannot fully predict under which conditions a &quot; traffic jam &quot; (as opposed to heavy, but smoothly flowing traffic) may suddenly occur. It has been found that individual incidents (such as accidents or even a single car braking heavily in a previously smooth flow) may cause ripple effects (a cascading failure ) which then spread out and create a sustained traffic jam when, otherwise, normal flow might have continued for some time longer. [ http://www.amasci.com/amateur/traffic/traffic1.html Science Hobbyist: Traffic Waves ] [ Mathematical theories ] Some traffic engineers have attempted to apply the rules of fluid dynamics to traffic flow, likening it to the flow of a fluid in a pipe. Congestion simulations and real-time observations have shown that in heavy but free flowing traffic, jams can arise spontaneously, triggered by minor events ( &quot; butterfly effect s &quot; ), such as an abrupt steering maneuver by a single motorist. Traffic scientists liken such a situation to the sudden freezing of supercooled fluid. { Critical Mass - } { Ball, Philip, ISBN 0-09-945786-5 } However, unlike a fluid, traffic flow is often affected by signals or other events at junctions that periodically affect the smooth flow of traffic. Alternative mathematical theories exist, such as Boris Kerner &apos;s three-phase traffic theory (see also spatiotemporal reconstruction of traffic congestion ). Because of the poor correlation of theoretical models to actual observed traffic flows, transportation planners and highway engineers attempt to forecast traffic flow using empirical models. Their working traffic models typically use a combination of macro-, micro- and mesoscopic features, and may add matrix entropy effects, by &quot; platooning &quot; groups of vehicles and by randomising the flow patterns within individual segments of the network. These models are then typically calibrated by measuring actual traffic flows on the links in the network, and the baseline flows are adjusted accordingly. A team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes the formation of &quot; phantom jams, &quot; in which small disturbances (a driver hitting the brake too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam. Key to the study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call &quot; jamitons, &quot; are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT&apos;s Department of Mathematics. That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s. { Mathematicians Take Aim At &apos;Phantom&apos; Traffic Jams } [ Economic theories ] { economic surge has resulted in a massive increase in the number of private vehicles on its roads, overwhelming the transport infrastructure. Shown here is a traffic jam in } { Delhi. } As in India, China&apos;s economic surge has resulted in a massive increase in the number of private vehicles on its roads overwhelming the transport infrastructure. Shown here is a traffic jam at 17:30, downtown Haikou City, Hainan Province. Congested roads can be seen as an example of the tragedy of the commons. Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by opportunity cost. Privatization of highways and road pricing have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives. Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a crash or roadworks, which may reduce the road&apos;s capacity below normal levels. Economist Anthony Downs argues that rush hour traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively standard work day. In a capitalist economy, goods can be allocated either by pricing (ability to pay) or by queueing (first-come first-serve); congestion is an example of the latter. Instead of the traditional solution of making the &quot; pipe &quot; large enough to accommodate the total demand for peak-hour vehicle travel (a supply-side solution), either by widening roadways or increasing &quot; flow pressure &quot; via automated highway system s, Downs advocates greater use of road pricing to reduce congestion (a demand-side solution, effectively rationing demand), in turn plowing the revenues generated therefrom into public transportation projects. A 2011 study in the The American Economic Review indicates that there may be a &quot; fundamental law of road congestion. &quot; The researchers, from the University of Toronto and the London School of Economics, analyzed data from the U.S. Highway Performance and Monitoring System for 1983, 1993 and 2003, as well as information on population, employment, geography, transit, and political factors. They determined that the number of vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) increases in direct proportion to the available lane-kilometers of roadways. The implication is that building new roads and widening existing ones only results in additional traffic that continues to rise until peak congestion returns to the previous level.

These levels are used by transportation engineer s as a shorthand and to describe traffic levels to the lay public. While this system generally uses delay as the basis for its measurements, the particular measurements and statistical methods vary depending on the facility being described. For instance, while the percent time spent following a slower-moving vehicle figures into the LOS for a rural two-lane road, the LOS at an urban intersection incorporates such measurements as the number of drivers forced to wait through more than one signal cycle. { Traffic Engineering, Third Edition. Roger P. Roess, Elana S. Prassas, and William R. McShane. ISBN 0-13-142471-8 } Traffic congestion occurs in time and space, i.e., it is a spatiotemporal process. Therefore, another classification schema of traffic congestion is associated with some common spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion found in measured traffic data. Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those features, which are qualitatively the same for different highway s in different countries measured during years of traffic observations. Common features of traffic congestion are independent on weather, road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc. Examples of common features of traffic congestion are the features [J] and [S] for, respectively, the wide moving jam and synchronized flow traffic phases found in Kerner’ three-phase traffic theory. The common features of traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time with the use of the ASDA and FOTO models. [ Negative impacts ] Traffic congestion detector in Germany. Traffic congestion has a number of negative effects: Wasting time of motorists and passengers ( &quot; opportunity cost &quot; ). As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health. Delays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses. Inability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel &quot; just in case &quot;, and less time on productive activities. Wasted fuel increasing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions owing to increased idling, acceleration and braking. Wear and tear on vehicles as a result of idling in traffic and frequent acceleration and braking, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements. Stressed and frustrated motorists, encouraging road rage and reduced health of motorists Emergencies: blocked traffic may interfere with the passage of emergency vehicles traveling to their destinations where they are urgently needed. Spillover effect from congested main arteries to secondary roads and side streets as alternative routes are attempted (&apos; rat running &apos;), which may affect neighborhood amenity and real estate prices. [ Countermeasures ] It has been suggested by some commentators [ March 2008 ] that the level of congestion that society tolerates is a rational (though not necessarily conscious) [ May 2010 ] choice between the costs of improving the transportation system (in infrastructure or management) and the benefits of quicker travel. Others [ March 2008 ] link it largely to subjective lifestyle choices, differentiating between car-owning and car-free households.

[ Supply and demand ] [ Transportation Demand Management ] { M25 motorway to increase the number of lanes. } Congestion can be reduced by either increasing road capacity (supply), or by reducing traffic (demand). Capacity can be increased in a number of ways, but needs to take account of latent demand otherwise it may be used more strongly than anticipated. Critics of the approach of adding capacity have compared it to &quot; fighting obesity by letting out your belt &quot; (inducing demand that did not exist before). { Dreaming of a Clean Car? &apos;&apos; - } { Kay, Jane Holtz, journalist and author } { 2005 Mayors Luncheon (from the NAIOP website, } { Tampa Bay, United States) } Reducing road capacity has in turn been attacked as removing free choice as well as increasing travel costs and times. Increased supply can include: Adding more capacity at bottlenecks (such as by adding more lanes at the expense of hard shoulder s or safety zones, or by removing local obstacles like bridge supports and widening tunnels) Adding more capacity over the whole of a route (generally by adding more lanes) Creating new routes Traffic management improvements (see separate section below) Reduction of demand can include: [ Hermann Knoflacher 2006 A new way to organize parking: the key to a successful sustainable transport system for the future Environment and Urbanization 18 2 387–400 International Institute for Environment and Development 10.1177/0956247806069621 ] [ Shoup Donald C.

A limited quota of car licences are issued each year and traded in a free market fashion. This guarantees that the number of cars does not exceed road capacity while avoiding the negative effects of shortages normally associated with quotas.

In effect, such cities are banning a different part of the automobile fleet from roads each day of the week. Mainly introduced to combat smog, these measures also reduce congestion. A weakness of this method is that richer drivers can purchase a second or third car to circumvent the ban. Permit s, where only certain types of vehicles (such as residents) are permitted to enter a certain area, and other types (such as through-traffic) are banned. For example, Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, has proposed to impose a complete ban on motor vehicles in the city&apos;s inner districts, with exemptions only for residents, businesses, and the disabled. { Policy approaches, which usually attempt to provide either strategic alternatives or which encourage greater usage of existing alternatives through promotion, subsidies or restrictions. } [ Hermann Simon Robert J Dolan Price Customization American Marketing Association Marketing Management 7 3 ] [ Heike Link PEP-A Yield-Management Scheme for Rail Passenger Fares in Germany Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review 38 2004 March 54 ] [ Andersen Bjørn 1993 January A survey of the Swiss public transport system and policy Transport Reviews 13 1 61–81 10.1080/01441649308716835 ] [ http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/2058/ The philosophy and practice of Taktfahrplan: a case-study of the East Coast Main Line 2008-04-27 Adrian May 2007-03-16 Working Paper Working Paper 579 Institute of Transport Studies, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK ] [ Ogilvie David Matt Egan, Val Hamilton, Mark Petticrew 2004-09-22 Promoting walking and cycling as an alternative to using cars: systematic review British Medical Journal 329 7469 763 BMJ Publishing Group 10.1136/bmj.38216.714560.55 15385407 520994 ] [ Rietveld Piet Vanessa Daniel 2004 August Determinants of bicycle use: do municipal policies matter?

There was, he said &quot; no attractive alternative &quot;. It would allegedly cut congestion by half by 2025, and bring benefits to the British economy totalling £28 bn a year.

It also estimated that the annual cost of congestion for each driver was approximately $1,000 in very large cities and $200 in small cities. Traffic congestion is increasing in major cities and delays are becoming more frequent in smaller cities and rural areas. By late 2010, the five cities in the United States with the worst rush hour traffic congestion were New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles.
