[ May 2010 ] [ March 2011 ] Ebionites, or Ebionaioi ( Greek : [ grc Ἐβιωναῖοι ]; derived from Hebrew אביונים ebyonim, ebionim, meaning &quot; the poor &quot; or &quot; poor ones &quot; ), is a patristic term referring to a Jewish Christian sect or sects that existed during the first centuries of the Christian Era. {. } They regarded Jesus as the Messiah {. } and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish religious law and rites. {. } The Ebionites used only one of the Jewish Gospels, revered James the Just and rejected Paul of Tarsus as an apostate from the Law. Their name suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty. Since historical records by the Ebionites are scarce, fragmentary and disputed, much of what is known or conjectured about the Ebionites derives from the Church Fathers, who wrote polemics against the Ebionites, whom they deemed heretical Judaizers. [ AFJ Klijn GJ Reinink Patristic Evidence for Jewish-Christian Sects Brill 1973 90‐04‐03763‐2 ] { Church Fathers on the Ebionites (Wikisource). } Consequently, very little about the Ebionite sect or sects is known with certainty, and most, if not all, statements about them are conjectural. Many scholars distinguish the Ebionites from other Jewish Christian groups, e.g., the Nazarenes; [ Tim Hegg The Virgin Birth — An Inquiry into the Biblical Doctrine TorahResource 2007 http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/VirginBirth.pdf 13 August 2007 PDF ] others consider them identical with the Nazarenes. [ Name ] The term Ebionites derives from the common adjective for &quot; poor &quot; in Hebrew (singular: אֶבְיוֹן ev·yōn, plural: אביונים ev·yōn·im), { Online } { Gesenius &apos; entry in Hebrew Lexicon, with link to 61 Hebrew Bible uses } { The word is still in use in that sense in contemporary Israeli Hebrew } which occurs fifteen times in the Psalms and was the self-given term of some pious Jewish circles (e.g. Psalm 69:33 &quot; For the LORD heareth the poor, &quot; 1 QpHab XII, 3.6.10, etc.). The term &quot; the poor &quot; was at first a common designation for all Christians - a reference to their material as well as their voluntary poverty. { Minucius Felix, Octavius, 36: &quot; That we are called the poor is not our disgrace, but our glory. &quot; } { The Greek equivalent ( } { Greek : } [ grc πτωχοί ] { ) ptōkhoi appears in the } { New Testament ( Romans 15, 26; Galatians 2,10 ), possibly as an honorary title of the } { Jerusalem church. } The graecized Hebrew term &quot; Ebionite &quot; (Ebionai) was first applied by Irenaeus in the 2nd century without making mention of Nazarenes (c.180 CE). { Antti Marjanen, Petri Luomanen &quot; A companion to second-century Christian &quot; heretics &quot; p250 &quot; It is interesting to note that the Ebionites first appear in the catalogues in the latter half of the second century. The earliest reference to the Ebionites was included in a catalogue used by Irenaeus in his Refutation and Subversion... &quot; } { Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible 2000 p364 &quot; EBIONITES Name for Jewish Christians first witnessed in Irenaeus (Adv. haer. 1.26.2; Gk. ebionaioi) ca. 180 ce &quot; } Origen says &quot; for Ebion signifies “poor” among the Jews, and those Jews who have received Jesus as Christ are called by the name of Ebionites. &quot; { Origen, Contra Celsum, II, 1. } { ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second | Christian Classics Ethereal Library } Tertullian was first to write against a non-existent heresiarch called Ebion and scholars believe he derived the name Ebion from a literal reading of Ebionaioi as meaning &quot; followers of Ebion &quot;, a derivation now considered mistaken. The term &quot; the poor &quot; (Greek ptokoi) was still used in its original, more general sense. { James Tabor, Nazarenes and Ebionites } { Eisenman (1997), p. 4, 45. } Modern Hebrew still uses the Biblical Hebrew term &quot; the needy &quot; both in histories of Christianity for &quot; Ebionites &quot; (אביונים) and for almsgiving to the needy at Purim. { The Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary 9780198601722. } [ History ] The earliest reference to a group that might fit the description of the later Ebionites appears in Justin Martyr &apos;s Dialogue with Trypho (c. 140). Justin distinguishes between Jewish Christians who observe the Law of Moses but do not require its observance upon others, and those who believe the Mosaic Law to be obligatory on all. { Justin Martyr, &apos;&apos;Dialogue with Trypho&apos;&apos;, 47. } Irenaeus (c. 180) was probably the first to use the term &quot; Ebionites &quot; to describe a heretical judaizing sect, which he regarded as stubbornly clinging to the Law. { Irenaeus of Lyon, } { Adversus Haereses I, 26; II,21. } Origen (c. 212) remarks that the name derives from the Hebrew word &quot; evyon, &quot; meaning &quot; poor. &quot; { Origen, &apos;&apos;De Principiis&apos;&apos;, IV, 22. } Epiphanius of Salamis in the 4th century gives the most complete but also questionable account in his heresiology called Panarion, denouncing eighty heretical sects, among them the Ebionites. { Epiphanius of Salamis, } { Panarion, 30. } [ Glenn Alan Koch A Critical Investigation of Epiphanius&apos; Knowledge of the Ebionites: A Translation and Critical Discussion of &apos;Panarion&apos; 30 University of Pennsylvania 1976 ] Epiphanius mostly gives general descriptions of their religious beliefs and includes quotations from their gospel s, which have not survived. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica (2011), the Ebionite movement may have arisen about the time of the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem (AD 70). { author not given, Encyclopædia Britannica article &apos;&apos;Ebionite&apos;&apos; } Paul talks of his collection for the &quot; poor among the saints &quot; in the Jerusalem church, but this is generally taken as meaning &quot; the poorer members of the church &quot; rather than a schismatic group. { Some scholars see the title present already in Paul&apos;s references to a collection for the &quot; poor &quot; in Jerusalem (Gal.1:10). But in Rom.15:26 Paul distinguishes this group from the other Jerusalem believers by speaking of &quot; the poor among the saints. &quot; In 2 Cor.9:12 Paul further confirms the economic, or literal, aspect by speaking of the collection as making up for &quot; the deficiencies of the saints &quot;. E. Stanley Jones, &apos; &quot; Ebionites &quot;, in Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, Amsterdam University Press, 2000 p.364. } The actual number of groups described as Ebionites is difficult to ascertain, as the contradictory patristic accounts in their attempt to distinguish various sects, sometimes confuse them with each other. Other groups mentioned are the Carpocratians, the Cerinthians, the Elcesaites, the 4th century Nazarenes, and the Sampsaeans, most of whom were Jewish Christian sects who held gnostic or other views rejected by the Ebionites. Epiphanius, however, mentions that a group of Ebionites came to embrace some of these views despite keeping their name. [ Henry Wace &amp; William Piercy A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography 1911 http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term%3DEbionism%20and%20Ebionites 1 August 2007 ] As the Ebionites are first mentioned as such in the 2nd century, their earlier history and any relation to the first Jerusalem church remains obscure and a matter of contention. There is no evidence linking the origin of the later sect of the Ebionites with the First Jewish-Roman War of 66–70 CE, or that prior to that they formed part of the Jerusalem church led by the Apostle Peter and later by Jesus&apos; brother James. Eusebius relates a tradition, probably based on Aristo of Pella, that the early Christians left Jerusalem just prior to the war and fled to Pella beyond the Jordan River, but does not connect this with Ebionites. { G. Uhlhorn, &quot; Ebionites &quot;, in: A Religious Encyclopaedia or Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology, 3rd ed. (edited by Philip Schaff), p. 684–685 (vol. 2). } { O. Cullmann, &quot; Ebioniten &quot;, in: Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, p. 7435 (vol. 2). } They were led by Simeon of Jerusalem (d. 107) and during the Second Jewish-Roman War, they were persecuted by the Jewish followers of Bar Kochba for refusing to recognize his messianic claims. { Decapolis showing the location of Pella. } According to Harnack the influence of Elchasaites places some Ebionites in the context of the gnostic movements widespread in Syria and the lands to the east. { Adolf von Harnack, The History of Dogma, &quot; Chapter VI. The Christianity of the Jewish Christians &quot;, 1907, ISBN 978-1-57910-067-4. } After the end of the First Jewish-Roman War, the importance of the Jerusalem church began to fade. Jewish Christianity became dispersed throughout the Jewish diaspora in the Levant, where it was slowly eclipsed by gentile Christianity, which then spread throughout the Roman Empire without competition from &quot; judaizing &quot; Christian groups. [ Brandon, S. G. F The fall of Jerusalem and the Christian church: A study of the effects of the Jewish overthrow of A. D. 70 on Christianity S.P. C.K. 1968 0-281-00450-1 ] Once the Jerusalem church, still headed by Jesus&apos; relatives, was eliminated during the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135, the Ebionites gradually lost influence and followers. According to Hyam Maccoby (1987) their decline was due to marginalization and &quot; persecution &quot; by both Jews and Christians. Following the defeat of the rebellion and the expulsion of all Jews from Judea, Jerusalem became the Gentile city of Aelia Capitolina. Many of the Jewish Christians residing at Pella renounced their Jewish practices at this time and joined to the mainstream Christian church. Those who remained at Pella and continued in obedience to the Law were deemed heretics. [ Edward Gibbon The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch. 15, p. 390–391. Random House, NY 2003 0-375-75811-9 ] [ Chapter 15 http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter15.html 2 August 2007 ] In 375, Epiphanius records the settlement of Ebionites on Cyprus, but by the mid-5th century, Theodoret of Cyrrhus reported that they were no longer present in the region. [ Last days of the Ebionite sect ] Map showing the region of Hejaz outlined in red Some scholars argue that the Ebionites survived much longer and identify them with a sect encountered by the historian Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad around the year 1000. [ Shlomo Pines The Jewish Christians Of The Early Centuries Of Christianity According To A New Source Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities II, No. 13 1966 102-255-998 ] Another possible reference to surviving Ebionite communities in northwestern Arabia, specifically the cities of Tayma and Tilmas, around the 11th century, appears in Sefer Ha&apos;masaot, the &quot; Book of the Travels &quot; of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, a rabbi from Spain. [ Marcus N. Adler The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Critical Text, Translation and Commentary, p. 70–72. Phillip Feldheim 1907 ] 12th century Muslim historian Muhammad al-Shahrastani mentions Jews living in nearby Medina and Hejaz who accepted Jesus as a prophetic figure and followed traditional Judaism, rejecting mainstream Christian views. [ Muhammad al-Shahrastani The Book of Religious and Philosophical Sects, William Cureton edition, page 167 Gorgias Press 2002 ] Some scholars argue that they contributed to the development of the Islamic view of Jesus due to exchanges of Ebionite remnants with the first Muslims. [ Views and practices ] [ Judaic and Gnostic Ebionitism ] Most patristic sources portray the Ebionites as traditional Jews, who zealously followed the Law of Moses, revered Jerusalem as the holiest city, and restricted table fellowship only to Gentiles who converted to Judaism. Yet some Church Fathers describe some Ebionites as departing from traditional Jewish principles of faith and practice. For example, Epiphanius of Salamis stated that the Ebionites engaged in excessive ritual bathing, { Epiphanius, Panarion, 19:28–30. } possessed an angelology which claimed that the Christ is a great archangel who was incarnated in Jesus and adopted as the son of God, { Epiphanius, Panarion, 30, 14, 5. } { Epiphanius, Panarion, 30, 16, 4-5. } opposed animal sacrifice, denying parts or most of the Law, { Epiphanius, Panarion, 30, 18, 7–9. } and practiced religious vegetarianism, { Epiphanius, Panarion, 30.22.4 } and celebrated a commemorative meal annually, [ 10.2307/624138 W.M. Ramsey The Tekmoreian Guest-Friends Journal of Hellenic Studies 32 151–170. 1912 624138 ] on or around Passover, with unleavened bread and water only, in contrast to the daily Christian Eucharist.

And a Sketch of the Eastern Church 1919 http://www.melkite.org/HolyCommunion.html 28 April 2007 ] { Irenaeus of Lyon, Against Heresies V, 1. } However, the reliability of Epiphanius&apos; account of the Ebionites is questioned by some scholars. [ Robert E. van Voorst Robert E. Van Voorst The Ascents of James: History and Theology of a Jewish-Christian Community Society of Biblical Literature 1989 1-55540-294-1 ] Shlomo Pines, for example, argues that the heterodox views and practices he ascribes to some Ebionites originated in Gnostic Christianity rather than Jewish Christianity, and are characteristics of the Elcesaite sect, which Epiphanius mistakenly attributed to the Ebionites. Another Church Father who described the Ebionites as departing from Christian Orthodoxy was Methodius of Olympus, who stated that the Ebionites believed that the prophets spoke only by their own power, and not by the power of the Holy Spirit. [ Thomas C. Oden Ancient Christian commentary on Scripture: New Testament http://books.google.com/?id%3DirWI6DUtPncC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA178 14 October 2010 2006 InterVarsity Press 978-0-8308-1497-8 178– ] { excerpt from St. Methodius of Olympus, Symposium on Virginity, 8.10., &quot; and with regard to the Spirit, such as the Ebionites, who contend that the prophets spoke only by their own power &quot; } While mainstream biblical scholars do suppose some Essene influence on the nascent Jewish-Christian Church in some organizational, administrative and cultic respects, some scholars go beyond that assumption. Among them, some [ September 2010 ] hold theories [ September 2010 ] which have been discredited and others which remain controversial. [ Géza Vermes Brother James&apos; Heirs? the community at Qumran and its relations to the first Christians (Times Literary Supplement) 1992 ] Regarding the Ebionites specifically, a number of scholars have different theories on how the Ebionites may have developed from an Essene Jewish messianic sect. Hans-Joachim Schoeps argues that the conversion of some Essenes to Jewish Christianity after the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE may be the source of some Ebionites adopting Essene views and practices; while some conclude that the Essenes did not become Jewish Christians but still had an influence on the Ebionites. [ Kriste Stendahl The Scrolls and the New Testament Herder &amp; Herder 1991 0-8245-1136-0 ] However, Epiphanius of Salamis, in his book Panarion, 30:17:5, said the following: &quot; But I already showed above that Ebion did not know these things, but later, his followers that associated with Elchasai had the circumcision, the Sabbath and the customs of Ebion, but the imagination of Elchasai &quot;. Doing so, Epiphanius made it clear that the original Ebionites were different from those heterodox Ebionites that he described. { Epiphanius of Salamis, Panarion, 30:17:5 } [ August 2010 ] [ Ebionite views on John the Baptist ] In the Gospel of the Ebionites, as quoted by Epiphanius, John the Baptist and Jesus are portrayed as vegetarian s. { J Verheyden, Epiphanius on the Ebionites, in The image of the Judaeo-Christians in ancient Jewish and Christian literature, eds Peter J.

On the other hand, an Ebionite story has Jesus eating bread with his brother Jacob ( &quot; James the Just &quot; ) after the resurrection, which indicates that the Ebionites, or at least the ones who accepted this version of the Gospel of the Hebrews, very much believed in a physical resurrection for Jesus. { Gospel of the Hebrews as quoted by Hieronymus (Jerome) in On Illustrious Men, 2. } The Ebionites are described as emphasizing the oneness of God and the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of both Mary and Joseph, who by virtue of his righteousness, was chosen by God to be the messianic &quot; prophet like Moses &quot; (foretold in Deuteronomy 18:14–22) when he was anointed with the Holy Spirit at his baptism.

Bromiley - 1982 article &quot; Ebionites &quot; citing E.H.3.27.3 &quot; There were others, however, besides them, that were of the same name, that avoided the strange and absurd beliefs of the former, and did not deny that the Lord was born of a virgin and of the Holy Spirit.

J. Reinink Patristic evidence for Jewish-Christian sects 1973 p42 &quot; Irenaeus wrote that these Ebionites used the Gospel of Matthew, which explains Theodoret&apos;s remark.

Those who deny the virgin birth use the Gospel of the Hebrews; those who accept it use the Gospel of Matthew. &quot; } Of the books of the New Testament, the Ebionites are said to have accepted only a Hebrew (or Aramaic) version of the Gospel of Matthew, referred to as the Gospel of the Hebrews, as additional scripture to the Hebrew Bible. This version of Matthew, Irenaeus reports, omitted the first two chapters (on the nativity of Jesus ), and started with the baptism of Jesus by John. The Ebionites believed that all Jews and Gentiles must observe the commandments in the Law of Moses, in order to become righteous and seek communion with God, { Hippolytus } but these commandments must be understood in the light of Jesus&apos; expounding of the Law, revealed during his sermon on the mount, and other evangelical counsels.

[ James and the Ebionites ] One of the popular primary connections of the Ebionites to James is that noted by William Whiston in his edition of Josephus (1794) where he notes regarding the murder of James the Just, &quot; we must remember what we learn from the Ebionite fragments of Hegesippus, that these Ebionites interpreted a prophecy of Isaiah as foretelling this very murder &quot; { Whiston, W. Antiquities 2008 edition p594 } That Hegesippus made this connection from Isaiah is undisputed, { James the Just and Christian origins p217 Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans - 1999 &quot; Isaiah 3:10 in its context expresses the link between the martyrdom of James and the fall of Jerusalem which the common source used by Hegesippus and the Second Apocalypse of James stressed &quot; } however Whiston&apos;s identification of Hegesippus as an Ebionite, while common in 18th and 19th century scholarship, is debatable. { Henry Clay Sheldon -History of Christian Doctrine 1895 &quot; But it is by no means clear that Hegesippus was an Ebionite. His description of James the Just scarcely goes further toward proving him an Ebionite than it does toward proving the same of Eusebius, who not only quotes his description... &quot; } The other popularly proposed connection is that the Ascents of James in the Pseudo-Clementine literature are related to the Ebionites. { Van Voorst } The Book of Acts begins by showing Peter as leader of the Jerusalem church - the only church in existence immediately after the ascension. Though several years later Paul lists James prior to &quot; Cephas &quot; (Peter) and John as those considered &quot; pillars &quot; (Greek styloi) of the Jerusalem Church. { Frank J. Matera Galatians 2007 p77 &quot; Here, Paul probably understands that James, Cephas, and John were considered to be pillars (styloi) of the Church. &quot; } Eusebius records that Clement of Alexandria wrote that Peter, James, and John chose James the Just as bishop of Jerusalem, but Eusebius also subjects James to the authority of all the apostles. { John Painter, Just James (2005), p274: &quot; Eusebius reported that Clement of Alexandria wrote that, after the ascension, Peter, James, and John chose James the Just as bishop of Jerusalem, although another quotation in Eusebius implies James&apos;s leadership from the time of the resurrection. Eusebius subjects James to the authority of all the apostles in a way that provides evidence of a struggle between the Great Church, represented here by the apostles and the independent authority of James &quot; } Peter baptised Cornelius the Centurion, introducing uncircumcised Gentiles into the church in Judea. { Jesus in context: Temple, purity, and restoration Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans - 1997 p12 &quot; Peter defends his baptisms in the house of Cornelius on the basis of his vision in the course of a dispute with... &quot; } { Cross, F. L., ed.

At the Council of Jerusalem (c 49), Paul argued to abrogate Mosaic observances { Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article Acts of the Apostles } for non-Jewish converts. When Paul recounted the events to the Galatians ( [ Galatians 2:9-10 ] ), he referred only to the remembrance of the poor rather than conveying the four points of the Council of Jerusalem ( [ Acts 15:19-21 ] ). James Dunn { James D. G. Dunn Beginning from Jerusalem 2009 p1083 &quot; This James is a much more conciliatory figure than he is usually thought to be. &quot; } notes the conciliatory role of James as depicted in Acts in the tension between Paul and those urging the Law of Moses upon Gentiles. According to Eusebius, after the death of James the Jerusalem church fled to Pella { Leon Morris The Gospel according to Matthew 1992 p604 &quot; but it is objected that Pella is not in fact in the mountains but at the foothills. There are serious doubts whether the Christians in fact did flee to Pella at that time (see Hendriksen, p. 858, for the difficulties in the way... &quot; citing Hendriksen, F. Exposition of the Gospel according to Matthew 1973 } to escape the siege of the future Emperor Titus, and then after the Bar Kokhba revolt the Jerusalem church was permitted to remain in the renamed Aelia Capitolina, but notably from this point onward all bishops of Jerusalem bear Greek rather than evidently Jewish names. { &quot; Jerusalem in Early Christian Thought &quot; p75 Explorations in a Christian theology of pilgrimage ed Craig G.

These scholars include Pierre-Antoine Bernheim, Robert Eisenman, Will Durant, Michael Goulder, Gerd Ludemann, John Painter, and James Tabor, { Eisenman (1997), e.g. &quot; As presented by Paul, James is the Leader of the early Church par excellence.

The following considerations tell in favor of the historical plausibility of this: 1. The name &apos;Ebionites&apos; might be the term this group used to denote themselves. 2. Hostility ot Paul in the Christian sphere before 70 is attested above all in groups which come from Jerusalem. 3. The same is true of observance of the law cumulating in circumcision. 4. The direction of prayer towards Jerusalem makes the derivation of the Ebionites from there probable. &quot; p.56 - &quot; therefore, it seems that we should conclude that Justin&apos;s Jewish Christians are a historical connecting link between the Jewish Christianity of Jerusalem before the year 70 and the Jewish Christian communities summed up in Irenaeus&apos; account of the heretics. &quot; } [ Michael Goulder St. Paul versus St. Peter: A Tale of Two Missions 107–113, 134 John Knox Press 1995 0-664-25561-2 ] { p.134 &quot; So the &apos;Ebionite&apos; Christology, which we found first described in Irenaeus about 180 is not the invention of the late second century.

Epiphanius relates that the Ebionites opposed the Apostle Paul, whom they saw as responsible that gentile Christians did not have to be circumcised, nor otherwise follow the Law of Moses, and named him an apostate. Epiphanius further relates that some Ebionites alleged that Paul was a Greek who converted to Judaism in order to marry the daughter of a high priest of Israel but apostatized when she rejected him. { &quot; [The Ebionites] declare that he was a Greek [...] He went up to Jerusalem, they say, and when he had spent some time there, he was seized with a passion to marry the daughter of the priest.

The &apos;&apos;Recognitions of Clement&apos;&apos; and the &apos;&apos;Clementine Homilies&apos;&apos;, two 3rd century Christian works, are regarded by general scholarly consensus as largely or entirely Jewish Christian in origin and reflect Jewish Christian beliefs. The exact relationship between the Ebionites and these writings is debated, but Epiphanius&apos;s description of some Ebionites in Panarion 30 bears a striking similarity to the ideas in the Recognitions and Homilies. Scholar Glenn Alan Koch speculates that Epiphanius likely relied upon a version of the Homilies as a source document. Some scholars also speculate that the core of the Gospel of Barnabas, beneath a polemical medieval Muslim overlay, may have been based upon an Ebionite or gnostic document. { John Toland, Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile and Mahometan Christianity, 1718. } The existence and origin of this source continues to be debated by scholars. [ Blackhirst, R. Barnabas and the Gospels: Was There an Early Gospel of Barnabas?, Journal of Higher Criticism, 7/1, p. 1–22 2000 http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/Blackhirst_Barnabas.html 11 March 2007 ] John Arendzen ( Catholic Encyclopedia article &quot; Ebionites &quot; 1909) classifies the Ebionite writings into four groups. [ Ebionites ] [ Gospel of the Ebionites ] Irenaeus stated that the Ebionites used Matthew&apos;s Gospel exclusively. { &quot; Those who are called Ebionites accept that God made the world. However, their opinions with respect to the Lord are quite similar to those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They use Matthew&apos;s gospel only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an apostate from the Law. &quot; - Irenaeus, Haer 1.26.2 } Eusebius of Caesarea later wrote that they used only the Gospel of the Hebrews. { Eusebius of Caesarea, &apos;&apos;Church History&apos;&apos;, IV, 21, 8. } From this the minority view of James R. Edwards (2009) and Bodley&apos;s Librarian Edward Nicholson (1879) claims that there was only one Hebrew gospel in circulation, Matthew&apos;s Gospel of the Hebrews. They also note that the title Gospel of the Ebionites, was never used by anyone in the early Church. { James R. Edwards, The Hebrew Gospel &amp; the Development of the Synoptic Tradition, 2009 Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co, 2009. pp 121 } { Nicholson The Gospel according to the Hebrews, 1879 reprinted print on demand BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009. pp 1-81 } { William Whiston &amp; H. Stebbing, The Life and Works of Flavius Josephus, reprinted Vol II, Kessinger Publishing, 2006. p 576 } Epiphanius contended that the gospel the Ebionites used, was written by Matthew and called the Gospel of the Hebrews. { They too accept the Matthew&apos;s gospel, and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the Gospel of the Hebrews, for in truth Matthew alone in the New Testament expounded and declared the Gospel in Hebrew using Hebrew script. - Epiphanius, Panarion 30.3.7 } Because Epiphanius said that it was &quot; not wholly complete, but falsified and mutilated... &quot;, { Epiphanius, Panarion 30.13.1 } writers such as Walter Richard Cassels (1877), and Pierson Parker (1940) consider it a different &quot; edition &quot; of Matthew&apos;s Hebrew Gospel. { Walter Richard Cassels, Supernatural Religion - An Inquiry Into the Reality of Divine Revelation, 1877 reprinted print on demand Read Books, 2010. Vol. 1, p 419- 422 } { Pierson Parker, A Proto-Lukan Basis for the Gospel According to the Hebrews, Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 59, No. 4, 1940. pp 471 } However, internal evidence from the quotations in Panarion 30.13.4 and 30.13.7 suggest that the text was a Gospel harmony originally composed in Greek. [ The Complete Gospels 436 Polebridge Press, Robert J. Miller ed. 1994 0-06-065587-9 ] Mainstream scholarly texts, such as the standard edition of the New Testament Apocrypha edited by Wilhelm Schneemelcher generally refer to the text Jerome cites as used by the Ebionites as the Gospel of the Ebionites, though this is not a term current in the Early Church. { Robert Walter Funk, The Gospel of Jesus: according to the Jesus Seminar, Publisher Polebridge Press, 1999. } { F.L. Cross and E.A. Livingston, The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, © 1989, Oxford University Press, p. 438 - 439. } [ Clementine literature ] The collection of New Testament apocrypha known as the Clementine literature included three works known in antiquity as the Circuits of Peter, the Acts of the Apostles and a work usually titled the Ascents of James. They are specifically referenced by Epiphanius in his polemic against the Ebionites. The first-named books are substantially contained in the Homilies of Clement under the title of Clement&apos;s Compendium of Peter&apos;s itinerary sermons, and also in the Recognitions attributed to Clement. They form an early Christian didactic fiction to express Jewish Christian views, i.e. the primacy of James the Just, their connection with the episcopal see of Rome, and their antagonism to Simon Magus, as well as gnostic doctrines. Scholar Robert E. Van Voorst opines of the Ascents of James (R 1.33–71), &quot; There is, in fact, no section of the Clementine literature about whose origin in Jewish Christianity one may be more certain &quot;. Despite this assertion, he expresses reservations that the material is genuinely Ebionite in origin. [ Symmachus ] Symmachus produced a translation of the Hebrew Bible in Koine Greek, which was used by Jerome and is still extant in fragments, and his lost Hypomnemata, written to counter the canonical Gospel of Matthew. Although lost, the Hypomnemata { Symmachus&apos; Hypomnemata is mentioned by } { Eusebius in his } { Historia Ecclesiae, VI, xvii: &quot; As to these translators it should be stated that Symmachus was an Ebionite. But the heresy of the Ebionites, as it is called, asserts that Christ was the son of Joseph and Mary, considering him a mere man, and insists strongly on keeping the law in a Jewish manner, as we have seen already in this history. Commentaries of Symmachus are still extant in which he appears to support this heresy by attacking the Gospel of Matthew. Origen states that he obtained these and other commentaries of Symmachus on the Scriptures from a certain Juliana, who, he says, received the books by inheritance from Symmachus himself. &quot;; } { Jerome, } { De Viris Illustribus &apos;&apos;, chapter 54, &apos;&apos;Church History&apos;&apos;, VI, 17. } { Jerome, } { De viris illustribus, 54. } is probably identical to De distinctione præceptorum mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, Bibl. Or., III, 1). The identity of Symmachus as an Ebionite has been questioned in recent scholarship. [ Oscar Skarsaune Jewish Believers in Jesus 448–450 Hendrickson Publishers 2007 978-1-56563-763-4 ] { Skarsaune argues that Eusebius may have only inferred that Symmachus was an Ebionite based on his commentaries on certain passages in the Hebrew Scriptures. E.g., Eusebius mentions Isa 7:14 where Symmachus reads &quot; young woman &quot; based on the Hebrew text rather than &quot; virgin &quot; as in the LXX, and he interprets this commentary as attacking the Gospel of Matthew.(Dem. ev. 7.1) and (Hist. eccl. 5.17) } [ Elkesaites ] Hippolytus of Rome (c.230) reports that a Jewish Christian, Alcibiades of Apamea, appeared in Rome teaching from a book which he claimed to be the revelation which a righteous man, Elkesai, had received from an angel. Though Hippolytus suspected that Alcibiades was himself the author. { Gerard P. Luttikhuizen The revelation of Elchasai 1985 p216 } Shortly afterwards Origen records a group, the Elkesaites, with the same beliefs. { Antti Marjanen, Petri Luomanen &apos;&apos;A companion to second-century Christian &quot; heretics &quot; p336 } Epiphanius claimed the Ebionites also used this book as a source for some of their beliefs and practices (Panarion 30.17). {, } { Philosophumena, IX, 14-17. Luttikhuizen 1985 &quot; Epiphanius deviates so strikingly from Hippolytus&apos; account of the heresy of Alcibiades that we cannot possibly assume that he is dependent on the Refutation. &quot; } { Epiphanius, Panarion, 19, 1; 53, 1. } Epiphanius explains the origin of the name Elkesai to be Aramaic El Ksai, meaning &quot; Hidden Power &quot; (Panarion 19.2.1). Scholar Petri Luomanen believes the book to have been written originally in Aramaic as a Jewish apocalypse, probably in Babylonia, in 116-117. { Petri Luomanen (2007) Jewish Christianity Reconsidered pp.96, 299, 331:note 7 } [ Religious and critical perspectives ] The mainstream Christian view of the Ebionites is partly based on interpretation of the polemical views of the Church Fathers who portrayed them as heretics for rejecting many of the central Christian views of Jesus, and allegedly having an improper fixation on the Law of Moses at the expense of the grace of God. [ Arendzen, J.P. Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume V.: Ebionites Robert Appleton Company 1904 ] In this view, the Ebionites may have been the descendants of a Jewish Christian sect within the early Jerusalem church which broke away from its mainstream theology. [ Jean Daniélou The theology of Jewish Christianity: The Development of Christian doctrine before the Council of Nicea H. Regnery Co 1964 ASIN B0007FOFQI ] [ Baur, Maccoby, Schonfield, Tabor and Eisenmann ] Hyam Maccoby (1987), Robert Eisenman, James Tabor, Hugh Schonfield (1961) and others argued that the Ebionites were more faithful to the authentic teachings of Jesus and constituted the mainstream of the Jerusalem church before being gradually marginalized by the followers of Paul of Tarsus.

This is true particularly where the Ebionites differed from normative Judaism, as in rejecting animal sacrifice and in deleting certain passages from Scripture with the claim that they were interpolations. &quot; } Although there is no evidence for the name Ebionaioi prior to Irenaeus, Tabor and Eisenman choose to label as &quot; Ebionites &quot;, Jewish Christians that maintained a continuity with the Messianic eschatology of the Jerusalem Church under James the Just [ Robert Eisenman The New Testament Code 34,145,273 Watkins Publishing 2006 978-1-84293-186-8 ] { p.34 - &quot; These &quot; Ebionites &quot; are also the followers of James par excellence, himself considered (even in early Christian accounts) to be the leader of &quot; the Poor &quot; or these selfsame &quot; Ebionites &quot; &quot;., p.145 - &quot; For James 2:5, of course, it is &quot; the Poor of this world ( &quot; the Ebionim &quot; or &quot; Ebionites &quot; ) whom God chose as Heirs to the Kingdom He promised to those that love Him &quot;. &quot;, p.273 - &quot;... &quot; the Righteous Teacher &quot; and those of his followers (called &quot; the Poor &quot; or &quot; Ebionim &quot; - in our view, James and his Community, pointedly referred to in the early Church literature, as will by now have become crystal clear, as &quot; the Ebionites &quot; or &quot; the Poor &quot; ). &quot; } while others, though agreeing about the historical events, use it in a more restricted sense, reserving the designation &quot; Nazarene &quot; before the flight to Pella in c70 CE, and &quot; Ebionite &quot; for Pella and afterwards. { Jeffrey Butz, The Secret Legacy of Jesus, ISBN 978-1-59477-307-5, &quot; In fact, the Ebionites and the Nazarenes are one and the same. &quot; pg 124; &quot; Following the devastation of the Jewish War, the Nazarenes took refuge in Pella, a community in exile, where they lay in anxious wait with their fellow Jews. From this point on it is preferable to call them the Ebionites. There was no clear demarcation or formal transition from Nazarene to Ebionite; there was no sudden change of theology or Christology. &quot;, pg 137; &quot; While the writings of later church fathers speak of Nazarenes and Ebionites as if they were different Jewish Christian groups, they are mistaken in that assessment. The Nazarenes and the Ebionites were one and the same group, but for clarity we will refer to the pre-70 group in Jerusalem as Nazarenes, and the post-70 group in Pella and elsewhere as Ebionites. &quot;, pg 137; } Mainstream scholarship commonly uses the term in the restricted sense. Maccoby&apos;s (1987) view of the Ebionites is that they were Jewish heretics due to their refusal to see Jesus as a false prophet and failed Jewish Messiah claimant but also for wanting to include their gospel into the canon of the Hebrew Bible. [ Modern movements ] In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several small yet competing &quot; Ebionite &quot; websites, claiming to be revivalists of the views and practices of early Ebionites, have occasionally been listed in some sources surveying religious activity on the Internet, though census data does not demonstrate any notable new religious movement s. The counter-missionary group Jews for Judaism favorably mentions the historical Ebionites in their literature in order to argue that &quot; Messianic Judaism &quot;, as promoted by missionary groups such as Jews for Jesus, is Pauline Christianity misrepresenting itself as Judaism. [ Bentzion Kravitz The Jewish Response to Missionaries: Counter-Missionary Handbook Jews for Judaism International 2001 ] Some Messianic groups have expressed concern over leaders in Israel that deny Jesus&apos; divinity and the possible collapse of the Messianic movement due to a resurgence of Ebionitism.
