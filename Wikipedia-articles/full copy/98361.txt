[ History ] Overhead sign for Route 20. The present-day routing of Route 20 north of Market Street was legislated in 1927 as part of Route 3, which was to run from the New York border at Greenwood Lake to Secaucus. { State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. } [ Williams, Jimmy and Sharon http://www.jimmyandsharonwilliams.com/njroads/1920s/images/1927_routes.gif 1927 New Jersey Road Map 1920s New Jersey Highways 2008-10-08 ] In addition, the present day routing south of Route 4 was also legislated as part of that route, which was to run from the George Washington Bridge to Cape May. In 1929, the western terminus of Route 3 was moved to Paterson as Route S4B (now Route 208 ) was planned to replace the alignment of Route 3 from Paterson to the New York border. { State of New Jersey, Laws of 1929, Chapter 126. } McLean Boulevard through Paterson was built by the 1930s. [ Rutgers University Cartography Services Map of Passaic County N.J. 1936 http://mapmaker.rutgers.edu/PASSAIC_COUNTY/PassaicCo1936.gif 2009-03-28 ] In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 20 was legislated to follow the former alignment of Route 3 between Paterson and East Rutherford as Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway that was built between East Rutherford and Clifton. [ 1953 renumbering http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1953_New_Jersey_state_highway_renumbering New Jersey Department of Highways July 31, 2009 ] Another freeway routing of Route 20 was planned in 1959. { State of New Jersey, Laws of 1959, Chapter 4. } This road, which was to be a six-lane freeway called the Paterson Peripheral, was to run from Clifton north to the existing Route 20 in downtown Paterson. [ http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NJ-19/ NJ 19 Freeway Anderson, Steve Eastern Roads 2009-03-11 ] This road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and Valley Road by 1969 and north to Interstate 80 in 1971. [ Chevron Oil Company Map of New Jersey 1969 H.M. Gousha ] Upon completion, this road received the Route 20 designation. In 1972, the state took over maintenance of the Paterson Plank Road from Route 3 to Route 17 in East Rutherford and made it a part of the route. { State of New Jersey, Laws of 1972, Chapter 209. } As these three sections of Route 20 were not connected, they received three different route designations by the 1990s. The freeway section of Route 20 from the Garden State Parkway to Interstate 80 was designated Route 19, the section between Route 3 and Route 17 was designated Route 120, and the Route 20 designation was retained along McLean Boulevard through Paterson.
