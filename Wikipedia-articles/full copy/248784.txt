[ March 2009 ] Independent animation is a term used to describe animated short cartoons and feature films produced outside the professional Hollywood animation industry. [ History ] [ Early independent animation ] The history of animation is as old as the film industry itself. Independent animators have produced innovative, often experimental, shorts since the silent era. One of the feature length animated films was &quot; The Adventures of Prince Achmed, &quot; was made in 1926 by Lotte Reiniger, a German artist who made intricate cut-out figures that are underlit. She made a number of shorter films, and another feature, Dr. Doolittle, in 1928. { http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.3/articles/moritz1.3.html &quot; Lotte Reiniger &quot;, William Moritz, Animation World Magazine, Issue 1.3 } [ The United States ] [ Success of independent animation ] Ralph Bakshi tried to establish an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions in the 1970s. In the late 1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz founded Bakshi Productions, [ Gibson Jon M. McDonnell Chris Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi 2008 Universe Publishing 0-7893-1684-6 54 First Gigs ] establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.

Bakshi soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi&apos;s lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark&apos;s Place, Bakshi came across a copy of R. Crumb &apos;s Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb&apos;s sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Fritz the Cat was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with Heavy Traffic. Ralph Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.

Knopf New York City 0-394-54684-9 275 ] Many independent animation short films are largely unknown; they are rarely seen outside of independent &quot; art house &quot; movie theaters. Collections of independent films have been gathered for theatrical viewing, and video release, under such titles as the International Tournee of Animation (which existed between about 1966 and the late 1990s) and Spike and Mike&apos;s Classic Festival of Animation (1977 to 1990) and Spike and Mike&apos;s Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation since 1990. Contemporary independent animators, including Paul Fierlinger and Bill Plympton, have also made features outside of the studio system. [ Later independent animation ] The rise of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s saw an exponential increase in the production of independent animation. Personal computer power increased to the point where it was possible for a single person to produce an animated cartoon on a home computer, using software such as Flash and distribute these short films over the World Wide Web. Independently produced Internet cartoons flourished as the popularity of the Web grew, and a number of strange, often hilarious short cartoons were produced for the Web. In the late 1990s, an independent animated short film called The Spirit of Christmas was produced for under $2,000 by two artists, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This film was widely distributed on the Internet as a pirated cartoon, and its phenomenal popularity gave rise to the popular television animated series South Park. Continued success for independent animation occurred in the 2000s with animated shorts such as Making Fiends and Travels of Bad News. Both shorts garnered enough support to be turned into full-length TV Series, airing on Nicktoons Network and Big TV, respectively. [ Independent animation outside the United States ] [ Canada ] [ :Category:National Film Board of Canada animated shorts ] The National Film Board of Canada began production of animation when Norman McLaren joined the organization in 1941. The NFB proved to be an organization that would give Canada a presence in the film world. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized experimental filmmaker. The NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as pinscreen animation, but most of the Oscars and many other awards it won were done in traditional cell animation. McLaren&apos;s Oscar-winning Neighbours popularized the form of character movement referred to as pixillation, a variant of stop motion. The term pixilation itself was created by NFB animator Grant Munro in an experimental film of the same name. [ The United Kingdom ] The BFI funded around thirty pieces of experimental animation between the mid-fifties and mid-nineties.
