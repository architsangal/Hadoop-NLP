[ Neville, Ralph (1364-1425) ] [ Origins ] He was born in Raby Castle, County Durham, England, the son of John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby by Lady Maud Percy. { Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Ed. Vol XXVIII. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1910. 553. } [ Life ] He was knighted by Thomas of Woodstock during the French expedition of 1380. In 1388, following the death of his father, he became the fourth Baron Neville de Raby. In 1391, Neville was put on the commission that undertook the duties of Constable in place of Thomas of Woodstock and was repeatedly engaged in negotiations with the Scots. On 29 September 1397, due to his support for King Richard II against the Lords Appellant, Neville was created the 1st Earl of Westmorland. As a Lancastrian, he supported the overthrow of Richard by Henry Bolingbroke and Bolingbroke&apos;s coronation as King Henry IV in October 1399. He was rewarded with an appointment as Earl Marshal for life (but resigned in 1412). He was also invested as a Privy Counsellor before 4 December 1399. { Charles Mosley, editor, Burke&apos;s Peerage and Baronetage, 106th edition, 2 volumes (Crans, Switzerland: Burke&apos;s Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 1999), volume 1, page 14. } In 1403, he was made a Knight of the Garter, taking the place left vacant by the death of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York. King Henry IV endowed him with the honour and lordship of Richmond for life. Like the first lords of Richmond and Peter II of Savoy before him, Ralph was endowed with Richmond, but without a title. The Nevilles were natural rivals of the House of Percy. In 1403, the power of the Percys had fallen at the Battle of Shrewsbury. Both marches had been in their hands, but the west marches was now assigned to Neville, whose influence in the east was also paramount. Neville had prevented Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, from marching to reinforce Henry Hotspur Percy before embarking on a new revolt to secure his enemy, Northumberland. In May 1403, while the Percys were in revolt with Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and Archbishop Scrope, Neville met them at Skipton Moor, near York, and suggested a parley between the leaders. Scrope and Mowbray were seized after Mowbray let his followers disperse and handed over to Northumberland at Pontefract Castle. It is believed by some historians that the two surrendered voluntarily. If Neville had betrayed them, he certainly shared no part in their execution. In the later part of his career, Neville was mainly engaged with defence of the northern border in his capacity as Warden of the West March (1403–1414). In 1415 he decisively defeated an invading Scottish army at the Battle of Yeavering. In 1422, he was a member of the Council of Regency during the minority of King Henry VI. [ Architectural legacy ] Neville was a great church builder, &quot; curious flat-headed windows being peculiar to the churches on the Neville manors &quot;. [ Character in Shakespeare ] The character of Westmorland in William Shakespeare &apos;s plays Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V is based on Neville. Neville did not play the part that was assigned to him in Shakespeare&apos;s Henry V. During Henry V &apos;s absence he remained in charge of the north and was a member of the Council of Regency in 1415, during King Henry V&apos;s absence. It has been claimed by Brenda James and Professor William Rubinstein that Neville&apos;s great-great-grandson Sir Henry Neville wrote the works of William Shakespeare.
