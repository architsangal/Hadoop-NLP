It is a state-maintained bridge over Amtrak and New Jersey Transit &apos;s Northeast Corridor line in West Windsor. Route  64 begins at an intersection with County Route  526 and County Route  571 in West Windsor. It heads along the bridge to an intersection with County Route  615, where Route 64 ends. County routes 526 and 571, which are unofficially concurrent with Route  64, continues to Hightstown. Route  64 was designated originally as an alignment of Route  31A, a spur off of State Highway Route  31 (currently U.S. Route  206 ) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route  33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route  31A to Route  64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed to become part of the Princeton –Hightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route  92 ), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route  64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route  1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571. [ Route description ] Route 64 heading northbound in West Windsor towards Penns Neck Route 64 begins at an intersection with County Route 526, County Route 571, and Mercer County Route 615 in the community of West Windsor. From this point, County Routes 526 and 571 continue along the right-of-way towards U.S. Route 130. The route heads north crosses over the Amtrak and New Jersey Transit -used Northeast Corridor Line and passes to the north of a local bus depot. Route 64 continues westward for a short distance, crossing through a local woodland and by several local homes. The route makes a gradual curve to the west off the railroad bridge and passes a couple of homes before heading to the south slightly at a jughandle. Route 64 reaches its northern terminus and County Route 526 and County Route 571 make a right turn to head northwest toward U.S. Route 1.

From there, it would follow an alignment of highway to the intersection with State Highway Route 33 in the community of Hightstown. The original proposal for the highway was to turn the road into a limited-access freeway along its entirety. The route was designated as State Highway Route 31A, a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 31 that year. [ ROUTE NO. 31A. Beginning in State highway route No. 31 in or near Princeton, and thence to a point at or near Hightstown and connecting there with State highway route No. 33 eastwardly of Hightstown. 1938 New Jersey State Assembly ] A portion of the highway was constructed in 1939, when a bridge over the Pennsylvania Railroad was constructed from Washington Road&apos;s former alignment to the current intersection with Route 615. [ 2009 Structure Number: ++++++++1117150 United States Department of Transportation ] This new, [ 104.00 ft m ] long bridge replaced the at-grade crossing on Washington Road, [ Southeastern portion of the Princeton, New Jersey quadrangle United States Geological Survey 1909 ] which is now a dead-end.

Beginning in State highway route No. 31 in or near Princeton, and thence to a point at or near Hightstown and connecting there with State highway route No. 33 eastwardly of Hightstown. 1941 New Jersey State Assembly ] Route 31A (1938-1953) The new bridge remained in place along Route  31A, however, no new portions of the freeway were constructed in terms of creating the Route  31A Freeway, as proposed in  1938. In  1950, then-governor of New Jersey, Alfred E. Driscoll, cited the need for the expressway as an important truck and passenger car highway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore. [ My studies have very definitely indicated that it is unwise to expect city streets to bear the brunt of through, truck and passenger traffic. A continuous line of trucks, or, for that matter, passenger cars, bound from the Trenton area to the seashore, or desiring to get on the (New Jersey) Turnpike after it is completed, may constitute a (brick wall) &quot; Chinese Wall &quot; just as effectively as an underpass or overpass. Alfred E. Driscoll State of New Jersey 1950 ] Route  31A itself was decommissioned in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, and replaced by the designation of Route  64. [ 1953 renumbering http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1953_New_Jersey_state_highway_renumbering New Jersey Department of Highways July 31, 2009 ] The route was truncated from both ends toward Princeton and Hightstown, leaving just the bridge in West Windsor. { State of New Jersey, Laws of 1953, Chapter 112, Page 1298, Section 1. } Route  31A remained in the state highway statutes for several decades after decommissioning, with a bill in  1991 being proposed. The bill passed, and Route  31A was stripped from the statutes on January  18,  1992. { State of New Jersey, Laws of 1991, Page 1298, Section 2. } [ Route 92 and future changes to CR 571 ] [ New Jersey Route 92 ] alt=Black and white circular shield on the side of an expressway Route  64, after designation in  1953, remained a short bridge along the highway. [ New Jersey American Oil Company 1959 General Drafting Inc. ] However, the need for an expressway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore remained, and in the late 1950s, the State Highway Department brought about plans for the Princeton –Hightstown Bypass, a four-lane freeway that would head for [ 14 mi km ] from U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township to New Jersey Route 33 in Hightstown. In the length, the freeway was to interchange with U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 130 and New Jersey Route 27. The route was re-designated as Route 92, [ http://www.nycroads.com/history/expwy-map_metro/ Proposed Expressways in New York City Regional Plan Association News May 1964 2009-09-09 ] and remained a high priority project for several decades. Even after changes in alignment, Route 64 was still an alternative. [ Public Hearing for Proposed Route 92 Freeway New Jersey Department of Transportation December 18, 1991 New Jersey State Legislature ] However, Route 92 was shelved on December 1, 2006 in favor of widening the New Jersey Turnpike mainline, [ Turnpike Won&apos;t Add Toll Link to Route 1 December 2, 2006 The Asbury Park Press ] and only New Jersey Route 133 was constructed for the proposal. [ Long Wait Is Over Armone Michael December 1, 1999 The Trenton Times ] As part of the proposed Penns Neck Bypass on U.S. Route 1, the New Jersey Department of Transportation plans on realigning County Route 571 and Route 526 from the western terminus of Route  64 to a northerly route to Route 1.
