It was first developed for brain, pancreatic and other cancers. It is used to treat harlequin-type ichthyosis, a usually lethal skin disease, and lamellar ichthyosis. Its effects are systemic and nonselective. It is a retinoid, meaning it is related to vitamin A, and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Isotretinoin&apos;s best-known and most dangerous side effect is birth defects. This is because of the molecule&apos;s close resemblance to retinoic acid, a natural vitamin A derivative which controls normal embryonic development. Because of this, it is one of the most difficult pharmaceuticals to obtain in the United States. [ May 2012 ] In 2009, Roche decided to pull Accutane off the US market after juries had awarded millions of dollars in damages to former Accutane users over inflammatory bowel disease claims. Among others, actor James Marshall sued Roche for $11 million in damages over Accutane-related disease that resulted in removal of his colon.

[ November 2010 ] [ Medical uses ] Due to side-effects and high cost, isotretinoin is used primarily for severe cystic acne and acne that has not responded to other treatments. Acne treatment usually begins with topical medications (e.g., benzoyl peroxide and adapalene ), followed by oral antibiotics and isotretinoin as a last resort. [ Indications ] Isotretinoin&apos;s main indication is for the treatment of severe cystic acne vulgaris. [ Rossi S Australian medicines handbook 2006 Australian Medicines Handbook Pty Ltd Adelaide, S. Aust 2006 0-9757919-2-3 ] [ October 2010 ] { Klasco RK, editor. Drugdex system, vol. 128. Greenwood Village (CO): Thomson Micromedex; 2006. } [ May 2012 ] Many dermatologists also support its use for treatment of lesser degrees of acne that prove resistant to other treatments, or that produce physical or psychological scarring. [ Strauss J Krowchuk D Leyden J Lucky A Shalita A Siegfried E Thiboutot D Vanvoorhees A Beutner K Guidelines of care for acne vulgaris management Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 56 4 651–63 2007 17276540 10.1016/j.jaad.2006.08.048 ] It is also somewhat effective for hidradenitis suppurativa and some cases of severe acne rosacea. It can also be used to help treat harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis and is used in xeroderma pigmentosum cases to relieve keratose s. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. It is also used for treatment of neuroblastoma, a form of nerve cancer. Isotretinoin therapy has furthermore proven effective against genital warts in experimental use, but is rarely used due to potentially severe side effects. In a small-scale study, low dose oral isotretinoin showed considerable efficacy; Isotretinoin may represent an efficacious and safe alternative systemic form of therapy for RCA of the cervix. Yet, albeit this indicative evidence not many studies have been conducted to further confirm its effectivenes. In most countries this therapy is currently unapproved and only used if other therapies failed.

Guide to poisons and therapeutic goods legislation for medical practitioners and dentists. Sydney: NSW Department of Health; 2006. } [ October 2010 ] In New Zealand, isotretinoin can be prescribed by any doctor, but is subsidised only if prescribed by a vocationally registered general practitioner or dermatologist. Since 1 March 2006, the dispensing of isotretinoin in the United States has been controlled by an FDA -mandated website called iPLEDGE – dermatologists are required to register their patients before prescribing and pharmacists are required to check the website before dispensing the drug. The prescription may not be dispensed until both parties have complied. A physician may not prescribe more than a 30-day supply. A new prescription may not be written for at least 30 days. Pharmacies are also under similar restriction. There is also a seven-day window between the time the prescription is written and the time the medication must be picked up at the pharmacy. If the original prescription is lost, or pick-up window is missed, the patient must requalify to have another prescription written. Doctors and pharmacists must also verify written prescriptions in an online system before patients may fill the prescription. Due to its teratogenic effects, women with the potential to bear children must commit to the use of two forms of contraception simultaneously for the duration of isotretinoin therapy, as well as for the month immediately preceding and the month immediately following therapy. [ https://www.ipledgeprogram.com/AboutiPLEDGE.aspx iPledge (About iPledge) ] In at least Mexico, Colombia, and also Brazil, this drug is of restricted use, and an official identification and patient signature is required by the pharmacies. [ Dosage ] 10 mg capsule The dose of isotretinoin patients receive is dependent on their weight and the severity of the condition. High-dose treatments are administered between 0.5  mg/kg/day to 2  mg/kg/day (usually at 0.5 to 1  mg/kg/day, { United States Pharmacopeia Staff. Consumer Reports Complete Drug Reference. Yonkers, NY: Consumer Reports Books, 1995. Pg 998. } divided into two doses), for a total treatment of four to six months. In some rare cases where the patient&apos;s acne is severe or unresponsive, the initial course may last up to nine months. A second course may be used at least eight weeks following the cessation of the initial course if severe acne recurs. Efficacy appears to be related to the cumulative dose of isotretinoin taken, with a total cumulative dose over each course of 120–150  mg/kg used as a guideline. Shorter, higher dose treatments or uninterrupted double courses should be used only as a last resort, due to adverse side effects. Nearly all patients achieve initial clearing of acne during high-dose isotretinoin therapy. Furthermore, about 40% observe complete and long-term remission of the disease following one course of isotretinoin, while another 40% eventually develop less severe recurrent acne, which is treatable with less invasive medications. The remaining 20% relapse significantly enough to warrant an additional course of isotretinoin. [ James William D.

Since the age until complete ossification of bones normally varies between individuals (17–20 years for upper limbs, 18–23 years for lower limbs) { Student Investigation 6.1.

It is also worth noting that stunted growth of long bones and other bones with epiphyseal plates that are not affecting an individuals height, for example the clavicles, scapula and sternum is almost impossible to detect since no measurements of these bones are done.

[ Pharmacokinetics ] [ January 2012 ] Isotretinoin, when administered orally, is best absorbed when taken after a high-fat meal, as it has a high level of lipophilicity. In a crossover study, the peak plasma concentration was found to be more than doubled when taken after a high-fat meal versus a fasted condition. Isotretinoin is primarily (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. At least three metabolites have been detected in human plasma after oral administration: 4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoic acid, and 4-oxo-retinoic acid. Isotretinoin also oxidizes, irreversibly, to 4-oxo-isotretinoin. The metabolites of isotretinoin are excreted through both urine and feces. The mean elimination half-life is 21 hours, with a standard deviation from this mean of 8.2 hours. [ History ] An early treatment of acne first used during the 1930s was high doses of the fat-soluble vitamin A ( retinoic acid ). [ April 2010 ] At these dosage levels (sometimes 500,000   IU per day), sebum production is notably reduced, thwarting acne, but overly dry hair is a negative side effect, and such high doses can lead to vitamin A toxicity. Use of animal-based vitamin A at nutritive levels (where the upper limit dosage is 10,000  IU daily), taken over the course of a year, has also been shown to reduce acne. [ April 2010 ] Building on the discovery that vitamin A can inhibit sebum production at toxic dosages, the retinoic acid derivative isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) was developed in 1982 by Hoffmann-La Roche. Dr. Gary Peck is credited with discovering its use for the treatment of cystic acne, as well as disorders of keratinization, such as lamellar ichthyosis, Darier&apos;s disease, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. In addition, he demonstrated its chemopreventive properties in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and Gorlin&apos;s syndrome. In fact, within one year of attaining the U.S. patent for discovering the use of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne, he received the Inventor&apos;s Award from the US Department of Commerce and a Meritorious Service Medal from the US Public Health Services in 1983. In 2003, he was honored with The Discovery Award by the Dermatology Foundation in &quot; recognition of extraordinary scientific accomplishments that have had a profound influence on the specialty of dermatology and have gained the respect and admiration of the world scientific community &quot;. Dosage requirements of isotretinoin have been disputed. After a 1984 study funded by Roche, relatively high dosages of isotretinoin became mainstream in treatment in the United States. Lower dosages were found to be effective in treatment by independent research (see dosage section). From the time of its introduction, the drug was known to have teratogenic potential, and pregnancies with the drug were strongly discouraged. When they occurred, they were found to have approximately 30% rates of congenital malformation, versus a 3–5% baseline risk.

A retrospective cohort study recently found that pregnancy rates were quite high during the period (one per 30 women per year), and 84% of pregnancies were ended by induced abortion. In February 2002, Roche&apos;s patents for isotretinoin expired, and there are now many other companies selling cheaper generic versions of the drug. On June 29, 2009, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the original creator and distributor of isotretinoin, officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their Accutane brand in the United States due to what the company described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with the high cost of defending personal-injury lawsuits brought by some patients prescribed the drug. Generic isotretinoin will remain available in the United States through various manufacturers. Roche USA continues to defend Accutane and claims to have treated over 13 million patients since its introduction in 1982. F.
