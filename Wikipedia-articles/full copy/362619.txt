The de Havilland Chipmunk was the first true postwar aviation project of de Havilland Canada. } Today, over 500 DHC-1 Chipmunk (affectionately known as &quot; Chippie &quot; ) airframes remain airworthy with more being rebuilt every year.

Wsiewołod Jakimiuk, a Polish prewar engineer, created the first indigenous design of the aircraft at de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. It is an all-metal, low wing, tandem two-place, single engine aircraft with a conventional tail wheel landing gear and fabric-covered control surfaces. The wing is also fabric-covered aft of the spar. A clear perspex canopy covers the pilot /student (front) and instructor/passenger (rear) positions. CF-DIO-X, the Chipmunk prototype, flew for the first time at Downsview, Toronto on 22 May 1946 with Pat Fillingham, test pilot from the parent de Havilland company, at the controls. { Bain 1992, p. 141. } The production version of the Chipmunk was powered by a [ 145 hp on ] in-line de Havilland Gipsy Major 8 engine while the prototype was powered by a 145  hp (108  kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major 1C. Two Chipmunk aircraft were evaluated by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A &amp; AEE) at RAF Boscombe Down. As a result, the fully aerobatic Chipmunk was ordered as an ab initio trainer for the Royal Air Force ( Prince Philip took his first flying lesson in one in 1952). The Royal Canadian Air Force also adopted the Chipmunk as their primary trainer. British-built and early Canadian-built Chipmunks are notably different from the later Canadian-built RCAF/Lebanese versions. The later Canadian-built aircraft have a bubble canopy, while early Canadian, and all Portuguese and British examples have the multi-panelled sliding canopy, the rearmost panels of which are bulged for better instructor visibility. From the 1950s onward, the Chipmunk also became a popular civilian aircraft, being used for training, aerobatics and crop spraying. Most civilian aircraft are ex-military. [ Operational history ] [ United Kingdom ] The RAF received 735 Chipmunks, designated de Havilland Chipmunk T.10, manufactured in the UK by the de Havilland parent company to specification 8/48 as a Tiger Moth replacement. Production began at the DH Hatfield factory but soon transferred to their plant at Hawarden Airport at Broughton near Chester. They initially served with Reserve Flying Squadrons (RFS) of the RAF Volunteer Reserve (VR) as well as the University Air Squadrons. A few Chipmunks were pressed into service in Cyprus on internal security flights during the conflict in 1958. From 1956 to 1990 the Chimunks of the RAF Gatow Station Flight were used for covert reconnaissance by BRIXMIS over the Berlin area. { Shields et al. 2009, p. 276. } Chipmunk T.10s were also used by the Army Air Corps and Fleet Air Arm for primary training. Chipmunks remained service with ATC Air Experience Flight s until 1996 (the final AEF to use the Chipmunk was No. 10 Air Experience Flight, RAF Woodvale ) when they were replaced by the Bulldog. The last Chipmunks in military service are still operated by the British historic flights - the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (including one of the Gatow aircraft), the Royal Navy and Army historic flights, to keep their pilots current on tailwheel aircraft. The cockpit sections of some former RAF Chipmunks have been used as ground training aids. These are colloquially known as &quot; Chippax &quot; trainers. { &quot; Chippax. &quot; Sywell Museum. Retrieved: 21 July 2011. } [ &quot; Chippax &quot; is an amalgamation of &quot; Chipmunk &quot; and &quot; Pax &quot; (an industry abbreviation for &quot; passenger &quot; ) N ]. [ Canada ] The RCAF accepted its first DHC-1 Chipmunks in 1948, as the first of a long production run of the 217 Chipmunks made in Canada. The Chipmunk was the first Canadian-designed aircraft to be made abroad under licence, with the majority of the home-grown production destined for the RCAF, but Canadian Chipmunks were also sent to Egypt, Lebanon, and Thailand. { &quot; de Havilland Canada DHC-1B2 Chipmunk 2. &quot; Canada Aviation and Space Museum. Retrieved: 26 July 2011. } Of the 113 in RCAF service, 79 Chipmunks were assigned as ab initio trainers with 34 assigned to flying clubs for use in refresher training for RCAF Reserve pilots. { &quot; De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk. &quot; Canadian Centennial of Flight, 2009. Retrieved: 26 July 2011. } The last example soldiered on as a CF trainer until 1972, three years after unification in 1968. The Chipmunk&apos;s long service was due, in part, to its fully aerobatic capabilities and superb flying characteristics, which made it a delight to fly. [ The Chipmnuk&apos;s flight characteristics have been favourably compared to that of the Supermarine Spitfire. Shields, Hugh et al. 2009, pp. cover, back cover. N ] It is also a mechanically sound aircraft and, consequently, many ex-RCAF Chipmunks are still operational around the world. { &quot; de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk. &quot; Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.

The main modification was the installation of a more powerful 180  hp Continental engine. Their main tasks are related to supporting the Air Force cadets aerial activities, mainly initial aptitude screening, glider tow and initial flight proficiency. [ Civil conversions ] Masefield Variant Modifications or conversions by Bristol Aircraft Ltd. Modifications could be made on Chipmunk Mk 20, Mk 21, Mk 22 and 22A aircraft. The Chipmunks could be fitted with luggage compartments in the wings, a blown canopy, landing gear fairings and enlarged fuel tanks. &quot; Masefield Chipmunk. &quot; Flight, 15 July 1960.

Turbo Chipmunk In 1967–1968 a Chipmunk Mk 22A was converted, tested and flown by Hants and Sussex Aviation. The Chipmunk was fitted with a 86.42-kW (116-shp) Rover 90 turboprop engine. Jackson 1987, p. 535. and extra fuel capacity.

ISBN 0-7106-0748-2 Operated mainly by the Royal Air Force Gliding &amp; Soaring Association (RAFGSA), the Supermunks are still in service and used at major gliding competitions in the United Kingdom. It is also used by the Portuguese Air Force Academy as basic training aircraft and as glider tug. [ Scholl Super Chipmunk ] Aerobatic pilot Harold Krier taxiing a Super Chipmunk, at an airshow in Fairview, Oklahoma 1970 A number of Chipmunks were modified as aerobatic aircraft in the United States as the &quot; Super Chipmunk &quot;. Along with an uprated engine, the aircraft underwent an extensive makeover including clipping its wings, adding retractable landing gear, conversion to a single-seat layout, adding an autopilot and being fitted with a red, white and blue wingtip and tail smoke system. The control stick received a three-inch (76  mm) extension for greater control during extreme aerobatic maneuvers. For over 25 years the Super Chipmunk in its distinctive bright color scheme of blue stars and sunburst effect was displayed by the aerobatic pilot Art Scholl. Four Super Chipmunk conversions were modified, Scholl&apos;s N13A and N13Y, Harold Krier’s N6311V and Skip Volk&apos;s N1114V. Another more recent &quot; Super Chipmunk &quot; was converted by air show performer, Jim &quot; Fang &quot; Maroney who similarly modified an ex-RCAF example by strengthening the airframe, replacing the original [ 145 hp on ] engine with a [ 260 hp on ] version incorporating an inverted fuel and oil system, clipping three feet off the wings and adding 30% more rudder and 10% more elevator. A spatted landing gear was retained. Another similarly modified &quot; Super Chipmunk &quot;, N1804Q, is owned and flown by air show pilot Greg Aldridge. N13Y is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington-Dulles International Airport., { &quot; De Havilland-Canada DHC-1A Chipmunk, Pennzoil Special. &quot; Smithsonian, Air and Space Museum, 2005.
