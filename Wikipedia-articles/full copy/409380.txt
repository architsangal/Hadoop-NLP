Evolution of political parties. Political parties in the Philippines are of diverse ideologies and are plentiful in number. Most of these parties do not have actual grassroots membership among ordinary voters but rather that of political figures and leaders. The Philippines has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition government s for political expediency and convenience. Since no political parties have sustaining membership to which party leaders are developed, most of the political parties have the rise-and-fall-and-rise character. There are three types of parties in the Philippines and these are: major parties, who correspond typically to traditional political parties, minor parties or party-list organizations, who rely on the party-list system to win Congressional seats and regional or provincial parties, who corresponds to a region-wide or province-wide organization, respectively.
