{ Great Frigatebird s chasing a } { Red-footed Booby in order to steal its food. } Kleptoparasitism or cleptoparasitism (literally, parasitism by theft ) is a form of feeding in which one animal takes prey or other food from another that has caught, collected, or otherwise prepared the food, including stored food (as in the case of cuckoo bee s, which lay their eggs on the pollen masses made by other bees). The term is also used to describe the stealing of nest material or other inanimate objects from one animal by another. The kleptoparasite gains either by obtaining prey or other objects that it could not obtain itself, or by saving the time and effort required to obtain it. However, the kleptoparasite may run the risk of injury from the victim if the latter is able to defend its property. Kleptoparasitism may be intraspecific (the parasite is the same species as the victim) or interspecific (the parasite is a different species). In the latter case, the parasites are commonly close relatives of the organisms they parasitize ( &quot; Emery&apos;s Rule &quot; ). Animals that have extraordinarily specialized feeding methods are often targets of kleptoparasitism. For example, oystercatcher s are unusual in being able to break through the shells of mussel s; adult oystercatchers suffer intraspecific kleptoparasitism from juveniles that are not yet strong or skillful enough to open mussels easily. Diving birds that bring their prey to the surface suffer interspecific kleptoparasitism from gull s, which are unable to fetch fish from the sea floor themselves. Chinstrap penguins also actively engage in kleptoparasitism, being known to steal rocks and other nest materials from members of their colony for use in their own nest. [ Arthropods ] { Nomada &apos;&apos;. } [ Bees and wasps ] There are many different lineages of cuckoo bee s, all of which lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bee s. There is also a family of cuckoo wasp s, many of which lay their eggs in the nests of potter and mud dauber wasps; many other lineages of wasp s in various families have evolved similar habits. These insects are normally referred to as &quot; kleptoparasites, &quot; rather than as &quot; brood parasite s. &quot; The distinction is that the term &quot; brood parasite &quot; is generally restricted to cases where the immature parasite is fed directly by the adult of the host, and raised as the host&apos;s offspring (as is common in bird s ). Such cases are rare in bees and wasps, which tend to provide all of the food for the larva before the egg is laid; in only a few exceptional cases (such as parasitic bumblebee s ) will a bee or wasp female feed a larva that is not her own species. The difference is only in the nature of the interaction by which the transfer of resources occurs (tricking a host into handing over food rather than stealing it by force or stealth), which is why brood parasitism is considered a special form of kleptoparasitism. [ Flies ] &apos;&apos;Sarcophaga&apos;&apos; sp. feeding on captured prey (Tipulidae) of a spider (video, 1m 44s) { miltogrammine fly &apos;&apos; } { Craticulina seriata &apos;&apos; is a kleptoparasite of } { sand wasp s, depositing its larvae on the food reserved for the larvae of the wasp. } Some flies are kleptoparasites, this being especially common in the subfamily Miltogramminae of the family Sarcophagidae. There are also some kleptoparasites in the families Chloropidae and Milichiidae. Some adult milichiids, for example, visit spider web s where they scavenge on half-eaten stink bug s. Others are associated with robber flies ( Asilidae ), or Crematogaster ant s. { Wild, A.L. &amp; Brake, I. 2009. Field observations on Milichia patrizii ant-mugging flies (Diptera: Milichiidae: Milichiinae) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. } { African Invertebrates 50 (1): 205-212. } Flies in the genus Bengalia ( Calliphoridae ) steal food and pupae transported by ant s and are often found beside their foraging trails. { Sivinski, J., S. Marshall and E. Petersson (1999) Kleptoparasitism and phoresy in the diptera. Florida Entomologist 82 (2) } [ True bugs ] { Ardennes, Belgium) } Many semiaquatic bugs ( Heteroptera ) are known to engage in kleptoparastism of prey. In one study, whenever the bug Velia caprai ( Water cricket ) took prey heavier than 7.9 g, other bugs of the same species joined it and successfully ate parts of the prey. [ Erlandsson Ann 1988 Food sharing vs monopolising prey: a form of kleptoparasitism in Velia caprai (Heteroptera) 3566063 Oikos 53 2 203–206 10.2307/3566063 ] [ Ants ] See Amazon ant [ Spiders ] Kleptoparasitic spider s, which steal or feed on prey captured by other spiders, are known to occur in five families: Theridiidae ( Argyrodes species) Dictynidae ( Archaeodictyna ulova ) Salticidae (species of Portia and Simaetha ) Symphytognathidae ( Curimagua bayano ) Mysmenidae ( Isela okuncana, Kilifia inquilina, and Mysmenopsis species).

Paul R. Ehrlich Dobkin David S. Wheye Darryl Pimm Stuart L. The Birdwatcher&apos;s Handbook 1994 Oxford University Press Oxford 0-19-858407-5 ] However, some non-passerine groups, such as skua s, jaegers and frigatebird s, rely extensively on such behavior to obtain food, and others —including raptor s, gull s, terns, coot s, and some duck s and shorebird s —will do so opportunistically. Among opportunistic species such as the Roseate Tern, research has found that parent birds involved in kleptoparasitism are more successful in raising broods than non-kleptoparasitic individuals. { David A. Shealer, Jeffrey A. Spendelow, Jeff S. Hatfield and Ian C. T. Nisbet 2005. The adaptive significance of stealing in a marine bird and its relationship to parental quality. Behavioral Ecology 16(2):371-376; doi:10.1093/beheco/ari008 } Bald Eagles can also be seen attacking smaller raptors, such as Ospreys, to steal fish away from them. [ Jorde D.G. Lingle, G Kleptoparasitism by Bald Eagles wintering in South-Central Nebraska Journal of Field Ornithology 59 2 183–188 1998 http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/JFO/v059n02/p0183-p0188.pdf 2007-08-21 ] Among passerine birds, there are fewer known examples of kleptoparasitism, though Masked Shrike s have been recorded stealing food from wheatear s, [ Harris Tony Franklin Kim 2000 Shrikes &amp; Bush-Shrikes Christopher Helm London 0-7136-3861-3 ] and Eurasian Blackbird s have been seen stealing smashed snail s from other thrushes. { Western Gull (&apos;&apos;Larus occidentalis&apos;&apos;) in pursuit of } { Elegant Tern (&apos;&apos;Thalasseus elegans&apos;&apos;) } Skuas (including the smaller species known as jaegers in North America ) are masters of piracy. Their victims are typically gulls and terns, though other fish -eating species (including auk s ) are also pursued until they disgorge their catches. The fact that skuas are swift and agile fliers —and that they sometimes gang up on a single victim —aid in their success rate. During seabird nesting seasons, frigatebirds will soar above seabird colonies, waiting for parent birds to return to their nest s with food for their young. As the returning birds approach the colony, the frigatebirds (which are fast and agile) drop down and pursue them vigorously; they have been known to seize tropicbird s by their long tail plumes. Many of the frigatebirds&apos; colloquial names, including Man-o&apos;-War Bird and Pirate of the Sea, are a clear reference to this kleptoparasitic behaviour. [ Sibley David David Allen Sibley The Sibley Guide to Bird Life and Behaviour 2001 Christopher Helm London 0-7136-6250-6 ] A study of kleptoparasitism in the Magnificent Frigatebird suggests that the amount of food obtained by kleptoparasitism may be marginal. { Itzia Calixto-Albarrán and José-Luis Osorno 2000. The diet of the Magnificent Frigatebird during chick rearing. The Condor 102(3):569–576 } Intraspecific kleptoparasitism often occurs between gulls. Gulls are the perpetrators as well as the victims of kleptoparasitism, with some species frequently exhibiting the behavior, particularly during the breeding season. While the victim is most often another member of the same species, other (principally smaller) gulls and terns are also targeted. In the Americas, Heermann&apos;s Gull s and Laughing Gull s are known to steal food from Brown Pelican s; as the pelicans surface and empty the water from their bills, the gulls lurk nearby and grab escaping food items. [ del Hoyo Josep Elliott Andrew Sargatal Jordi Handbook of Birds of the World vol. 3 Lynx Edicions Barcelona 1996 84-87334-20-2 ] Several species of coots and gallinules have been recorded engaging in kleptoparasitism. [ Taylor Barry van Perlo Ber Rails Christopher Helm London 1998 1-873403-59-3 ] American Coot s often feed in the company of other waterfowl species, and occasionally will rob diving ducks —including Ring-necked Duck s, Redhead s and Canvasback —when they surface with food. Eurasian Coot s steal from conspecifics, as well as from diving and dabbling ducks, and swans. Allen&apos;s Gallinule s rob both conspecifics and African Pygmy Geese. [ Mammals ] The relationship between spotted hyena s and lion s, in which each species steals the other&apos;s kills, [ Estes, Richard D. 1999 The Safari Companion: A Guide to Watching African Mammals Chelsea Green 294 1-890132-44-6 ] is a form of kleptoparasitism. All hyena species engage in this behavior when they can, and jackal s also steal from other carnivores&apos; kills. { Estes, op. cit., 281–295, 339–346 } Sperm whale s sometimes steal fish from fishermen&apos;s lines, making them the largest of all kleptoparasites. [ http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/archives/05-06/mar18.html#3 Whale Buffet 2007-03-19 http://web.archive.org/web/20070207232120/http%3A//www.cbc.ca/quirks/archives/05-06/mar18.html#3 2007-02-07 ] A cheetah has killed an impala (and eaten part of it), creating a target for kleptoparasitism. Three minutes later: this spotted hyena and another are running toward the kill. 38 seconds later: The cheetah has fled without resistance. The vultures will also engage in kleptoparasitism: when the hyenas move a piece of the carcass, the vultures will take scraps from the ground. [ Humans ] Humans have been found to chase away lions from their captured prey and consume the meat themselves. A researcher noted the behaviour in Waza National Park, Cameroon in 2006, and other ecologists have suggested that the behaviour may be widespread but often goes unrecognised. Interviews with Bororo herdsmen suggested that they often chase lions away from their prey. This kleptoparasitism may be contributing to the decline of lion populations within the national park.
