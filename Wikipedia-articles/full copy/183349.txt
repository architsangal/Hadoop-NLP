The eroded volcano has had at least four major eruptive periods during the past 15,000  years. The last three at Mount Hood occurred within the past 1,800  years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag Rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 170 to 220  years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781–82 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907. [ http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Hood/description_hood.html Mount Hood Volcano, Oregon USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory 2007-01-16 ] The glaciers on the mountain&apos;s upper slopes may be a source of potentially dangerous lahar s when the mountain next erupts. There are vents near the summit that are known for emitting noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the only known fatality related to volcanic activity in the Cascades occurred in 1934 when a climber suffocated in oxygen-poor air while exploring ice caves melted by fumarole s in Coalman Glacier. Since 1950, there have been several earthquake swarm s each year at Mount Hood, most notably in July 1980 and June 2002.
