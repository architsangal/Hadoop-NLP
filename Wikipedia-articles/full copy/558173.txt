Screamadelica also won the first Mercury Music Prize in 1992. [ http://www.mercuryprize.com/aoty/track.php?TrackID%3D66 1992 Shortlist - Barclaycard Mercury Prize Mercuryprize.com 2011-12-03 ] [ History ] The album was a significant departure from the band&apos;s early indie rock sound, drawing inspiration from the house music scene (and associated drugs ) that was becoming popular at the time of its production. The band enlisted house DJs Andrew Weatherall and Terry Farley on producing duties, although the album also contained a wide range of other influences including gospel and dub. Although the band wrote a track also called Screamadelica, it does not appear on the album. The ten minute dance track was also produced by Andrew Weatherall and sung by Denise Johnson. It appears on the Dixie Narco EP released in 1992, and is featured in the opening credits of the now rare Screamadelica VHS video tape. The album includes &quot; Loaded &quot;, which was a top twenty hit single in the UK. Dance DJ Andrew Weatherall began remixing &quot; I&apos;m Losing More Than I&apos;ll Ever Have &quot;, from their previous album, and the resulting track disassembled the song, adding a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell &apos;s &quot; What I Am &quot; and a sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels. The single &quot; Movin&apos; on Up &quot; was the band&apos;s breakthrough hit in the United States, reaching #2 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and also making #28 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. [ Album cover ] The album cover for Screamadelica was painted by Creation Records &apos; in-house artist Paul Cannell, who died in 2005.

The song features Bobby Gillespie&apos;s vocals in the verse section with a gospel chorus, accompanied throughout by acoustic guitar, electric guitar and percussion. The song originally had a slower tempo and was described as a Ballad, the song only featured a piano and Gillespie&apos;s vocals. The song also borrows from the lyrics to Can &apos;s &quot; Yoo Doo Right &quot; with the lyrics are similar to those of Amazing Grace. &quot; Slip Inside This House &quot; is a version of a 1967 song by the 13th Floor Elevators. Primal Scream&apos;s version features Sly Stone &apos;s laugh from the end of the song &quot; Sex Machine &quot; (from the 1969 album Stand! ) and the Amen break. &quot; Don&apos;t Fight It, Feel It &quot;, in the Italo house style, with vocals by Denise Johnson. &quot; Higher Than the Sun &quot; uses a sample from &quot; Wah Wah Man &quot; by the Young-Holt Unlimited Trio. It also has a recurring spoken word sample from &quot; Get Away Jordan &quot; by Take 6. &quot; Inner Flight &quot; samples the closing sound on Brian Eno &apos;s &quot; The Great Pretender &quot; from the album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy). &quot; Loaded &quot;, in E-flat major, features lines spoken by Peter Fonda &apos;s character in the 1966 movie The Wild Angels, as well as a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell &apos;s &quot; What I Am &quot;, and the Emotions&apos; &quot; I Don&apos;t Want to Lose Your Love &quot;. There are brass pedal notes between the sections with vocals. It is a remix of Primal Scream&apos;s own &quot; I&apos;m Losing More than I&apos;ll Ever Have &quot;, off their second album &apos; Primal Scream &apos; &quot; Damaged &quot;, in contrast to the previous track, has a slower tempo and more reflective mood. Sparse percussion, acoustic guitar and piano accompany quiet vocals. &quot; Come Together &quot; is the longest track on the album. On the UK version, the track opens with part of a speech given by Jesse Jackson at the Wattstax concert held in Los Angeles in 1972. About half-way through the track, a repeated female vocal line &quot; Come... together as one &quot; kicks in and repeats for the rest of the track.
