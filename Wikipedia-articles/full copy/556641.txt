[ http://www.robertchristgau.com Robert Christgau, Dean of American Rock Critics robertchristgau.com October 10, 2009 ] One of the earliest professional rock critic s, Christgau is known for his terse capsule reviews, published since 1969 in his Consumer Guide columns. He also spent 37 years as music editor for The Village Voice, during which time he created the annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll. [ Early life ] Christgau grew up in New York City, where he says he became a rock and roll fan when disc jockey Alan Freed moved to the city in 1954. { Christgau, Robert (2004), &quot; A Counter in Search of a Culture &quot;. Any Old Way You Choose It, Cooper Square Press, p.2. } He left New York for four years to attend Dartmouth College, graduating in 1962 with a B.A. in English. While at college Christgau&apos;s musical interests turned to jazz, but he quickly returned to rock after moving back to New York. [ Career ] He initially wrote short stories, before giving up fiction in 1964 to become a sportswriter, and later, a police reporter for the Newark Star-Ledger. { Christgau, Robert (2004), &quot; A Counter in Search of a Culture &quot;. Any Old Way You Choose It, Cooper Square Press, p.4. } Christgau became a freelance writer after a story he wrote about the death of a woman in New Jersey was published by New York magazine. He was asked to take over the dormant music column at Esquire, which he began writing in early 1967. After Esquire discontinued the column, Christgau moved to The Village Voice in 1969, and he also worked as a college professor. In early 1972, he accepted a full-time job as music critic for Newsday. Christgau returned to the Village Voice in 1974 as music editor. He remained there until August 2006, when he was fired shortly after the paper&apos;s acquisition by New Times Media. { Rosen, Judy (September 5, 2006), &quot; X-ed Out: The Village Voice fires a famous music critic &quot;. Slate.com. Retrieved August 15, 2009. } Two months later, Christgau became a contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Late in 2007, Christgau was fired by Rolling Stone, { Christgau, Robert (March 27, 2009), &quot; Poptastic bye-bye &quot;. ARTicles. Retrieved March 4, 2010 } although he continued to work for the magazine for another three months. Starting with the March 2008 issue, he joined Blender, where he was listed as &quot; senior critic &quot; for three issues and then &quot; contributing editor. &quot; { Blender, June 2008, p. 16 } Christgau had been a regular contributor to Blender before he joined Rolling Stone. He continued to write for Blender until the magazine ceased publication in March 2009. Christgau has also written frequently for Playboy, Spin, and Creem. He previously taught during the formative years of the California Institute of the Arts. As of 2005, he was also an adjunct professor in the Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music at New York University. [ Consumer Guide ] Christgau is perhaps best known for his Consumer Guide columns, which have been published on a more-or-less monthly basis since 1969, in the Village Voice, as well as a brief period at Newsday. In December 2006, the column moved online to MSN Music, initially appearing every other month, before switching to a monthly schedule in June 2007. In its original format, the Consumer Guide consisted of 18 to 20 single-paragraph album reviews, each of which was given a letter grade ranging from A+ to E-. &quot; Christgau&apos;s blurbs &quot;, writes Jody Rosen, &quot; are like no one else&apos;s — dense with ideas and allusions, first-person confessions and invective, highbrow references and slang. &quot; In 1990, Christgau changed the format of the Consumer Guide; it now contains six to eight reviews graded upper-B+ or higher, one &quot; Dud of the Month &quot; review graded B or lower, and three lists: Honorable Mention (B+ albums deemed not worthy of full-paragraph reviews), Choice Cuts (excellent tracks on un-recommended albums), and Duds. For several years, there were two annual Consumer Guide columns which strayed from this format: The Turkey Shoot (typically published the week of Thanksgiving ), which consisted entirely of reviews graded B- or lower, and a Christmas -season roundup of compilations and reissues, mostly graded A or A+. Both have been discontinued. He also uses ratings such as &quot; neither &quot; (denoted by a frowny face), which &quot; may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won&apos;t &quot; and a &quot; choice cut &quot; (denoted by a pair of scissors), which, as noted above, &quot; is a good song on an album that isn&apos;t worth your time or money. &quot; [ http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php Key to Icons RobertChristgau.com ] Other ratings including 1-3 stars, being various versions of &quot; honorable mention. &quot; Lou Reed recorded a tirade against Christgau in his 1978 live album, Take No Prisoners : &quot; Critics. What does Robert Christgau do in bed? I mean, is he a toe fucker? Man, anal retentive, A Consumer&apos;s Guide to Rock, what a moron: &apos;A Study&apos; by, y&apos;know, Robert Christgau. Nice little boxes: B-PLUS. Can you imagine working for a fucking year, and you get a B+ from some asshole in The Village Voice?” Christgau rated the album C+ and wrote in his review, “I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right.” Similar angst came from band Sonic Youth in their song Kill Yr Idols (at the time known as &quot; I Killed Christgau With My Big Fucking Dick &quot; ), in which they sing &quot; I don&apos;t know why / You wanna impress Christgau / Ah let that shit die / And find out the new goal &quot;; Christgau responded by saying &quot; Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos--critics just want a little respect. So if it&apos;s not too hypersensitive of me, I wasn&apos;t flattered to hear my name pronounced right, not on this particular title track. &quot; { http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=sonic+youth } On July 1, 2010, Christgau announced in the introduction to his Consumer Guide column that the July 2010 installment would be his last on MSN. [ http://music.msn.com/music/consumerguide/ Inside Music MSN Microsoft Christgau Robert July 1, 2010 ] On November 22 of that year, Christgau launched a blog on MSN, &quot; Expert Witness &quot;, which would only feature reviews of albums that he had graded B+ or higher, since those albums &quot; are the gut and backbone of my musical pleasure; &quot; the writing of reviews for which are &quot; so rewarding psychologically that I&apos;m happy to do it at blogger&apos;s rates. &quot; [ http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post%3D258264de-2519-4d38-a469-ca4742b3bf29%26amp%3B_blg%3D3 This Blog--The Whats, Whys, and Wherefores Christgau Robert 22 November 2010 Expert Witness MSN 15 January 2011 ] [ Pazz &amp; amp; Jop ] In 1971, Christgau inaugurated the annual Pazz &amp; Jop music poll. The results are published in the Village Voice every February, and compile &quot; top ten &quot; lists submitted by music critics across the nation. Throughout Christgau&apos;s career at the Voice, every poll was accompanied by a lengthy Christgau essay analyzing the results, and pondering the year&apos;s overall musical output. The Voice has continued the feature, despite Christgau&apos;s dismissal, and although he no longer oversees the poll, Christgau continues to vote in it. { Christgau&apos;s 2010 ballot } [ Style and tastes ] Christgau names Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Chuck Berry, The Beatles, and The New York Dolls as his top five artists of all time.

Metal —I don&apos;t think metal&apos;s as bad as I hear it as being. ] In music critic circles, he was an early supporter of hip hop and the riot grrrl movements. In the 1980s, Christgau was a fervent booster of Afro-pop, a stance that alienated him from some in the critical community, as he seemed insufficiently interested in American and British rock music. In the 1990s, however, Christgau&apos;s interest in indie rock seemed to increase. Christgau readily admits to disliking the musical genres heavy metal, art rock, progressive rock, bluegrass, gospel, Irish folk, and jazz fusion, [ http://rockcriticsarchives.com/interviews/robertchristgau/01.html Online exchange with Robert Christgau Rubio Steven 2002 July Rockcritics Archives rockcritics.com As for my limitations, they&apos;re public and they&apos;re legion.

In December 1980, Christgau provoked angry responses from Voice readers when his column approvingly quoted his wife Carola Dibbell&apos;s reaction to the murder of John Lennon : &quot; Why is it always Bobby Kennedy or John Lennon? Why isn&apos;t it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney ? &quot; [ http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/lennon-80.php John Lennon, 1940-1980 March 15, 2008 Christgau Robert December 22, 1980 Robert Christgau: Dean of American Rock Critics ] Slate music critic Jody Rosen describes Christgau&apos;s writing as &quot; often maddening, always thought-provoking...
