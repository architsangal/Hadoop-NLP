With the rapid infusion of loggers, homesteaders, and sportsmen, Bovill and his wife Charlotte opened a hotel in 1907, which included a store and post office. The railroad arrived that same year and as logging activity increased nearby, the town became too wild for the couple and their two daughters, and they left in 1911 (Hugh died in 1935 in Oregon, Charlotte in 1947 in California). { &quot; Idaho for the Curious &quot;, by Cort Conley, ©1982, ISBN 0-9603566-3-0, p.56-57 } The Bovill Opera House, at 2nd and Pine, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.
