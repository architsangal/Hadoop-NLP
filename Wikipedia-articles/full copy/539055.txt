These vehicles for hire are typically smaller than buses and usually take passengers on a fixed or semi-fixed route without timetables, but instead departing when all seats are filled. They may stop anywhere to pick up or drop off passengers. Often found in developing countries, the vehicles used as share taxis range from four-seat cars to minibuses. { Robert Cervero, Fostering Commercial Transit: Alternatives in Greater Los Angeles, } { Reason Magazine, September 1992. } They are often owner operated. The UITP term &quot; informal transport &quot; includes share taxis. [ Operation ] Share taxis are always operated in a way that allows them to be defined as such. [ The terminus ] A given share taxi route may start and finish in fixed central locations, and landmarks may serve as route names or route termini. In some African cities routes are run between formal termini, where the majority [ March 2011 ] of passengers board. In these places the share taxis wait for a full load of passengers prior to departing, and off-peak wait times may be in excess of an hour. In other places there may be no formal termini, with taxis simply congregating at a central location, instead. Even more-formal terminals may be little more than parking lots. { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 24) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } [ Along the route ] Where they exist, share taxis provide service on set routes within and sometimes between towns. After a share taxi has picked up passengers at its terminus, it proceeds along a route, from which it does not deviate. Drivers will stop anywhere to allow riders to disembark, and may sometimes do the same when prospective passengers want to ride. [ Operational distinctions ] While all share taxis share certain characteristics—and many regional versions exhibit peculiarities—some basic operational distinctions can be delineated. [ Vehicle ownership ] Most share taxis are operated under one of two regimes. [ Company ] Some share taxis are operated by a company. [ March 2011 ] For example, in Dakar there are company-owned fleets of hundred of car rapides. [ Individual ] In Africa, while there are company share taxis, individual owners are more usual. Rarely owning more than two vehicles at a time, they will rent out a minibus to operators, who pay fuel and other running costs, and keep revenue. [ Syndicates ] In some African cities share taxi minibuses are overseen by syndicates, unions, or route associations. { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 9) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } These groups often function in the absence of a regulatory environment and may collect dues or fees from drivers { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 10) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } (such as per-use terminal payments ), set routes, manage terminals, and fix fares. Terminal management may include ensuring each vehicle leaves with a full load of passengers. { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page xiv) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } Because the syndicates represent owners, their regulatory efforts tend to favor operators rather than passengers, { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 11) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } and the very termini syndicates upkeep can cost delays and money for passengers as well as forcing them to disembark at inconvenient locations, in a phenomenon called &quot; terminal constraint &quot;. [ Regulation ] In Africa, regulation is mainly something that pertains to the vehicle itself not its operator { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page xv) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } or its mode of operation. [ March 2011 ] In Kenya, regulation does extend to operators and mode of operation (such as routes used) [ March 2011 ] as well as the vehicle As of 2008, African minibuses are difficult to tax, and may operate in a &quot; regulatory vacuum &quot; perhaps because their existence is not part of a government scheme, but is simply a market response to a growing demand for such services. { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 8) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } Route syndicates and operator&apos;s associations { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 17) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } often exercise unrestricted control, and existing rules may see little enforcement. [ Types of vehicle ] Share taxi is a unique mode of transport independent of vehicle type. Minibus es, midibus es, covered pickup truck s, station wagon s, and lorries see use as share taxis. Certain vehicle types may be better-suited to current condition than others. In many traffic-choked, sprawling, and low-density African cities minibuses profit. [ Traditional systems around the world ] While carrying different names and distinguished by regional peculiarities, the share taxi is an everyday feature of life in many places throughout the world. [ Black taxi (Northern Ireland) ] In some towns in Northern Ireland, notably certain districts in Ballymena, Belfast, Derry and Newry, share taxi services operate using Hackney carriage s. These services developed during The Troubles as public bus services were often interrupted due to street rioting. Taxi collectives are closely linked with political groups - those operating in Catholic areas with Sinn Féin, those in Protestant areas with loyalist paramilitaries and their political wings. Typically, fares approximate to those of Translink operated bus services on the same route. Service frequencies are typically higher than on bus services, especially at peak times, although limited capacities mean that passengers living close to the termini may find it difficult to find a black taxi with seats available in the rush hour. [ Bush taxi (West and Central Africa) ] A Toyota Corolla estate bush taxi. Three main vehicle types are used as bush taxis (French taxi brousse, Mandinka tanka tanka): the station wagon, the minibus, and the lorry. Many are previously owned vehicles imported from Europe or Japan; others are assembled from parts in regional centres such as Nigeria or Kenya. The original seating of the vehicles is usually stripped out in order to fit benches with more passenger space. In addition, more people generally sit on each bench than would be the case in more-developed countries. They are often in poor condition, though wealthier countries tend to have better-maintained vehicles. In the past, most station-wagon bush taxis were modified 1980s-model Peugeot 504 s. In some countries they are known as &quot; five-seaters &quot; or &quot; seven-seaters &quot; (French sept-place), but in fact, they may seat nine passengers or more in three rows of seats. Other models, such as the Peugeot 505 or the Toyota Corolla have since supplanted the 504 in some countries, and are gaining ground in others. The bush taxi, a type of public light bus frequently used in West-Africa Typically two passengers are seated on the front seat next to the driver, and four passengers in each of the two back rows. Sometimes, in particular on less-frequented routes, bush taxis are more crowded, and passengers might even sit on the roof or the boot. Bush taxis in wealthier countries tend to be less crowded. For example, in Nigeria bush taxis (of both the station wagon or minibus type) are called three-across or four-across according to the number of passengers seated in each row. The minibus (a van -like vehicle seating 12 to 20 passengers; French minicar) is quickly becoming the most common type of bush taxi in West and Central Africa, especially for longer trips. Due to the vehicles&apos; larger size, drivers often employ a helper who rides in the back of the vehicle and tells the driver when to stop to let people off, and helps load and unload baggage. Minibuses tend to travel slower than cars, and they take longer to fill up and to pass through police checkpoints. These vehicles generally charge more than standard buses but less than Peugeot-type bush taxis. Frequently used models in West-Africa are the Renault Goelette, the Saviem Super Goelette 2, and the Isuzu Kitamura [ June 2011 ] minibus. The Goelette is also used frequently in Vietnam and Madagascar as a share taxi. { African Goelette busexplorer.com } Lorries are also used as bush taxis (French bâché): they are normal lorries (trucks) with benches along the sides of the bed for passengers. There is often a cover for the bed as well. Lorries are more robustly made (and give a rougher ride) than purpose-built passenger vehicles; routes over worse roads and to more remote areas are often serviced by lorries. [ Carro Público ] Carros Públicos (literally &quot; Public Cars &quot; ) are share taxis in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. [ Dominican Republic ] In the Dominican Republic, these privately owned vehicles run fixed routes with no designated stops, and the ride is shared with other passengers. { Dominican Republic Transportation: Carro Publicos dr1.com } Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada advises against traveling in Dominican Republic carros públicos because doing so makes passengers targets for robbery, and because the taxis are known to, &quot; disregard traffic laws, often resulting in serious accidents involving injuries and sometimes death. &quot; { TRAVEL REPORT: Dominican Republic; 9. TRAVEL AND CURRENCY Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada Official Site. } The US Department of State also warns that using them is hazardous, as passengers often have their pockets picked, and are sometimes robbed by the drivers themselves. { Dominican Republic: Country Specific Information; Crime US Department of State Official Site } [ Puerto Rico ] In Puerto Rico, carros públicos ply set routes with several passengers sharing the ride { PUERTO RICO&apos;S QUIET EDGE nytimes.com, March 31, 1985 } and others picked up throughout the journey. { On becoming Nuyoricans Angela Anselmo, Alma Rubal-Lopez. Peter Lang, 2005. 172 pages. 0820455202, 9780820455204. (Google Books). } The industry is regulated by the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission. While these cars do travel inter-city, they may not be available for longer, cross-island travel. Stations may exist in cities, and Puerto Rican carros públicos may congregate in specific places around town. { Q &amp; A nytimes.com, February 21, 1988. } [ Coaster bus (Rwanda) ] Minibus public transports in Rwanda may be called coaster buses, { No more ‘twegerane’ in commuter Coaster buses newtimes.co.rw, Friday, March 11, 2011. } share taxis, or twegerane. The latter could easily be a word meaning &quot; stuffed &quot; or &quot; full &quot;. As of 2011 in Kigali, Rwanda, syndicates include ATRACO and ONATRACOM, but an independent transport authority is absent. [ Colectivo ] [ Colectivo ] Colectivos operated as share taxis from the late 1920s until the 1950s in Buenos Aires, Argentina when they were integrated into the public transportation system. Vehicles still known as colectivos operate throughout the country, but have long been indistinguishable from busses. { The design evolution of the colectivo. Article with much information and many photographs accessed 10 April 2010. } [ Dala dala (Tanzania) ] [ Dala-dala ] { Dar es Salaam } Minivan s (minibuses may be a more-correct term here) are used as vehicles for hire and referred to as dala dala in Tanzania. { Thoughts On Dala Dala Buses isteptanzania.wordpress.com, May 29, 2009. } While dala dala may run fixed routes picking up passengers at central locations, they will also stop along the route to drop someone off or allow a prospective passenger to board. Before minibuses became widely used, the typical dala dala was a pick-up truck with benches placed in the truck bed. { Travel Guide to Zanzibar zanzibar.org } In Dar es Salaam, publicly operated minibus service may also exist as of 2008. Usually run by both a driver and a conductor, the latter is called a mpigadebe. Literally meaning &quot; a person who hits a debe &quot; (a 4 gallon tin container used for transporting gasoline or water), the name is in reference to the fact that conductors are often hitting the roof and side of the van to attract customers and notify the driver when to leave the station. [ Syndicates ] These often-crowded public transports have their routes allocated by a Tanzania transport regulator, Surface and MarineTransport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page xii) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } but syndicates also exist and include DARCOBOA. [ Danfo (Nigeria) ] In Nigeria, both minibuses (called danfo ) and midibus es (molue) may be operated as share taxis. Such public transports may also be referred to as bolekaja, and many may bear slogan s or saying s. As Lagos, Nigeria, has a transport-dedicated regulator, Lagos MetropolitanArea Transport Agency (LAMATA), { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (page 14) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } its remit most probably includes share taxi activity. [ March 2011 ] Syndicates in Lagos may include NURTW. [ Dolmuş (Turkey, Turkish-controlled Cyprus) ] { Bodrum, Turkey } In Turkey and Turkish controlled Northern Cyprus dolmuş (pronounced &quot; dolmush &quot; ) are share taxis that run on set routes within and between cities. { Turkish Dolmus Taxi or Minibus turkeytravelplanner.com } Each of these cars or minibuses displays their particular route on signboards behind the windscreen. Some cities may only allow dolmuş to pick-up and disembark passengers at designated stops, and terminals also exist. The word derives from Turkish for &quot; full &quot; or &quot; stuffed &quot;, as these share taxis depart from the terminal only when a sufficient amount of passengers have boarded. { Bus Services in North Cyprus essentialcyprus.com, January 28, 2009. } Westerners may be surprised by the speed of dolmuş travel. { Dolmuş story hurriyetdailynews.com, Tuesday, January 19, 2010. } These share taxis are also found in Turkish-controlled, Northern Cyprus under the same name. Traveling intra and inter-city, the privately owned minibuses or aging Mercedes stretch limo s are overseen by a governance institution; routes are leased and vehicles licensed. Passengers board anywhere along the route (you may have to get the driver to stop if he doesn&apos;t honk at you) as well as at termini and official stations. Dolmuş in Turkish-controlled, Northern Cyprus display their routes but don&apos;t follow timetables. Instead, they simply appear frequently. [ Fula fula (Democratic Republic of the Congo) ] Those in Kinshasa, DRC, (or perhaps just the Kongo people, instead) may call share taxis fula fula meaning &quot; quick quick &quot;. There was no independent transport authority in this city as of 2008. [ Gbaka (Côte d&apos;Ivoire) ] In Côte d&apos;Ivoire, gbaka are a name for minibus public transports. The transport regulator in Abidjan, CI, is Agence de Gestion des Transports Urbains or AGETU. As of 2008, Abidjan public transport was serviced by large buses as well as minibuses. { Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa 9page xiii) Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report. } Syndicates include UPETCA, SNTMVCI. [ Jeepney (Philippines) ] A typical jeepney [ Jeepney ] The most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines as of 2007, jeepneys were originally made out of US military jeep s left over from World War II [ Otsuka Keijiro Masao Kikuchi, Yujiro Hayami 1986 January Community and Market in Contract Choice: The Jeepney in the Philippines Economic Development and Cultural Change 34 2 279–298 2008-02-27 10.1086/451528 0013-0079 1153851 ] and are known for their color and flamboyant decoration. Today the Jeepneys are built by local body shops from a combination of prefabricated elements (from a handful Filipino manufacturers) and improvisation and in most cases equipped with &quot; surplus &quot; or used Japanese SUV or light truck engines, drive train, suspension and steering components (from recycled vehicles in Japan). In contrast to their African share taxi brethren, jeepneys are often conversion vehicles, as Filipinos are not content to extemporaneously place a picture of a deity, mortal or no, on a bondo -splattered minibus and then pack it with passengers. They have not changed much since their post-war creation { Toughest place to be a Bus Driver (Part 6 of 6) &quot; 0:45/9:23 &quot; youtube.com. BBC. First broadcast Sun 20 Feb 2011. } even in the face of an increased access to pre-made vehicles, such as minibuses. Jeepneys have the entrance on the back, and there is space for 2 people beside the driver (or more if they&apos;re small). The back of the Jeepney is equipped with two long bench seats along the sides and the people seated closest to the driver are responsible for passing the fare of new passengers forward to the driver and the change back to the passenger. The start and end point of the Jeepney route is often a Jeepney terminal, where there&apos;s a queue system so only one Jeepney plying a particular route is filled at a time, and where a person helps the driver to collect fares and fill the vehicles with people, usually to more than comfortable capacity. Preferring to only leave when full and only stop for a crowd of potential passengers, { Philippines (page 454) Chris Rowthorn, Greg Bloom.

(Google Books) } [ Jitney (US and Canada) ] [ Dollar Van ] A jitney is a North American English term that originally referred to a vehicle for hire intermediate between a taxi and a bus. [ Page, Walter Hines 1915 Page, Arthur Wilson April The March Of Events: The Jitney The World&apos;s Work: A History of Our Time XXIX 618 http://books.google.com/?id%3Dl_2rn8M7DSsC%26amp%3Bpg%3DRA1-PA618 2009-08-04 ] They are generally small-capacity vehicles that follow a rough service route, but can go slightly out of its way to pick up and drop off passengers. In many US cities (e.g. Pittsburgh and Detroit), the term jitney refers to an unlicensed taxi cab. The name comes from an archaic, colloquial term for a five-cent piece in the US (the nickel ). The common fare for the service when it first came into use was five cents, so the &quot; five-cent cab &quot; or &quot; jitney cab &quot; came to be known for the price charged. In Rhode Island a jitney license plate is used for all public passenger buses, even for larger ones. { Atlantic City, United States in 2008 } While jitneys became fairly common in many other countries, such as the Philippines, they first appeared in the US and Canada. The first US jitneys ran in Los Angeles, California in 1914. By 1915, there were 62,000 nationwide. Local regulations, demanded by streetcar companies, killed the jitney in most places. By the end of 1916, only 6,000 jitneys remained. { 724795 } { 10.1086/466738 } Similarly, in Vancouver, Canada, in the 1920s, jitneys competed directly with the streetcar monopoly operating along the same routes as the streetcars, but jitneys were charging lower fares. { &apos;&apos;Report of Dr. Adam Shortt, commissioner investigating the economic conditions and operations of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company and subsidiary companies, and to decide definitely as to the possibility of street car service being maintained in competition with the jitneys&apos;&apos;, publ. BC Electric Railway Company Limited, Vancouver, 1917 } Operators were referred to as &quot; jitney men. &quot; They were so successful that the city government banned them at the request of the streetcar operators. Since the 1973 oil crisis (as well as the mid-20th-century decline in transit service), jitneys have reappeared in some areas of the US, particularly in inner city areas once served by streetcars and private buses. An increase in bus fares usually leads to a significant rise in jitney usage. Liberalization of jitneys is often encouraged by libertarian urban economists, such as University of Chicago &apos;s Richard Epstein, Rutgers &apos; James Dunn [ June 2011 ], and USC &apos;s Peter Gordon [ June 2011 ], as a more &quot; market-friendly &quot; alternative to public transportation. Concerns over fares, insurance liabilities, and passenger safety have kept legislative support for jitneys decidedly tepid. Nevertheless, in New York City and northern New Jersey, jitneys (known as &quot; dollar van s &quot; because of their original price (compare earlier &quot; jitney &quot; ) or guagua s in Spanish) are regulated and remain popular especially outside of Manhattan. Miami has the country&apos;s most comprehensive jitney network, due to Caribbean influence. In Atlantic City the ACJA operates a jitney service that travels the main strip of casinos. One of the routes also services the new cluster of casinos west of Atlantic City proper. [ Kia kia (Yorùbáland) ] The term kia kia may be used in Yorùbáland to refer to minibus public transports, and means &quot; quick quick &quot;. [ Liinitakso (Estonia) ] Share taxis in Estonia are mostly found in Tallinn, the capital. [ March 2011 ] Called liinitakso, marsruuttakso, taksobuss or mikroautobuss depending on the language spoken, these minibuses run fixed routes and allow passengers to disembark at any time. { Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania Carolyn Bain.

Riders nearer the driver are responsible for handing up the other passengers&apos; fares and passing back change. { Marshrutka moscow.info } [ Mashrū` (Egypt) ] Egypt ian share cabs are generally known as masharī`, ( [ ar مشريع ] (singular mashrū` [ ar مشروع ] ) meaning literally &quot; project &quot; or &quot; planned &quot;; the name may be a phono-semantic match from marshrutka, particularly given Egypt&apos;s Cold War ties to the Soviet Union. Masharī` are licensed by each governorate as taxicabs, and are generally operated privately by their drivers. Although each governorate attempts to maintain a consistent paint scheme for them, in practice the color of masharī` varies wildly, as the &quot; consistent &quot; schemes have changed from time to time and many drivers have not bothered to repaint their cars. Rates vary depending on distance traveled, although these rates are generally well known to those riding the mashrū`. The fares also depend on the city. Riders can typically hail masharī` from any point along the route, often with well-established hand signals indicating the prospective rider&apos;s destination, although certain areas tend to be well-known mashrū` stops. Like the Eastern European marshrutka, a typical mashrū` is a large van, most often a Toyota HiAce or its Jinbei equivalent, the Haise, and the latter is produced by the Bavarian Auto Manufacturing Group in 6th of October City in Egypt. Smaller vans and larger small buses are also used. [ Maršrutinis taksi (Lithuania) ] In Lithuania, share taxis are called maršrutinis taksi, mikruškė, mikriukas or maršrutinis.

In Kampala the informal vehicles are called taxis or &apos;boda boda&apos;. [ Minibus taxi (Ethiopia) ] Minibus taxis in Ethiopia are one of the most important modes of transport in big cities like Addis Ababa. They are preferred by the majority of the populace over public buses and more-traditional taxicabs because they are generally cheap, operate on diverse routes, and are available in abundance. All minibus taxis in Ethiopia have a standard blue-and-white coloring scheme, much like the yellow color of New York taxi s except it isn&apos;t yellow. Minibus taxis are usually Toyota Hiace s, frequent the streets. They typically can carry 11 passengers, but will always have room for another until that is no longer the case. The minibus driver has a crew member called a weyala, and his job is to collect the fare from passengers. In 2008, publicly operated public transport was available in Addis Ababa in addition to that provided by the minibuses. A fleet of 350 large buses may operate for this purpose, [ March 2011 ] as such a number does exist. Also as of 2008, the city lacks an independent transport authority, but some regulation, such as that controlling market entry, does exist. Route syndicates may be a presence but are described as &quot; various &quot;. [ Minibus taxi (South Africa) ] Cape Town minibus taxi rank [ Taxi wars in South Africa ] Over 60% of South African commuters use shared minibus taxis (16 seater commuter buses). Many of these vehicles are unsafe and not roadworthy, and often dangerously overloaded. [ November 2011 ] Prior to 1987, the taxi industry in South Africa was highly regulated and controlled. [ November 2011 ] Black taxi operators were declined permits in the Apartheid era and all minibus taxi operations were, by their very nature, illegal. Post 1987, the industry was rapidly deregulated, leading to an influx of new minibus taxi operators, keen to make money off the high demand for this service. Taxi operators banded together to form local and national associations. Because the industry was largely unregulated and the official regulating bodies corrupt [ November 2011 ], these associations soon engaged in anti-competitive price fixing and exhibited gangster tactics - including the hiring of hit-men and all-out gang warfare. [ November 2011 ] During the height of the conflict, it was not uncommon for taxi drivers to carry shotguns and AK-47&apos;s to simply shoot rival taxi drivers and their passengers on sight. [ June 2008 ] Currently the South African Government is attempting to formalize and re-regulate the out-of-control minibus taxi industry. Along with new legislation, the government has instituted a 7-year recapitalization scheme to replace the old and unroadworthy vehicles with new 18 and 35-seater minibuses. These new minibus taxis carry the South African flag on the side and are notably more spacious and safe. [ Public light bus (Hong Kong) ] { public light bus (left) and a } { double-decker bus (right) in } { Hong Kong. } [ Public light bus ] Public light buses ( [ 公共小型巴士 ] ), also known as minibus or maxicab ( [ 小巴 ] ), run the length and breadth of Hong Kong, through areas which the standard bus lines cannot or do not reach as frequently, quickly or directly. Typically offering a faster and more efficient transportation solution due to their small size, limited carrying capacity, frequency and diverse range of routes, although they are generally slightly more expensive than standard buses, minibuses carry a maximum of 16 seated passengers. Standing passengers are not allowed. There are two types of public light minibus, green and red. Both types have a cream coloured body, the distinguishing feature being the colour of the external roof, and the type of service that the colour denotes: green for continuous service (regardless of number of passengers) and generally salaried drivers; red is more like a shared taxi, with the driver waiting for enough passengers to justify leaving, as his income depends on the revenue.

(Google Books) } [ Shared taxi and shared jeep (India) ] Shared taxis–and they are known by that exact name–have been operating in Mumbai, India, since the early 1970s. These are more like a point-to-point service that operates only during the peak hours than other share taxis. During off-peak hours, they ply just like the regular taxis; they can be hailed anywhere on the roads, and passengers are charged by the meter. But during peak hours several of them will operate as shared taxis, taking a full cab load of passengers to a more or less common destination. The pick-up points for these taxis are fixed, and are marked by a sign saying &quot; shared taxis &quot; and the cabs will line up at this point during peak hours. They display the general destination they are headed for on their windscreens, and passengers just get in and wait for the cab to fill up. As soon as this happens–which takes less than a few minutes–the cab moves off. Fares are a fixed amount and are far lower than the metered fare to the same destination but higher than a bus or train fare. Quicker than buses, these taxis are also popular for their greater comfort and the absence of the crush people that typifies rush hour commuter traffic in buses and trains. Share jeeps are a common form of transportation in the Himalayas, the North Eastern States and elsewhere. { http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC &amp; pg=PA521 } [ Sherut (Israel) ] Sherut (pl. moniot sherut) is a Hebrew word meaning &quot; service &quot;.

Frommer&apos;s, 2010. 544 pages. 0470618205, 9780470618202. } that serve as share taxis in Israel, these can be picked up from sherut stations. They follow fixed routes (sometimes the same routes as public transport buses ), leave when full, { GUIDE TO 13 MAJOR WAY STATIONS nytimes.com, March 4, 1984. } and will only disembark passengers along the route. { Taxi &amp; &quot; Sherut &quot; Service in Israel tourplanisrael.com } Moniyot sherut operate both inter { INTERNATIONAL ISSUE; Going Abroad Without Going Broke nytimes.com, March 11, 1990. } and intra-city. Payment is done by passing money to the driver in a &quot; human chain &quot; formed by the passengers seated before. The change (and the receipt, when requested) are returned to the person who paid by the same means. When most or some seats are vacant, the driver usually travels slower and honks the horn to attract the attention of potential passengers on the sidewalk. In intra-city routes, where they compete with official buses, the drivers usually coordinate their travel by radio so that they can arrive at the bus station just before public transport buses and take the most passengers. Called &quot; ser-vees &quot; (service taxi) by Palestinians, in the West Bank vans are replaced by minibuses, aging Mercedes sedans, { Israel and the Palestinian Territories (page 431) Amelia Thomas, Michael Kohn, Miriam Raphael, Dan Savery Raz.

The most common case is a connection between an airport and central city locations. These services are often known as shuttles. Such services usually use smaller vehicles than normal buses, and often operate on demand. An air traveller can contact the shuttle company by telephone or Internet, not necessarily in advance; the company will ensure that a shuttle is provided without unreasonable delay. The shuttle will typically connect one airport with several large hotels, or addresses in a specified area of the city. The shuttle offers much of the convenience of a taxi, although taking longer, at a price which is significantly lower for one or two passengers. Scheduled services between an airport and a hotel, usually operated by the hotel, are also called shuttles. In many cases the shuttle operator takes the risk of there not being enough passengers to make the trip profitable; in others there is a minimum charge when there are not enough passengers. { http://www.queenstown.net.nz/index.php?title=Airport_Transfers } Usually there are regulations covering vehicles and drivers; for example in New Zealand under NZTA regulations, shuttles are only allowed to have up to eleven passenger seats, and the driver must have a passenger endorsement (P) on their drivers licence.

In many rural areas, they are the only public transportation. In some cases truck/taxi combination vehicles have evolved to transport light goods as well as passengers. Heavily used share taxi routes often evolve into regulated microbus public transit routes, as has occurred in Mexico City and in Lima. Taxis colectivos are also found in Perú, Chile, Guatemala, and Argentina, where they are most commonly referred to simply as colectivos, although in some places they have become essentially standard buses. [ Treintaxi (Netherlands) ] Besides the conventional deeltaxi, there are treintaxis in most major Dutch towns. Operated on behalf of the Netherlands Railways, [ February 2011 ] they run to and from railway stations and the ride is shared with additional passengers picked up along the way.

Traditionally these services had to be booked a day in advance, but are becoming increasingly responsive using modern communications systems with a central booking system accessed by phone or internet and instant communications with GPS tracked vehicles. Unlike scheduled services the vehicles need not operate on fixed routes of timetables, although they do often have constrained routes. [ Commercial shared taxis booking services ] Some newer taxi share systems now use internet and mobile phone communications for booking and scheduling purposes, with the actual service provided by normal hackney carriage or Private Hire vehicles. Prospective passengers make bookings and supply destination details using SMS to a central server which aggregates these travel requests and creates packages of trips which are then communicated to drivers. [ Commercially operated airport shuttle buses ] There are many operators of airport shuttle services between Airports and Hotels around the world that operate on flexible routing and timing to offer a service that is both cheaper than a sole-occupancy taxi and also often more convenient that other forms of public transport. The requirement to carry luggage offers an added incentive to use such services over scheduled transport which will normally require a walk from the drop-off location to the final destination. Services from these operators are starting to spread from airports to railway stations and to other locations.
