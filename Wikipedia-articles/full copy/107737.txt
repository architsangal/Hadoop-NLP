(Listen to a clip of &quot; Mill Valley &quot;.) [ Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary ] The site of the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary on Strawberry Point was considered for the headquarters for the United Nations. This was because in the forties when the UN was established in San Francisco, Strawberry was undeveloped. It was seen as a tranquil and peaceful setting. New York City was eventually chosen. { Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, accessed 10/18/06 } [ Government ] Strawberry is unincorporated, receiving most of its general government services from Marin County. It is in the 3rd Supervisorial District and, [ 2007 on ], is represented by Supervisor Charles McGlashan. { Marin County Supervisorial District 3 } Some residents have been struggling for years to become an incorporated part of Tiburon, not Mill Valley. However, any vote that comes up before the residents is voted down. [ May 2007 ] The Strawberry Recreation District provides limited services in the area, including recreation facilities and management of garbage and recycling collection. It has an elected board of five directors. District boundaries do not exactly match those of the CDP. Strawberry is in the Southern Marin Fire Protection District, which also serves Tamalpais Valley, Homestead Valley, Almonte, Alto, part of the Town of Tiburon, and, since 2004, the City of Sausalito. Prior to the creation of the District in 1999, Strawberry was in the Alto-Richardson Fire Protection District. { Southern Marin Fire Protection District, &apos;&apos;About the District&apos;&apos;, accessed May 26, 2007 } Strawberry shares a zip code (94941) with Mill Valley (hence, addresses in Strawberry are listed as &quot; Mill Valley &quot; ) and falls within its school districts. However, it is considered within the sphere of influence of the Town of Tiburon, and there have been several unsuccessful ballot measures to incorporate into Tiburon.
