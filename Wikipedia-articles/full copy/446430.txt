The species of this genus are known as pike and pickerel, and in heraldry they are usually called lucy. [ Woodward John 1892 http://openlibrary.org/details/treatiseonherald02wooduoft A treatise on heraldry, British and foreign Edinburgh: W. &amp; A.K. Johnston 694 02020303 ] The big pike species are native to the Palearctic and Nearctic ecozone s, ranging across northern North America and from Western Europe to Siberia in Eurasia. They have been found in many urban lakes in Western Europe, reported to be in the Rostrum ( Lucerne ) and the Serpentine, ( London ). Pike can grow to a maximum recorded length of [ 1.83 m ], reaching a maximum recorded weight of [ 35 kg ]. The UK record pike of [ 21 kg ] was caught on a Creek Chub Pikie lure by Roy Lewis at Llandegfedd Reservoir in Wales in 1992. { Record pike } Individuals have been reported to reach 30 years in age. All pike over [ 5 kg ] in body weight are females. They have the elongated, torpedo-like form of predatory fishes, with sharply-pointed heads and sharp teeth. Their coloration is typically grey-green with a mottled or spotted appearance with stripes along their back, perfectly camouflaged among weeds. Individual pike marking patterns are unique, like fingerprints. [ Species ] There are currently six recognized species in this genus: [ Esox February 2012 ] Esox americanus americanus J. F.

(1999): The First Esox (Esocidae: Teleostei) from the Eocene Green River Formation, and a Brief Review of Esocid Fishes.

Pliny uses the Latin form esox in reference to a large fish in the Rhine normally identified with lax (salmon). It is likely that Carolus Linnaeus&apos;s application of Esox to the pike is thus a misnomer. { E. lucius &apos;&apos; specimen—a &quot; pickerel &quot; in the original sense—in an } { aquarium. } The English common name &quot; pike &quot; is an apparent shortening of &quot; pike-fish &quot;, in reference to its pointed head, Old English píc originally referring to a pickaxe. The plural of pike is pike. A northern English and Lowland Scots name for the pike, ged, similarly derives from Old Norse gaddr (spike) (cf. the modern Swedish name for the pike, gädda, the Danish &quot; gedde &quot;, the Norwegian &quot; gjedde &quot; and Scottish Gaelic : geadais). The Dutch name for the pike (snoek) has been given to a wide variety of fish reminding sailors of the pike (see snoek, snook ). The English &quot; pike &quot; originally referred specifically to the adult fish, the diminutive form &quot; pickerel &quot; (now used to name some of the smaller pike, E. americanus and E. niger ) referring to the young. The walleye (Sander vitreus) is sometimes called a pickerel by Gerard, but it is unrelated to the pike, being a member of the perch family (family Percidae ). Pike are not to be confused with the unrelated pikeminnows (traditionally, and perhaps better, known as squawfish ) of genus Ptychocheilus (family Cyprinidae ) or pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) which is more akin to walleye than to pike. Pike are also called &quot; Jackfish &quot; in North America and informally &quot; Slough Shark &quot; in Western Canada. [ Diet ] { Haus des Meeres, } { Vienna } Pike feed on a wide range of food sources, predominantly smaller shoal fish. Pike are also cannibalistic, sometimes preying upon smaller members of their own species. They will also prey on insect s and amphibian s such as newt s or frog s in times when their usual food is scarce, and occasionally on small mammal s like moles or mice when caught water-borne. Small birds such as duckling s may become a target for hungry pike. Pike are also known to prey on swimming snake s. They are, however, undeserving of their reputation for being overly vicious predators. There are few substantiated incidents of pike &apos;attacks&apos; on people. Pike&apos;s further reputation as a pest seems to lie predominately amongst anglers who seek more desirable species. [ Angling ] { River Shannon, } { Ireland } A caught pike Effective methods for catching this hard-fighting fish include dead baits, live baits, and lure fishing. Pike can easily be damaged when handled since they are not as robust as their reputation would suggest. Colour of lure can be influenced by water clarity and weather conditions. Since pike have numerous sharp teeth it is wise to take extreme care when unhooking them. The use of a wet leather gauntlet and surgical forceps to remove hooks is highly recommended on safety grounds. If practising catch and release fishing, care for the pike should be the pike angler&apos;s utmost concern. The formerly recommended practice of grasping a pike by its eye sockets (tragically interpreted as &quot; its eyes &quot; ) resulted in countless released pike that quickly died from inability to see prey any longer. The current recommended method of grasping pike is to close the hand firmly over the gill covers, and to make the period of handling as short as possible before release. Grabbing a pike by the gill covers is not feasible when a pike is very big, but it is easy to handle a pike by inserting the fingers at the bottom of the gill opening and grabbing the lower jaw. Big pike should also be supported at the belly. When a pike is held this way it is also easier to keep the mouth open to remove a hook. Many anglers now use special grips to grab the pike&apos;s front lower jaw, which can add to the safety of an anglers because of the danger imposed by the hooks of the lure or tackle and the pike&apos;s teeth. The Pike Anglers Club was formed in 1977 to campaign for the preservation of pike and the sport of pike fishing. A practice known as gut hooking was previously widely used in catching pike. Upon taking the bait, the pike will hold it for a short time in its mouth as it moves off. The pike will then, usually, turn the bait in its mouth, so that it sits in alignment with its throat to ease swallowing. It is recommended that when pike fishing the process is not allowed to go this far and a strike is recommended as soon as a bite is indicated. For this it is necessary to attach hooks on the head side as well as the middle of the baitfish. Otherwise, what is known as gut hooking will result, which will normally kill or seriously injure the fish. Dutch research shows that cutting the line immediately when the fish is gut hooked will still give low mortality (14%). The hooks in the gut or stomach were either encapsulated or removed from the body. { http://www.hsvdekleuter.nl/documents/snoek-kennis.pdf } Other methods of catching and handing pike that are now frowned upon are the gaff and the gag. The gaff is a metal hook on the end of a pole used to hook through the fish&apos;s body in place of a more humane landing net. A gag is a device for holding open the pike&apos;s mouth whilst unhooking. These are now illegal in Scotland, as they put a huge amount of pressure on a pike&apos;s jaw, thus causing irreparable damage. Catching a 10  kg pike, kymppihauki (Finnish for &quot; ten pike &quot; ), is considered as &quot; earning one&apos;s spurs &quot; as a fisherman in Finland. [ In mythology and literature ] Fossil &apos;&apos;Esox&apos;&apos; In the Finnish Kalevala, Väinämöinen creates a kantele (string instrument) from the jawbone of the pike. Russian mythology holds that the pike is one of several forms assumed by evil water spirits called vodyanoy, and a ravenous mythical pike is traditionally blamed for decimating the fish population in the Sheksna River. Russian fairy tales, on the other hand, also tell about an old wise pike that can fulfil wishes of the one who catches it, if its catcher releases it back into its habitat. [ September 2011 ] In the beginning of Boris and Arkady Strugatsky &apos;s book, Monday Begins on Saturday, a wise centuries-old pike appears in the story when main character Sasha arrives at Baba Yaga &apos;s house in Solovets. In the 10th episode of Monarch of the Glen series 3, Hector MacDonald fights a pike that has infiltrated his loch and has eaten all the fish. In the book Redwall, Cluny the Scourge has only one eye, the other having been lost to a pike who was then killed by Cluny. [ Submarines and tanks ] The name of the Soviet Shchuka class submarine s, active during the Second World War, is derived from &quot; Shchuka &quot; - Russian for &quot; pike &quot;. Two United States Navy submarine s have been named Pike, SS-6 of 1903 and SS-173 of 1935, and three, SS-22 of 1912, SS-177 of 1936, and SS-524 of 1944, named Pickerel. In addition, the Soviet submarines known to NATO as the Victor III class were called the Shchuka (Щука, &quot; pike &quot; ) class, in Russian. The Soviet Iosif Stalin tank (IS-3) was also nicknamed Shchuka, in reference to its sharply pointed hull front. [ Heraldry ] In heraldry, the pike is called a lucy. [ Fox-Davies Arthur Charles 1909 http://openlibrary.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxdrich A Complete Guide to Heraldry London: T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack 255 09023803 ] It is usually blazon ed either naiant (swimming), embowed (bowed) or hauriant (jumping), though pairs of lucies may appear addorsed (back to back), as in the arms of the Finnish town of Uusikaupunki, Finland. (Argent, two lucies addorsed azure). [ May 2009 ] Uusikaupunki coat of arms Gimte, in Lower Saxony, Germany.
