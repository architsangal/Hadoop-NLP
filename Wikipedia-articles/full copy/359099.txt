According to Roth (2010), &quot; He was a figurehead who led various economic commissions, lobbied the Soviets for increased aid, and conducted foreign policy tours in the attempt to break the country&apos;s diplomatic isolation. &quot; At critical moments in East Germany he was passive and never took sides in the internal battles of the SED (Communist) party. [ Career ] Grotewohl was born in the city of Braunschweig and after World War I started his political career as a leader of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and minister in the Free State of Brunswick. In 1922 Grotewohl with the majority of the USPD members joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and from 1925 was a member of the Reichstag parliament. Dismissed after the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933 he was imprisoned several times. 21 April 1946: Pieck (left) and Grotewohl sealing the unification, Ulbricht in the foreground After World War II he became a leader of the SPD in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany and, fiercely opposed by chairman Kurt Schumacher, led his party into a merger with the Communist Party under Wilhelm Pieck.
