Construction began in August 2002 and the exterior completed on 1 June 2006. The plaza was finished in June 2006 and the building was officially opened on 11 October 2006. The project was designed by Melbourne architectural firm Fender Katsalidis Architects and was built by Grocon (Grollo Australia). The developer of the tower was Eureka Tower Pty Ltd, a joint venture consisting of Daniel Grollo (Grocon), investor Tab Fried and one of the Tower&apos;s architects Nonda Katsalidis. It was the world&apos;s tallest residential tower when measured to its highest floor, until surpassed by Ocean Heights and the HHHR Tower in Dubai. It is now the 9th tallest residential building in the world [ http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/List/tallest-residential-100-buildings 100 Tallest Residential Buildings in the World Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat 3 May 2012 ]. [ Design and features ] Eureka Tower is named after the Eureka Stockade, a rebellion during the Victorian gold rush in 1854. This has been incorporated into the design, with the building&apos;s gold crown representing the gold rush and a red stripe representing the blood spilt during the revolt. The blue glass cladding that covers most of the building represents the blue background of the stockade&apos;s flag and the white lines also represent the eureka stockade flag. The white horizontal stripes also represent markings on a surveyor&apos;s measuring staff [ September 2011 ] When measured either by the height of its roof, or by the height of its highest habitable floor, Eureka Tower was the tallest residential building in the world when completed. It is also currently the building with the most floors available for residential occupancy in the world. The building stands 297 metres in height, with 91 storeys above ground plus one basement level. It is one of only seven buildings in the world with 90 or more storeys and is the equal 77th tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest building in Australia and the tallest building in Melbourne. The single level basement and first 9 floors contain car park ing. The building&apos;s proximity to the water table as well as the Yarra River made the construction of a basement car park uneconomical. There are a total of 84 floors of apartments (including some floors shared between car parking and apartments) with the remainder being used for building facilities and the observation deck. According to the ranking system developed by the U.S.-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the Eureka Tower qualifies as the tallest building in three of the four categories in which heights are ranked, namely height to the floor of the highest occupied floor of the building. For comparison, the Q1 apartment tower on the Gold Coast has its highest habitable floor the observation deck, reaching a height of [ 235 m ft 0 on ], some [ 62 m ft 0 on ] lower than Eureka Tower&apos;s highest habitable floor. Q1&apos;s highest penthouse apartment is [ 217 m ft 0 on ] whilst Eureka&apos;s penthouse is [ 278 m ft 0 on ] high. However, the spire attached to the top of Q1 exceeds the Eureka Tower in the other two categories, namely &quot; Height to the tip of spire, pinnacle, antenna, mast or flag pole &quot; – in this case, spire – and height to architectural top of the building.

The Skydeck features thirty viewfinders that help visitors to pinpoint numerous significant landmarks around all parts of Melbourne, along with several free binoculars.

There is also a glass cube called &apos;The Edge&apos;, which extends itself from the building to hang over the edge of the tower and add to the viewing experience. On 10 January 2005, Grocon, the firm building Eureka Tower, proposed adding a [ 53.8 m ft 1 on ] communications mast/observation tower. The proposal is currently before the local planning commission. This mast would be a significant structure, used for providing an adventure climb to the tip of the summit. On 16 April 2006, a new proposal was announced that the construction company and developers were considering options for the building to have a &quot; skywalk &quot; that would take daring people up 350 metres high. The proposed structure may also include a communications tower. [ The Edge ] Skydeck 88 features &apos;The Edge&apos; – a glass cube which projects [ 3 m ft 0 on ] out from the building with visitors inside, suspended almost [ 300 m ft 0 on ] above the ground.
