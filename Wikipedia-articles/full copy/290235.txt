[ Seven Sisters (disambiguation) ] The &quot; Seven Sisters &quot; was a term coined in the 1950s by businessman Enrico Mattei, then-head of the Italian state oil company Eni, to describe the seven oil companies which formed the &quot; Consortium for Iran &quot; cartel and dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. { The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals, by Carola Hoyos, Financial Times. 11 March 2007 } [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C946053-1%2C00.html Business: The Seven Sisters Still Rule 24 October 2010 Time 11 September 1978 ] The group comprised Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now BP ); Gulf Oil, Standard Oil of California (Socal) and Texaco (now Chevron ); Royal Dutch Shell; and Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) and Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony) (now ExxonMobil ). Prior to the oil crisis of 1973, the members of the Seven Sisters controlled around 85% of the world&apos;s petroleum reserves, but in recent decades the dominance of the companies and their successors has declined as a result of the increasing influence of the OPEC cartel and state-owned oil companies in emerging-market economies.

In an effort to bring Iranian oil production back to international markets, the U.S. State Department suggested the creation of a &quot; Consortium &quot; of major oil companies. { Stefano Beltrame (2009): Mossadeq. L&apos;Iran, il petrolio, gli Stati Uniti e le radici della Rivoluzione Islamica } The &quot; Consortium for Iran &quot; was subsequently formed by the following companies: Anglo-Persian Oil Company (United Kingdom). This subsequently became Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and then British Petroleum. Following the acquisition of Amoco (which in turn was formerly Standard Oil of Indiana) and Atlantic Richfield it shortened its name to BP in 2000. Gulf Oil (United States) In 1985 most of Gulf was acquired by Chevron, with smaller parts acquired by BP and Cumberland Farms. A network of service stations in the northeastern United States still bears the Gulf name. Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands/United Kingdom) Standard Oil of California (Socal) (United States) This subsequently became Chevron. Standard Oil of New Jersey ( Esso ) (United States) This subsequently became Exxon, which renamed itself ExxonMobil following the acquisition of Mobil in 1999. Standard Oil Co. of New York (Socony) (United States) This subsequently became Mobil, which was acquired by Exxon in 1999. Texaco (United States). This was acquired by Chevron in 2001. The head of the Italian state oil company, Enrico Mattei sought membership for the Italian oil company Eni, but was rejected by what he dubbed the &quot; Seven Sisters &quot; - the Anglo-Saxon companies which largely controlled the Middle East’s oil production after World War II. { Italy: Two-Timing the Seven Sisters, Time Magazine, June 14, 1963 } British writer Anthony Sampson took over the term when he wrote the book The Seven Sisters in 1975, to describe the shadowy oil cartel, which tried to eliminate competitors and control the world’s oil resource. { The Four Horsemen Behind America&apos;s Oil Wars, by } { Dean Henderson, Global Research, April 26, 2011 } Being well-organized and able to negotiate as a cartel, the Seven Sisters were initially able to exert considerable power over Third World oil producers. However, in recent decades the dominance of the Seven Sisters and their successor companies has been challenged by the following trends: the increasing influence of the OPEC cartel (formed in 1960), a declining share of world oil &amp; gas reserves held by OECD countries and the emergence of powerful state-owned oil companies in emerging-market economies. As of 2010, the surviving companies from the Seven Sisters are BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, which form four members of the &quot; supermajor s &quot; group. [ The &quot; New Seven Sisters &quot; ] The Financial Times has used the label the &quot; New Seven Sisters &quot; to describe a group of what it argues are the most influential national oil and gas companies based in countries outside of the OECD.
