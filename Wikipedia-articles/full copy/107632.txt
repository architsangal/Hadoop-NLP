The population was 58,829 at the 2010 census, up from 57,746 at the 2000 census. [ Geography ] Gardena is located at [ 33 53 37 N 118 18 28 W type:city ] (33.893615, -118.307841). [ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 5.9 sqmi km2 ], over 99% of which is land. Gardena is bordered by Athens on the north, the Los Angeles neighborhood of Harbor Gateway on the east and south, Torrance on the southwest, Alondra Park on the west, and Hawthorne on the northwest. [ History ] Based on archaeological findings, Tongva Indians hunted and fished in the area of today&apos;s Gardena. [ Gardena Heritage Committee Gardena Arcadia Publishing 7 2006 978-0-7385-4676-6 ] The Tongva Indians — also known as Gabrielino Indians — are probably descendants of those who crossed from Asia to North America around 10,000 years ago. In 1784, three years after the foundation of Los Angeles, Juan Jose Dominguez (1736–1809), a Spanish soldier who arrived in San Diego, California in 1769 with Fernando Rivera y Moncada, in recognition of his military service, received the roughly [ 43000 acre km2 on ] Spanish land grant, the Rancho San Pedro. Part of this land contained what became known as Gardena Valley. After the American Civil War veterans bought parts of the land, soon ranchers and farmers followed suit. Union Army Major General William Starke Rosecrans in 1869 bought [ 16000 acre km2 ]. The &quot; Rosecrans Rancho, &quot; was bordered by what later was Florence Avenue on the north, Redondo Beach Boulevard on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and Arlington Avenue on the west. The Rosecrans property was sub divided and sold in the early 1870s. One of those became the [ 650 acre km2 on ] Amestoy Ranch. Gardena proper began in 1887 when the Pomeroy &amp; Harrison real estate developers subdivided the ranch, and-anticipating that the coming of the Los Angeles and Redondo Railway. Civil War veteran Spencer Roane Thorpe is credited with starting the first settlement in Gardena in 1887. Railroads put Gardena on the map following a real estate boom in the Los Angeles area in the 1880s. Some believe the city was named for its reputation for being the only &quot; green spot &quot; in the dry season between Los Angeles and the sea. Because of its acres of berries, the city was dubbed &quot; Berryland &quot;. The Strawberry Day Festival and Parade was held each May annually. The berry industry suffered at the time of World War I as other crops were supported by the war economy. { Gardena, p. 8 } Japanese American s settled in Gardena throughout its history. { Frequently Asked Questions: Gardena } { County of Los Angeles Public Library.

The only way Gardena could protect itself from a heavy county tax imposed on a planned project at a park site was to incorporate. The City of Gardena became incorporated on September 11, 1930.
