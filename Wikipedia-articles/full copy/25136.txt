Most events since the inception in 1978 were from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal, but due to security threats in Mauritania, which led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally, the 2009 Dakar Rally was run in South America ( Argentina, Chile and Peru ). It was the first time the race took place outside of Europe and Africa.

Amateurs typically make up about eighty percent of the participants. Despite its name it is an off-road endurance race, called a rally-raid rather than a conventional rally – the terrain the competitors traverse is much tougher and the vehicles used are true off-road vehicles rather than the modified on-road vehicles used in rallies. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks and erg among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to [ 800 - 900 km ] per day. [ History and route ] The race originated in 1978, a year after racer Thierry Sabine got lost in the desert and decided that it would be a good location for a regular rally. Originally, the rally was from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal, interrupted by a transfer across the Mediterranean. However, due to politics and other factors, the course, including origin and destination, has varied over the years. Dakar has been the destination city on all but four occasions during the period the rally was held in Africa (i.e., prior to 2009). The event started from Paris every year from 1979 to 1994, and also in 1998 and 2001. In 1994 the rally both began and ended in Paris but, due to complaints by the mayor, the finish had to be moved from the Champs-Élysées to Euro Disney. This also caused the organisation to lay out the rally through different locations in following years.

Twelve years later, Stéphane Peterhansel managed the same feat. In 2001, Jutta Kleinschmidt became the first woman to win the Dakar, driving a Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, with fellow German Andreas Schulz as her co-driver. Until the 2008 terrorist attacks, rallies had been passing through Morocco, Western Sahara, and on to the grasslands and deserts of Mauritania. Segments running through Atar and the sand dunes and canyons of Mauritania&apos;s Adrar Region may have been the most challenging in all off-road racing. The Mauritania terrorist attacks spelled the end of North Africa as the rally&apos;s host region. The 2008 Dakar Rally was canceled on January 4, 2008, amid fears of terrorist attacks. This caused serious doubts over the future of the rally. Various newspapers in Africa called the cancellation a &quot; death sentence &quot; for the race. Chile and Argentina offered to host the event, along with the Czech Republic, [ http://motoring.iafrica.com/worldsport/dakar/776184.htm world motorsport &amp; #124; dakar Chile offers to host Dakar 2008 motoring.iafrica.com 2011-08-08 ] or Hungary [ http://index.hu/sport/dakarali0105/ Index – Két pótvesennyel pótolnák idén a Dakart Index.hu 2011-08-08 ] in Central Europe.

Many vehicle manufacturers exploit the harsh environment the rally offers as a testing ground and consequently to demonstrate the durability of their vehicles, although most vehicles are heavily modified or purpose built. [ Moto class ] The Moto class is divided between three groups. Group 1 is Marathon, which are nearly unmodified production motorcycles, subdivided between engines of greater and less than [ 451 cc cuin 0 on on ]. [ August 2011 ] Group 2 is Super-Production bikes, which are more substantially modified than Marathon bikes, subdivided between engines of greater and less than 451  cc. Group 3 for quads, subdivided between engines of greater and less than 500  cc. From 2012 the two wheeled motorcycles are limited to 450cc. Winning motorcycles include those made by Honda, KTM, Yamaha and BMW. [ Car class—T1, T2 and Open ] { Stéphane Peterhansel at Dakar 2011. He won the Dakar 10 times. } The car class is made up of vehicles weighing less than [ 3500 kg lb 0 on ] and subdivided into several categories. The T1 Group is made up of Improved Cross Country Vehicles and the T2 Group is made up of Cross Country Series Production vehicles. [ August 2011 ] The Open class accepts weight-qualifying vehicles such as SCORE International trucks. Originally, European utility vehicles like the Renault 4, Land Rover, Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz G, Volkswagen Iltis and the Pinzgauer, as well the Japanese Toyota Land Cruiser, dominated the race. Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero is the most successful model in race history, including 7 years straight (2001–2007). Other manufacturers have entered heavily modified street vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Citroën, Peugeot ( 405 T16 and 205 T16 ) and Porsche. In 2003 prominent examples in the Car Class included the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, the Volkswagen Race Touareg, the Bowler Wildcat 200 and the Nissan Navara. Mercedes Benz M, BMW X5 and BMW X3. Hummer H1 and Hummer H3 sport-utilities were represented but did not appear in the leader positions. Jean-Louis Schlesser built a series of custom dune buggy vehicles for the race and has won with them several times. American ( &quot; Baja &quot; ) style pro trucks have also made appearances but they have seldom won. At present the main competitors in the car class are Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and BMW. [ Truck class—T4 and T5 ] { Vladimir Chagin, &apos;&apos; &quot; The Tsar of Dakar &quot; &apos;&apos;, is the most successful Dakar driver in any category. } The Truck class, also known as &quot; Camions &quot; or &quot; Lorries &quot;, is made up of vehicles weighing more than [ 3500 kg lb 0 on ]. [ http://www.robbygordon.com/cms/publish/cat_index_109.shtml Dakar Dictionary ] They are divided into two groups, T4 and T5. T4 class trucks participate in the competition, while T5 trucks are rally support truck s, which means they travel from bivouac to bivouac to support the competition vehicles. T4 trucks may provide assistance during the special stages but must be homologated vehicles. The T4.1 class covers production trucks, and the T4.2 class covers modified trucks. [ August 2011 ] T5 vehicles do not have to be homologated. The T4 class has been composed of vehicles manufactured by Tatra, LIAZ, Kamaz, Hino, MAN, DAF, Mercedes-Benz, Unimog, Renault Kerax, SCANIA, IVECO, and GINAF. In the 1980s, a strong rivalry between DAF and Mercedes-Benz led to vehicles which had twin engines and more than 1000 hp (750 kW ). Later Tatra, and Kamaz took the race up. After 2000, renewed competition started in the truck class between DAF, Tatra, Mercedes-Benz and Kamaz.

This has been commentated on by Toby Moody for ten years but Ben Constanduros Speaks on the 2011 edition The organisers provide 20 edit stations for various countries to produce their own programmes. There are four TV helicopters, six stage cameras and three bivouac crews to make over 1,000 hours of TV over the two week period. In the United States, coverage can be seen on the Versus network (now the NBC Sports Network ). A television documentary Race to Dakar described the experiences of a team including the actor Charley Boorman in preparation for and entry into the 2006 Dakar Rally. According to Gert Vermersch, the media coverage of the Dakar rally, particularly in Europe has been decreasing. This has been triggered by the fact that the new South-American edition of the race has proven to be less spectacular, at least in regards to the scenery as the original edition. { Dakar hobbelt naar zijn eind, Het Nieuwsblad, 15 January 2012 } [ Incidents ] [ List of Dakar Rally fatal accidents ] In 1982, Mark Thatcher, son of the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, along with his French co-driver Charlotte Verney and their mechanic, disappeared for six days. On January 9, the trio became separated from a convoy of vehicles after they stopped to make repairs to a faulty steering arm. They were declared missing on January 12; after a large-scale search, a Lockheed L100 search plane from the Algerian military spotted their white Peugeot 504 some 50  km (30  mi) off course. Thatcher, Verney and the mechanic were all unharmed. The organiser of the rally, Thierry Sabine, was killed when his Ecureuil helicopter crashed at 07:30 p.m. on Tuesday 14 January 1986, into a dune at Mali during a sudden sand-storm. Also killed onboard was the singer-songwriter Daniel Balavoine, helicopter pilot François-Xavier Bagnoud, journalist Nathalie Odent and Jean-Paul Lefur who was a radiophonic engineer for RTL.

Italian motorcyclist Fabrizio Meoni, a two-time winner of the event, became the second Dakar Rally rider to die in two days, following Pérez on January 11 on stage 11. Meoni was the 11th motorcyclist and the 45th person overall to die in the history of the race. On January 13, a five-year-old Senegal ese girl was hit and killed by a service lorry after wandering onto a main road, bringing the total deaths to five. In 2006, 41-year-old Australian KTM motorcyclist Andy Caldecott, in his third time in the Dakar, died January 9 as a result of neck injuries sustained in a crash approximately 250  km (155  mi) into stage 9, between Nouakchott and Kiffa, only a few kilometers from the location where Meoni had his fatal wreck the year before. He won the third stage of the 2006 event between Nador and Er Rachidia only a few days before his death. The death occurred despite efforts by the event organisers to improve competitor safety, including limiting speed, mandatory rest at fuel stops, and reduced fuel capacity requirements for the bike classes.

[ Criticism ] [ November 2010 ] When the race was held in Africa, it was subject to criticism from several sources, generally focusing on the race&apos;s impact on the inhabitants of the African countries through which it passed. Some African residents along the race&apos;s course in previous years have said they saw limited benefits from the race; that race participants spent little money on the goods and services local residents can offer. The racers produced substantial amounts of dust along the course, and were blamed for hitting and killing livestock, in addition to occasionally injuring or killing people.

[ Paterne Elodie 2001-12-28 Protests overshadow start of Paris-Dakar race Agence France-Presse ] The rally was criticised before 2000 for crossing through the disputed territory of Western Sahara, without the approval of the Polisario Front, which considers itself the representative of the Sahrawi people. After the race officials gained formal permission from the Polisario from 2000 onwards this ceased to be an issue. The environmental impact of the race has been another area of criticism. This criticism of the race is notably the topic of the song &quot; 500 connards sur la ligne de départ &quot; ( &quot; 500 Assholes at the Starting Line &quot; ), on the album Marchand de cailloux by French singer Renaud.
