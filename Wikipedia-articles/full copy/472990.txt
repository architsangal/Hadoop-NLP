This is a list of the 200 currently operating suburban railway stations (216 including greater metropolitan stations) in Melbourne, Australia. The stations make up 16 radial railway lines (and 3 greater metropolitan lines), as well as the central City Loop. There are also a further 19 stations on 3 heritage, volunteer -operated, tourist railways. These are not a part of the suburban network. Stations are broken up into 2 Metcard ticketing zones (some stations are in the overlap between the two zones, where tickets for either zone may be used), as well as the City Saver area, which is within Zone 1 and covers the central business district. On March 4, 2007 zone 3 was abolished by being incorporated into Zone 2.

Stations followed by an asterisk (  *  ) are &quot; host station s &quot;. These stations are manned during peak hour s only. Some are manned only during morning peak, some during both morning and evening peaks. Listed in parentheses after each station is that station&apos;s 3-letter code.
