With a population of 25,233 at the 2000 census, it is the largest city between Midland to the west, Abilene to the east, Lubbock to the north, and San Angelo to the south. Big Spring was established as the county seat of Howard County in 1882; it is the largest community in the county. The city got its name from the single, large spring that issued into a small gorge between the base of Scenic Mountain and a neighboring hill in the southwestern part of the city limits. Although the name is often mistakenly pluralized, it is officially singular; Big Springs, Texas, is actually a community in Rusk County in East Texas. [ Geography ] Big Spring is located at [ 32 14 36 N 101 28 31 W type:city ] (32.243198, -101.475231) [ 1 ]. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 19.2 sqmi km2 ]. [ 19.1 sqmi km2 ] of it is land, and [ 0.1 sqmi km2 ] of it (0.42%) is water.

In the early-1840s, it was the center of a territorial dispute between Comanche and Pawnee tribes, and has been a major watering hole for wildlife and prehistoric man in this semi-arid area. { Brune, G. 1981. Springs of Texas. Vol. I, Fort Worth: Branch Smith, p. 235 } Early military scouting reports and pioneer accounts describe the water as cold, clear, and dependable; the spring pool was approximately [ 15 ft 0 on ] deep, with the overflow going only a short distance down the draw before it sank beneath the surface. The spring has mistakenly been described in other writings as being located in Sulphur Draw. It is actually located to the south, near the top of a small, rugged, unnamed draw running eastwards from the spring, and is itself a tributary to Beal&apos;s Creek, the name given to Sulphur Draw as it flows into, through, and past the city of Big Spring. Long used by regional inhabitants, both permanent and nomadic, with a large number of locally-collected artifacts testifying to its heavy occupation, the spring sat astride the several branches of the later-developed Comanche War Trail as they converged on this important water hole from beyond Texas, coming south across the Northern Plains and the Llano Estacado. From the Big Spring, the war trail continued south via three branches, one to the southeast through the western part of the Concho country; one going almost due south, heading for Castle Gap and Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River; and one heading west to Willow Springs in the sand country southwest of present Midland, before turning south down the Pecos, all headed ultimately for Mexico. As whites began to settle the western territories, the spring continued to serve as a major watering place on the southern route of the Gold Rush Trail of the early-1850s and continued in use well beyond that time, as the cross-continental trail turned into a major road for later pioneers coming into the area. The spring was sourced from a relatively small aquifer situated on the northern end of the Edwards Plateau and the southern end of the High Plains, being, structurally, a collecting sink of lower Cretaceous (Fredericksburg) limestones and sands. The spring aquifer held a large quantity of water due to the great number of fractures, solution channels, and interstices in the rocks and underlying sands, although the aeral extent of the Big Spring sink is estimated to be only [ 1 mi 0 on ] in diameter, with the main area only [ 3000 ft 0 on ] wide and almost circular, with some ellipticity trending towards the west. The Cretaceous beds subsided about [ 280 ft 0 on ] below their normal position, centered on the SE quarter of Section 12, Block 33 T1S; T &amp; P RR Co survey, and the entire strata appears to be preserved within the sink, the surface topography roughly following the subsurface subsidence. [ Livingston P.P. Bennett, R.R. Geology and ground-water resources of the Big Spring area, Texas Water Supply Paper 913 1944 United States Geological Survey, 113 pp ] This writing identifies the sink as one of a number of similar subsurface geologic features in the surrounding area, differing from the Big Spring sink only in the fact that the surface topography above the others, while showing some decline, does not dip low enough to intersect the top of the water tables; hence, no springs could form from the other aquifers. In a passing comment, enigmatic in its content and disappointing in its brevity, the report states that no other comparable deep sinks formed elsewhere on the Edwards Plateau. The same publication suggests that the spring&apos;s discharge volume was in excess of [ 100000 gal liter 0 ] per day at the time of the railroad&apos;s arrival in the area in the late-1880s. The water was heavily mined by wells built by both the railroad and the early town of Big Spring greatly in excess of its modest recharge rate, until the water table first dropped below the level of the spring outlet, and, finally, was completely depleted by the mid-1920s. The city now artificially fills the spring from its current source of water as a means of allowing residents and visitors to maintain some idea of how it appeared in times past. [ History ] Although the area had long been a popular watering hole for Native Americans and other prehistoric residents and nomads, including members of the more recently established Jumano, Apache, and Comanche tribes, the first Europe an to view the site now known as Big Spring was probably a member of a Spanish expedition, possibly that of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, although the record of his travels cannot confirm his visit. United States Army Captain Randolph B. Marcy &apos;s expedition was the first United States expedition to explore and map the area in 1849. { Marcy, R.B. 1850. Report of Captain R.B. Marcy&apos;s route from Fort Smith to Santa Fe. In: Reports of the Secretary of War, Executive Document 64, Washington DC, pp. 169–233. (See p. 208) } Marcy marked the spring as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The site began to collect inhabitants and by the late-1870s, a settlement had sprung up to support buffalo hunters that frequented the area. The original settlement consisted largely of hide huts and saloon s. Ranching quickly became a major industry in the area; early ranchers included F.G. Oxsheer, C.C. Slaughter, and B.F. Wolcott. [ BB/heb9 Big Spring ] One notable early rancher was Briton, Joseph Heneage Finch, the Seventh Earl of Aylesford. Finch purchased [ 37000 acre km2 0 on ] of ranch land in the area in 1883 and is credited with building Big Spring&apos;s first permanent structure, a butcher &apos;s shop. [ HH/hch20 Howard County ] The completion of the Texas and Pacific Railroad led to the founding in the early-1880s of Abilene, Colorado City, and Big Spring, three railroading and ranching cities where saloons and gambling dens flourished. More important in the city&apos;s history was the discovery of oil in the region during the 1920s. The early discoveries in the area marked the beginning of the oil industry in the Permian Basin area of west Texas, and the oil industry has continued to be a dominant part of the area&apos;s economy. The oil industry in Big Spring reached its peak during the oil boom of the 1950s. Another major part of Big Spring&apos;s economy and life during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was Webb Air Force Base. It initially opened during World War II as the Big Spring Bombardier School, a training base for bombardier pilots. Following the war, it was converted to a U.S. Air Force Training Base and was named for James Webb, a Big Spring native who died in action during World War II. Webb Air Force Base was active until it was closed in 1977, when the base facilities were deeded to the city. Big Spring was also featured in the 1969 film &apos;&apos;Midnight Cowboy&apos;&apos;, which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight and received the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1969. The opening scenes featuring Voight, then a relatively unknown actor, playing the character Joe Buck were filmed in Big Spring and the neighboring city of Stanton. Big Spring is the location at which the opening scene of the Quentin Tarantino film, From Dusk Till Dawn, takes place. The FAI World Hang Gliding Championship was hosted by Big Spring in August 2007.
