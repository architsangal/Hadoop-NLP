The &apos;Ndrangheta ( [ n̩ˈdraŋɡeta ] ) [p] is a criminal organization in Italy, centered in Calabria. Despite not being as famous abroad as the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, and having been considered more rural compared to the Neapolitan Camorra and the Apulia n Sacra Corona Unita, the &apos;Ndrangheta managed to become the most powerful crime syndicate of Italy in the late 1990s and early 2000s. While commonly lumped together with the Sicilian Mafia, the &apos;Ndrangheta operates independently from the Sicilians, though there is contact between the two due to the geographical proximity of Calabria and Sicily. A US diplomat estimated that the organization&apos;s drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering activities accounted for at least 3 percent of Italy&apos;s GDP. { US saw mafia-ridden Italian region as &apos;failed state,&apos; according to WikiLeaks cable, The Canadian Press, January 13, 2011 } [ History ] [ Origin and etymology ] Map of the province of Reggio Calabria In 1861 the prefect of Reggio Calabria already noticed the presence of so-called camorristi, a term used at the time since there was no formal name for the phenomenon in Calabria (the Camorra was the older and better known criminal organization in Naples). { Relazione annuale sulla &apos;Ndrangheta, Italian } { Antimafia Commission, February 2008 } { Behan, The Camorra, pp. 9-10 } Since the 1880s, there is ample evidence of &apos;Ndrangheta-type groups in police reports and sentences by local courts. At the time they were often being referred to as the picciotteria, onorata società (honoured society) or camorra and mafia. { Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 36 } These secret societies in the areas of Calabria rich in olives and vines were distinct from the often anarchic forms of banditry and were organized hierarchically with a code of conduct that included omertà – the code of silence – according to a sentence from the court in Reggio Calabria in 1890. An 1897 sentence from the court in Palmi mentioned a written code of rules found in the village of Seminara based on honour, secrecy, violence, solidarity (often based on blood relationships) and mutual assistance. { Gratteri &amp; Nicaso, Fratelli di sangue, pp. 23-28 } In the folk culture surrounding &apos;Ndrangheta in Calabria, references to the Spanish Garduña often appear. Aside from these references, however, there is nothing to substantiate a link between the two organizations. The Calabrian word &apos;Ndrangheta derives from ancient Greek [ Turone, Giuliano Il delitto di associazione mafiosa Giuffrè editore 2008 97 978-88-14-13917-8 Il vocabolo deriva infatti dal greco antico ανδραγαθία e significa valore, prodezza, carattere del galantuomo. ] ἀνδραγαθία andragathía for &quot; heroism &quot; and &quot; virtue &quot; or ἀνδράγαϑος andragathos, a blend of andròs &quot; man &quot; and agathòs &quot; good &quot;, meaning a courageous man. In many areas of Calabria the verb &apos;ndranghitiari, from the Greek andragatizomai, means &quot; to engage in a defiant and valiant attitude &quot;. { Gratteri &amp; Nicaso, Fratelli di sangue, p. 21 } The first time the word &apos;Ndrangheta was mentioned before a more wider audience was by the Calabrian writer Corrado Alvaro in the Corriere della Sera in September 1955. { La &apos;ndrangheta transnazionale: Dalla picciotteria alla santa - Analisi di un fenomeno criminale globalizzato, Giovanni Tizian, March 2009 } [ Modern history ] Until 1975, the &apos;Ndrangheta restricted their Italian operations to Calabria, mainly involved in extortion and blackmailing. Then a gang war started, killing 300 people. The prevailing faction began to kidnap rich people from northern Italy for ransom. It is believed that John Paul Getty III was one of their victims. The Second &apos;Ndrangheta war raged from 1985 to 1991. The bloody six-year war between the Condello - Imerti - Serraino - Rosmini clans and the De Stefano - Tegano - Libri -Latella clans left more than 600 deaths. { Godfather&apos;s arrest fuels fear of bloody conflict, The Observer, 24 February 2008 } { Condello, leader pacato e spietato, La Repubblica, 19 February 2008 } In the 1990s, the organization started to invest in the illegal international drug trade, mainly importing cocaine from Colombia. Francesco Fortugno, popular center-left politician and deputy president of the regional parliament, was openly killed by the &apos;Ndrangheta on 16 October 2005, in Locri. Demonstrations against the organization ensued, with youthful protesters carrying banderoles of &quot; Ammazzateci tutti ! &quot; — &quot; Kill us all! &quot; { Im Schattenreich der Krake, } { Süddeutsche Zeitung, 3 February 2006. } The government started a large-scale enforcement operation in Calabria and arrested numerous &apos;ndranghetisti including the murderers of Fortugno. In March 2006, the national anti-Mafia prosecutor announced the discovery of a narco submarine in Colombia; it was being constructed on behalf of the &apos;Ndrangheta for smuggling cocaine. [ http://www.italymag.co.uk/2006/news-from-italy/current-affairs/mafia-drugs-submarine-seized/ Mafia drugs submarine seized 3 February 2009 Web Editor 28 March 2006 News From Italy Italy Magazine http://web.archive.org/web/20071013095517/http%3A//italymag.co.uk/2006/news-from-italy/current-affairs/mafia-drugs-submarine-seized/ 13 October 2007 ] The &apos;Ndrangheta has recently expanded its activities to Northern Italy, mainly to sell drugs and to invest in legitimate businesses which can be used for money laundering. The mayor of Buccinasco was threatened when he tried to halt these investments; in May 2007 twenty members of &apos;Ndrangheta were arrested in Milan. On 30 August 2007, hundreds of police raided the small town of San Luca, the focal point of the bitter San Luca feud between rival clans among the &apos;Ndrangheta. Over 30 men and women, linked to the killing of six Italian men in Germany, were arrested. { Mafia suspects arrested in Italy, BBC News, 30 August 2007. } In September 2009 &apos;Ndrangheta was accused by a former member of the gang of sinking dozens of ships loaded with radioactive waste off the Italian coast and of shipping radioactive waste to developing countries for dumping. [ Characteristics ] Italian anti-organized crime agencies estimated in 2007 that the &apos;Ndrangheta has annual revenue of about € 35–40 billion ( US$ 50–60 billion), which amounts to approximately 3.5% of the GDP of Italy. { &quot; Move over, Cosa Nostra. &quot; } { The Guardian, 8 June 2006. } { &quot; Mafiosi move north to take over the shops and cafés of Milan. &quot; } { The Times, 5 May 2007. } This comes mostly from illegal drug trafficking, but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction, restaurants and supermarkets. { &quot; Six morts dans un règlement de comptes mafieux en Allemagne. &quot; } { Le Monde. 15 August 2007. } The &apos;Ndrangheta has a strong grip on the economy and governance in Calabria. According to a US Embassy cable leaked by Wikileaks, Calabria would be a failed state if it were not part of Italy. The &apos;Ndrangheta controls huge segments of its territory and economy, and accounts for at least three percent of Italy&apos;s GDP through drug trafficking, extortion, skimming of public contracts, and usury. Law enforcement is hampered by a lack of both human and financial resources. { Can Calabria Be Saved? } { Italy&apos;s Brutal Export: The Mafia Goes Global, Time Magazine, March 9, 2011 } The principal difference with the Mafia is in recruitment methods. The &apos;Ndrangheta recruits members on the criterion of blood relationships resulting in an extraordinary cohesion within the family clan that presents a major obstacle to investigation. Sons of ‘ndranghetisti are expected to follow in their fathers&apos; footsteps, and go through a grooming process in their youth to become giovani d’onore (boys of honor) before they eventually enter the ranks as uomini d’onore (men of honor). There are relatively few Calabrian mafiosi who have opted out to become a pentito; at the end of 2002, there were 157 Calabrian witnesses in the state witness protection program. Unlike the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s, they have meticulously avoided a head-on confrontation with the Italian state. Prosecution in Calabria is hindered by the fact that Italian judges and prosecutors who score highly in exams get to choose their posting; those who are forced to work in Calabria will usually request to be transferred right away. With weak government presence and corrupt officials, few civilians are willing to speak out against the organization. [ Organizational structure ] { Formulas from the code of the ‘Ndrangheta: The three handwritten pages describe the text for the speech held when a member is promoted to a higher ranking. The text reads awkwardly for a native speaker—it is composed in an uncertain Italian with many grammatical and orthographic mistakes. &quot; Crisis among the &quot; Men of Honor. &quot; interview with Letizia Paoli, Max Planck Research, February 2004 } &apos;Ndrangheta Structure Both the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and the &apos;Ndrangheta are loose confederations of about one hundred mafia groups, also called cosche or families, each of which claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village, though without ever fully conquering and legitimizing its monopoly of violence. There are approximately 100 of these families, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 members in Reggio Calabria. { Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 32 } { Relazione annuale, Commissione parlamentare d’inchiesta sul fenomeno della criminalità organizzata mafiosa o similare, 30 July 2003 } Other estimates mention 6,000-7,000 men, worldwide there might be some 10,000 members. Most of the groups (86) operate in the Province of Reggio Calabria, although a portion of the recorded 70 criminal groups based in the Calabrian provinces Catanzaro and Cosenza also appears to be formally affiliated with the &apos;Ndrangheta. The families are concentrated in poor villages in Calabria such as Platì, Locri, San Luca, Africo and Altomonte as well as the main city and provincial capital Reggio Calabria. { &quot; La pax della &apos;ndrangheta soffoca Reggio Calabria. &quot; La Repubblica. 25 April 2007. } San Luca is considered to be the stronghold of the &apos;Ndrangheta. According to a former &apos;ndranghetista, &quot; almost all the male inhabitants belong to the &apos;Ndrangheta, and the Sanctuary of Polsi has long been the meeting place of the affiliates. &quot; { Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 29 } Bosses from outside Calabria, from as far as Canada and Australia, regularly attend the meetings at the Sanctuary of Polsi. A &apos;Ndrangheta crime family is called a locale (place). A locale may have branches, called &apos;ndrina (plural: &apos;ndrine), in the districts of the same city, in neighbouring towns and villages, or even outside Calabria, in cities and towns in the industrial North of Italy in and around Turin and Milan. Sometimes sotto &apos;ndrine are established. These subunits enjoy a high degree of autonomy – they have a leader and independent staff. In some contexts the &apos;ndrine have become more powerful than the locale on which they formally depend. Other observers maintain that the &apos;ndrina is the basic organizational unit. Each &apos;ndrina is &quot; autonomous on its territory and no formal authority stands above the &quot; &apos;ndrina boss &quot;, according to the Antimafia Commission. The &apos;ndrina is usually in control of a small town or a neighborhood. If more than one &apos;ndrina operates in the same town, they form a locale. Blood family and membership of the crime family overlap to a great extent within the &apos;Ndrangheta. By and large, the &apos;ndrine consist of men belonging to the same family lineage. Salvatore Boemi, Anti-mafia prosecutor in Reggio Calabria, told the Italian Antimafia Commission that &quot; one becomes a member for the simple fact of being born in a mafia family, &quot; although other reasons might attract a young man to seek membership, and non-kin have also been admitted. Marriages help cement relations within each &apos;ndrina and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence &quot; a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given &apos;ndrina. &quot; Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants. At the bottom of the chain of command are the picciotti d’onore or soldiers, who are expected to perform tasks with blind obedience until they are promoted to the next level of cammorista, where they will be granted command over their own group of soldiers. The next level is known as santista and higher still is the vangelista, upon which the up-and-coming gangster has to swear their dedication to a life of crime on the Bible. The quintino is the second highest level of command in a &apos;Ndrangheta clan, being made up of five privileged members of the crime family who report directly to the boss, the capobastone (head of command). { &quot; The &apos;Ndrangheta Looms Large. &quot; AmericanMafia.com. } [ Power structure ] For many years, the power apparatus of the single families were the sole ruling bodies within the two associations, and they have remained the real centers of power even after superordinate bodies were created in the Cosa Nostra beginning in the 1950s (the Sicilian Mafia Commission ) and in the &apos;Ndrangheta a superordinate body was created only in 1991 as the result of negotiations to end years of inter family violence. { Review of: Paoli, &apos;&apos;Mafia Brotherhoods&apos;&apos; } Unlike the Sicilian Mafia, the &apos;Ndrangheta managed to maintain a horizontal organizational structure up to the early 1990s, avoiding the establishment of a formal superordinate body. Information of several witnesses has undermined the myth of absolute autonomy of Calabrian crime families, however. At least since the end of the 19th century, stable mechanisms for coordination and dispute settlement were created. Contacts and meetings among the bosses of the locali were frequent. A new investigation, which ended in July 2010 with an arrest of 305 &apos;Ndrangheta members revealed that the &apos;ndrangheta was extremely &quot; hierarchical, united and pyramidal, &quot; and not just clan-based as previously believed, as said by Italy&apos;s chief anti-mafia prosecutor Piero Grasso. { &apos;Ndrangheta mafia structure revealed as Italian police nab 300 alleged mobsters, The Associated Press, July 13, 2010 } At least since the 1950s, the chiefs of the &apos;Ndrangheta locali have met regularly near the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Polsi in the municipality of San Luca during the September Feast. These annual meetings, known as the crimine, have traditionally served as a forum to discuss future strategies and settle disputes among the locali. The assembly exercises weak supervisory powers over the activities of all &apos;Ndrangheta groups. Strong emphasis was placed on the temporary character of the position of the crimine boss. A new representative was elected at each meeting. { Paoli. Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 59 } Far from being the &quot; boss of the bosses, &quot; the capo crimine actually has comparatively little authority to interfere in family feuds or to control the level of interfamily violence. { Varese, Federico. &quot; How Mafias Migrate: The Case of the &apos;Ndrangheta in Northern Italy. &quot; Law &amp; Society Review. June 2006. } At these meetings, every boss &quot; must give account of all the activities carried out during the year and of all the most important facts taking place in his territory such as kidnappings, homicides, etc. &quot; The historical preeminence of the San Luca family is such that every new group or locale must obtain its authorization to operate and every group belonging to the &apos;Ndrangheta &quot; still has to deposit a small percentage of illicit proceeds to the principale of San Luca in recognition of the latter’s primordial supremacy. &quot; { Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 29-30 } Security concerns have led to the creation in the &apos;Ndrangheta of a secret society within the secret society: La Santa. Membership in the Santa is only known to other members. Contrary to the code, it allowed bosses to establish close connections with state representatives, even to the extent that some were affiliated with the Santa. These connections were often established through the Freemasonry, which the santisti - breaking another rule of the traditional code - were allowed to join. { Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 116 } Since the end of the Second &apos;Ndrangheta war in 1991, the &apos;Ndrangheta is ruled by a collegial body or Commission, known as La Provincia. Its primary function is the settlement of inter-family disputes. { Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 61-62 } [ Activities ] According to Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, Department of the Police of Italy against organized crime) and Guardia di Finanza (Italian Financial Police and Customs Police) the &quot; &apos;Ndrangheta is now one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the world. &quot; [ August 2007 ] Economic activities of &apos;Ndrangheta include international cocaine and weapons smuggling, with Italian investigators estimating that 80% of Europe&apos;s cocaine passes through the Calabrian port of Gioia Tauro and is controlled by the &apos;Ndrangheta. However, according to a report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol, the Iberian Peninsula is considered the main entry point for cocaine into Europe and a gateway to the European market. { Cocaine: a European Union perspective in the global context, EMCDDA/ Europol, Lisbon, April 2010 } The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that in 2007 nearly ten times as much cocaine was intercepted in Spain (almost 38 MT) in comparison with Italy (almost 4 MT). { World Drug Report 2009, UNODC, 2009 } &apos;Ndrangeta groups and Sicilian Cosa Nostra groups sometimes act as joint ventures in cocaine trafficking enterprises. { The Rothschilds of the Mafia on Aruba, by Tom Blickman, Transnational Organized Crime, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer 1997 } { Uno degli affari di Cosa Nostra e &apos;Ndrangheta insieme, Notiziario Droghe, 30 May 2005 } Further activities include skimming money off large public work construction projects, money laundering and traditional crimes such as usury and extortion. &apos;Ndrangheta invests illegal profits in legal real estate and financial activities. The business volume of the &apos;Ndrangheta is estimated at almost 44 billion euro in 2007, approximately 2.9% of Italy&apos;s GDP, according to Eurispes (European Institute of Political, Economic and Social Studies) in Italy. Drug trafficking is the most profitable activity with 62% of the total turnover. { Il fatturato della ’Ndrangheta Holding: 2,9% del Pil nel 2007, &apos;Ndrangheta Holding Dossier 2008, Centro Documentazione Eurispes } Total turnover of the &apos;Ndrangheta in 2007 Illicit activity Income Drug trafficking  €  27.240 billion Commercial enterprise &amp; public contracts      €      5.733 billion Prostitution  €      2.867 billion Extortion &amp; usury  €      5.017 billion Arms trafficking  €      2.938 billion Total  €  43.795 billion [ Outside Italy ] The &apos;Ndrangheta has had a remarkable ability to establish branches abroad, mainly through migration. The overlap of blood and mafia family seems to have helped the &apos;Ndrangheta expand beyond its traditional territory: &quot; The familial bond has not only worked as a shield to protect secrets and enhance security, but also helped to maintain identity in the territory of origin and reproduce it in territories where the family has migrated &quot;. &apos;Ndrine are reported to be operating in northern Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Eastern Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia. One group of &apos;ndranghetistas discovered outside Italy was in Ontario, Canada, several decades ago. They were dubbed the Siderno Group by Canadian judges as most of its members hailed from Siderno.

After the death of Domenico Italiano, known as Il Papa, different clans tried to gain control over the produce market. At the time it was unclear that most involved were affiliated with the &apos;Ndrangheta. { Omerta in the Antipodes, Time Magazine, January 31, 1964 } { L’ascesa della &apos;Ndrangheta in Australia, by Pierluigi Spagnolo, Altreitalie, January–June 2010 } The &apos;Ndrangheta began in Australia in Queensland, where they continued their form of rural organized crime, especially in the fruit and vegetable industry.
