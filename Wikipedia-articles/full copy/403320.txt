It is the lowest positive power of two that is adjacent to neither a Mersenne prime nor a Fermat prime. 64 is the sum of Euler&apos;s totient function for the first fourteen integers. It is also a dodecagonal number and a centered triangular number. Since it is possible to find sequences of 64 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member, 64 is an Erdős–Woods number. In base 10, no integer added up to its own digits yields 64, hence it is a self number. 64 is a superperfect number - a number such that σ (σ(n))=2n. 64 is the index of Graham&apos;s number in the rapidly growing sequence 3,27,7625597484987,....
