Gephardt served as a U.S. Representative from Missouri from January 3, 1977, until January 3, 2005, serving as House Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995, and as Minority Leader from 1995 to 2003. He also ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1988 and 2004. Gephardt was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1988, 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2008.

[ Early life ] Gephardt was born into a family in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Loreen Estelle (née Cassell) and Louis Andrew Gephardt, a Teamster milkman; part of his ancestry is German. [ http://www.wargs.com/political/gephardt.html Ancestry of Dick Gephardt Wargs.com 2009-08-23 ] He graduated from the former Southwest High School in 1958. Gephardt is an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He earned his B.S. at Northwestern University in 1962 where he was president of Beta Theta Pi, the student senate, and his freshman class. [ http://www.nndb.com/people/447/000022381/ Dick Gephardt Nndb.com 2010-05-24 ] He earned his J.D. at the University of Michigan Law School in 1965. In 1965, he was admitted to the Missouri bar. He then entered the Missouri Air National Guard, where he served until 1971. He and his wife Jane have three grown children, Matt, Katie, and Chrissy. His brother, Donald L. Gephardt, is the Dean of The College of Fine and Performing Arts at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. [ Political career ] Gephardt was Democratic committeeman for the 14th ward in St. Louis between 1968 and 1971, moving up to become 14th ward alderman between 1971 and 1976, as part of a group of young aldermen known informally as &quot; The Young Turks. &quot; [ House of Representatives ] In 1976, Gephardt was elected to Congress from the St. Louis-based 3rd District, succeeding 24-year incumbent Leonor Sullivan. He was elected 13 more times, opting not to run for reelection in 2004. For most of his Congressional career, Gephardt&apos;s National Political Director was St. Louis-based political consultant Joyce Aboussie. [ 1988 campaign for President ] Gephardt was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 1988 presidential election. Gephardt ran hard and early in 1987–88 and finally started moving ahead in Iowa after running the &quot; Hyundai ad &quot; that criticized what he thought were unfair trade barriers by Korea and Japan. Gephardt won the Iowa caucus es and South Dakota primary in February, but ran out of money and dropped out after losing badly in the March &quot; Super Tuesday &quot; primaries, when he won only the Missouri primary. An ad aired by the campaign of Governor Michael Dukakis focused on Gephardt&apos;s &quot; flip-flopping &quot; voting record, and showed a Gephardt look-alike doing forward and backward flips for the camera. Many felt that the ad killed any chance Gephardt had of winning the nomination. Gephardt dropped out after winning only 13% in the Michigan caucus, despite support from the United Auto Workers. Dukakis considered Gephardt for his running mate, but chose Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen. [ House leadership ] In part due to the visibility gained from his 1988 presidential bid, Gephardt was named majority leader in June 1989. He became the second-ranking Democrat in the House, behind then- Speaker Tom Foley, serving in that position until January 1995. After Foley was unseated in the Republican landslide of 1994 that gave the Republicans a 52-seat majority, Gephardt became the leader of the House Democrats, as minority leader, initially opposite Newt Gingrich and then, from 1999 onwards, Dennis Hastert. When Gingrich faced a coup within his own party in 1997, there was a possibility of Gephardt becoming Speaker if there had been a floor vote and he could gain the support of Republican Congressman dissatisfied with Gingrich, however Gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred. In the 1996, 1998, and 2000 elections, Gephardt led the Democrats to gains in the House, [ http://articles.cnn.com/2002-11-18/politics/column.shields.opinion.gephardt_1_leader-gephardt-dick-gephardt-caucus?_s%3DPM%3AALLPOLITICS CNN AllPolitics Clinton, Gephardt Share Welfare Event Stage August 12, 1997 ] although they did not retake the majority until 2006, after Gephardt had left Congress. Gephardt was considered a keen politician who worked hard at passing legislation, defending traditional Democratic principles, and for his home district in St. Louis. He became a prolific financial supporter of Democrats around the country in the early 1990s when he assembled a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office. Although Gephardt worked hard for many of President Bill Clinton &apos;s programs, he and his union supporters strongly opposed NAFTA and other &quot; free trade &quot; programs, so Clinton required Republican support to pass these initiatives. During the Impeachment proceedings of President Clinton, Gephardt led a walkout in the House after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/clinton_under_fire/latest_news/238784.stm BBC News Clinton impeached December 19, 1998 ] In 2000, Vice President Al Gore named Gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates. The other names on the short list were then-Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, then-North Carolina Senator John Edwards, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, then-Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, and then-New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen. [ August 2009 ] Gore eventually selected Lieberman. In the 2002 Congressional midterm elections, Gephardt campaigned on the issues of the economy and Social Security, however the continuing resonance of the September 11 attacks, the momentum for military action against Iraq, and President George W. Bush &apos;s popularity lead to Republican gains, with the Democrats losing four House seats. Harold Ford of Tennessee described the results an &quot; absolute blowout &quot; and called upon Gephardt to step down, saying that it was time for &quot; new ideas and new faces &quot;. Due to his previous success, it has been said that Gephardt would have been easily returned as Minority Leader if he decided to stay on.

His leadership position was contested by the centrist Martin Frost, the outgoing Democratic Caucus Chair, and the liberal Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Whip, who was elected as Gephardt&apos;s successor. No longer having Congressional leadership duties freed up Gephardt to concentrate on a 2004 presidential bid.

His successor as Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, endorsed his bid for president. His campaign was notable for the high-profile coming out of his daughter Chrissy in People magazine, when she was helping him on the campaign trail, { No Secrets, } { people, June 2, 2003 } { Gay Daughter Joins Gephardt Campaign, } { ABC News, June 9, 2003 } a subject they also discussed in interviews for the 2007 documentary film For the Bible Tells Me So; { Chrissy and Dick Gephardt appear on CNN to promote new film, &apos;&apos;For The Bible Tells Me So&apos;&apos;, PageOneQ, October 16, 2007 } he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign, though still opposes same-sex marriage. { Home State Record: Dick Gephardt, } { New Hampshire Public Radio, December 30, 2003 } Although Republicans considered him a formidable candidate, Gephardt was seen by many as too old fashioned and unelectable.

Swarns THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN; Gephardt&apos;s Poignant Echo at the Site of His 1988 Victory January 20, 2004 ] His fundraising efforts were behind that of former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, and tied with Joe Lieberman. Furthermore, Gephardt&apos;s support of the Iraq War resolution hurt him among liberal activists. Gephardt promoted a form of universal health care, and was backed by 21 labor unions, but did not have enough support to receive the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. Throughout early 2003, Gephardt was ahead in polling for the Iowa caucus, but by August Dean had taken the lead with his campaign fueled by anti-war activists. The Gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early August St Louis Post-Dispatch article that revealed that 11 of 33 &quot; Gephardt team leaders &quot; listed on his Iowa campaign&apos;s web site were actually supporting other candidates or neutral. The race between Gephardt and Dean became negative, and took an ugly turn in October when a Gephardt staffer reportedley pushed a Dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a &quot; faggot &quot;. [ http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/dont_quote_me/documents/03301021.asp An unlikely bigfoot Boston Phoenix 2009-08-23 ] Many press at the event claimed the Dean staffer was picking a fight and that the Gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment. Dean chairman Joe Trippi (who had previously worked for Gephardt in 1988) and Gephardt chairman Steve Murphy became involved in a war of words over that incident. In the final days of the campaign, both Dean and Gephardt faded and finished third and fourth, respectively. Gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result. [ http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/g/richard_a_gephardt/index.html?offset%3D30%26amp%3Bs%3Dnewest The New York Times R. W. Apple Jr ] After he dropped out of the Presidential race, Gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for John Kerry. On March 7, 2004, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, seen as a strong possibility for the position himself, endorsed Gephardt for the Vice Presidency. &quot; I think he&apos;s the best candidate, &quot; Richardson said of Gephardt in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot; There&apos;s a good regional balance with Kerry and Gephardt. &quot; Kerry announced on July 6, 2004, that he had chosen John Edwards as his running mate. On the same day, the New York Post published an incorrect headline stating that Gephardt had become Kerry&apos;s running mate. Shortly after this false story broke, the headline was compared to the 1948 &quot; Dewey defeats Truman &quot; front page of the Chicago Tribune, which incorrectly reported the presidential election results of that year. In 2007, it was revealed in the book No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner by Bob Shrum, who served as Kerry&apos;s campaign adviser in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, that Kerry wanted to choose Gephardt as his nominee for Vice President but was convinced by Shrum and others to choose Edwards.

Originally, Gephardt was strongly anti- abortion and was viewed as a social conservative. He was initially extremely critical of the Supreme Court&apos;s landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. He wrote on the subject in 1984: [ January 2011 ] &quot; Life is the division of human cells, a process that begins with conception. The ( Supreme Court&apos;s abortion) ruling was unjust, and it is incumbent on the Congress to correct the injustice... I have always been supportive of pro-life legislation. I intend to remain steadfast on this issue.... I believe that the life of the unborn should be protected at all costs. &quot; In 1987, when Gephardt decided to run for president, he announced that he would no longer support legislation to restrict abortion rights. He told the National Right to Life Committee; &quot; I now do not support any Constitutional amendment pertaining to the legality of abortion. &quot; Gephardt&apos;s views on economic policy also changed over the years. He voted for Ronald Reagan &apos;s tax cuts in 1981; in the 2000s, however, he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by President George W. Bush, saying that the enormous surplus created during the administration of Bill Clinton should have been spent on health care instead. Gephardt is widely viewed as an economic populist. He supports universal health coverage, fair trade, and progressive taxation. Although he once chaired the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Gephardt in his later years in Congress distanced himself from the organization, finding his pro-labor views at odds with the DLC&apos;s pro-business positions. On October 10, 2002, Gephardt was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He was an early supporter of the war, and cosponsor of the authorization resolution. However, three years later Gephardt said of his support for the war that &quot; It was a mistake... I was wrong. &quot; [ http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2005/10/gephardt_on_ira.html The Next Hurrah: Gephardt on Iraq: &quot; I was wrong &quot; Thenexthurrah.typepad.com 2005-10-17 2009-08-23 ] [ Activities since leaving Congress ] On January 3, 2005, Gephardt&apos;s three-decade political career ended with the expiration of his fourteenth term in the House of Representatives. That month, Gephardt started a consulting and lobbying firm, Gephardt Group; he is currently its President and CEO. [ http://www.gephardtgroup.com Gephardt Group (2008) Gephardt Group 2010-05-24 ] In his new role as a Washington lobbyist, Gephardt, on behalf of the Republic of Turkey, has been actively lobbying against the House resolution condemning the Armenian genocide of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire. While supportive of the resolution while in Congress, he now contends that facts need to be better known before any position is taken over this historical controversy.
