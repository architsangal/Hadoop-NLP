Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the flow of information between an organization and its public s. { Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations. (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984), 6e. } Public relations provides an organization or individual exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. { Seitel, Fraser P. The Practice of Public Relations. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2007), 10e. } The aim is often to persuade the public, investors, partners, employees and other stakeholders to maintain a certain point of view about the company, its leadership, products or of political decisions. Common activities include speaking at conferences, winning industry awards, working with the press, and employee communication. { Rubel, Gina F., Everyday Public Relations for Lawyers, Doylestown, PA: 1 ed. 2007, ISBN 978-0-9801719-0-7 } The Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), founded by Richard Rotman, defined public relations in 1982 as, &quot; Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other. &quot; { PRSA&apos;s Old Definition of Public Relations, } { From the Public Relations Society of America Web site, http://prsa.org/pressroom/aboutpr.htm accessed in 2001. } According to the PRSA, the essential functions of public relations include research, planning, communication, dialogue and evaluation. In 2011/2012 the Society developed a crowd sourced definition which PRSA considers more accurate and descriptive: Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics. { From the Public Relations Society of America Web site, http://prsa.org/pressroom/aboutpr.htm accessed March 1, 2012. } It was announced on March 1, 2012 after a vote by public relations professionals.

Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd. Ed. Retrieved from findarticles.com } Others define it simply as the practice of managing communication between an organization and its publics. { Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations. (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984), 6e. Public relations is what you do with what you know and what other think about what you say. } The Europe an view of public relations notes that besides a relational form of interactivity there is also a reflective paradigm that is concerned with publics and the public sphere; not only with relational, which can in principle be private, but also with public consequences of organizational behavior { name=On the definition of public relations: a European view. } { Sciencedirect.com } A much broader view of interactive communication using the Internet, as outlined by Phillips and Young in Online Public Relations Second Edition (2009), describes the form and nature of Internet-mediated public relations. Specific public relations disciplines include: Financial public relations – providing information mainly to business reporter s Consumer/lifestyle public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service, rather than using advertising Crisis public relations – responding to negative accusations or information Industry relations – providing information to trade bodies Government relations – engaging government departments to influence policymaking Other public relations activities include: { publicity Publicists, Public Relations professionals at a } { Hollywood Red carpet. } Publicity events, pseudo-event s, photo op s or publicity stunt s Speeches to constituent groups and professional organizations; receptions; seminars, and other events; personal appearances Talk show circuit: a public relations spokesperson, or the client, &quot; does the circuit &quot; by being interviewed on television and radio talk shows with audiences that the client wishes to reach Books and other writings Collateral literature, both offline and online Direct communication (carrying messages directly to audiences, rather than via the mass media) with, for example, printed or email newsletters Blogs Social media and social networks After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field for a while, he or she accumulates a list of contacts in the media and elsewhere in the public affairs sphere. This &quot; Rolodex &quot; becomes a prized asset, and job announcements sometimes even ask for candidates with an existing Rolodex, especially those in the media relations area of public relations. Astroturfing is the act of public relations agencies placing blog and online forum messages for their clients, in the guise of a normal &quot; grassroots &quot; user or comment (an illegal practice across the larger practice areas such as the European Union ) [ History ] Edward Bernays was the self-appointed Father of Public Relations. &apos;&apos;See more at History of public relations The history of public relations is mostly confined to the early half of the twentieth century; however there is evidence of the practice scattered through history. One notable practitioner was Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire whose efforts on behalf of Charles James Fox in the 18th century included press relations, lobbying and, with her friends, celebrity campaigning. { Amanda Forman (2001), Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire, New York: Random House USA Inc; New Ed edition. ISBN 003757538340 } [ Invalid length. ] {. } A number of American precursors to public relations are found in the form of publicists who specialized in promoting circuses, theatrical performances, and other public spectacles. In the United States, where public relations has its origins, many early public relations practices were developed in support of railroads. In fact, many scholars believe that the first appearance of the term &quot; public relations &quot; appeared in the 1897 Year Book of Railway Literature. { W. Joseph Campbell &apos;&apos;1897 American journalism’s exceptional year&apos;&apos; – “The reference to “public relations” appears in the preface of The Yearbook of Railway Literature (Chicago: Railway Age, 1897).” } [ Salaries ] In the United States, public relations professionals earn an average annual salary of $49,800 which compares with £40,000 for a practitioner with a similar job in the UK [ April 2012 ]. Top earners make around $89,220 annually, while entry-level public relations specialists earn around $28,080. Corporate, or in-house communications is generally more profitable, and communications executives can earn salaries in the mid six-figures, though this only applies to a fraction of the sector&apos;s workforce. [ http://www.collegedegreereport.com/articles/public-relations-specialist-careers-employment-salary-trends-aspiring-public-relations-spec Public Relations Specialist Careers: Employment &amp; Salary Trends for Aspiring Public Relations Specialists ] The role of public relations professionals is changing because of the shift from traditional to online media. Many PR professionals are finding it necessary to learn new skills and to examine how social media can impact a brand&apos;s reputation. { NMA.co.uk } in pakistan it is 10000 only [ Methods, tools and tactics ] Traditional public relations tools include press release s and press kits which are distributed to the media to generate interest from the press. Other widely used tools include brochures, newsletters and annual reports. Increasingly, companies are utilizing interactive social media outlets, such as blog s, Microblogging and social media. Unlike the traditional tools which allowed for only one-way communication, social media outlets allow the organization to engage in two-way communication, and receive immediate feedback from various stakeholders. There are two types of Two-way communication, Two-way asymmetrical public relations and Two-way symmetrical public relations. An asymmetrical public relations model is unbalanced. In this model an organization gets feedback from the public and uses it as a basis for attempting to persuade the public to change. A symmetrical public relations model means that the organization takes the interests of the public into careful consideration and public relations practitioners seek a balance between the interest of their organization and the interest of the public. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content, with or without acknowledgment of the source. One emerging theme is the application of psychological theories of impression management. { Kamau, C. (2009) Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference.

The viral effect of social networks require adequate training and real-time social media monitoring in order to detect the early signs of breaking news. { Alan B. Bernstein and } { Cindy Rakowitz (2012). Emergency Public Relations: Crisis Management In a 3.0 World. p. 6. ISBN 978-1-4691-5954-6 } [ Targeting the public ] A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the target audience, and to tailor every message to appeal to that audience. It can be a general, nationwide or worldwide audience, but it is more often a segment of a population. A good elevator pitch can help tailor messaging to each target audience. Marketers often refer to socio-economically driven &quot; demographics &quot;, such as &quot; black males 18-49 &quot;. On the other hand stakeholders theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue. All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the charity and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. This is not always easy to do, and sometimes, especially in politics, a spokesperson or client says something to one audience that creates dissonance with another audience or group of stakeholders. [ Lobby groups ] Lobby group s are established to influence government policy, corporate policy, or public opinion. Such groups claim to represent a particular interest and in fact are dedicated to doing so. When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a front group. Moreover, governments may also lobby public relations firms in order to sway public opinion. A well illustrated example of this is the way civil war in Yugoslavia was portrayed. Governments of the newly seceded republics of Croatia and Bosnia, as well as Serbia invested heavily with UK and American public relations firms, so that they would give them a positive image in the USA. { See Peter Viggo Jakobsen, Focus on the CNN Effect Misses the Point: The Real Media Impact on Conflict Management is Invisible and Indirect, Journal of Peace Research, vol.37, no.2. Institute of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (2000). } [ Spin ] [ Spin (public relations) ] In public relations, spin is sometimes a pejorative term signifying a heavily biased portrayal in specific favor of an event or situation. While traditional public relations may also rely on creative presentation of the facts, spin often, though not always, implies disingenuous, deceptive and/or highly manipulative tactics. Politicians are often accused of spin by commentators and political opponents when they produce a counterargument or position. The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions ( cherry picking ), the so-called &quot; non-denial denial &quot;, phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, euphemism s for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news. A famous reference to this practice occurred when British Government press officer Jo Moore used the phrase &quot; It&apos;s now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury &quot;, (widely paraphrase d or misquoted as &quot; It&apos;s a good day to bury bad news &quot; ), in an email sent on the day of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The furor caused when this email was reported in the press eventually caused her to resign. Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called &quot; spin doctors &quot;, despite the negative connotation associated with the term. Perhaps the best-known person in the UK often described as a &quot; spin doctor &quot; is Alastair Campbell, who was involved with Tony Blair &apos;s public relations between 1994 and 2003, and also played a controversial role as press relations officer to the British and Irish Lions rugby union side during their 2005 tour of New Zealand. [ March 2010 ] State-run media in many countries also engage in spin by selectively allowing news stories that are favorable to the government while censoring anything that could be considered critical. They may also use propaganda to indoctrinate or actively influence citizens&apos; opinions. Privately run media may also use the same techniques of &quot; issue &quot; versus &quot; non-issue &quot; to spin its particular political viewpoints [ Negative PR ] Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR), is a process of destroying the target&apos;s reputation and/or corporate identity. In other words, instead of concentrating efforts in the maintenance and the creation of a positive reputation or image of your clients, the objective is to discredit someone else, usually a business rival. Unlike the regular services in public relations, those in DPR rely on the development of industries such as IT security, industrial espionage, social engineering and competitive intelligence. A common technique is finding all of the dirty secrets of their target and turning them against their very own holder. The building of a dark PR campaign, also known as a dirty tricks or a smear campaign is a long and a complex operation. Traditionally it starts with an extensive information gathering and follows the other needs of a precise competitive research. The gathered information is being used after that as a part of a greater strategical planning, aiming to destroy the relationship between the company, its shareholders and its customers. { Wattenberg, Martin P.

Opponents can be candidates, organizations and other groups of people. In the 2004 US presidential campaign, Howard Dean defined John Kerry as a &quot; flip-flopper, &quot; which was widely reported and repeated by the media, particularly the conservative media. Similarly, George H.W. Bush characterized Michael Dukakis as weak on crime (the Willie Horton ad) and hopelessly liberal ( &quot; a card-carrying member of the ACLU &quot; ). In 1996, President Bill Clinton seized upon opponent Bob Dole &apos;s promise to take America back to a simpler time, promising in contrast to &quot; build a bridge to the 21st century. &quot; This painted Dole as a person who was somehow opposed to progress. In the debate over abortion, self-titled pro-choice groups, by virtue of their name, defined their opponents as &quot; anti-choice &quot;, while self-titled pro-life groups refer to their opponents as &quot; pro-abortion &quot; or &quot; anti-life &quot;. [ Managing language ] If, in the USA, a politician or organization can use an apt phrase in relation to an issue in interviews or news releases, the news media will often repeat it verbatim, without questioning its aptness. This perpetuates both the message and whatever preconceptions might underlie it. Often, something that sounds innocuous can stand in for something greater; a &quot; culture of life &quot; sounds like general goodwill to most people, but will evoke opposition to abortion for many pro-life advocates. The phrase &quot; States&apos; rights &quot; was used as a code for anti- civil rights legislation in the United States in the 1960s, and allegedly in the 1970s and 1980s. [ Conveying the message ] The means by which a message is communicated can be as important as the message itself. Direct mail, robocall ing, advertising and public speaking are commonly used depending upon the intended audience and the message that is conveyed. Press releases are also used, but since many newspapers are folding in the USA, they have become a less reliable way of communicating for American practitioners, and other methods have become more popular. In the USA and India, news organizations have begun to rely more on their own websites and have developed a variety of unique approaches to publicity and public relations, on and off the web. { Promoting Theater in a World without Print } Israel has employed a series of Web 2.0 initiatives which are indicative of how a small nation can use internet mediated communication. Israel&apos;s initiative in 2008 included a blog, { Israel Video Blog aims to show the world &apos;the beautiful face of real Israel&apos;, Ynet, February 24, 2008. } MySpace page, { Israel seeks friends through MySpace page, Bobby Johnson, } { The Guardian, March 23, 2007. } YouTube channel, { Israel uses YouTube, Twitter to share its point of view, } { CNN, December 31, 2008 } Facebook page { Israel&apos;s New York Consulate launches Facebook page, Ynet, December 14, 2007. } and a political blog to reach different audiences. { Latest PR venture of Israel&apos;s diplomatic mission in New York attracts large Arab audience, Ynet, June 21, 2007. } The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs started the country&apos;s video blog as well as its political blog. The Foreign Ministry held the first microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Consul David Saranga answering live questions from a worldwide public in common text-messaging abbreviations. { Battlefront Twitter, Haviv Rettig Gur, } { The Jerusalem Post, December 30, 2008. } The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country&apos;s official political blog. { The Toughest Q&apos;s Answered in the Briefest Tweets, Noam Cohen, } { The New York Times, January 3, 2009; accessed January 5, 2009. } [ Front groups ] One of the most controversial practices in public relations is the use of front groups, organizations that purport to serve a public cause while actually serving the interests of a client whose sponsorship may be obscured or concealed. Critics of the public relations industry, such as PR Watch, contend that some public relations firms involve a &quot; multi-billion dollar propaganda-for-hire industry &quot; that &quot; concocts and spins the news, organizes phony grassroots front groups, spies on citizens, and conspires with lobbyists and politicians to thwart democracy. &quot; { PRWatch } Instances with the use of front groups as a public relations technique have been documented in many industries. Coal mining corporations have created &quot; environmental groups &quot; that contend that increased carbon dioxide emissions and global warming will contribute to plant growth and will be beneficial, trade group s for bars have created and funded citizens&apos; groups to attack anti-alcohol groups, tobacco companies have created and funded citizens&apos; groups to advocate for tort reform and to attack personal injury lawyer s, while trial lawyers have created &quot; consumer advocacy &quot; front groups to oppose tort reform.
