It stars Salma Hayek in her Academy Award nominated portrayal as Kahlo and Alfred Molina as her husband, Diego Rivera. The movie was adapted by Clancy Sigal, Diane Lake, Gregory Nava, Anna Thomas and Edward Norton (uncredited) from the book Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo by Hayden Herrera. It was directed by Julie Taymor. It won Oscars for Best Makeup and Best Original Music Score (recipient: Elliot Goldenthal ). [ Plot ] Frida begins with the trauma tic accident Frida Kahlo ( Salma Hayek ) suffered at the age of 18 when a car trolley collided with a bus she was riding. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a live-action scene with actors. Frida also details the artist&apos;s dysfunctional relationship with the mural ist Diego Rivera ( Alfred Molina ). When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego&apos;s appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera cheats on her with a wide array of women, while the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera. The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage, and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller ( Edward Norton ); as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two. Kahlo&apos;s sister Cristina moves in with the two at their San Ángel studio home to work as Rivera&apos;s assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into alcoholism. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house Leon Trotsky ( Geoffrey Rush ), who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his Coyoacán home. Kahlo leaves for Paris after Diego realizes she was unfaithful to him with Trotsky. When she returns to Mexico, he asks for a divorce. Soon afterwards, Trotsky is murdered in Mexico City. Rivera is temporarily a suspect, and Kahlo is incarcerated in his place when he is not found. Rivera helps get her released. Kahlo has her toes removed when they become gangrenous. Rivera asks her to remarry him, and she agrees. Her health continues to worsen, including the amputation of a leg, and she ultimately dies after finally having a solo exhibition of her paintings in Mexico.

The Brothers Quay -created stop motion animation sequence depicting the initial stages of Kahlo&apos;s recovery at the hospital after the trolley accident are inspired by the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead. The gown Valeria Golino wears at Kahlo&apos;s 1953 Mexican solo art exhibition is a replica of the dress her character Lupe Marín wore in Rivera&apos;s 1938 portrait of her. [ Production ] [ Development ] The film version of Frida Kahlo &apos;s life was initially championed by Nancy Hardin, a former book editor and Hollywood-based literary agent, turned early &quot; female studio executive &quot;, who, in the mid-1980s wished to &quot; make the transition to independent producing. &quot; Learning of Hayden Herrara &apos;s biography of Kahlo, Hardin saw Kahlo&apos;s life as very contemporary, her &quot; story... an emblematic tale for women torn between marriage and career. &quot; Optioning the book in 1988, Hardin &quot; tried to sell it as an epic love story in the tradition of Out of Africa, attracting tentative interest from actresses such as Meryl Streep and Jessica Lange, but rejection from the film studios. As Kahlo&apos;s art gained prominence, however ( &quot; [i]n May 1990 one of Kahlo&apos;s self-portraits sold at Sotheby&apos;s for $1.5 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a Latin American painting &quot; ), Madonna &quot; announced her plans to star in a film based on Frida&apos;s life &quot;, and Robert De Niro &apos;s Tribeca Productions reportedly &quot; envisioned a joint biography of Rivera and Kahlo. &quot; In the spring of 1991, director Luis Valdez began production on a New Line feature about Frida Kahlo starring Laura San Giacomo in the lead. San Giacomo&apos;s casting was objected due to her non- Hispanic ethnicity, and New Line bowed to the protests, and left the then-titled Frida and Diego in August 1992 citing finances. { The Book LA SUMMER 2000 Selma &amp; Frida } Hardin&apos;s project found itself swamped by similar ones: When I first tried to sell the project... there was no interest because nobody had heard of Frida. A few years later, I heard the exact opposite that there were too many Frida projects in development, and nobody wanted mine. Valdez was contacted early on by the then unknown in the US Salma Hayek, who sent &quot; her [promo] reel to the director and phoned his office &quot;, but was ultimately told she was then too young for the role. By 1993 Valdez had retitled the film The Two Fridas with San Giacomo and Ofelia Medina both playing the portraitist. { Kahlo biopic gets new wakeup call Entertainment News, International News, Media Variety } Raúl Juliá was cast as Diego Rivera, but his death further delayed the movie. At the same time, Hardin approached HBO, and with &quot; rising young development executive and producer &quot; Lizz Speed (a former assistant to Sherry Lansing ) intended to make a TVM, hopeful that Brian Gibson (director of &quot; What&apos;s Love Got to Do With It, the story of Tina Turner &quot; and The Josephine Baker Story) would direct. Casting difficulties proved insurmountable, but Speed joined Hardin in advocating the project, and after four years in development, the two took the project from HBO to Trimark and producer Jay Polstein (with assistant Darlene Caamaño ). At Trimark, Salma Hayek became interested in the role, having &quot; been fascinated by Kahlo&apos;s work from the time she was 13 or 14 &quot; although not immediately a fan: [ At that age I did not like her work... I found it ugly and grotesque. But something intrigued me, and the more I learned, the more I started to appreciate her work. There was a lot of passion and depth. Some people see only pain, but I also see irony and humor. I think what draws me to her is what Diego saw in her. She was a fighter. Many things could have diminished her spirit, like the accident or Diego&apos;s infidelities. But she wasn&apos;t crushed by anything. ] Hayek was so set on acting the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and (after his death) administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera&apos;s art, which Rivera had &quot; willed... to the Mexican people &quot;, bequeath[ing] the trust to Olmedo. Salma Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo&apos;s paintings from her, and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. According to Molina, &quot; She turned up backstage [of the Broadway play &apos;Art&apos; ] rather sheepishly and asked if I would like to play Diego &quot;. Molina went on to gain 35 pounds to play Rivera. { &quot; That Frida feeling &quot; | Culture | The Guardian } When producer Polstein left Trimark, however, the production faltered again, and Hayek approached Harvey Weinstein and Miramax, and the company purchased the film from Trimark; Julie Taymor came onto the project as Director. Meanwhile, in August 2000 it was announced that Jennifer Lopez would star in Valdez &apos; s take on the story, The Two Fridas, by then being produced by American Zoetrope. { Fascinated by Frida| Film | This is London } Nonetheless, it was Hayek and Miramax who began production in Spring, 2001 on what was to become simply titled Frida. { the writing studio: adaptation frida. Accessed April 10, 2008 } [ Release ] On August 29, 2002, the film made its world premiere opening the Venice International Film Festival. Frida&apos;s American premiere was at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles on October 14 of that year. It had its Mexican premiere on November 8, 2002 at Mexico City &apos;s Palace of Fine Arts.
