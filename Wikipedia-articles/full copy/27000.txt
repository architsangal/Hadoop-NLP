{ New York City as viewed from the } { World Trade Center in 1988 } German road sign, &apos;&apos;Verkehrsverbot bei Smog&apos;&apos; (No traffic allowed in smog conditions) Smog is a type of air pollution; the word &quot; smog &quot; was coined in the early 20th century as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog. [ Schwartz Cowan Ruth A Social History of American Technology 1997 Oxford University Press 978-0-19-504605-2 ] The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid 20th century. This kind of smog is caused by the burning of large amounts of coal within a city; this smog contains soot particulates from smoke, sulfur dioxide and other components.Modern smog, as found for example in Los Angeles, is a type of air pollution derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engine s and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. [ Origin of term ] Coinage of the term &quot; smog &quot; is generally attributed to Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper, &quot; Fog and Smoke &quot; for a meeting of the Public Health Congress. The July 26, 1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux, &quot; He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as &apos;smog.&apos; &quot; { Gaia Piazzesi 2006 } The following day the newspaper stated that &quot; Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog. &quot; &quot; Smog &quot; also appears in a January 19, 1893, Los Angeles Times article and is attributed to &quot; a witty English writer. &quot; [ Photochemical smog ] Photochemical smog was first described in the 1950s. It is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compound s in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles and ground-level ozone. { &quot; What is Smog? &quot;, Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, CCME.ca } This noxious mixture of air pollutants can include the following: Aldehydes Nitrogen oxide s, such as nitrogen dioxide Peroxyacyl nitrates Tropospheric ozone Volatile organic compounds All of these chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. [ Miller, Jr. George Tyler Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions (12th Edition) The Thomson Corporation 2002 Belmont 423 0-534-37697-5 ] Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well. { California in the beige cloud bank behind the } { Golden Gate Bridge. The brown coloration is due to the NOx in the photochemical smog. } [ Health effects ] { Los Angeles, circa 1954 } Smog is a serious problem in many cities and continues to harm human health. { USA Today } Ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. { Airnow.gov, &quot; Who is most at risk from ozone? &quot; } It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs&apos; working capacity, cause shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body&apos;s ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness. Hospital admissions and respiratory deaths often increase during periods when ozone levels are high. { CWAC.net, Ozone in } { Wisconsin } The U.S. EPA has developed an Air Quality Index to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. 8 hour average ozone concentrations of 85 to 104 ppbv are described as &quot; Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups &quot;, 105 ppbv to 124 ppbv as &quot; unhealthy &quot; and 125 ppb to 404 ppb as &quot; very unhealthy &quot;. { Airnow.gov } The &quot; very unhealthy &quot; range for some other pollutants are: 355 μg m −3 - 424 μg m −3 for PM10; 15.5 ppm - 30.4ppm for CO and 0.65 ppm - 1.24 ppm for NO 2. { EPA.gov } The Ontario Medical Association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in the province each year. { Wheels.ca, $3.83 to power hybrid plug-in for 6 days } A 20-year American Cancer Society study found that cumulative exposure also increases the likelihood of premature death from a respiratory disease, implying the 8-hour standard may be insufficient. { NPR.org, Smoggy Skies May Cause Respiratory Death } [ Areas affected ] { Beijing air on a day after rain (left) and a smoggy day (right) } Smog can form in almost any climate where industries or cities release large amounts of air pollution, such as smoke or gases. However, it is worse during periods of warmer, sunnier weather when the upper air is warm enough to inhibit vertical circulation. It is especially prevalent in geologic basins encircled by hills or mountains. It often stays for an extended period of time over densely populated cities or urban areas, and can build up to dangerous levels. [ London ] { Victorian } { London was notorious for its thick smogs, or &quot; } { pea-soupers &quot;, a fact that is often recreated (as here) to add an air of mystery to a period } { costume drama } In 1306, concerns over air pollution were sufficient for Edward I to (briefly) ban coal fires in London. { Environmentalgraffiti.com, Environmentalism in 1306 } In 1661, John Evelyn &apos;s Fumifugium suggested burning fragrant wood instead of mineral coal, which he believed would reduce coughing. The Ballad of Gresham College the same year describes how the smoke &quot; does our lungs and spirits choke, Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron. &quot; Severe episodes of smog continued in the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly in the winter, and were nicknamed &quot; pea-soupers &quot;. The Great Smog of 1952 darkened the streets of London and killed approximately 4,000 people in the short time of 4 days (a further 8,000 [ Bell Michelle L. Michelle L. Bell, Devra L. Davis, Tony Fletcher 2004 January A Retrospective Assessment of Mortality from the London Smog Episode of 1959: The Role of Influenza and Pollution Environ Health Perspect 112 1 6–8 10.1289/ehp.6539 http://www.ehponline.org/members/2003/6539/6539.html 14698923 1241789 ] died from its effects in the following weeks and months). Initially a flu epidemic was blamed for the loss of life. In 1956 the Clean Air Act started legally enforcing smokeless zone s in the capital. There were areas where no soft coal was allowed to be burned in homes or in businesses, only coke, which produces no smoke. Because of the smokeless zones, reduced levels of sooty particulates made the intense and persistent London smog a thing of the past. It was after this that the great clean-up of London began. One by one, historical buildings which, during the previous two centuries had gradually completely blackened externally, had their stone facades cleaned and restored to their original appearance. Victorian buildings whose appearance changed dramatically after cleaning included the British Museum of Natural History. A more recent example was the Palace of Westminster, which was cleaned in the 1980s. Smog caused by traffic pollution, however, does still occur in modern London. [ Mexico City ] Due to its location in a highland &quot; bowl &quot;, cold air sinks down onto the urban area of Mexico City, trapping industrial and vehicle pollution underneath, and turning it into the most infamously smog-plagued city of Latin America. Within one generation, the city has changed from being known for some of the cleanest air of the world into one with some of the worst pollution, with pollutants like nitrogen dioxide being double or even triple international standards. { SBC.ac.at, Air pollution in Mexico City, } { University of Salzburg } Photochemical Smog Over Mexico City December 2010. [ Santiago (Chile) ] Similar to Mexico City, the air pollution of Santiago valley located between the Andes and Chilean Coast Range turning it into the most infamously smog-plagued city of South America. Other aggravant of the situation resides in its high latitude (31 degrees South) and dry weather at most part of the year. [ Tehran ] In December 2005, schools and public offices had to close in Tehran, Iran and 1600 people were taken to hospital, in a severe smog blamed largely on unfiltered car exhaust. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4516430.stm Hundreds treated over Tehran smog BBC News 2005-12-10 2006-08-03 ] [ United States ] { NASA astronaut photograph of a smog layer over central } { New York. } { National Ambient Air Quality Standards are not met, as of June 2007. } Smog was brought to the attention of the general US public in 1933 with the publication of the book &quot; Stop That Smoke &quot;, by Henry Obermeyer, a New York public utility official, in which he pointed out the effect on human life and even the destruction of [ 3000 acre km2 ] of a farmer&apos;s spinach crop. { &quot; Cities Unit in Concerted Drive Again Air Laden With Health Destroying Impurities &quot;, October 1933, Popular Science } Since then, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated over 300 U.S. counties to be non-attainment areas for one or more pollutants tracked as part of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. { EPA.gov, The Green Book Nonattainment Areas, Green Book | } These areas are largely clustered around large metropolitan areas, with the largest contiguous non-attainment zones in California and the Northeast. Various U.S. and Canadian government agencies collaborate to produce real-time air quality maps and forecasts. { Airnow.gov } [ Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley ] Being in low basins surrounded by mountains, Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley are notorious for their smog. The millions of vehicles in these basins plus the added effects of the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles/ Long Beach port complexes contribute to further air pollution. While strict regulations by the multiple California government agencies overseeing this problem have reduced the number of Stage 1 smog alerts from several hundred annually to just a few, these geologically predisposed entrapment zones collect pollution levels from cars, trucks and fixed sources which still exceeds health standards and is a pressing issue for the more than 25 million people who live there.

Farmers and plantation owners are usually responsible for the fires, which they use to clear tracts of land for further plantings. Those fires mainly affect Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and occasionally Guam and Saipan. { SaigpanTribune.com } { Sun2Surf.com } The economic losses of the fires in 1997 have been estimated at more than US$9 billion. { Asean.org, ASEAN secreatriat on smog cost } This includes damages in agriculture production, destruction of forest lands, health, transportation, tourism, and other economic endeavours. Not included are social, environmental, and psychological problems and long-term health effects. The latest bout of haze to occur in Malaysia, Singapore and the Malacca Straits is in October 2006, and was caused by smoke from fires in Indonesia being blown across the Straits of Malacca by south-westerly winds. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) reacted and signed Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, formed a Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) and established a co-ordination and support unit (CSU). { Asean.org } RHAP, with the help of Canada, established a monitoring and warning system for forest/vegetation fires and implemented a Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). The Malaysian Meteorological Service (MMS) { KJC.gov.my } has issued a daily rating since September 2003. The Indonesians have been ineffective at enforcing legal policies on errant farmers. [ Natural causes ] An erupting volcano can also emit high levels of sulphur dioxide along with a large quantity of particulate matter; two key components to the creation of smog. However, the smog created as a result of a volcanic eruption is often known as &quot; vog &quot; [ November 2010 ] to distinguish it as a natural occurrence. The radiocarbon content of some plant life has been linked to the distribution of smog in some areas. For example; presence of Creosote bush in the Los Angeles area has been shown to have an effect on smog distribution that is more than fossil fuel combustion alone. { http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg &amp; _imagekey=B6V7X-48XDN58-3H-1 &amp; _cdi=5854 &amp; _user=7209612 &amp; _pii=0160412081901136 &amp; _origin=search &amp; _coverDate=12%2F31%2F1981 &amp; _sk=999949998 &amp; view=c &amp; wchp=dGLzVzz-zSkzV &amp; md5=b5a34a715396bf9618677e5f389bd00b &amp; ie=/sdarticle.pdf } [ Pollution index ] { São Paulo } The severity of smog is often measured using automated optical instruments such as Nephelometer s, as haze is associated with visibility and traffic control in ports. Haze however can also be an indication of poor air quality though this is often better reflected using accurate purpose built air indexes such as the American Air Quality Index, the Malaysian API (Air Pollution Index) and the Singaporean Pollutant Standards Index. In hazy conditions, it is likely that the index will report the suspended particulate level. The disclosure of the responsible pollutant is mandated in some jurisdictions. The Malaysian API does not have a capped value; hence its most hazardous readings can go above 500. Above 500, a state of emergency is declared in the affected area. Usually, this means that non-essential government services are suspended, and all ports in the affected area are closed. There may also be prohibitions on private sector commercial and industrial activities in the affected area excluding the food sector. So far, state of emergency rulings due to hazardous API levels were applied to the Malaysian towns of Port Klang, Kuala Selangor and the state of Sarawak during the 2005 Malaysian haze and the 1997 Southeast Asian haze.

Similarly, Edinburgh was known as &quot; Auld Reekie &quot;. The smogs feature in many London novels as a motif indicating hidden danger or a mystery, perhaps most overtly in Margery Allingham &apos;s The Tiger in the Smoke (1952), but also in Dickens &apos; Bleak House (1852) and T.S. Eliot &apos;s The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. The 1970 made-for-TV movie A Clear and Present Danger, which featured Hal Holbrook, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Campanella, Jack Albertson and Pat Hingle, was one of the first American television network entertainment programs to warn about the problem of smog and air pollution.
