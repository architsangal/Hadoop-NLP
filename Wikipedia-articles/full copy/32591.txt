Forrest Jamie December 18, 2007 Serious Eats July 9, 2010 ] Vegetarianism can be adopted for different reasons. Many object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, along with the concept of animal rights. Other motivations for vegetarianism include health, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic or economic. There are varieties of the diet as well: an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs, and an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products. A vegan diet excludes all animal product s, including eggs, dairy, and honey. Various packaged or processed foods, including cake, cookies, chocolate and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, and may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. { Things to look out for if you are a vegetarian/vegan, The } { Vegetarian Society, December 11, 2010. } Often, products are scrutinized by vegetarians for animal-derived ingredients prior to purchase or consumption.

In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; { Spencer p. 252–253, 261–262. } Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. The International Vegetarian Union, a union of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the 20th century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns. [ Varieties of vegetarianism ] { Kullu, India. } There are a number of types of vegetarianism, which exclude or include various foods. Ovo vegetarianism includes eggs but not dairy products. Lacto vegetarianism includes dairy products but not eggs. Ovo-lacto vegetarianism (or lacto-ovo vegetarianism) includes animal/dairy products such as eggs, milk, and honey. Veganism excludes all animal flesh and animal products, including milk, honey, and eggs, and may also exclude any products tested on animals, or any clothing from animals. What is a Vegan?, Vegan Society (UK), accessed May 12, 2010. Raw veganism includes only fresh and uncooked fruit, nuts, seeds, and vegetables. Vegetables can only be cooked up to a certain temperature. International Vegetarian Union (IVU), accessed May 2, 2010. Fruitarianism permits only fruit, nuts, seeds, and other plant matter that can be gathered without harming the plant. Mangels, AR.

Buddhist vegetarianism (also known as su vegetarianism) excludes all animal products as well as vegetables in the allium family (which have the characteristic aroma of onion and garlic): onion, garlic, scallions, leeks, or shallots. Jain vegetarianism includes dairy but excludes eggs and honey, as well as root vegetables. Macrobiotic diet s consist mostly of whole grain s and bean s. Within the &apos;ovo-&apos; groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example), however such distinction is typically not specifically addressed. Some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals&apos; skin, bones and connective tissue ), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of such ingredients.

In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as &quot; flexitarian &quot;. These diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include: pescetarianism, which includes fish and some other forms of seafood; pollotarianism, which includes poultry; &quot; pollo-pescetarian &quot;, which includes poultry and fish, or &quot; white meat &quot; only; macrobiotic diet s consisting mostly of whole grains and beans, but may sometimes include fish. Semi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups who state that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.

Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the &quot; lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts &quot;.

This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that &quot; the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population &quot; at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women.

In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses, or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein. Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat. [ Ethics of killing for food ] Princeton University professor and founder of the animal liberation movement, Peter Singer, believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book Animal Liberation listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutritional value is not sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards. [ Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive Environmental Values 2001 103 10 1 10.3197/096327101129340769 David Benatar ] Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This does not excuse cruelty, but it does mean animals are not morally equivalent to humans and do not possess the rights a human has. { http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SH2b } [ Treatment of animals ] Ethical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.

[ http://www.sikhs.org/meat.htm The Sikhism Home Page Sikhs.org 1980-02-15 2009-08-29 ] [ Hinduism ] [ Diet in Hinduism ] Most major paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal. There are three main reasons for this: the principle of nonviolence ( ahimsa ) applied to animals; { Tähtinen, Unto: Ahimsa. Non-Violence in Indian Tradition, London 1976, p. 107–109. } the intention to offer only &quot; pure &quot; (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; { Mahabharata 12.257 (note that Mahabharata 12.257 is 12.265 according to another count); Bhagavad Gita 9.26; Bhagavata Purana 7.15.7. } and the conviction that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and dairy products, so they are lacto-vegetarians. However, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community and according to regional traditions. Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe Jhatka meat.

Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because this would involve the killing of plants. Instead they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of plants. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed. Jains hold self termination from starvation as the ideal state and some dedicated monks do perform this act of self annihilation. This is for them an indispensable condition for spiritual progress. { &quot; Vegetarianism Good For The Self And Good For The Environment &quot; at The Jain Study Circle } { &quot; Spiritual Traditions and Vegetarianism &quot; } [ October 2009 ] { at the Vegetarian Society of Colorado website. } Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians. { Matthews, Warren: World Religions, 4th edition, Belmont: Thomson/Wadsworth 2004, p. 180. ISBN 0-534-52762-0 } Honey is forbidden, because its collection is seen as violence against the bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up. { &quot; Jainism &quot; at JainUniversity.org } [ Buddhism ] A vegetarian dinner at a Japanese Buddhist temple [ Vegetarianism in Buddhism ] Theravadins in general eat meat. { Dharma Data: Vegetarianism.

In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them to eat meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh { Mahavagga Pali – Bhesajjakkhandhaka – Vinaya Pitaka } ) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made [ December 2011 ]. In several Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha instructs his followers to avoid meat. { Life as a Vegetarian Tibetan Buddhist Practitioner. Serv-online.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-25. } { Apparitions of the Self: The Secret Autobiographies of a Tibetan Visionary } { &apos;&apos;The life of Shabkar: the autobiography of a Tibetan yogin &apos;&apos;, page 541 } { Angulimaliya Sutra } However, each branch of Mahayana Buddhism selects which sutra to follow, and some branches, including the majority of Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists, do eat meat, while many Chinese Buddhist branches do not. [ Sikhism ] [ Diet in Sikhism ] The tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, { &quot; Misconceptions About Eating Meat &quot;, Sikhism Home Page } { I.J. Singh, Sikhs and Sikhism, Manohar, Delhi ISBN 978-81-7304-058-0: &quot; Throughout Sikh history, there have been movements or subsects of Sikhism which have espoused vegetarianism.

This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic halal diet. &quot; Amritdharis &quot; that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari { Jane Srivastava, &quot; Vegetarianism and Meat-Eating in 8 Religions &quot;, } { Hinduism Today, Spring 2007.

Retrieved 2010-12-28. } This vegetarian stance has been traced back to the times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food ( Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth&apos;s resources and thus on life. [ http://www.sikhs.org/meat_gn.htm Sikhism Home Page Sikhs.org 2009-08-09 ] [ Singh Prithi Pal The History of Sikh Gurus Lotus Press New Delhi 2006 38 3 Guru Amar Das 81-8382-075-1 http://books.google.com/?id%3DEhGkVkhUuqoC ] Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that it is &quot; foolish &quot; to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: &quot; Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian? &quot; The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma. [ Judaism ] { Israel } While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Jewish religion (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama ) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. Therefore, their concern was with regard to possible harmful effects upon human character rather than with animal welfare. Indeed, Rabbi Joseph Albo maintains that renunciation of the consumption of meat for reasons of concern for animal welfare is not only morally erroneous but even repugnant. [ http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid%3D107.html J. David Bleich – Contemporary Halakhic Problems Innernet.org.il 2009-08-09 ] One modern-day scholar who is often cited as in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals. In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi David Cohen, known as the &quot; Nazirite &quot; of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook&apos;s circle were also vegetarians. According to some Kabbalists, only a mystic, who is able to sense and elevate the reincarnated human souls and &quot; divine sparks &quot;, is permitted to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet.

Pick } The Torah also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter ( shechita ). According to medieval sage Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, author of the Torah commentary Kli Yakar, the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat. { &quot; The Vision of Eden: Animal Welfare and Vegetarianism &quot; in &quot; Jewish Law and Mysticism &quot;, Orot 2003 } [ Classical Greek and Roman ] Ancient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. Pythagoras was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be. Socrates was reportedly vegetarian, and in his dialogue of what people, or at least Philosopher-rulers, in an ideal republic should eat, he described only vegetarian food. He specified that if meat-eating was allowed, then society would require more doctors. { Plato, The Republic. } Roman writer Ovid concluded his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human. [ Everything changes; nothing dies; the soul roams to and fro, now here, now there, and takes what frame it will, passing from beast to man, from our own form to beast and never dies...Therefore lest appetite and greed destroy the bonds of love and duty, heed my message!

Melville, Oxford University Press, 1986. ] [ Christianity ] [ Christian vegetarianism ] Vegetarianism is not a common practice in current Christian culture. However, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet.

[ http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/pr_fasting.aspx Living an Orthodox Life: Fasting Orthodoxinfo.com 1997-05-27 2010-02-03 ] There is also a strong association between the Quakers and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century. The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends&apos; Vegetarian Society in 1902 &quot; to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends. &quot; [ http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/quakers.html The Great War and the Interwar Period ivu.org 2009-08-14 ] [ Islam ] [ Islam and animals ] Followers of Islam, or Muslims, have the freedom of choice to be vegetarian for medical reasons or if they do not personally like the taste of meat. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing. { Muslims can’t be vegetarian? Retrieved 5/16/2008 } Vegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Râbi‘ah al-‘Adawîyah of Basrah, who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. { Vegetarian quotations from Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Retrieved 5/16/2008 } The former Indian president Dr. A.

However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole. [ Bahá&apos;í Faith ] While there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá&apos;í Faith, `Abdu&apos;l-Bahá, the son of the religion&apos;s founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick.

While Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá&apos;í Faith stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, [ Writings Concerning Health, Healing, and Nutrition http://bahai-library.com/compilation_health_healing_nutrition#III 25 May 2009 Research Department, Universal House of Justice ] both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá&apos;ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá&apos;í practice and that Bahá&apos;ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others&apos; beliefs.

[ May 2010 ] [ Environment and diet ] [ Environmental vegetarianism ] Environmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a &quot; massive scale &quot; to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that &quot; the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. &quot; [ http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM Livestock&apos;s long shadow – Environmental issues and options Fao.org 2009-08-09 ] In addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO 2 equivalents. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. { EPA. 2011. Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990-2009. United States Environmental Protection Agency. EPA 430-R-11-005. 459 pp. } This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents. Meat produced in a laboratory (called in vitro meat ) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat.

An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the Worldwatch Institute, &quot; Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world&apos;s chronically hungry. &quot; { Worldwatch Institute, News July 2, 1998, United States Leads World Meat Stampede } Taiwanese Buddhist cuisine [ Demographics ] A research study conducted on more than 8,000 people, and published in the British Medical Journal, suggested that children with an above-average IQ may have a higher chance of becoming vegetarians in their adulthood. { Children with a high IQ are more likely to become vegetarian :: University of Southampton.
