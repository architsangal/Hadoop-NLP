A party of surveyors commissioned by George Washington noted the site appeared to have been struck by a hurricane, { ::City of Hurricane:: } giving rise to the name. Less than [ 17 mi ] southeast of Hurricane is a post office named Tornado. A town named Hurricane Bridge was located where West Virginia Route 34 now crosses the creek, near current-day Hurricane. The town can be traced back to an 1811 Virginia map. The town primarily consisted of a small inn. On March 28, 1863, Union and Confederate forces fought a Civil War battle at Hurricane Bridge, now known as the Skirmish at Hurricane Bridge. { Skirmish at Hurricane Bridge } Hurricane itself can be traced back to 1873, when a railroad track was laid through the town and a small depot was constructed. It was during this period that Main Street developed, and other businesses in the area. Hurricane was a trading and residential town for tobacco growers and other farmers in the early 1900s. The fire department was established March 2, 1936. It was incorporated as a town in 1888, and as a city in the 1970s. The three oldest continuously operating businesses are: The Hurricane Breeze, a weekly newspaper established October 1900 Putnam County Bank, established October 25, 1901 Rappold&apos;s Barber Shop, established June 1906 In the early 1990s, the old depot, which once served as the catalyst for the town&apos;s development, was torn down and replaced with a small gazebo. It was also during the 1990s that the city began to see a surge in urban growth as several subdivisions were established in the city limits. The population increase resulted in the widening of Route 34, a connecting road to Teays Valley, and an expansion of Hurricane High School. In 2002, a winning multi-state Powerball ticket was sold at a convenience store in Teays Valley near the city of Hurricane. The winning ticketholder was Jack Whittaker.
