By early 1993, the show&apos;s rating picked up and TVNZ renewed the production. Today, it is one of New Zealand&apos;s highest-rated shows, frequently making AGB Nielsen Media Research&apos;s top 5 programmes of the week. [ History ] After the cancellation of Gloss, Television New Zealand noticed the lack of New Zealand content on their show and in 1990 set about creating a local equivalent of Australian soap Neighbours.

[ Shorty road to success http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv/3728697/Shorty-road-to-success stuff.co.nz 23 May 2010 September 2011 Bennett, Cath Fairfax Media ] Caterina De Nave was hired as the show&apos;s producer and subsequently travelled to Australia to work with Grundy Television to work out an idea for the five times a week soap. TV2 programmer Bettina Hollings suggested the setting of a hospital after reading an article detailing ideal locations of a drama, which included a hospital, a police station and a school. De Nave worked with several storyliners including Jason Daniel and they worked out an outline of the show. De Nave noticed Neighbours and Home and Away had a generally straight forward Australian cast and wished for the cast of her show to be culturally diverse to reflect New Zealand. She also wanted the cast to have strong female characters to attract the necessary female audience. Daniel created the character of Kirsty while De Nave created Meredith and Ken Catran created Hone. The character of Stuart was originally planned to be gay but the plans made TVNZ nervous and were scrapped. De Nave also wished to counter-stereotype races and made Polynesian Sam Aleni a paramedic as there was only one paramedic of Polynesian descent throughout New Zealand. De Nave decided to make the setting that of a private hospital as it reflected New Zealand medicine at the time. The working title was The Shortland Street Project after its planned filming location in a TVNZ-owned studio at 74 Shortland Street in Auckland Central. However, the studio was found to be too small for the required sets, and the production studio was moved to a warehouse in Browns Bay. After running through many name options, the original working title was chosen and subsequently truncated to simply Shortland Street.

Ratings were originally high after a successful marketing campaign but fell steadily throughout the year until 1993 when they rose dramatically. The show would have been cancelled in the first year if it was not for the fact TVNZ ordered a years worth of episodes. With high public interest in the show and a viewing figure of a constant 600,000, Shortland Street received more sets and the nursing uniform which was considered outdated was redone. In 2000 an Australian consultant drastically changed the show so that it would suit the 21st century tone of New Zealand.

From 29 March 1993, Central Television were the first ITV region to screen the soap, beginning in an afternoon timeslot, 1520-1550. From 1994 to 2000, it was shown in an early evening timeslot, at either 1710-1740 and, later at 1730-1800. Other ITV regions also screened Shortland Street at their own pace, usually during daytime although some ( HTV and Granada ) followed Central&apos;s early-evening example for a short time. Scottish Television have never shown Shortland Street. Central eventually moved the serial to a lunchtime slot, 1300-1330 from September 2000 and it remained here for over two years. From January 2003, the Carlton -owned ITV regions including Central, Westcountry, HTV and Carlton-London networked Shortland Street in an afternoon slot, 1430–1500, Monday to Wednesday, with a Thursday episode added a few months later. A special programme was aired (presented by Michael Galvin and Angela Bloomfield ) introducing new viewers to the show whilst viewers in other regions had to endure a massive jump in storylines to join up with Central who were considerably ahead (up to 5  years in some cases). Meanwhile, the Granada-owned regions, such as Yorkshire Television and Meridian dropped the series entirely, opting for local programming instead. However, Shortland Street failed to attract a significant audience in its new afternoon slot and it was axed completely by ITV and was last shown on 28 August 2003, finishing at episode 2367. Central had shown the serial consecutively for over 10  years, leaving many fans in the Midlands very disappointed. Almost 7  years later, it was announced on 5 August 2010, that Shortland Street would return to British television on 23 August 2010 on Living TV.
