[ July 2011 ] [ 1998 11 25 ] { 95 minutes } { English } { $60  million } { $363,398,565 } A Bug&apos;s Life is a 1998 American computer animated adventure comedy film produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures in the United States on November 25, 1998. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, the film is the second Disney-Pixar feature film after Toy Story, and the third American computer-animated film after Toy Story and DreamWorks &apos; Antz. Based on Akira Kurosawa &apos;s film Seven Samurai, and Aesop &apos;s fable &quot; The Ant and the Grasshopper &quot;, it tells the tale of an oddball individualist inventor ant named Flik who hires what he thinks are &quot; warrior bugs &quot; — actually circus performers — to fight off a small band of grasshoppers who have made the ant colony their servants. The film received positive reception and was a box office success. [ Plot ] { Flik is an individualist and would-be inventor in a colony of ants — led by Princess Atta and her mother, The Queen — living on a small island in the middle of a creek. Flik is different and always unappreciated because of his inventions causing trouble. The colony is constantly oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers who arrive every season demanding food from the ants. However, when an offering that the ants were putting together to appease the grasshoppers is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik&apos;s latest invention, a harvester device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food at the end of the season. Given a temporary reprieve by the grasshoppers, the ants pretend to agree to Flik&apos;s plan to recruit &quot; warrior bugs &quot; to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as a fool&apos;s errand to get rid of Flik. } Flik finds his way to the &quot; big city &quot; (a heap of trash under a trailer), where he mistakes a group of circus bugs, whose act collapses into chaos, for the warrior bugs he&apos;s seeking. The bugs meanwhile mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island. The bugs earn the ants&apos; respect after they save the Queen&apos;s youngest daughter, Dot, from a bird. The bird attack inspires Flik into making a plan to build a fake bird that they can use to scare Hopper away, leader of the grasshoppers, who is deeply afraid of bug-eating birds. Eventually, the troupe&apos;s former ringmaster, P.T. Flea, arrives searching for the circus bugs. Angered at Flik&apos;s deception, the ants exile him. The ants desperately try to pull together enough food for a new offering to the grasshoppers, but are unable to do so. After overhearing Hopper&apos;s plan to kill the queen after the offering, Dot leaves in search of Flik and convinces him to return and save the colony with his original plan. The plan nearly works, but P.T. Flea mistakes the model for a real bird and sets it on fire, causing Hopper to realize that he has been tricked. He orders Flik to be beaten, and before finishing him off Princess Atta steps in and defends Flik, prompting the rest of the colony to stand up to the grasshoppers and drive them out of the colony. In the chaos, Hopper viciously pursues Flik, who leads him to an actual bird&apos;s nest, where he is ultimately eaten by the bird and its chicks, ending his menace. Some time later, Flik has been welcomed back to the colony, and the circus bugs join him in a celebration; he and Atta are now a couple, and Atta is crowned the new Queen. The circus troupe then departs as Flik, Atta and Dot watch and wave farewell from a tree branch. [ Cast ] Dave Foley as Flik: An ant who wants to make a difference for his colony.

[ Production ] In 1988, Disney had considered producing a film entitled &quot; Army Ants &quot;, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony. However, the idea never fully materialized. [ http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm Antz vs. Bugs Business Week November 23, 1998 ] In 1994, while working on Toy Story, John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter and Joe Ranft attended a lunch to discuss future projects. They talked about doing Aesop &apos;s fable &quot; The Ant and the Grasshopper &quot;, but with a twist. They eventually decided that instead of having the Grasshopper beg for food, it would demand it. { Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, A Bugs Life, The inspiration } The Japanese film Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa influenced the story. In early versions, Flik was an ant named Red and was part of P.T&apos;s Circus. However this created several story problems and he was changed to the ant sent to hire the warrior bugs. { A Bugs Life, DVD Commentary } The characters of &quot; Tuck and Roll &quot; were inspired by a drawing that Andrew Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in Second Grade. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Award s (Spacey being there for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for The Usual Suspects and Lasseter being there for Academy Special Achievement Award for Toy Story). When Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper, Spacey was delighted. For research, Pixar ordered a tiny camera, put Lego wheels on it, attached it to a stick and named it the &quot; Bug-Cam &quot;. The &quot; Bug-Cam &quot; was then wheeled out onto the garden of Pixar in order to see what small objects looked like from a bugs point of view. The artists were amazed by the translucency of the world. Lasseter claimed &quot; It was like living in a world of stained glass windows. &quot; The animators also studied the movement of insects to apply to the characters. { A Bugs Life, DVD Behind the Scenes } The technical artists created crowd simulation, allowing the film makers to create over 430 shots with over 800 characters in the frame without having to animate every single ant. The animators would only animate 4–5 groups of approximately 8 individual universal ants. Each one of these universal ants would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different eye color, different skin color, different heights, different weights etc.). This made sure that no two ants were the same. DreamWorks Animation &apos;s similar film Antz was released a little more than a month before A Bug&apos;s Life. DreamWorks&apos; Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 and said the idea for Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Pixar head John Lasseter said he felt &quot; betrayed &quot; when he learned Antz was scheduled for release before A Bug&apos;s Life. According to Lasseter and Steve Jobs, Katzenberg offered to stop development of Antz if Disney moved the release date of A Bug&apos;s Life, which was coming out opposite DreamWorks Animation&apos;s The Prince of Egypt. Pixar refused. The release date of Antz was moved up from March 1999 to October 1998 in response to Pixar&apos;s refusal. [ http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm Of Ants, Bugs, and Rug Rats: The Story of Dueling Bug Movies AP October 2, 1998 ] Even though A Bug&apos;s Life was the first to be pitched, Antz was finished and released first. A Bug&apos;s Life, however, was a bigger success.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 81 reviews, with an average score of 7.9/10. The critical consensus is &quot; Blending top notch animation with rousing adventure, witty dialogue, and memorable characters, A Bug&apos;s Life is another Pixar winner. &quot; [ http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bugs_life/ A Bug&apos;s Life Movie Reviews, Pictures Rotten Tomatoes June  7, 2009 ] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 77 based on 23 reviews. &quot; [ http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-bugs-life/ A Bug&apos;s Life Reviews, Ratings, and more at Metacritic Metacritic July  22, 2011 ] [ Box office ] A Bug&apos;s Life grossed approximately $33,258,052 on its opening weekend, ranking #1 for that weekend. It managed to retain its #1 spot for two weeks. The film eventually made $162.7  million in its United States theatrical run, covering its estimated production costs of $45  million. The film made $200,600,000 in foreign countries. The film made a worldwide gross of $363.3  million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation &apos;s Antz. [ Awards ] [ List of Pixar awards and nominations (feature films)#A Bug&apos;s Life ] [ American Film Institute ] The American Film Institute nominated A Bug&apos;s Life for its Top 10 Animated Films list. { AFI&apos;s 10 Top 10 Ballot } [ Release ] [ section January 2012 ] [ Home media ] The DVD of the film was the first wholly digital transfer of a feature film to a digital playback medium. No analog processes came between the creation of the computer images and their representation on the DVD. The pan and scan or &apos;full screen&apos; version of the video (on the DVD as well as VHS releases) has been reframed and restaged; rather than sacrifice image in some parts of the film, the frame has been extended or objects moved to fit the narrower aspect ratio. Pixar continued this process on its later video releases. Also, different characters (Flik, Dot, Francis, Hopper, and Heimlich) were on one (by themselves) cover of the video cover, considered a collectible in many cases. [ December 2010 ] To show off its new DVD capabilities, a copy of the film was included with the Apple iMac DV, which made its debut on October 8, 1997. A laserdisc version was also released in Japan by Pioneer, one of the last. The film was released on August 15, 2000 on VHS and DVD in the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection. The widescreen version of the film preserves its original aspect ratio of 2.40:1. A Bug&apos;s Life is the first fully computer animated feature to be created with this ratio. A set of &quot; fluffs &quot; and &quot; outtakes &quot; was included, in which various animated characters corpse or &quot; blow &quot; their dialog. In one, Flik yells the line &quot; To infinity, and beyond! &quot;, quoting Buzz Lightyear from an earlier Pixar film, Toy Story. Later, Woody leans into view with an upside down clapperboard to mark the end of a botched take. On July 19, 2005, another DVD was released as a Special Edition. This DVD is fully remastered and has substantial bonus features about the film, and is the current DVD release today. On May 19, 2009, a Blu-ray version was released. These versions included a DisneyFile Digital Copy.
