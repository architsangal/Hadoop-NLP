[ Coffee Creek ] Coffee Creek flows through an area that includes downtown Chesterton. The Coffee Creek Watershed Preserve includes a restored section of the creek and its associated wetland. [ Issues ] [ Effluent Discharge ] Chesterton is known for dumping hundreds to thousands of gallons of sewage into the nearby Little Calumet River every year during almost all rainfall events. The Little Calumet River then flows to Lake Michigan. Most days after a heavy rainstorm nearby beaches are then closed because of high e.coli counts. The Chesterton Tribune reports any or all waste water treatment plant bypasses. In the Spring of 2010, this is to be fixed permanently when the City is slated to undergo a complete re-working of the sewer systems in the downtown area and other sections of town. The downtown sewer system replacement project was placed on hold this year due to the congestion caused by the enormous roadway re-alignment project already in progress located at Calumet Avenue, State Road 49, and County Road 1100 North.
