Located at 4 Yawkey Way, it has served as the home ballpark of the Boston Red Sox baseball club since it opened in 1912 and is the oldest Major League Baseball stadium currently in use. It is one of two &quot; classic &quot; Major League ballparks still in use, the other being Chicago&apos;s Wrigley Field and it is considered to be one of the best-known sports venues in the United States. Because of the ballpark&apos;s age and constrained location in the dense Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood, the park has had many renovations and additions over the years not initially envisioned, resulting in unique, quirky features, including &quot; The Triangle, &quot; &quot; Pesky&apos;s Pole &quot;, and most notably the famous Green Monster in left field. The Red Sox have sold out every home game since May 15, 2003; in 2008, the park sold out its 456th consecutive Red Sox game, breaking a Major League Baseball record. Fans who attended this game received gifts to celebrate this accomplishment. As of April 17, 2012, the Red Sox have had 717 consecutive sellouts, which is the longest such streak in Major League Baseball history.

In addition to Major League Baseball, Fenway Park has been the site of many other sporting and cultural events, including professional football games for the Boston Redskins and the Boston Patriots, concerts, soccer and hockey games, political and religious campaigns. April 20, 2012 marked Fenway Park&apos;s centennial, and the Red Sox made plans for the celebration, such as a distinctive commemorative logo just as they did for Fenway&apos;s 75th and 90th birthdays. On March 7, 2012, the park was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The score is still updated by hand today from behind the wall (except the National League scores which need to be changed out on the field). In 1946, upper deck seats were installed; Fenway Park is essentially the first double-tiered ballpark in Boston since the South End Grounds of the 1880s. In 1947, arc light s were installed at Fenway Park. The Boston Red Sox were the third-to-last team out of 16 major league teams to have lights in their home park. In 1976, metric distances were added to the conventionally-stated distances because it was thought that the United States would adopt the metric system. Today, few American ballparks have metric distances posted. Fenway Park retained the metric measurement until mid-season 2002, when they were painted over. Also, Fenway&apos;s first message board was added over the center field bleachers. In 1999 the auxiliary press boxes were added on top of the roof boxes along the first and third base sides. In 2000, a new video display from Daktronics, measuring high by wide, was added in center field. Before the 2003 season, seats were added to the Green Monster. Before the 2004 season, seats were added to the right field roof, above the grandstand, called the Budweiser Right Field Roof. Before the 2005 season, a new drainage system was installed on the field. The system, along with new sod, was installed to prevent the field from becoming too wet to play on during light to medium rains, and to reduce the time needed to dry the field adequately. Work on the field was completed only weeks prior to spring training. After the 2005 season, the Red Sox completed their plans for the.406 Club area, which became the EMC Club. The construction resulted in 852 pavilion club seats, 745 pavilion box seats, and approximately 200 pavilion standing-room seats along the left- and right-field lines, resulting in approximately 1300 additional seats. The winter of renovations focused on renovating the luxury boxes as well as adding a new food concourse area and renovated bathrooms behind the third base grandstands. Before the 2008 season, the temporary luxury boxes installed for the 1999 All-Star Game were removed and permanent ones were added to the State Street Pavilion level. Seats were also added down the left field line called the Coca-Cola Party-Deck. 100 standing-room tickets were also added to the pavilion increasing capacity to just under 40,000 people. The Coke bottles, installed in 1997, were also removed to return the light towers to their original state. All bleacher seats were replaced and the seating bowl water-proofed as well. Before the 2009 season, the right field roofbox seating area was renovated and expanded and the original 1912 seating bowl was water-proofed and seats replaced. Before the 2010 season, the left field lower seating bowl was water-proofed and seats replaced. This was done in two phases to allow for the hosting of the NHL Winter Classic. Before the 2011 season, three new scoreboards beyond right-center field were installed: a 38-by-100-foot scoreboard in right-center field, a 17-by-100-foot video screen in center field, a 16-by-30-foot video board in right field, along with a new video control room. The Gate D concourse has undergone a complete remodel with new concession stands and improved pedestrian flow. The wooden grandstand seats were all removed to allow the completion of the waterproofing of the seating bowl and completely refurbished upon re-installation. The Red Sox originally planned to expand the bullpens to provide more room for pitchers to warm up, but that part of the renovation project was scrapped. [ Proposed (then canceled) new Fenway Park ] On May 15, 1999, then Red Sox CEO John Harrington announced plans for a new Fenway Park to be built near the existing structure. { New Fenway Park Ballparks.com. } It was to have the same dimensions on the field, include a new Green Monster, basically be a replica of the current park, but be modernized to replace some of the old features of Fenway Park. Some sections of the old Fenway Park were to be preserved (mainly the original Green Monster and the third base side of the park) as part of the overall new layout. Most of the old park was to be demolished to make room for new development, with one section remaining to house a baseball museum and public park. This was a highly controversial idea, as most Boston area sports fans consider Fenway Park to be sacred ground, and demolishing the old park would have caused a significant outcry (as did the closure and later demolition of Tiger Stadium that same year after decades of grassroots efforts to try to save it). Several groups sprang up, such as &quot; Save Fenway Park &quot; to try to block the move. [ http://www.savefenwaypark.com/news.cfm Save Fenway Park! savefenwaypark.com 2004 April 20, 2012 ] All involved parties wrangled for several years on the details of the new stadium. One plan even involved building a &quot; Sports Megaplex &quot; in South Boston, where a new Fenway would be located next to a new stadium for the New England Patriots. The Patriots ultimately built a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachussetts, their home throughout most of their history, and that plan was abandoned. Even after several more rounds of deliberations, the Red Sox could not reach an agreement with the city of Boston for a new stadium. In 2005, the Red Sox ownership group announced that the team would stay at Fenway Park indefinitely.

Regarding the narrow foul territory, Will writes: [ George Will George Will MacMillan 1990 Men at Work ] [ p. 175 ] The narrow foul territory in Fenway Park probably adds 5 to 7 points onto batting average s. Since World War II, the Red Sox have had 18 batting champions (through 1989)... Five to 7 points are a lot, given that there may be only a 15- or 20-point spread between a good hitting team and a poor hitting team. Will states that some observers might feel that these unique aspects of Fenway give the Red Sox an advantage over their opponents, given that the Red Sox hitters play 81 games at the home stadium while each opponent plays no more than nine games as visiting teams but Will does not share this view. [ p. 177 ] { Green Monster } Fenway Park has one of the smallest seating capacity in the major leagues. Some now-closed ballparks had seating capacities under 40,000, and some had a smaller capcity than Fenway.

Part of the original ballpark construction of 1912, the wall is made of wood, but was covered in tin and concrete in 1934 when the scoreboard was added. The wall was covered in hard plastic in 1976. The scoreboard is manually updated throughout the game. Despite the name, the Green Monster was not painted green until 1947; before that it was covered with advertisements. The Monster designation is relatively new; for most of its history it was simply called the wall. { Fenway Park Timeline - 1947 } In recent years, terrace-style seating has been added on top of the wall.

Pesky&apos;s Pole is the name for the pole on the right field foul line, which stands [ 302 ft m ] from home plate, the shortest outfield distance (left or right field) in Major League Baseball. Despite the short wall, home runs in this area are relatively rare, as the fence curves away from the foul pole sharply. The pole was named after Johnny Pesky, a light-hitting shortstop and long-time coach for the Red Sox, who hit some of his six home runs at Fenway Park around the pole but never off the pole. Pesky and the Red Sox give credit to pitcher Mel Parnell for coining the name. The most notable for Pesky is a two-run homer in the eighth inning of the 1946 Opening Day game to win the game (in his career, Pesky hit 17 home runs). In similar fashion, Mark Bellhorn hit what proved to be the game-winning home run off of Julián Tavárez, in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series off that pole&apos;s screen.

Facing Reds right-hander Pat Darcy in the 12th inning with the score tied at 6, Fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line. It appeared to be heading foul, but Fisk, after initially appearing unsure of whether or not to continue running to first base, famously jumped and waved his arms to the right as if to somehow direct the ball fair. It ricocheted off the foul pole, winning the game for the Red Sox and sending the series to a seventh and deciding game the next night, which Cincinnati won. [ &quot; Duffy&apos;s Cliff &quot; ] From 1912 to 1933, there was a [ 10 ft m on ] high incline in front of the then [ 25 ft m on ] -high left field wall at Fenway Park, extending from the left-field foul pole to the center field flag pole. As a result, a left fielder had to play part of the territory running uphill (and back down). Boston&apos;s first star left fielder, Duffy Lewis, mastered the skill so well that the area became known as &quot; Duffy&apos;s Cliff &quot;. The incline served two purposes:it was a support for a high wall and it was built to compensate for the difference in grades between the field and Lansdowne Street on the other side of that wall. The wall also served as a spectator-friendly seating area during the dead ball era when overflow crowds would sit on the incline behind ropes. [ http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2005/10/25/a_baseball_showcase_in_football_land/ A Baseball Showcase in Football Land The Boston Globe Dan Shaughnessy October 25, 2005 ] As part of the 1934 remodeling of the ballpark, the bleachers, and the wall itself, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey arranged to flatten the ground along the base of the wall, so that Duffy&apos;s Cliff no longer existed. The base of the left field wall is several feet below the grade level of Lansdowne Street, accounting for the occasional rat that might spook the scoreboard operators.
