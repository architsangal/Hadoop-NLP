Her keel was laid down on 11 November 1935 by AG Weser of Bremen. She was commissioned on 12 August 1936 with Korvettenkapitän Hans Ibbeken in command. Ibbeken was relieved on 4 October 1937, by Johannes Franz, who commanded the boat until 6 June 1939 when Hans-Georg von Friedeburg assumed command for barely one month. He was relieved on 8 July 1939 again by Johannes Franz, who commanded the boat until her loss on 20 September 1939. U-27 had a very short career, with only one war patrol and only two enemy ships sunk. Following the sinking of two British trawlers, the Davara on 13 September and the Rudyard Kipling on 16 September, U-27 was hunted down and sunk west of Lewis, Scotland, by depth charge s from the British destroyer s [ Fortune H70 2 ], [ Faulknor H62 2 ] and [ Forester H74 2 ]. All 38 crewmen survived and were taken prisoner for the remainder of the war. [ Construction and design ] [ Construction ] U-27 was ordered by the German Kriegsmarine on 1 April 1935 as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Her keel was laid down in the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen as Werk 908 on 11 November 1935. After about nine months of construction, she was launched on 24 June 1936 and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine as the second Type VIIA submarine (after [ U-33 1936 2 ], which was commissioned a few months earlier) on 12 August 1936 under the command of Korvettenkapitän Hans Ibbeken. [ Design ] [ German Type VII submarine ] Like all Type VIIA submarines, U-27 displaced [ 626 LT t 0 ] while surfaced and [ 745 LT t 0 on ] when submerged. She was [ 64.5 m ftin on ] in overall length and had a [ 44.5 m ftin on ] pressure hull. U-27 s propulsion consisted of two MAN 6-cylinder 4-stroke M6V 40/46 diesel engine s that totaled [ 2100 - 2310 bhp on ] at maximum between 470 and 485 rpm giving a maximum speed of [ 17 kn mph km/h in ] on the surface and a range of [ 11470 km nmi on on ] at [ 10 kn km/h on ]. The submarine was also equipped with two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 electric motors that totaled [ 750 shp on ]. Their maximum rpm was 322 and they could propel U-27 [ 175 km nmi on ] at [ 4 kn km/h on ] when submerged, with an underwater maximum of [ 8 kn km/h ]. The U-boat&apos;s test depth was [ 220 m ft on ], but she could go as deep as [ 230 - 250 m ft on ] without having her hull crushed. U-27 s armament consisted of five [ 533 mm in 0 on ] torpedo tube s (four located in the bow and one in the stern). She could have up to 11 torpedoes on board or 22 TMA mines or 33 TMB mines. U-27 was also equipped with a C35 88  mm gun/L45 deck gun and had 220 rounds stowed on board. Her anti-aircraft defenses consisted of one C30 20 mm AA gun. U-27 had 38 crew members and officers. [ Service history ] U-27 had a very short career, conducting only one war patrol and sinking only two enemy vessels before she herself was sunk. U-27 left Wilhelmshaven on her first war patrol on 23 August 1939. For a period of 24 days, U-27 traveled down the coast of Germany and neutral Belgium and the Netherlands, through the English Channel and out into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland. Here, U-27 sank two British trawler s, totaling 624 tons. The first attack took place at 2:55 on 13 September, [ 21 nmi km ] northwest of Tory Island, when the trawler Davara was shelled by U-27 s main deck gun. Following the sinking of the Davara, her captain and 11 other crew members were picked up by the steam merchant ship Willowpool. [ http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/17.html Guðmundur Helgason Darava (Steam trawler) Uboat.net 30 June 2010 ] The second vessel to be sunk by U-27 was the trawler Rudyard Kipling. The attack on the Rudyard Kipling took place at 3:53 on 16 September, [ 100 nmi km ] west of the west coast of neutral Ireland, with the ship being sunk by scuttling charges from U-27. Following the sinking of the Rudyard Kipling, the crew of U-27 picked up her crew and gave them food and warm clothes. Eight hours later, Rudyard Kipling s crew were allowed to re-enter their lifeboats and they rowed the remaining [ 5 nmi km ] to Ireland.

On 20 September 1939, three torpedoes were fired at the warships, but failed to do any damage when they exploded prematurely. The British vessels replied with a series of depth charge attacks, one of which damaged the German submarine sufficiently to force it to the surface. Fortune&apos;s ramming attack was curtailed when it became apparent that the U-Boat was surrendering. { Kemp, Paul: U-Boats Destroyed, German Submarine Losses in the World Wars, 1997. p. 60. Arms and Armour. ISBN 1-85409-515-3 } All 38 crewmen survived and were taken prisoner. U-27 became the second German submarine to be sunk in World War II after [ U-39 1938 2 ] was sunk on 14 September 1939.
