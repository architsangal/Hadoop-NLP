It runs from its junction with the A36 at Whiteparish (near Salisbury ) in the county of Wiltshire. It closely parallels the south coast, where it passes through West Sussex and terminates at Pevensey (near Eastbourne and Bexhill ) in East Sussex. Between Portsmouth and Lewes, it is one of the busiest trunk roads in the UK. [ History ] Historically, for longer distance movement along the south coast, the M25 in combination with the M2, M20, M23 / A23, A3 / A3(M) and M3 has provided an attractive alternative to the actual south coast route of A259, A27 and M27. In 2002 an offpeak journey between Margate and Southampton via the M25 was 2 hours 30 minutes, and via the coastal route using the A259, A27 and M27 was 3 hours 50 minutes.

These include Chichester, Arundel, Worthing and East of Lewes.

A proposed scheme to bypass Arundel was dropped in 2003 although the junction at the end of the dual carriageway has been partly made into an underpass. [ http://www.chichester.co.uk/news/business/a27_upgrade_calls_1_2775785 Chichester Observer A27 upgrade calls 16 May 2011 ] At Worthing, where the possibility of a bypass has often been discussed since 1967, even getting as far as passing the inspector&apos;s report at a public inquiry, the plan was dropped in 1996 following rising costs. These are both areas of known traffic congestion during times of peak usage. A bridge over the level crossing at Beddingham was completed on 22 August 2008.

Despite the limited improvements to the A27, it is still substantially quicker to travel from Southampton to Margate via the M25 route (2hr 43m) compared to the coast route of A259, A27 and M27 (3hr 48m).

[ http://www.worthingherald.co.uk/news/local/private-investment-needed-for-a27-improvements-1-3667090 Private investment needed for A27 improvements Worthing Herald 24 March 2012 ] Actor Desmond Llewelyn, who portrayed Q in a large portion of the James Bond film series, was fatally injured in a car accident on the A27 in 1999. [ Description ] The road starts at its junction with the A36 at Whiteparish. It runs through Romsey, Swaythling, West End and Bursledon. It then closely parallels the south coast and travels on via Fareham, Cosham, Havant, Chichester, Arundel, Worthing, Shoreham-by-Sea, Brighton, Hove, Falmer, Lewes and Polegate where it then terminates at Pevensey in East Sussex. A section of the A27 running from the eastern end of the M27 to the end of the road at Pevensey forms part of the long-distance South Coast Trunk Road. Much of the road has been improved to dual carriageway standard, with the westernmost section of the trunk portion even having as much as four lanes plus a hard shoulder in each direction, and on a motorway alignment with grade-separated junctions. This is perhaps a reflection that the M27 was once proposed to run as far as Chichester. [ http://pathetic.org.uk/unfinished/m27/map/ Map of Original Plans for M27 Pathetic Motorways 21 March 2012 ] The road runs east from Portsmouth to Havant. Beyond Havant the dual carriageway east has no junctions in it until it reaches Chichester, where the by-pass, has five roundabouts that disrupt the mainline flow of the road. { Google map of Chichester retrieved 3 March 2012 } The Chichester by-pass is regularly subject to congestion and although a public inquiry has proposed improvements, those improvements are currently on hold. [ http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4039.aspx A27 Chichester Improvement Highways Agency 8 June 2011 ] East of Chichester the road largely retains a two-lane dual-carriageway standard. There are, however a couple of sections of single-carriageway; at Arundel, where a proposed bypass scheme was dropped in 2003, and at Worthing, where the possibility of a bypass has often been discussed since 1967, even getting as far as passing the inspector&apos;s report at a public inquiry, but was dropped in 1996 following rising costs.

After Worthing, the A27 passes through Lancing and crosses the River Adur near Shoreham. It then runs through the Southwick Hill Tunnel, crossing into East Sussex where it passes into a narrow cutting. Later, it passes Brighton — where it has in the past been known as the Brighton Bypass { The Archaeology of the A27 Brighton Bypass, Archaeology South East } { By-pass: First proposed in 1932, My Brighton and Hove, Tim Carder, 1990 } — and around the South Downs. This stretch of road often is slow in the morning rush hour. It then passes around Falmer with this section of road having three lanes in each direction but loses the third lane later. When Brighton and Hove Albion play at home this section can become congested due to its proximity to The American Express Community Stadium. Afterwards, it passes south of Lewes where it meets the A26 road to Newhaven. Here, the road becomes a single carriageway standard and, until 2008, crossed a level crossing until it was bypassed. The south coast multi model study recommended a dual carriageway, but the Highways Agency built it to a cheaper single-carriageway standard. Plans are still proposed for upgrading this later. { http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/3939.aspx } The road afterwards reverts to a dual carriageway with access to the A22, which provides links to Eastbourne and Hailsham. The road then. once again. turns into a single carriageway near Pevensey, where the road ends, and the South Coast Trunk Road transfers over to the A259; this coast road starts in Emsworth and shadows the route of the A27.
