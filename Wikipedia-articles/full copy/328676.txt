Fuji from Chiyodako-lake, January 2010 Kōfu&apos;s name means &quot; capital of Kai Province &quot;. During the Sengoku period, it was the stronghold of Takeda Shingen. Centuries ago the area which today is referred to as Yamanashi Prefecture was known as Kai Province. At that time the geographical denomination of ken (prefecture), was not yet in use, and the area was categorized as a fu. Located in the center of Kai, Kōfu&apos;s name was derived from a combination of kanji used in both Kai and fu. Alternate pronunciation of the characters resulted in the modern name of Kōfu. Archaeologists have discovered evidence of human settlement in the Kōfu area dating back as far as 6000 years BCE [ November 2010 ]. However, the town of Kōfu was not formally established until 1519. Kōfu is designated as one of the special cities of Japan. On March 1, 2006 the city, with a population of 193,795, was amalgamated with the town of Nakamichi, from Higashiyatsushiro District, and the northern part of the village of Kamikuishiki, from Nishiyatsushiro District, increasing the population to 201,184. [ Climate ] Kōfu has the typical Honshū humid subtropical climate, though it is less wet than either the south or Sea of Japan coast due to its location in a shielded mountain valley. Temperature ranges are noticeably greater than in coastal regions: in 2004 Kōfu reached a temperature of [ 40 C F ] previously almost unknown in Japan, and it has fallen below [ 0 C F ] as early as 26 October { http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/rank_s.php?prec_no=19 &amp; prec_ch=%8B%FA%98H%8Ex%92%A1 &amp; block_no=47638 &amp; block_ch=%8B%FA%98H &amp; year= &amp; month=10 &amp; day= &amp; view= 観測史上1～10位の値（10月としての値） }, which is about a month before the earliest freezing temperatures in such coastal cities as Kanazawa or Tokyo.
