[ surreptitious monitoring of computer activity information on methods of preventing unauthorized access to computer data computer security ] Computer surveillance is the act of performing surveillance of computer activity, and of data stored on a hard drive or being transferred over the Internet. Computer surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is closely monitored for clues of illegal activity. Supporters [ May 2010 ] say that watching all Internet traffic is important, because by knowing everything that everyone is reading and writing, they can identify terrorists and criminals, and protect society from them. Critics [ May 2010 ] cite concerns over privacy and the possibility of a totalitarian state where political dissent is impossible and opponents of state policy are removed in COINTELPRO -like purges. Such a state may be referred to as an Electronic Police State, in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, organize, search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens. [ Network surveillance ] The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet.

Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called &quot; packets &quot;, which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete &quot; message &quot; again. Packet sniffers are programs that intercept these packets as they are travelling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet sniffer is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. That is it gathers &quot; messages &quot; but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers&apos; broadband Internet traffic. There is far too much data gathered by these packet sniffers for human investigators to manually search through all of it. So automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic, and filter out and report to human investigators those bits of information which are &quot; interesting &quot; -- such as the use of certain words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with a certain individual or group.

Corporate surveillance of computer activity is very common. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of business intelligence, which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Or the data can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. Or it can be used for direct marketing purposes, such as targeted advertisements, where ads are targeted to the user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails [ http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r%3D1 F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy Story Louise November 1, 2007 New York Times 2009-03-17 ] (if they use free webmail services), which is kept in a database.

A surveillance program installed on a computer can search the contents of the hard drive for suspicious data, can monitor computer use, collect password s, and/or report back activities in real-time to its operator through the Internet connection. There are multiple ways of installing such software. The most common is remote installation, using a backdoor created by a computer virus or trojan. This tactic has the advantage of potentially subjecting multiple computers to surveillance. Viruses often spread to thousands or millions of computers, and leave &quot; backdoors &quot; which are accessible over a network connection, and enable an intruder to remotely install software and execute commands. These viruses and trojans are sometimes developed by government agencies, such as CIPAV and Magic Lantern. More often, however, viruses created by other people or spyware installed by marketing agencies can be used to gain access through the security breaches that they create. Another method is &quot; cracking &quot; into the computer to gain access over a network. An attacker can then install surveillance software remotely. Server s and computers with permanent broadband connections are most vulnerable to this type of attack. One can also physically place surveillance software on a computer by gaining entry to the place where the computer is stored and install it from a compact disc, floppy disk, or thumbdrive. This method shares a disadvantage with hardware devices in that it requires physical access to the computer. [ Social network analysis ] One common form of surveillance is to create maps of social network s based on data from social networking sites as well as from traffic analysis information from phone call records such as those in the NSA call database, [, Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists?

In order to be successful SSNA will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe.

The differences are individually identifiable under some conditions, and so it&apos;s possible to log key strokes without actually requiring logging software to run on the associated computer.
