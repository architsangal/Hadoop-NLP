Wall was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Swift Current in 1999, and re-elected in 2003. He became leader of the Official Opposition Saskatchewan Party on March 15, 2004. He replaced Elwin Hermanson, who resigned after leading the party to defeat in the 2003 provincial election. In the 2011 election, Wall led the Saskatchewan Party to a majority government in Saskatchewan with more than 64% of the popular vote and 49 of the 58 seats in the legislature. [ Life and political career ] Wall is a lifelong resident of Swift Current, Saskatchewan and he completed his post-secondary education with a degree in public administration from the University of Saskatchewan. His political roots are in the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, working as a ministerial assistant to Graham Taylor, Minister of Public Participation, Tourism, Small Business, Co-operatives and Health, and John Gerich, Associate Minister of Economic Development. Wall ran unsuccessfully for the Progressive Conservative nomination for Swift Current in April 1991. Prior to his election, Wall was the director of business development for the City of Swift Current. In 1999, the Saskatchewan Economic Developers Association (SEDA) had presented him with the 1998 Economic Developer of the Year Award. In the early 1990s, Wall also managed a country music museum that was relocated to Swift Current from Kitchener, ON, following a significant grant from the Grant Devine government. { &quot; Hall of Fame is Lured West, &quot; Calgary Herald: September 26, 1991. } The facility went bankrupt in 1995. { &quot; Country Music Center at a Low Note, &quot; Regina Leader-Post: December 27, 1995. } Wall has also sat on a number of boards including being a founding member of the Southwest Centre for Entrepreneurial Development. Wall also started his own business, The Last Stand Adventure Company. Wall won the Saskatchewan Party nomination for Swift Current in the 1999 election and won handily, defeating NDP incumbent John Wall (no relation) by 24 points as part of a wave of rural victories that saw the NDP cut down to a minority government. He was immediately appointed to the Saskatchewan Party&apos;s front bench as Justice Critic, and later became critic for the Crown Investments Corporation as well. When original leader Elwin Hermanson resigned after narrowly losing the 2003 provincial election, Wall announced his candidacy for the leadership. No other candidates stepped forward, and Wall was acclaimed the party&apos;s new leader on March 15, 2004. After becoming leader of the Saskatchewan Party, Wall committed to a review of Saskatchewan Party policies. This policy review process reached its culmination at the Saskatchewan Party&apos;s annual convention in February 2005 and resulted in a considerably more moderate policy platform. Among the old resolutions that were replaced was one that called for &quot; boot camps &quot; for young offenders. New policy resolutions included calling for treatment for crystal methamphetamine addicts, a patient-first review of the health care system, the development of a comprehensive plan to recruit and retain health care professionals, the development an integrated addictions strategy for young offenders who are incarcerated, a comprehensive review of the justice system to restore trust and confidence in the system, the establishment of a provincial youth justice board to address youth crime, rehabilitation and restitution measures, support for victims of crime, the establishment of a university research chair in occupational health and safety, and a review of the Workers&apos; Compensation Board.

The Saskatchewan Party garnered 49 of 58 seats in the Saskatchewan Legislature, gaining 9 seats over what they held previous to the election and leaving the NDP with a mere 9 seats, the smallest number of seats held by them since 1982. [ Controversies ] Wall&apos;s leadership style has generally been received as popular throughout Saskatchewan and within the Saskatchewan Party caucus. However, his leadership was called into question at the end of January 2006 when MLA Brenda Bakken-Lackey resigned from the party. Bakken-Lackey cited unspecified frustrations within the Saskatchewan Party caucus as being among her reasons for resigning.

At the party&apos;s 2007 annual convention, Wall received the support of 98 per cent of convention delegates for his leadership. In recent times, he has been more willing to discuss his employment under the Grant Devine government.
