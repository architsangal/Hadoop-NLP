[ the idiom Speak of the Devil (disambiguation) ] [ speak of the devil ] [ March 2010 ] &quot; Speak of the devil &quot; is the short form of the idiom &quot; Speak of the devil and he doth appear &quot;. It is used when an object of discussion unexpectedly becomes present during the conversation. For example, if Alice and Bob start discussing Charlie while he isn&apos;t in the room, and Charlie walks into the room, Alice or Bob might say, &quot; Speak of the devil! &quot; It can also be used about a topic that quickly becomes relevant, such as the onset of rain or a car breaking down. Used in this sense it can be seen as an alternative to the phrase &quot; tempting fate &quot;. The phrase is an abbreviation of English proverb, &quot; Speak of the devil and he doth appear. &quot; Deriving from the Middle Ages, this proverb (which was, and to a certain extent still is, rendered as &quot; Talk of the Devil... &quot; ) was a superstitious prohibition against speaking directly of the Devil or of evil in general, which was considered to incite that party to appear, generally with unfortunate consequences. Its first printed usage in modern English can be found in Giovanni Torriano&apos;s Piazza Universale (1666), as &quot; The English say, Talk of the Devil, and he&apos;s presently at your elbow. &quot; The phrase lost its overt message during the 19th century, during which it became a warning against eavesdroppers ( &quot; No good of himself does a listener hear,/Speak of the devil he&apos;s sure to appear &quot; ), and by the 20th century had taken on its present meaning.
