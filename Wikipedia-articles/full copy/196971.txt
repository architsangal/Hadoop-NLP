[ February 2009 ] Ecological land classification is defined as being a cartographical delineation of distinct ecological areas, identified by their geology, topography, soil s, vegetation, climate conditions, living species, habitat s, water resources, as well as anthropic factors. These factors control and influence biotic composition and ecological processes. [ Types ] Many different lists and ecological land classification schemes have been developed. { Part of the list proposed below is inspired by } { Miklos Udvardy classification of the Biographical Provinces in the World which was prepared by Unesco&apos;s Man and the Biosphere program, published in 1975 and updated in 1982. } { http://www.pcap-sk.org/docs/6_skecositeguide/Ecoregions_and_Ecosites.pdf } Biogeography - Biogeographical provinces take into account both flora and fauna. Phytogeography - from Greek words phyto = plant and geography meaning also distribution, concerned with the geographic distribution of plant species. Botany - botanists have identified floristic province s based on flora - plant communities Zoology - zoologists have identified zoogeographic provinces based on fauna l communities. Conservation - approximating ecosystem capacity and potentials. Geology and Pedology (soil study) - the physical matter and energy that constitute the Earth. In Canada ecological land classification schemes are commonly used. Provincial authorities have adopted methods to classify ecosystems within various ecoregions of the province. Ontario is one such province that uses an extensive method to define ecological units. Improvements in hand held technology have allowed for more efficient collection of vegetation and physiological data in the field, such as with the ELC eTool. [ Hierarchy of classification levels in ecology compared to other fields ] This classification table shows the parallel classification terms in similar spatial scales used in the study of the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems and the Earth. From largest at top to the smallest at bottom the classification levels are: CLASSIFICATION LEVELS IN ECOLOGY COMPARED TO OTHER FIELDS Biotic Abiotic ECOLOGY BIOGEOGRAPHY ZOOGEOGRAPHY PHYTOGEOGRAPHY PHYSIOGRAPHY GEOLOGY PEDOLOGY ecosphere biosphere zoosphere phytosphere physiosphere geosphere pedosphere ecozone biome zoozone (zoogeographic region) http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202763/faunal-region http://www.birdcare.com/bin/showdict?zoogeographical+region floral kingdom ecoprovince bioprovince zooprovince http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7sk9t2dz floral province - &apos;&apos;phytochorion&apos;&apos; geoprovince ecoregion bioregion zooregion floral region - &apos;&apos;floristic province&apos;&apos; physioregion georegion pedoregion ecodistrict biodistrict ecosection biosection ecosite biosite ecotope ( ecosystem sensu stricto?) biotope ‡ zootope ‡ phytotope ‡ physiotope geotope ‡ pedotope ecoelement bioelement geoelement Sources: ‡ These words are all loanwords from German science.
