The product line-up consists of the hard drive-based iPod classic, the touchscreen iPod touch, the compact iPod nano and the ultra-compact iPod shuffle. iPod classic models store media on an internal hard drive, while all other models use flash memory to enable their smaller size (the discontinued mini used a Microdrive miniature hard drive). As with many other digital music players, iPods can serve as external data storage devices. Storage capacity varies by model, ranging from 2  GB for the iPod shuffle to 160  GB for the iPod classic. The iPod line was announced by Apple on October 23, 2001, and released on November 10, 2001. All of the models have been redesigned multiple times since their introduction. The most recent iPod redesigns were introduced on September 1, 2010. Apple&apos;s iTunes software can be used to transfer music to the devices from computers using certain versions of Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Discontinued models of the line include the iPod mini and the iPod photo, the former being replaced by the iPod nano, and the latter reintegrated into the main iPod line (now the iPod classic). In iOS versions prior to iOS 5, the iPod branding is also used for the media player applications included with the iPhone and iPad; the iPhone version is essentially a combination of the Music and Videos apps on the iPod touch. As of iOS 5, separate apps named &apos;Music&apos; and &apos;Video&apos; are standardized across all iOS-powered products. [ http://www.bgr.com/nggallery/page-320/album-all/gallery-186/image/2403/ APPLE IOS 5 IPHONE / IPAD HANDS-ON (screenshot of iPhone home screen with iOS 5 preview) Boy Genius Report June 6, 2011 June 6, 2011 ] While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media-player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally treated as separate products. In the last few years, iPhone and iPad sales have overtaken those of the iPod. [ History and design ] Various iPod models, all of which have been discontinued or updated. The iPod line came from Apple&apos;s &quot; digital hub &quot; category, { Kahney, Leander. Straight Dope on the iPod&apos;s Birth, } { Wired News, October 17, 2006. Retrieved on October 30, 2006. } when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players &quot; big and clunky or small and useless &quot; with user interfaces that were &quot; unbelievably awful, &quot; so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple&apos;s hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, { &quot; 2007 Engineer of the Year Finalist Michael Dhuey’s Hardware Knowledge Helps Breathe Life Into iPod, TelePresence &quot;, Design News, September 24, 2007. } and design engineer Jonathan Ive. The product was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5  GB hard drive that put &quot; 1,000 songs in your pocket. &quot; [ http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/origin-of-the-ipod.html A History of the iPod: 2000 to 2004 Lowendmac.com 2011-08-15 ] Apple did not develop the iPod software entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer &apos;s reference platform based on two ARM cores. The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software&apos;s look and feel. Starting with the iPod mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans —a font similar to Apple&apos;s corporate font, Myriad. iPods with color displays then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation iPod classic and third-generation iPod nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item). In September 2007, during a lawsuit with patent holding company Burst.com, Apple drew attention to a patent for a similar device that was developed in 1979. Kane Kramer applied for a UK patent for his design of a &quot; plastic music box &quot; in 1981, which he called the IXI. { Boffey, Daniel Apple admit Briton DID invent iPod, but he&apos;s still not getting any money } { Daily Mail, September 8, 2008. Retrieved on September 8, 2008. } He was unable to secure funding to renew the US$ 120,000 worldwide patent, so it lapsed and Kramer never profited from his idea. [ Trademark ] [ Timeline of Apple Inc. products ] The name iPod was proposed by Vinnie Chieco, a freelance copywriter, who (with others) was called by Apple to figure out how to introduce the new player to the public. After Chieco saw a prototype, he thought of the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey and the phrase &quot; Open the pod bay door, Hal ! &quot;, which refers to the white EVA Pod s of the Discovery One spaceship. Chieco saw an analogy to the relationship between the spaceship and the smaller independent pods in the relationship between a personal computer and the music player. Apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use. Joseph N. Grasso of New Jersey had originally listed an &quot; iPod &quot; trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in July 2000 for Internet kiosk s. The first iPod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in New Jersey in March 1998, and commercial use began in January 2000, but had apparently been discontinued by 2001. The trademark was registered by the USPTO in November 2003, and Grasso assigned it to Apple Computer, Inc. in 2005. { Serial No. 78018061, Registration No. 2781793, records of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. InPub, LLC, filed an &quot; IPOD &quot; trademark on June 1, 1999, for &quot; computer software and hardware. &quot; The trademark was abandoned May 18, 2000, without commercial use. } The earliest recorded use in commerce of an &quot; iPod &quot; trademark was in 1991 by Chrysalis Corp. of Sturgis, Michigan, styled &quot; iPOD &quot;. [ Ipod by Chrysalis Incorporated http://www.trademarkia.com/ipod-74132201.html Trademarkia December 20, 2011 ] [ Software ] The iPod line can play several audio file format s including MP3, AAC / M4A, Protected AAC, AIFF, WAV, Audible audiobook, and Apple Lossless. The iPod photo introduced the ability to display JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and PNG image file formats. Fifth and sixth generation iPod classics, as well as third generation iPod nanos, can additionally play MPEG-4 ( H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ) and QuickTime video formats, with restrictions on video dimensions, encoding techniques and data-rates. { The restrictions vary from generation to generation; for the earliest video iPods, video is required to be } { Baseline Profile (BP), up to } { Level 1.3, meaning most significantly no } { B-frame s (BP), a maximum bitrate of 768 kb/s (BP Level 1.3), and a maximum framerate of 30 frame/s at 320×240 resolution.

[ http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ iTunes Downloads Apple.com 2008-02-07 2011-08-15 ] Unlike most other media players, Apple does not support Microsoft &apos;s WMA audio format—but a converter for WMA files without Digital Rights Management (DRM) is provided with the Windows version of iTunes. MIDI files also cannot be played, but can be converted to audio files using the &quot; Advanced &quot; menu in iTunes. Alternative open-source audio formats, such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC, are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod (e.g., Rockbox ). During installation, an iPod is associated with one host computer. Each time an iPod connects to its host computer, iTunes can synchronize entire music libraries or music playlists either automatically or manually. Song ratings can be set on an iPod and synchronized later to the iTunes library, and vice versa. A user can access, play, and add music on a second computer if an iPod is set to manual and not automatic sync, but anything added or edited will be reversed upon connecting and syncing with the main computer and its library. If a user wishes to automatically sync music with another computer, an iPod&apos;s library will be entirely wiped and replaced with the other computer&apos;s library. [ User interface ] { iPod click wheel. } iPods with color displays use anti-aliased graphics and text, with sliding animations. All iPods (except the 3rd-generation iPod shuffle, the 6th generation iPod nano, and iPod touch ) have five buttons and the later generations have the buttons integrated into the click wheel – an innovation that gives an uncluttered, minimalist interface. The buttons perform basic functions such as menu, play, pause, next track, and previous track. Other operations, such as scrolling through menu items and controlling the volume, are performed by using the click wheel in a rotational manner. The 3rd-generation iPod shuffle does not have any controls on the actual player; instead it has a small control on the earphone cable, with volume-up and -down buttons and a single button for play and pause, next track, etc. The iPod touch has no click-wheel; instead it uses a 3.5 &quot; touch screen along with a home button, sleep/wake button and (on the second and third generations of the iPod touch) volume-up and -down buttons. The user interface for the iPod touch is identical to that of the iPhone. Differences include a lack of a phone application. Both devices use iOS. [ iTunes Store ] [ iTunes iTunes Store ] The iTunes Store (introduced April 29, 2003) is an online media store run by Apple and accessed through iTunes. The store became the market leader soon after its launch { iTunes Music Store Catalog Tops One Million Songs, } { Apple Inc., August 10, 2004. Retrieved on December 28, 2006. } and Apple announced the sale of videos through the store on October 12, 2005. Full-length movies became available on September 12, 2006. { Scott-Joynt, Jeremy. Apple targets TV and film market, } { BBC News, September 12, 2006. Retrieved on September 12, 2006. } At the time the store was introduced, purchased audio files used the AAC format with added encryption, based on the FairPlay DRM system. Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files. Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD, then re-importing would create music files without the DRM. The DRM could also be removed using third-party software. However, in a deal with Apple, EMI began selling DRM-free, higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores, in a category called &quot; iTunes Plus. &quot; While individual songs were made available at a cost of US$1.29, 30¢ more than the cost of a regular DRM song, entire albums were available for the same price, US$9.99, as DRM encoded albums. On 17  October 2007, Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to US$0.99 per song, the same as DRM encoded tracks. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM has been removed from 80% of the music catalog, and that it would be removed from all music by April 2009. iPods cannot play music files from competing music stores that use rival-DRM technologies like Microsoft &apos;s protected WMA or RealNetworks &apos; Helix DRM. Example stores include Napster and MSN Music. RealNetworks claims that Apple is creating problems for itself [ Kanellos Michael Real&apos;s Glaser exhorts Apple to open iPod http://news.cnet.com/2100-1025_3-5177914.html CNET News December 20, 2011 March 23, 2004 ] by using FairPlay to lock users into using the iTunes Store. Steve Jobs stated that Apple makes little profit from song sales, although Apple uses the store to promote iPod sales. [ Hansell Saul The iTunes Store: Profit Machine http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/steve-jobs-tries-to-downplay-the-itunes-stores-profit/ August 11, 2008 December 20, 2011 August 11, 2008 ] However, iPods can also play music files from online stores that do not use DRM, such as eMusic or Amie Street. Universal Music Group decided not to renew their contract with the iTunes Music Store on July 3, 2007. Universal will now supply iTunes in an &apos;at will&apos; capacity. { Evans, Jonny. Universal confirms iTunes contract change, } { Macworld UK, July 4, 2007. Retrieved on July 5, 2007. } Apple debuted the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store on September 5, 2007, in its Media Event entitled &quot; The Beat Goes On... &quot; This service allows users to access the Music Store from either an iPhone or an iPod touch and download songs directly to the device that can be synced to the user&apos;s iTunes Library over a WiFi connection, or, in the case of a iPhone, the telephone network. [ Games ] [ iPod game App Store (iOS) ] Video games are playable on various versions of iPods. The original iPod had the game Brick (originally invented by Apple&apos;s co-founder Steve Wozniak ) included as an easter egg hidden feature; later firmware versions added it as a menu option. Later revisions of the iPod added three more games: Parachute, Solitaire, and Music Quiz. In September 2006, the iTunes Store began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of iTunes 7, compatible with the fifth generation iPod with iPod software 1.2 or later. Those games were: Bejeweled, Cubis 2, Mahjong, Mini Golf, Pac-Man, Tetris, Texas Hold &apos;Em, Vortex, Asphalt 4: Elite Racing and Zuma. Additional games have since been added. These games work on the 6th and 5th generation iPod classic and the 5th and 4th generation iPod nano. With third parties like Namco, Square Enix, Electronic Arts, Sega, and Hudson Soft all making games for the iPod, Apple&apos;s MP3 player has taken steps towards entering the video game handheld console market. Even video game magazines like GamePro and EGM have reviewed and rated most of their games as of late.

When unzipped, they reveal executable files along with common audio and image files, leading to the possibility of third party games. Apple has not publicly released a software development kit (SDK) for iPod-specific development. { &quot; What&apos;s Inside an iPod Game? &quot; bensinclair.com, September 14, 2006. } Apps produced with the iPhone SDK are compatible only with the iOS on the iPod touch and iPhone, which cannot run clickwheel-based games.

[ December 2011 ] If an iPod is formatted on a Mac OS X computer, it uses the HFS+ file system format, which allows it to serve as a boot disk for a Mac computer.

With the release of the Windows-compatible iPod, the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS+ to FAT32, although it can be reformatted to either file system (excluding the iPod shuffle which is strictly FAT32). Generally, if a new iPod (excluding the iPod shuffle) is initially plugged into a computer running Windows, it will be formatted with FAT32, and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS X it will be formatted with HFS+.

The user must use software that has been specifically designed to transfer media files to iPods, so that the files are playable and viewable. Usually iTunes is used to transfer media to an iPod, though several alternative third-party applications are available on a number of different platforms. iTunes 7 and above can transfer purchased media of the iTunes Store from an iPod to a computer, provided that computer containing the DRM protected media is authorized to play it. Media files are stored on an iPod in a hidden folder, along with a proprietary database file. The hidden content can be accessed on the host operating system by enabling hidden files to be shown. The media files can then be recovered manually by copying the files or folders off the iPod. Many third-party applications also allow easy copying of media files off of an iPod.

The units have been } { miniaturized over time. } Originally, a FireWire connection to the host computer was used to update songs or recharge the battery. The battery could also be charged with a power adapter that was included with the first four generations. The third generation began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod nano and the fifth-generation iPod classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod touch and the fourth-generation iPod nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod shuffle uses a single 3.5  mm jack which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock. The dock connector also allowed the iPod to connect to accessories, which often supplement the iPod&apos;s music, video, and photo playback. Apple sells a few accessories, such as the now-discontinued iPod Hi-Fi, but most are manufactured by third parties such as Belkin and Griffin. Some peripherals use their own interface, while others use the iPod&apos;s own screen. Because the dock connector is a proprietary interface, the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to Apple.

Retrieved on February 17, 2007. } The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitor s and the typical low- impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods. { Heijligers, Marc. iPod circuit design engineering, May 2006. Retrieved on February 17, 2007. } The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load. For all iPods released in 2006 and earlier, some equalizer (EQ) sound settings could &quot; distort the [bass] sound far too easily, even on undemanding songs &quot;. { Kuzmanoski, Brian.

Further, the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled U.S. professionals, as opposed to lower skilled U.S. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor. One interpretation of this result is that U.S. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically.
