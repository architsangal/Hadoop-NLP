[ yes 1950 6 6 ] { Brussels, } { Belgium } { Artist, film director, professor } [ August 2010 ] Chantal Anne Akerman (born 6 June 1950) is a Belgian film director, artist, and professor of film at the European Graduate School. { Chantal Akerman Faculty Page at } { European Graduate School } Akerman&apos;s best-known film, Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), exemplifies a dedication to the ellipses of conventional narrative cinema. [ August 2010 ] [ Early life ] Akerman was born to an observant Jewish family in Brussels, Belgium. Her grandparents and her mother were sent to Auschwitz; only her mother came back. This is a very important factor in her personal experience, and her mother&apos;s anxiety is a recurrent theme in her filmography. Akerman claims that, at the age of 15, after viewing Jean-Luc Godard &apos;s Pierrot le fou (1965), she decided to make movies the same night. At 18, Akerman entered the Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion, a Belgian film school. During her first term, however, Akerman chose to leave and make Saute ma ville, a thirteen-minute black-and-white picture in 35mm. Akerman partially subsidized Saute ma ville from shares she sold on the Antwerp diamond exchange, procuring its remaining budget through clerical work. In 1971, Saute ma ville premiered at the Oberhausen short-film festival. [ Invalid length. ] { 2 } This same year Akerman moved to New York and remained there until 1972. At Anthology Film Archives in New York, Akerman became impressed by the work of Stan Brakhage, Jonas Mekas, Michael Snow, and Andy Warhol. She states that Snow&apos;s La Région Centrale introduced her to the relationship between film, time and energy.¹ Her 1972 feature Hotel Monterey and shorts La Chambre 1 and La Chambre 2 reveal structural filmmaking&apos;s influence through their usage of extended-duration takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate the films&apos; images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman&apos;s films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with cinematographer Babette Mangolte. In 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and, in 1974, received critical recognition for her feature Je tu il elle. In 1991, she was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.

[ Identity aesthetics ] According to the book Images in the Dark by Raymond Murray, Akerman refused to have her work ghettoized, and she denied the New York Gay Film Festival the right to screen Je tu il elle. &quot; I will never permit a film of mine to be shown in a gay film festival. &quot; [ Filmography ] [ http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1989/02_programm_1989/02_Programm_1989.html Berlinale: 1989 Programme 2011-03-11 berlinale.de ] Year Title Length Notes English 1968 Saute ma ville 13 minutes Blow up My Town 1971 L&apos;enfant aimé ou Je joue à être une femme mariée 35 minutes The Beloved Child, or I Play at Being a Married Woman 1972 Hotel Monterey 65 minutes 1972 La Chambre 1 11 minutes The Room, 1 1972 La Chambre 2 11 minutes The Room, 2 1973 Le 15/8 42 minutes co-directed by Samy Szlingerbaum 1973 Hanging Out Yonkers 90 minutes unfinished 1974 Je tu il elle 90 minutes I...
