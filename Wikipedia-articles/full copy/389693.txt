[ the town in Ohio New Rome, Ohio ] The term &quot; New Rome &quot; has been used in the following contexts: [ May 2011 ] [ May 2011 ] [ May 2011 ] [ May 2011 ] [ May 2011 ] [ May 2011 ] [ May 2011 ] &quot; Nova Roma &quot; is traditionally reported to be the Latin name given by emperor Constantine the Great to the new imperial capital he founded in 330 at the city on the European coast of the Bosporus strait, known as Byzantium until then and as Kōnstantinoúpolis ( Constantinople ) from that time to its official renaming as Istanbul in 1928. According to the Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum, vol. 164 (Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 2005), there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city &quot; New Rome &quot; (Nova Roma or Nea Rhome). Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as Constantinopolis (see e.g. Michael Grant, The climax of Rome (London 1968), p. 133). It is possible that the emperor called the city &quot; Second Rome &quot; (Deutera Rhome) by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian Socrates of Constantinople. The first appearance of the term &apos;New Rome&apos; in connection to Constantinople in any kind of document was at the First Council of Constantinople (381), in the context of deciding that the relatively youthful church of Constantinople should have precedence over Alexandria and Antioch &apos;because it is the New Rome&apos;. Even after this, the name was not used in official proclamations by the civil authority, as opposed to the Christian church. It is used to express connection with or discontinuity from the &quot; old &quot; Rome, depending upon context, and is particularly used by the Orthodox Church to emphasize that the See of Constantinople should be considered as second only to the Roman See in prestige. The full title of the Patriarch of Constantinople is &quot; Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Œcumenical Patriarch &quot;. It has been a cultural, historical, and theological concept within much of European culture (as far east as Russia) for centuries if not millennia. The idea of Moscow being the &quot; Third Rome &quot;, became popular since the time of the early Russian Tsar s. Within decades after the Fall of Constantinople to Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on May 29, 1453, some were nominating Moscow as the &quot; Third Rome &quot;, or new &quot; New Rome &quot;. Earlier, in the 14th century, as the Byzantine Empire weakened, the capital of Bulgaria Tarnovo ( Tarnovgrad ) had also claimed to be the Third Rome based on its pre-eminent cultural influence in the Balkans and the Slavic Orthodox world. Paris has at various stages of its history been designated &quot; nouvelle Rome &quot; or New Rome, as early as the reign of Philip IV (1268–1314) but from a tradition starting most significantly under the rule of Louis XIV who dominated most of Western Europe. Within the context of Protestant Reformation, it became a pejorative description, applied to nations or cities that earned a reputation for rapacity, immorality, or other social or political faults. This may have its roots in virulently anti-Roman (anti-Catholic) propaganda against &quot; papist s &quot; and the city of Rome, home of the Pope and heart of the Roman Catholic Church, which drew the ire of many a Reformation author. In the present day, &quot; New Rome &quot; is used in this form mostly to refer to &quot; political immorality &quot;, casting any large and powerful country into the role of an oppressive and expansionary empire (for example, by Osama bin Laden, as a description of the United States of America). &quot; Babylon &quot; is often used in a similar sense. Terza Roma (Third Rome, after the first Rome of the Caesars and the second Rome of the Popes) is also a name for the Benito Mussolini Discorso pronunciato in Campidoglio per l&apos;insediamento del primo Governatore di Roma il 31 dicembre 1925, Internet Archive copy of a page with a Mussolini speech. plan to expand Rome towards Ostia and the sea. The Esposizione Universale Roma neighbourhood was the first step in that direction. In the post-apocalyptic science fiction novel A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter Michael Miller, Jr., first published in 1959, the residence of the post-nuclear holocaust Pope is called New Rome. In the sequel Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, New Rome was revealed to have been founded on the site of St. Louis, Missouri. New Rome is the capital of the fictional planet Secundus, the second to be settled by the Howard families in the 1973 science fiction novel Time Enough for Love by Robert A. Heinlein and subsequent books featuring Lazarus Long. Satirists have called Washington DC the New Rome. The planet New Rome is the political and legal centre of the human-inhabited worlds of Brian Stableford &apos;s six Hooded Swan science fiction novels. Its exact status is never clearly defined. In Rick Riordan&apos;s Heroes of Olympus series, human descendants of the Roman gods have created a city called &quot; New Rome &quot; in California. [ References ] Dmytryshyn, Basil (transl). 1991.
