In December 1915, the division moved to France, joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), under the command of Irish Major General William Hickie, and spent the duration of the First World War in action on the Western Front. Following enormous losses at the Somme, Passchendaele and Ypres, the Division required a substantial refit in England between June and August 1918, which involved the introduction of many non-Irish battalions. The division served as a formation of the United Kingdom &apos;s British Army during World War I. [ Ireland in World War I ] [ History ] The Division began forming as part of the K2 Army Group towards the end of 1914 after Irish recruits in the early days of the war from England and Belfast first filled the ranks of the 10th (Irish) Division before being assigned to the 16th Division, { Grayson, Richard S.: pp.14-18 } formed around a core of National Volunteers. Initial training began in Ireland at Fermoy, { Grayson, Richard S.: pp.16-18 } Munster; recruits also trained at Buttevant. It moved to Aldershot in England for more intensive training in September 1915. After thirteen weeks, the formation was deployed to Etaples in France, joining the BEF, from where it left on December 18 for that part of the front in the Loos salient, under the command of Irish Major General William Hickie. It spent the rest of the war on the Western Front. At Loos, in January and February 1916, the division was introducted to trench warfare and suffered greatly in the Battle of Hulluch, 27–29 April, (during the Easter Rising in Ireland). Personnel raided German trenches all through May and June, and in late July they were moved to the Somme Valley where they were intensively engaged in the Battle of the Somme. The 16th division played an important part in capturing the towns of Guillemont and Ginchy, although they suffered massive casualties. During these successful actions between 1 and 10 September casualties amounted to 224 officers and 4,090 men; despite these very heavy losses the division gained a reputation as first-class shock troops. { Murphy, David: Irish Regiments in the World Wars, The Irish Divisions, 1914-18: the 16th (Irish) Division pp.16-17, Osprey Publishing (2007) ISBN 978-1-84603-015-4 } Out of a total of 10,845 men, it had lost 3,491 on the Loos sector between January and the end of May 1916, including heavy casualties from bombardment and a gas attack at Hullach in April. Bloodletting of this order was fatal to the division’s character, for it had to be made good by drafts from England. { Duffy, Christopher: Through German Eyes: The British &amp; the Somme 1916 p.101, Phoenix of Orion Books (2007) ISBN 978-0-7538-2202-9 } In early 1917, the division took a major part in the Battle of Messines alongside the 36th (Ulster) Division, adding to both their recognition and reputation. Their major actions ended in the summer of 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele after coming under the command of General Hubert Gough and the Fifth Army. In July 1917, during the Third Battle of Ypres, although both divisions were totally exhausted after 13 days of moving weighty equipment under heavy shelling, Gough ordered the battalions to advance through deep mud towards well fortified German positions left untouched by totally inadequate artillery preparation. { Prior, Robin &amp; Wilson, Trevor: Passchendaele, the untold story, &quot; Gough, Rain &quot; pp.102–05, (1997) ISBN 978-0-300-07227-3 } By mid August, the 16th had suffered over 4,200 casualties, the 36th almost 3,600, or more than 50% of their numbers. General Haig was very critical of Gough for &quot; playing the Irish card &quot;. { Prior &amp; Wilson 1997, pp.102–05. } The 16th Division held an exposed position from early 1918 at Ronssoy where they suffered more heavy losses during the German Spring Offensive in March and being practicaally wiped out in the retreat which followed Operation Michael, when they helped to finally halt the German attack prior to the Battle of Hamel. The decision was then made to break up the division, the three surviving Service battalions were posted to other formations. { Bowman, Timothy: Irish Regiments in the Great War p.171, Manchester Uni. Press (2003) ISBN 978-0-7190-6285-8 } On 14 June the division returned to England for &quot; reconstitution &quot;. The Conscription Crisis of 1918 in Ireland meant that fewer Irish recruits could be raised so that the 16th Division which returned to France on 27 July contained five English Battalions, two Scottish Battalions and one Welsh Battalion. The only original Battalion left was the 5th Royal Irish Fusiliers. The dispersion of the Irish battalions throughout the BEF in 1918, despite its practical considerations, appears to suggest that the Irish units were increasingly distrusted by the military authorities. { Bowman, Timothy: p.176 } [ Order of battle ] 47th Brigade 8th (Service) Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers (New Army) (disbanded November 1916) 6th (Service) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (disbanded 1922) 7th (Service) Battalion, Leinster Regiment; (disbanded February 1918) 6th (Service) Battalion, Connaught Rangers (until June 1918) 1st (Service) Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers (from November 1916 until April 1918) 18th (Service) Battalion Welsh Regiment (2nd Glamorgan ), (from May 1918) 14th (Service) Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment (from June 1918) 9th (Service) Battalion, Black Watch (from July 1918) 2nd (Service) Battalion, Leinster Regiment (from February 1918 until April 1918) 47th Machine Gun Company Joined 28 April 1916, moved to 16th Battalion MGC 9 March 1918 The 47th Brigade was known as the &quot; Nationalist Brigade &quot; as the majority were men from Redmond&apos;s Irish Volunteers.
