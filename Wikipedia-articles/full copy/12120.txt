Greenland has no land boundaries and 44,087  km of coastline. A sparse population is confined to small settlements along the coast. Greenland possesses the world&apos;s second largest ice sheet. Greenland sits atop the Greenland plate, a subplate of the North American plate.

The Isua greenstone belt in southwestern Greenland contains the oldest known rocks on Earth dated at 3.7-3.8 Billion years old. { Appel, Peter W.U., Hugh R. Rollinson, and Jacques L.R. Touret. (2001) &quot; Remnants of an Early Archaean ( &gt; 3.75 Ga) sea-floor, hydrothermal system in the Isua Greenstone Belt. &quot; Precambrian Research, Vol. 112, Issues 1-2, 15 November, pp.  27–49. } The vegetation is generally sparse, with the only patch of forested land being found in Nanortalik Municipality in the extreme south near Cape Farewell. The climate is arctic to subarctic with cool summers and cold winters. The terrain is mostly a flat but gradually sloping icecap that covers all land except for a narrow, mountainous, barren, rocky coast. The lowest elevation is sea level and the highest elevation is the summit of Gunnbjørn Fjeld, the highest point in the Arctic at [ 3694 m us ]. The northernmost point of the Island of Greenland is Cape Morris Jesup, discovered by Admiral Robert Peary in 1909. Natural resource s include zinc, lead, iron ore, coal, molybdenum, gold, platinum, uranium, fish, seal s, and whale s.

[ Climate change ] [ Greenland ice sheet Greenland#Geography and climate ] Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland. Map of Greenland&apos;s rate of change in Ice Sheet Height. The Greenland ice sheet is [ 3 km mi 1 us ] thick and broad enough to blanket an area the size of Mexico. The ice is so massive that its weight presses the bedrock of Greenland below sea level and is so all-concealing that not until recently did scientists discover that Greenland might actually be three islands. { Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2006, &quot; Greenland&apos;s Ice Sheet Is Slip-Sliding Away &quot; } It is thought that before the Ice Age Greenland had mountainous edges, and a lowland (and probably very dry) center which drained to the sea by one big river flowing out westwards past where Disko Island is now. There is concern about sea level rise caused by ice loss (melt and glaciers falling into the sea) on Greenland. Between 1997 and 2003 ice loss was [ 68 - 92 km3/a cumi/a 0 on ], compared to about [ 60 km3/a cumi/a on ] for 1993/4-1998/9. Half of the increase was from higher summer melting, with the rest caused by velocities of some glaciers exceeding those needed to balance upstream snow accumulation (Krabill et al., L24402, GRL 2004). A complete loss of ice on Greenland would cause a sea level rise of as much as [ 6.40 m ft us ]. Researchers at NASA &apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Kansas reported in February 2006 that the glaciers are melting twice as fast as they were five years ago. By 2005, Greenland was beginning to lose more ice volume than anyone expected – an annual loss of up to [ 52 cumi km3 0 or ] per year, according to more recent satellite gravity measurements released by JPL. The increased ice loss may be partially offset by increased snow accumulation due to increased precipitation. Between 1991 and 2006, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) found that the average winter temperature had risen almost [ 10 F-change 1 on ]. Recently, Greenland&apos;s three largest outlet glaciers have started moving faster, satellite data show. These are the Jakobshavn Isbræ at Ilulissat on the western edge of Greenland, and the Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim glaciers on the eastern edge of Greenland. The two latter accelerated greatly during the years 2004-2005, but returned to pre-2004 velocities in 2006. { Rapid Changes in Ice Discharge from Greenland Outlet Glaciers - Howat et al., 10.1126/science.1138478 - Science } The accelerating ice flow has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in seismic activity. In March 2006, researchers at Harvard University and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University reported that the glaciers now generate swarms of earthquakes up to magnitude 5.0. The retreat of Greenland&apos;s ice is revealing islands that were thought to be part of the mainland. In September 2005 Dennis Schmitt discovered an island [ 400 mi km 0 ] north of the Arctic Circle in eastern Greenland which he named Uunartoq Qeqertoq, Inuit for &quot; warming island &quot;. { The Warming of Greenland, New York Times, January 16, 2007 } [ Extreme points ] This is a list of the extreme points of Greenland, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location. Greenland (nation) Northernmost Point — Kaffeklubben Island (83°40&apos;N) - the northernmost permanent land in the world. There are also some shifting gravel bars that lie north of Kaffeklubben, the most famous being Oodaaq. Southernmost Point — unnamed islet 2.3  km south of Cape Farewell, Egger Island (59°44&apos;N) Westernmost Point — Cape Alexander (73°08&apos;W) Easternmost Point — Nordostrundingen, Greenland (11°19&apos;W) Greenland (island) Northernmost Point — Cape Morris Jesup (83°39&apos;N) Southernmost Point — Peninsula near Nanortalik Westernmost Point — Cape Alexander (73°08&apos;W) Easternmost Point — Nordostrundingen, Greenland (11°19&apos;W) [ Towns ] Greenland has 18 towns - settlements with more than 500 inhabitants. Nuuk is the largest town - and the capital - with roughly one third of the country&apos;s urban population. Sisimiut with approximately 5,500 inhabitants is the second largest town, while Ilulissat is number three with ca. 5,000 inhabitants.
