Ken Burns&apos; brother is the documentary filmmaker Ric Burns. Burns&apos; academic family moved frequently, and lived in Saint-Véran, France; Newark, Delaware; and Ann Arbor, where his father taught at the University of Michigan. Burns&apos; mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when Burns was 3, and died when he was 11, a circumstance that he said helped shape his career; he credited his father-in-law, a psychologist, with a signal insight: &quot; He told me that my whole work was an attempt to make people long gone come back alive. &quot;. Well-read as a child, he absorbed the family encyclopedia, preferring history to fiction. Upon receiving an 8 mm film movie camera for his 17th birthday, he shot a documentary about an Ann Arbor factory. Turning down reduced tuition at the University of Michigan, he attended the new Hampshire College, an alternative school in Amherst, Massachusetts with narrative evaluations rather than letter grades and self-directed academic concentrations instead of traditional majors. He worked in a record store to pay his tuition. Studying under photographers Jerome Liebling and Elaine Mayes and others, Burns earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in film studies and design in 1975. At 22, upon graduation, he co-founded with two college friends Florentine Films in Walpole, New Hampshire. As of 2010, there is a Ken Burns Wing at the Jerome Liebling Center for Film, Photography and Video at Hampshire College.

Developing a signature style of documentary filmmaking in which he &quot; adopted the technique of cutting rapidly from one still picture to another in a fluid, linear fashion. He then pepped up the visuals with &apos;first hand&apos; narration gleaned from contemporary writings and recited by top stage and screen actors &quot;, he made the feature documentary Brooklyn Bridge (1981) which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary and ran on PBS in the United States. Following another documentary, The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God (1984), Burns was Oscar-nominated again for The Statue of Liberty (1985). [ Later life and career ] He went on to a long, successful career directing and producing well-received television documentaries and documentary miniseries on subjects as diverse as politicians ( Thomas Jefferson, 1997), sports ( Baseball, 1994, updated with 10th Inning, 2010), music ( Jazz, 2001), arts and letters ( Thomas Hart Benton, 1988, Mark Twain, 2001), historical technology and mass media ( Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio, 1991), and war (the 15-hour World War II documentary The War, 2007, and the 11-hour The Civil War, 1990, which All Media Guide says &quot; many consider his &apos;chef d&apos;oeuvre&apos; &quot; ). [ Personal life ] In 1982, Burns married Amy Stechler, with whom he had two daughters, Sarah and Lily, born circa 1983 and 1987, respectively.

[ September 2011 ] The Civil War has received more than 40 major film and television awards, [ September 2011 ] including two Emmy Award s, two Grammy Award s, the Producer of the Year Award from the Producers Guild of America, a People&apos;s Choice Award, a Peabody Award, a duPont-Columbia Award, a D.W. Griffith Award, and the $50,000 Lincoln Prize. [ Style ] Burns frequently incorporates simple musical leitmotifs or melodies. For example, The Civil War features a distinctive violin melody throughout, &quot; Ashokan Farewell &quot;, which was performed for the film by the musician Jay Ungar. One critic noted, &quot; One of the most memorable things about The Civil War was its haunting, repeated violin melody, whose thin, yearning notes seemed somehow to sum up all the pathos of that great struggle. &quot; [ http://www.salon.com/weekly/west2960909.html Shame and Glory: The Westholds a mirror before the double face of a nation Gary Kamiya Salon.com undated ] Burns often gives &quot; life &quot; to still photographs by slowly zooming in on subjects of interest and panning from one subject to another. For example, in a photograph of a baseball team, he might slowly pan across the faces of the players and come to rest on the player who is the subject of the narrator. This technique, possible in many professional and home software applications, is termed &quot; The Ken Burns Effect &quot; in Apple &apos;s iPhoto and iMovie software applications. As a museum retrospective noted, &quot; His PBS specials [are] strikingly out of step with the visual pyrotechnics and frenetic pacing of most reality-based TV programming, relying instead on techniques that are literally decades old, although Burns reintegrates these constituent elements into a wholly new and highly complex textual arrangement. &quot; In a 2011 interview, Burns stated that he admires and is influenced by filmmaker Errol Morris.
