{ Freeciv.net is an HTML5 browser game } A browser game is a computer game that is played over the Internet using a web browser. { D Schultheiss: Long-term motivations to play MMOGs: A longitudinal study on motivations, experience and behavior, page 344. DiGRA, 2007. } Browser games can be created and run using standard web technologies [ http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/graphics#uses Graphics - W3C W3.org 2010-02-18 2010-05-20 ] or browser plug-ins. Browser games include all video game genres and can be single-player or multiplayer. Browser games are also portable and can be played on multiple different devices or web browsers. [ http://www.pbbg.org/default.asp The PBBG Project Pbbg.org 2010-05-20 ] Browser games come in many genres and themes that appeal to both core players and casual players. [ Characteristics ] Browser games are often free-to-play and do not require any client software to be installed apart from a web browser. Multiplayer browser games have an additional focus on social interaction, often on a massive scale. Due to the accessibility of browser games, they are often played in more frequent, shorter sessions compared to traditional computer games. { C Klimmt: Exploring the Enjoyment of Playing Browser Games, page 231. CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior, 2009. } Since browser games run isolated from hardware in a web browser, they can run on many different operating systems without having to be ported to each platform. { E Adams: Fundamentals of Game Design, page 80. New Riders, 2009. } [ Technologies ] Browser games can take advantage of different technologies in order to function. [ Web standards ] Standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to make browser games, but these have had limited success because of issues with browser compatibility and quality. These technologies, collectively termed dynamic HTML, allow for games that can be run in all standards-compliant browsers.

In addition, WebGL allows for hardware-accelerated 3D support in the browser.

Critics cite examples such as the occurrence of May 2010, when Google replaced their normal logo with a playable rendition of Pac-Man. A small scale study of 11000 users concluded that Google&apos;s playable logo caused users to spend an extra 36 seconds on Google&apos;s homepage, which could be extrapolated to 4.82 million hours over Google&apos;s 504 million unique users. Assuming all of this time was lost during time that would have otherwise been spent productively, the game could be considered to have incurred a time cost of $120 million USD in man-hours.
