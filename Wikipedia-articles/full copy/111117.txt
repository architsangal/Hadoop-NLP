The population was 22,018 at the 2010 census. [ History ] Bloomingdale is one of the earliest villages settled in what is now DuPage County. The Meacham family settled here in 1833, and by the end of the following year, 12-15 families had settled in the locality. The community was served by the Chicago-Galena Highway, modern day Lake Street. It became an important stop for stage coaches and westward travelers. Originally a Cook County settlement, it was annexed by DuPage in 1839, and incorporated as a village later that year. The northern part of the village wanted to develop commercially while the southern part wished to remain a farming community. In 1922, the village split to accommodate this—the northern portion of the town was incorporated as Roselle. From 1950 to 1980, the population increased from 338 to 12,659.
