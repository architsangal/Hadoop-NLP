Some Equisetopsida were large tree s reaching to 30 meters tall; [ http://www.fiu.edu/~chusb001/GiantEquisetum/Intro_Equisetum.html Florida International University An Introduction to the Genus Equisetum and the Class Sphenopsida as a whole 2009-07-22 ] the genus Calamites of family Calamitaceae for example is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period. A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare&apos;s tail ( Hippuris ), is occasionally misidentified and misnamed as &quot; horsetail &quot;. It has been suggested that the pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, inspired John Napier to discover logarithm s. [ Sacks Oliver Field Trip: Hunting Horsetails The New Yorker 2011 August ] [ Etymology ] { Rough Horsetail, &apos;&apos;Equisetum hyemale&apos;&apos; (2-1-0-1-2 is one } { millimeter with 1/20th } { graduation ). The small white protuberances are accumulated } { silicate s on } { cell s. } The name &quot; horsetail &quot;, often used for the entire group, arose because the branched species somewhat resemble a horse &apos;s tail. Similarly, the scientific name Equisetum derives from the Latin equus ( &quot; horse &quot; ) + seta ( &quot; bristle &quot; ). Other names include candock for branching individuals, and scouring-rush for unbranched or sparsely branched individuals. The latter name refers to the plants&apos; rush -like appearance, and to the fact that the stems are coated with abrasive silicate s, making them useful for scouring (cleaning) metal items such as cooking pots or drinking mugs, particularly those made of tin. In German, the corresponding name is Zinnkraut ( &quot; tin-herb &quot; ). Rough horsetail E. hyemale is still boiled and then dried in Japan, to be used for the final polishing process on woodcraft to produce a smoother finish than any sandpaper. [ Distribution, ecology and uses ] The genus Equisetum is near- cosmopolitan, being absent only from Antarctica. They are perennial plant s, either herbaceous and dying back in winter as most temperate species, or evergreen as most tropical species and the temperate species rough horsetail (E. hyemale), branched horsetail ( E. ramosissimum ), dwarf horsetail ( E. scirpoides ) and variegated horsetail (E. variegatum). They mostly grow 0.2-1.5 m tall, though the &quot; giant horsetails &quot; are recorded to grow as high as 2.5 m ( northern giant horsetail, E. telmateia), 5 m ( southern giant horsetail, E. giganteum) or 8 m ( Mexican giant horsetail, E. myriochaetum ), and allegedly even more. { Husby, Chad E. (2003): How large are the giant horsetails ? Version of 2003-03-19. Retrieved 2008-11-20. } Many plants in this genus prefer wet sand y soil s, though some are semi- aquatic and others are adapted to wet clay soils. The stalks arise from rhizome s that are deep underground and almost impossible to dig out. The field horsetail (E. arvense) can be a nuisance weed, readily regrowing from the rhizome after being pulled out. It is also unaffected by many herbicide s designed to kill seed plant s. However, as E. arvense prefers an acid soil, lime may be used to assist in eradication efforts to bring the soil pH to 7 or 8. { Kress, Henriette, Getting rid of horsetail, Henriette&apos;s Herbal Homepage, April 7th, 2005. Retrieved May 19, 2010. } Members of the genus have been declared noxious weeds in Australia and in the US state of Oregon.

Vegetative stem: B = branch in whorl I = internode L = leaves N = node If eaten in large quantities, the foliage of some species is poison ous to grazing animals, including (somewhat ironically given its common name) being poisonous to horses. { Israelsen, Clark E.; McKendrick, Scott S. &amp; Bagley, Clell V. (2006): Poisonous Plants and Equine. PDF fulltext } On the other hand, the young fertile stems bearing strobili of some species are cooked and eaten by humans in Japan, although considerable preparation is required and care should be taken. { Plants For A Future: &apos;&apos;Equisetum arvense&apos;&apos;. } The dish is similar to asparagus and is called tsukushi. { Michael Ashkenazi, Jeanne Jacob. 2003. Food culture in Japan. Greenwood Publishing Group. 232 p. } The people of ancient Rome would also eat meadow horsetail in this manner, but they also used it to make tea as well as a thickening powder. { Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast: Washington, Oregon, British Columbia &amp; Alaska, Written by Paul Alaback, ISBN 978-1-55105-530-5 } Indians of the North American Pacific Northwest eat the young shoots of this plant raw. { Erna Gunther. 1973. Ethnobotany of western Washington: The knowledge and use of indigenous plants by Native Americans. } The leaves are used as a dye and give a soft green colour. An extract is often used to provide silica for supplementation. Horsetail was often used by Indians to polish wooden tools. Equisetum species are often used to analyze gold concentrations in an area due to their voracious ability to take up the metal when it is in a solution. [ Anatomy ] { Northern Giant Horsetail (&apos;&apos;Equisetum telmateia braunii&apos;&apos;), terminal on an unbranched stem. } In these plants the leaves are greatly reduced and usually non- photosynthetic. They contain a single, non-branching vascular trace, which is the defining feature of microphyll s. However, it has recently been recognised that horsetail microphylls are probably not primitive like in Lycopodiophyta (clubmosses and relatives), but rather advanced adaptation s, evolved by the reduction of a megaphyll. { Rutishauser, Rolf (1999): Polymerous Leaf Whorls in Vascular Plants: Developmental Morphology and Fuzziness of Organ Identities. International Journal of Plant Sciences 160(Supplement 6): 81–103. } [ 10.1086/314221 ] { PMID 10572024 PDF fulltext } They are therefore sometimes actually referred to as megaphylls to reflect this homology. The leaves of horsetails grow in whorls fused into nodal sheaths. The stems are green and photosynthetic, and distinctive in being hollow, jointed and ridged (with sometimes 3 but usually 6-40 ridges) and these are often played with by children who will separate and then seamlessly rejoin the segments. There may or may not be whorls of branches at the nodes; when present, these branches are identical to the main stem except being smaller and more delicate. [ Spores ] The spore s are borne under sporangiophore s in strobili, cone-like structures at the tips of some of the stems. In many species the cone-bearing stems are unbranched, and in some (e.g. field horsetail, E. arvense) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in spring separately from photosynthetic sterile stems. In some other species (e.g. marsh horsetail, E. palustre) they are very similar to sterile stems, photosynthetic and with whorls of branches. Horsetails are mostly homosporous, though in the field horsetail smaller spores give rise to male prothalli. The spores have four elater s that act as moisture-sensitive springs, assisting spore dispersal after the sporangia have split open longitudinally. [ Systematics ] [ Species ] The living members of the genus Equisetum are divided into two distinct lineages, which are usually treated as subgenera. Hybrid s are common, but hybridization has only been recorded between members of the same subgenus. { Pigott, Anthony (2001): National Collection of Equisetum – Summary of &apos;&apos;Equisetum&apos;&apos; Taxonomy. Version of 2001-10-04. Retrieved 2008-11-20. } In addition, there are numerous ill-determined populations. One of them, the Kamchatka Horsetail ( Equisetum camtschatcense [ November 2008 ] ), is an ornamental forming imposing stands of these archaic plants. { Kamchatka Horsetail in } { Parc floral de Paris } Subgenus Equisetum [ Equisetum arvense L. ] [ Equisetum bogotense Kunth ] [ Equisetum diffusum L. ] [ Equisetum fluviatile L. ] [ Equisetum palustre L. ] [ Equisetum pratense Ehrh. ] [ Equisetum sylvaticum L. ] [ Equisetum telmateia Ehrh. ] – Field Horsetail, Common Horsetail or Giant Horsetail – Andean Horsetail or Giant Horsetail – Himalayan Horsetail – Water Horsetail – Marsh Horsetail – Meadow Horsetail, Shade Horsetail, Shady Horsetail – Wood Horsetail – Great Horsetail, Northern Giant Horsetail { Branched Horsetail (&apos;&apos; } { E. ramosissimum &apos;&apos;) } Subgenus Hippochaete [ Equisetum giganteum L. ] [ Equisetum myriochaetum Schlect. &amp; Cham. ] [ Equisetum hyemale L. ] [ Equisetum laevigatum A.

In addition, the cell walls of all Equisetum species tested contain mixed-linkage glucan (MLG), a polysaccharide which, until recently, was thought to be confined to the Poales.

Wilson Sarah M. Doblin Monika S. Johansen Bo Bacic Antony Willats William G. T. The Plant Journal 54 3 510–21 ] The evolutionary distance between Equisetum and the Poales suggests that each evolved MLG independently. The presence of MXE activity in Equisetum suggests that they have evolved MLG along with some mechanism of cell wall modification. The lack of MXE in the Poales suggests that there it must play some other, currently unknown, role. Due to the correlation between MXE activity and cell age, MXE has been proposed to promote the cessation of cell expansion. [ Medicinal uses ] The plant has a long history of medicinal uses, although modern sources include cautions with regard to its use.
