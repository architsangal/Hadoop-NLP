German wheat beer, naturally cloudy from wheat protein and specific yeast Wheat beer is a beer that is brewed with a large proportion of wheat in addition to malt ed barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (as required by law in Germany). { Eric Warner, German Wheat Beer. Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. ISBN 978-0-937381-34-2 } The main varieties are weissbier, witbier, and the sour varieties, such as lambic, Berliner Weisse and gose. [ Varieties ] Two common varieties of wheat beer are witbier (Dutch – &quot; white beer &quot; ) based on the Belgian tradition of using flavourings such as coriander and orange peel which was revived by Pierre Celis at the Hoegaarden Brewery, [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3DPhfWmUsaOB4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA49%26amp%3Bdq%3DPierre%2BCelis#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3DPierre%20Celis%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Belgium and Luxembourg – Google Books 17 October 2009 978-1-74104-237-5 Logan Leanne Cole Geert 2007-06-01 ] [ http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000215.html Michael Jackson&apos;s Beer Hunter – Belgium&apos;s Great Beers www.beerhunter.com 17 October 2009 ] and the Celis Brewery in Austin Texas [ Michael Jackson Pocket Guide to Beer Hardcover 208 Running Press 7 10 August 2000 0-7624-0885-5 ] { ISBN 978-0-7624-0885-6. } [ http://web.archive.org/web/20020311075809/http%3A//www.austin360.com/aas/dining/beer01/celis01.html Lisheron Mark 21 February 2001 Last call for a Celis: Whether you blame the beer big boys, Texas tastes or marketing mistakes, a great little Austin brewery is gone Austin American Statesman 26 April 2012 ] { at } { Wayback machine } [ http://belgianbeerspecialist.blogspot.com/2011/04/pierre-celis-conversation-in-hoegaarden.html 20 April 2011 David Cook Pierre Celis: A Conversation in Hoegaarden Belgian Beer and Travel 30 August 2011 ] and weissbier (German – &quot; white beer &quot; ) based on the German tradition of mixing at least 50% wheat to barley malt to make a light coloured top-fermenting beer. [ http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/weissbier.html Weissbier www.germanbeerinstitute.com 20 June 2008 ] Both the Belgian witbier and the German weissbier were termed &quot; white beers &quot; because historically they are pale unfiltered and have a hazy appearance due to the type of yeast. Belgian white beers are often made with raw unmalted wheat, as opposed to the malted wheat used in other varieties. German wheat beers are called weizen ( &quot; wheat &quot; ) in the western ( Baden-Württemberg ) and northern regions, and weissbier or weiss ( &quot; white beer &quot; or &quot; white &quot; ) in Bavaria. Hefeweizen (the prefix &quot; hefe &quot; is German for yeast ) is the name for unfiltered wheat beers, while kristallweizen ( &quot; kristall &quot; being German for crystal) is the same beer filtered. Breweries in other countries, particularly the U.S. and Canada, will brew wheat beers based on these two main traditions using special wheat beer yeasts. Sour beers such as Berliner Weisse, gose, and lambic are made with a significant proportion of wheat. In Britain, wheat beer is not considered traditional, but several brewers produce cask-conditioned varieties, such as Fuller&apos;s Discovery, Oakleaf Eichenblatt Bitte, Hoskins White Dolphin, Fyfe Weiss Squad and Oakham White Dwarf. British wheat beer tends to be a hybrid of the continental style with an English bitter, rather than an exact emulation. { Adrian Tierney-Jones } { Michael Jackson&apos;s Beer Hunter } Wheat beers are commonly marketed as spring or summer seasonal products. [ Weissbier &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Weissbier &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] A kristallweizen (left) and a hefeweizen (right) Weissbier, sometimes weißbier ( &quot; white beer &quot; ), also known as Weizen(bier) ( &quot; wheat beer &quot; ), is a Bavaria n beer in which a significant proportion of malt ed barley is replaced with malted wheat. By German law, weissbiers brewed in Germany must be top-fermented. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. Weissbier is so called because it was, at the time of its inception, paler in colour than Munich brown beer. It is well-known throughout Germany, though better known as weizen ( &quot; wheat &quot; ) outside Bavaria. The terms hefeweizen ( &quot; yeast wheat &quot; ) or hefeweissbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or kristall weiss (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast from suspension. Additionally, the filtration process removes wheat proteins present in the beer which contribute to its cloudy appearance. The hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 IBUs ) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer&apos;s relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavour note unique to hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is 4-vinyl guaiacol, [ Donaghy John A. Paul F. Kelly, Alan McKay Conversion of ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol by yeasts isolated from unpasteurised apple juice Society of Chemical Industry 15 October 1998 http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/61003783/ABSTRACT 28 July 2010 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(19990301)79:3 &lt; 453::AID-JSFA284 &gt; 3.0.CO;2-H ] a metabolite of ferulic acid, the result of fermentation by top-fermenting yeast appropriate for the style. Hefeweizen&apos;s phenolic character has been described as &quot; clove &quot; and &quot; medicinal &quot; ( &quot; Band-aid &quot; ) but also smoky. Other more typical but less assertive flavour notes produced by Weissbier yeast include &quot; banana &quot; ( amyl acetate ), &quot; bubble gum &quot;, and sometimes &quot; vanilla &quot; ( vanillin ). Weissbier is available in a number of other forms including dunkelweizen (dark wheat) and weizenstarkbier (strong wheat beer), commonly referred to as weizenbock. The dark wheat varieties are made with darker, more highly-kilned malts (both wheat and barley). The weizenbocks typically have a much higher alcohol content than their lighter cousins. Some prominent commercial examples of hefeweizen are produced by Hopf, Paulaner, Weltenburger Kloster, Tucher, Erdinger, Schneider Weisse (original amber only), Franziskaner, Schweiger, Hacker-Pschorr, Ayinger (Bräu Weisse), Weihenstephan er, and Widmer Brothers. The style is currently consumed throughout Germany, but is especially popular in its Southern German homeland. [ Witbier ] Witbier, white beer, (French: bière blanche), or simply witte is a barley/wheat, top-fermented beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. It is a descendant from those medieval beers which were not brewed with hops, but instead flavoured and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants referred to as &quot; gruit &quot;. It therefore still uses gruit, although nowadays the gruit consists mainly of coriander, orange, bitter orange, and hops. The taste is therefore only slightly hoppy. The beers have a somewhat sour taste due to the presence of lactic acid. { Belgian Witbier } { http://www2.parc.com/emdl/members/apte/GingerBeer.pdf } The suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle. Witbier differs from other varieties of wheat beer in the use of gruit. French regulation (the territory was French in the 14th century) excluded the use of hops in gruit. Witbier can be made with raw wheat, in addition to wheat malt.

[ December 2010 ] [ Sour varieties ] [ Berliner Weisse Lambic ] A minor variety of wheat beer is represented by Berliner Weisse (Berlin White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and quite tart. Although it can be imbibed by itself, enthusiasts often add sweetened syrups of lemon, raspberry or woodruff herb into the beer. Leipziger Gose is similar to Berliner Weisse but slightly stronger at around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which are unusual for German beers. Both Gose and Berliner Weisse acquire their sourness through the use of lactic acid bacteria in the fermentation in addition to yeast. The Belgian lambic is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from witbier in its yeast. Lambic is a brew of spontaneous fermentation. [ Names and types ] According to the place in which the beer is brewed and small variations on the recipe, several different names are used for wheat beer: Weißbier, short Weiße: these terms are used almost exclusively in the southern German state of Bavaria. &quot; Weisse &quot; is German for &quot; white &quot;. Weizenbier, short Weizen: these names are used to indicate the same thing. &quot; Weizen &quot; is German for &quot; wheat &quot;. Hefeweissbier or Hefeweizen: &quot; hefe &quot; is the German word for yeast. The prefix is added to indicate that the beer is bottle-conditioned (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment. Kristallweissbier or Kristallweizen: if the weissbier is filtered, the beer will look &quot; clear &quot; (or &quot; kristall &quot; ). Dunkles Weissbier or Dunkles Weizen: a dark version of a wheat beer ( &quot; dunkel &quot; is the German word for &quot; dark &quot; ). Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the bock style originating in Germany. An example of this style is Aventinus, made by the G. Schneider &amp; Sohn brewery in Kelheim, Germany. Witbier or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer. La bière blanche (Literally, &quot; white beer &quot; ): The French language name for this type of beer. [ Serving ] Bavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in 500 ml, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 25cl glass, although there is no standard shape. Berliner Weisse is often served in a schooner. Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass; this is generally frowned upon in Bavaria. In northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer lasting foam. { Weizenbier or wheat beer } A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is cola-weizen, which is a mix of cola and weizenbier. Often this is referred to as a &quot; Neger &quot; – a pejorative German term for a person of African descent. If weizen-bock is used instead of normal weizen it is called a &quot; Turbo-Neger &quot;. Another mixture popular during the summer is a 50–50 mix of Weissbier with lemonade, called &quot; Russ &quot;. The German term for Russian. In different parts of Germany bananenweizen (wheat beer with banana nectar mixed in) is very popular. [ Sensory profile ] Weissbiers feature fermentation by-products such as ester s (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially amyl acetate, reminiscent of bananas, and the phenolic compound guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, which smells and tastes like clove s. Other phenolics sometimes found in Weissbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Weissbiers is close to 15 International Bitterness Units, a relatively low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low. The ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill. The carbonation level can range from 5.5  grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7  grams per liter, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially in light of the high protein content of wheat malt.
