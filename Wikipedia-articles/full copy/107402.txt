[ History ] Between 5,000 B.C. and 1,000 B.C., an indigenous tribe of people called the Huchiun, a sub-tribe of the Ohlone, came to the East Bay, including El Sobrante. One of the Huichin villages was located where the El Sobrante Library now stands. The Huichin left a now-buried shell mound beside San Pablo Creek. { El Sobrante Greens. &apos;&apos;The History of El Sobrante&apos;&apos; } In the 1770s, the Huchiun were forcibly converted to Christianity by Spanish missionaries, and died in great numbers. After Mexican independence from Spain in the early 19th century, Spanish colonists were given land grants, one of which was Rancho El Sobrante, deeded to Juan Jose and Víctor Castro in 1841. The grant&apos;s boundaries were unusually complicated, as they were to be determined by the boundaries of the surrounding grants: San Antonio, San Pablo, El Pinole, Boca de la Canada del Pinole, Acalanes, and La Laguna de los Palos Colorados. In this sense, the rancho was el sobrante, the remaining area. Legal disputes concerning the borders and the claims of squatters continued for four decades, with much of the land sold to pay court and attorney costs. Victor Castro was left with [ 549 acre km2 ] of the original grant. He built an adobe dwelling in what is now El Cerrito, and became one of the first members of the Board of Supervisors of Contra Costa County. Castro died at the age of 90 in 1897. { Moraga Historical Society. &apos;&apos;Tres Ranchos del Sur: Historic Mexican Land Grants&apos;&apos;, by Kay Norman, Sarge Littlehale and Carol Moll } Some of his descendants still live in the area of Castro Ranch Road.

[ Hanson, Earl C. The True Story of the California and Nevada Railroad: Narrow Gauge in the East Bay Colorado Rail Museum Golden, Colorado 1994 99954-39-81-6 ] Then the name Sobrante was applied, with the addition of the Spanish definite article &quot; El &quot; coinciding with the opening of the first post office in 1941. [ 629 ] By the early 20th century, Rancho El Sobrante had been reduced to a number of smaller ranches, generally following a dirt road along San Pablo Creek. Many of these ranches were further subdivided. As roads were paved and homes were constructed, El Sobrante changed from a rural to a semi-rural community. [ Demographics ] { Sikh population.
