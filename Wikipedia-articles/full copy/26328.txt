The RAAF was formed in March 1921.

More recently the RAAF participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and is still involved with the War in Afghanistan (2001–present). The motto on the RAAF&apos;s coat of arms is the Latin phrase Per ardua ad astra, which means &quot; Through Struggle to the Stars &quot;. [ Royal Australian Air Force Badge Australian Department of Defence http://www.raaf.gov.au/aboutus/badge.aspx 25 February 2010 ] [ November 2010 H3llBot ] [ History ] [ History of the Royal Australian Air Force ] [ Formation, 1912 ] The RAAF traces its history back to the Imperial Conference held in London in 1911, where it was decided aviation should be developed within the armed forces of the British Empire. Australia implemented this decision, the only country to do so, by approving the establishment of the Central Flying School at Point Cook, Victoria on 22 October 1912. [ http://www.raaf.gov.au/history/ww1.aspx Australian Military Aviation and World War One Royal Australian Air Force 26 December 2011 ] The RAAF was the second air force to be officially formed. [ February 2012 ] [ World War I ] [ Military history of Australia during World War I ] Soon after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Australian Flying Corps sent aircraft to assist in capturing German colonies in what is now north-east New Guinea. These colonies surrendered quickly however, before the planes were even unpacked. The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in protecting British oil interests in what is now Iraq. The Corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of World War I. By the end of the war, four squadrons had seen active service. 460 officers and 2,234 other ranks served in the AFC, whilst another 200 men served as aircrew in the British flying services. { Grey, Jeffrey (1999) A Military History of Australia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Pages. 114–115. } Casualties included 175 dead, 111 wounded, 6 gassed and 40 captured. { Beaumont, Joan (2001) Australian Defence: Sources and Statistics.

Although the Central Flying School continued to operate at Point Cook, military flying virtually ceased until 1920, when the Australian Air Corps was formed. The Australian Air Force was formed on 31 March 1921. King George V approved the prefix &quot; Royal &quot; in June 1921 and became effective on 31 August 1921. The RAAF then became the second Royal air arm to be formed in the British Commonwealth, following the British Royal Air Force. When formed the RAAF had more aircraft than personnel, with 21 officers and 131 other ranks and 170 aircraft. [ May 2010 ] [ World War II ] [ Military history of Australia during World War II ] [ Europe and the Mediterranean ] In 1939, just after the start of World War II, Australia joined the Empire Air Training Scheme, under which flight crews received basic training in Australia before travelling to Canada for advanced training. A total of 19 RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain, and/or with the Desert Air Force, in North Africa and the Mediterranean. About nine percent of the personnel who served under British RAF commands in Europe and the Mediterranean were RAAF personnel. [ http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/raaf/explore.html Explore: &apos;The Angry Sky&apos; Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs 24 July 2009 ] With British manufacturing targeted by the Luftwaffe, the Australian government created the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP; later known as the Government Aircraft Factory) to supply Commonwealth air forces and the RAAF was eventually provided with large numbers of locally-built versions of British designs like the DAP Beaufort torpedo bomber. In the European Theatre of World War II, RAAF personnel were especially notable in RAF Bomber Command : they represented two percent of all RAAF personnel during the war, but accounted for 23% of the total number killed in action. This statistic is further illustrated by the fact that No. 460 Squadron RAAF, mostly flying Avro Lancaster s, had an official establishment of about 200 aircrew and yet had 1,018 combat deaths. The squadron was therefore effectively wiped out five times over. [ Pacific War ] { Brewster Buffalo fighters, flown by many RAAF fighter pilots in the } { Malayan, } { Singapore and } { Dutch East Indies campaigns, as seen here being inspected at } { RAF Sembawang, Singapore. } The beginning of the Pacific War — and the rapid advance of Japan ese forces — threatened the Australian mainland for the first time. The RAAF was quite unprepared for the emergency, and initially had negligible forces available for service in the Pacific. In 1941 and early 1942, many RAAF airmen, including 21 and 453 Squadron s, saw action with the RAF Far East Command in the Malayan, Singapore and Dutch East Indies campaigns. Allied fighter pilots, in particular, performed well in the campaign, despite being outnumbered and the fact that many were allocated sub-standard examples of the Brewster Buffalo. The devastating air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 drove the point home. Some RAAF squadrons were transferred from the northern hemisphere — although a substantial number remained there until the end of the war. Shortages of fighter and ground attack planes led to the acquisition of US-built P-40 Kittyhawks and the rapid design and manufacture of the first Australian fighter, the CAC Boomerang. RAAF Kittyhawks came to play a crucial role in the New Guinea and Solomon Islands campaigns, especially in operations like the Battle of Milne Bay. As a response to a possible Japanese chemical warfare threat the RAAF imported hundreds of thousands of chemical weapons into Australia. [ http://www.mustardgas.org Chemical Warfare in Australia Geoff Plunkett 24 July 2009 ] RAAF volunteers from Brisbane leaving for training In the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, imported Bristol Beaufighter s proved to be highly effective ground attack and maritime strike aircraft. Beaufighters were later made locally by the DAP. Although it was much bigger than Japanese fighters, the Beaufighter had the speed to outrun them. The RAAF&apos;s heavy bomber force was predominantly 287 B-24 Liberator s, which could bomb Japanese targets as far away as Borneo and the Philippines from airfields in Australia and New Guinea. By late 1945, the RAAF had received or ordered about 500 P-51 Mustang s, for fighter/ground attack purposes. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation initially assembled US-made Mustangs, but later manufactured most of those used. The RAAF&apos;s main operational formation, the First Tactical Air Force, comprised more than 18,000 personnel and 20 squadrons; it had taken part in the Philippines and Borneo campaigns and was scheduled to participate in the invasion of the Japanese mainland, Operation Downfall. So too were the RAAF bomber squadrons in Europe, as part of the proposed Tiger Force. However, the war was brought to a sudden end by the US nuclear attack s on Japan. As a result of the Empire Air Training Scheme, about 20,000 Australian personnel had served with other Commonwealth air forces in Europe during World War II. A total of 216,900 men and women served in the RAAF, of whom 11,061 were killed in action. [ Service since 1945 ] During the Berlin Airlift, in 1948–1949, the RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift aided the international effort to fly in supplies to the stricken city; two RAF York aircraft were also crewed by RAAF crews. Although a small part of the operation, the RAAF contribution was significant, flying 2062 sorties and carrying 7030 tons of freight and 6964 passengers. { Eather, Steve (1996) Odd Jobs: RAAF Operations in Japan, the Berlin Airlift, Korea, Malaya and Malta 1946–1960. Point Cook: RAAF Museum, Page 38. } In the Korean War, from 1950–53, Mustangs from No. 77 Squadron (77 Sqn), stationed in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, were among the first United Nations aircraft to be deployed, in ground support, combat air patrol, and escort missions. When the UN planes were confronted by MiG-15 jet fighters, 77 Sqn acquired Gloster Meteor s, which enabled some success against the Soviet pilots flying for North Korea. However the MiGs were superior aircraft and the Meteors were relegated to ground support missions, as the North Koreans gained experience. The air force also operated transport aircraft during the conflict. No. 77 Squadron flew 18872 sorties, claiming the destruction of 3700 buildings, 1408 vehicles, 16 bridges, 98 railway carriages and an unknown number of enemy personnel. 3 MiG-15s were confirmed destroyed, and 2 others probably destroyed. RAAF casualties included 41 killed and 7 captured; 66 aircraft – 22 Mustangs and 44 Meteors – were lost. { Eather, Steve (1996) Odd Jobs: RAAF Operations in Japan, the Berlin Airlift, Korea, Malaya and Malta 1946–1960. Point Cook: RAAF Museum, Page 162. } { Mirage III fighters in 1980 } In the Malayan Emergency, from 1950–1960, 6 Lincolns from No. 1 Squadron (1 Sqn) and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron (38 Sqn) took part in operations against the CTs as part of the Far East Air Force (FEAF). The Dakotas were used on cargo runs, in troop movement and in paratroop and leaflet drops within Malaya. The Lincolns, operating from bases in Singapore and from Kuala Lumpur, formed the backbone of the air war against the CTs, conducting bombing missions against their jungle bases. Although results were often difficult to assess, they allowed the government to harass CT forces, attack their base camps when identified and keep them on the move. Later, in 1958, Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron (2 Sqn) were deployed to Malaya and took part in bombing missions against the CTs. { Eather, Steve (1996) Odd Jobs: RAAF Operations in Japan, the Berlin Airlift, Korea, Malaya and Malta 1946–1960.

The Canberras flew 11,963 bombing sortie s, and two aircraft were lost. One went missing during a bombing raid. The wreckage of the aircraft was recovered in April 2009, and the remains of Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver were found in late July 2009. The other was shot down by a surface to air missile, although both crew were rescued. They dropped 76389 bombs and were credited with 786 enemy personnel confirmed killed and a further 3390 estimated killed, 8637 structures, 15568 bunkers, 1267 sampans and 74 bridges destroyed. { Coulthard-Clark, Chris (1995) The RAAF in Vietnam: Australian Air Involvement in the Vietnam War 1962–1975, The Official History of Australia&apos;s Involvement in the Vietnam War. St Leonards: Allen &amp; Unwin, Page 215. } RAAF transport aircraft also supported anti-communist ground forces. The UH-1 helicopters were used in many roles including Dustoff ( medical evacuation ) and Bushranger Gunships for armed support. RAAF casualties in Vietnam included 6 killed in action, 8 non-battle fatalities, 30 wounded in action and 30 injured. { Coulthard-Clark, Chris (1995) The RAAF in Vietnam: Australian Air Involvement in the Vietnam War 1962–1975, The Official History of Australia&apos;s Involvement in the Vietnam War. St Leonards: Allen &amp; Unwin, Page 351. } Military airlifts were conducted for a number of purposes in the intervening decades, such as the peacekeeping operations in East Timor from 1999. Australia&apos;s combat aircraft were not used again in combat until the Iraq War in 2003, when 14 F/A-18s from No. 75 Squadron operated in the escort and ground attack roles, flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser guided bombs. Since August 2007, a detachment of No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit RAAF has been on active service at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan. Approximately 75 personnel deployed with the TPS 77 radar assigned with the responsibility to coordinate coalition combat air operations.

[ Roundel ] Originally, the air force used the existing red, white and blue roundel of the Royal Air Force. However, during World War II, the inner red circle was removed after a No. 11 Squadron Catalina was mistaken for a Japanese aircraft by a US Navy Wildcat in the Pacific Theatre. [ Air Force Roundel Australian Department of Defence http://www.airforce.gov.au/AboutUs/roundel.aspx 21 October 2010 ] After the war, a range of options were proposed, including the Southern Cross, a boomerang, a sprig of wattle and the red kangaroo. The current version of the RAAF roundel was formally adopted on 2 July 1956. The roundel exists of a white inner circle with a Red Kangaroo surrounded by a royal blue circle. The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face the front. Low visibility versions exist of the roundel, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey. Australian Army helicopters sometimes use just the Kangaroo, either in black or in one of the camouflage colours. [ Royal Australian Air Force badge ] The RAAF badge was accepted by the Chester Herald in 1939. The badge is composed of the imperial crown mounted on a circle featuring the words Royal Australian Air Force, beneath which scroll work displays the Latin motto (shared with the Royal Air Force ) Per Ardua Ad Astra. Surmounting the badge is a wedge-tailed eagle. Per Ardua Ad Astra is attributed with the meaning “Through Struggle to the Stars” and is from Sir Henry Rider Haggard&apos;s novel The People of the Mist.
