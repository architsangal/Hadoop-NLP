Several well-known New York City politicians aspired to succeed him. Bloomberg, a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, decided to run for mayor as a member of the Republican Party ticket. Voting in the primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was postponed later that day. In the rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated Herman Badillo, a former Congressman, to become the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, the Democratic primary did not produce a first-round winner. After a runoff, the Democratic nomination went to New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. In the general election, Bloomberg received Giuliani&apos;s endorsement. He also had a huge spending advantage. Although New York City&apos;s campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign, outspending Green by five to one.

In addition to serving as the Republican nominee, Bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial Independence Party, in which &quot; Social Therapy &quot; leaders Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani exert strong influence. Some say that endorsement was important, as Bloomberg&apos;s votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over Green. (Under New York &apos;s fusion rules, a candidate can run on more than one party&apos;s line and combine all the votes received on all lines. Green, the Democrat, also had the ballot line of the Working Families Party. He also created an independent line called Students First whose votes were combined with those on the Independence line). Another factor was the vote in Staten Island, which has traditionally been far friendlier to Republicans than the rest of the city. Bloomberg handily beat Green in that borough, taking 75 percent of the vote there. Overall, Bloomberg won 50 percent to 48 percent. Bloomberg&apos;s election marked the first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a presidential election since Calvin Coolidge won in 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws. Despite the fact that 68 percent of New York City&apos;s registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The Convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to The New York Times, more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.

He won re-election in 2005. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled to gain high approval levels from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings. Bloomberg&apos;s re-election means the Republicans have won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloomberg&apos;s decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the Republican Party &apos;s losing the mayor&apos;s seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joins Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in this mostly Democratic city. ( John Lindsay was also elected mayor of New York twice while a registered Republican; however, Lindsay did not receive the Republican Party nomination during his 1969 campaign for re-election but ran successfully on the Liberal ticket and joined the Democratic Party during his second term.) Bloomberg has said that he wants public education reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second. { &quot; The Mayor&apos;s Legacy &quot;, } { Gotham Gazette, September 2006. } Some have alleged that he made certain decisions regarding the closure of seventeen day-care centers across the city for political reasons.

However, on May 10, 2010, The New York Times reported: &quot; According to the test [NAEP], New York City eighth graders have shown no significant improvement [in math or reading] since they began taking it in 2003, mirroring the largely flat performance of American eighth graders as a whole during that period. In the city, the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lower-income students. &quot; The annual New York City Department of Education Budget noted that spending for education was $12.5 billion in 2002 and $21 billion in 2009. [ January 2011 ] Bloomberg has chosen to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what New York Times political reporter Adam Nagourney called a &quot; bullpen &quot; open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility. { Nagourney, Adam (December 25, 2001). &quot; Bloomberg Vows to Work at Center of Things &quot;. } { The New York Times. } Some have seen this approach to the New York education system as largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers. Under the reformed approach, a school must do better than the previous year to receive funding. Because of this requirement, many successful schools were closed for being &quot; unsuccessful &quot; because of their inability to raise test scores, even though they were the top performing schools, while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly.

He is socially liberal, supporting abortion rights, gay marriage, gun control, and amnesty for illegal immigrants, for example. On economics, foreign, and domestic issues, Bloomberg tends to be conservative. He opposed a timeline for withdrawal from the Iraq War, and criticized those who favored one. Economically, he supports government involvement in issues such as public welfare and climate change, while being strongly in favor of free trade, pro-business, and describing himself as a fiscal conservative because he balanced the city&apos;s budget. { Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks at 2007 Conservative Party Conference &quot;. } { The New York Times.

[ Being a fiscal conservative is not about slashing programs that help the poor, or improve health care, or ensure a social safety net. It&apos;s about insisting services are provided efficiently, get to only the people that need them, and achieve the desired results. Fiscal conservatives have hearts too  — but we also insist on using our brains, and that means demanding results and holding government accountable for producing them. To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets  — not running deficits that the next generation can&apos;t afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don&apos;t squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns  — and by all indications, we&apos;ve got one coming. Michael Bloomberg speech to UK Conservative Party, September 30, 2007 ] Bloomberg has expressed a distaste of taxes, stating, &quot; Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebody&apos;s got to pay for them, so they&apos;re a necessary evil. &quot; [ http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/authors/michael-bloomberg-quotes.htm Michael Bloomberg Quotes August 2, 2007 woopidoo.com ] As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007 he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear.
