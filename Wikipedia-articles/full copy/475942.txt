{ Oliver (born circa 1958) is a } { Common Chimpanzee and a former performing ape once promoted as a } { missing link or &quot; } { Humanzee &quot; due to his unusually human-like face and a tendency to } { walk upright. Despite his somewhat unusual appearance and behavior, scientists determined in the 1990s that Oliver is not a human-chimpanzee hybrid. } [ Early life ] Oliver was acquired as a young animal (around 2 years old [ Karl Shuker Shuker Karl 1999 Oliver&apos;s No Gene Genie Fortean Times 120 48–49 http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/120_oliver.shtml ] [ September 2011 ] ) in 1960 by trainers Frank and Janet Berger. Supposedly, the chimpanzee had been caught in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Republic of the Congo). Some physical and behavioral evidence led the Bergers to believe Oliver was a creature other than a chimpanzee, perhaps a human-chimp hybrid: Oliver possesses a flatter face than his fellow chimpanzees; Oliver was habitually bipedal (before being struck with arthritis ), never walking on his knuckles like his chimpanzee peers; and Oliver may have preferred human females over chimpanzee females. During a December 16, 2006 Discovery Channel special, Janet Berger herself claimed that Oliver was becoming attracted to her when he reached the age of 16. [ The Human Chimp http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-C6NkRUbI38 YouTube ] He mounted her and tried to mate with her. After he tried it several times it became apparent that Oliver was a threat to Janet, and had to be sold. [ 1977 to 2006 ] { In 1977 Oliver&apos;s owner gave him to } { Ralph Helfer, partner in a small } { theme park called } { Enchanted Village in } { Buena Park, California, USA, built on the site of the defunct } { Japanese Village and Deer Park amusement attraction. When Enchanted Village closed later that year, Helfer continued exhibiting Oliver in a new venture, Gentle Jungle, which changed locations a few times before finally closing in 1982. The } { Los Angeles Times did an extensive article about Oliver as a possible missing link or new sub-species of chimp. Oliver was transferred to the } { Wild Animal Training Center at } { Riverside, } { California, owned by Ken Decroo, but he was allegedly sold by Decroo in 1985. The last trainer to own Oliver was Bill Rivers. Rivers reported problems with Oliver not getting along with other chimps. } The Buckshire Corporation, a Pennsylvanian laboratory leasing out animals for scientific and cosmetic testing, purchased Oliver in 1989. His entrance examination revealed some previous rough handling. He was never used in experiments, but for the next nine years, his home was a small cage, whose restricted size resulted in muscular atrophy to the point that Oliver&apos;s limbs trembled. In 1996, Sharon Hursh, president of the Buckshire Corporation, after being petitioned by Primarily Primates, an organization founded by Wallace Swett in 1978, allowed his retirement in Buckshire&apos;s colony of 13 chimpanzees. Older, partially sighted [ http://www.primarilyprimates.org/videos/ppvid_Oliver.htm Primarily Primates - Oliver 2009-07-15 Primarily Primates ] and arthritic, in 1998 Oliver ended up at a spacious, open-air cage at Primarily Primates [ http://www.texasmonkeyproject.com/animals.html The Texas Monkey Project 2007-12-17 Texas Monkey Project ], in Bexar County, Texas. The sanctuary&apos;s director at the time also decided to resolve the question of Oliver&apos;s taxonomy. [ Genetic testing ] A geneticist from the University of Chicago examined Oliver&apos;s chromosome s in 1996 [ Science Anonymous 1996 Mutant Chimp Gets Gene Check 10.1126/science.274.5288.727e 274 5288 727 ] and revealed that Oliver had forty-eight, not forty-seven, chromosomes, thus disproving the earlier claim that he did not have a normal chromosome count for a chimpanzee. Oliver&apos;s cranial morphology, ear shape, freckles and baldness fall within the range of variability exhibited by the Common Chimpanzee. { Hill, WCO; in } [ Bourne GH 1969 Anatomy, behavior, and diseases of chimpanzees (The Chimpanzee 1 22–49 S. Karger ] Scientists performed further studies with Oliver, the results of which were published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.

Though Oliver&apos;s health may have been compromised by being kept for long periods of time under unsatisfactory conditions prior to his arrival at Primarily Primates, he has barely exceeded half the usual lifespan of captive Common Chimpanzees which survive to adulthood. On April 27, 2007, the state of Texas entered into a settlement agreement which removed Lee Theisen-Watt as overseer of Primarily Primates and replaced her with a board of directors that is headed by Eric Turton and Priscilla Feral. The settlement also dismissed all charges against Primarily Primates. Swett was required to leave the property and is prohibited from serving either on the board or as an employee. { Settlement looming for Primarily Primates by Cindy Tumiel San Antonio Express-News April 25, 2007, 10:30 PM CDT } Oliver remains in the care of Primarily Primates while the facility goes through major renovations. Members of the re-formed board of directors expressed concern for Oliver in court proceedings and in news articles about the ongoing dispute over management of the sanctuary. The Star-Telegram reports that Friends of Animals is now merging with Primarily Primates in order to restructure its management and address past concerns about the future of the sanctuary. { Lawsuit filed in Oregon latest battle over Texas animal sanctuary By WILLIAM McCALL, Associated Press Writer Tue, Jun. 26, 2007. Accessed June 28, 2006 } [ Oliver in popular culture ] The decades long speculation about Oliver&apos;s origins and the possibility that he was a human-chimp hybrid have led to numerous references in popular culture. Many of these are satirical in nature or at least intended to be humorous. For example, the popular Church of the SubGenius assigns a feast day or holy day (sometimes several) to every day of the year and has seen fit to assign October 20 as The Feast of Saint Oliver the humanzee. [ http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/answers/ARTICLES3/X0006_Calendar_of_SubGeniu.html Calendar Of SubGenius Saints ] In addition, there are musical outfits appearing in North America referencing Oliver&apos;s legacy, such as The Humanzees from Ontario, { The Humanzees at Myspace Alt. Pop-Rock from Guelph, ON [CA]. Accessed October 18, 2011 } as well as a New Mexico Jam band calling itself Oliver and The Humanzees. { Oliver and the Humanzees at iSound Alt. Pop-Rock from Albuquerque, NM [US]. Accessed February 29, 2007 } Pop culture depictions like these generally ignore or predate the more recent proof that Oliver is not a hybrid. Oliver has been regularly talked about by Karl Pilkington on The Ricky Gervais Show on a feature called &quot; Monkey News &quot;. The character Caesar in the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes is actually based on Oliver, according to the character&apos;s actor Andy Serkis. { Andy Serkis Talks ‘The Hobbit,’ ‘Rise of the Planet of the Apes,’ Animal Rights, and Steven Spielberg and Explains Why “Performance Capture” is Really, Really Acting } [ References ] [ External links ] The Story of Oliver an online video biography of Oliver produced by Primarily Primates Friends of Animals Official Website - they now oversee Primarily Primates Oliver research and publications by David J.
