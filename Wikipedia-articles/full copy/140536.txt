A Swedish relief army under Charles XII of Sweden defeated a Russia n siege force three times its size. Before, Charles XII had forced Denmark-Norway to sign the Treaty of Travendal. Narva was not followed by further advances of the Swedish army into Russia, instead, Charles XII turned southward to expel August the Strong from Livonia and Poland-Lithuania. Peter the Great took Narva in a second battle in 1704. [ Prelude ] During the 17th century, Russia was less advanced than the rest of Europe. This extended to their armed forces. { Peter The Great - Swift } Peter the Great of Russia was keen to expand his territory by conquering parts of Sweden&apos;s Baltic provinces. Russia made an alliance with Denmark-Norway and August the Strong, king of Poland-Lithuania and elector of Saxony, to wage war against Sweden, whereupon all three countries attacked Sweden from several directions. [ The Northern Wars. War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe 1558-1721 Robert I Frost Longman 2000 978-0-582-06429-4 228 ] Charles XII, assisted by the Royal Navy and the Dutch Navy, first landed in Humlebaek north of Copenhagen and forced Denmark-Norway to leave the alliance in August 1700 (until 1709). [ The Northern Wars. War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe 1558-1721 Robert I Frost Longman 2000 978-0-582-06429-4 229 ] He then moved part of the Swedish army across the Baltic Sea to Estonia where it was joined by Estonian and Finnish regiments of the Swedish army. [ November 2009 ] The new Russian Tsar, Peter I, would drastically modernize Russia in the coming years, but the army with which he traveled in 1700 was still poorly drilled. Peter had employed foreign generals and officers to improve his armed forces, but they were still far from seasoned. Sweden, on the other hand, possessed a well-drilled and well-equipped army. Charles XII of Sweden had the most complete military force in northern Europe, even if it wasn&apos;t the biggest, and Peter envied its capabilities. During November, Russian troops surrounded the Swedish city of Narva in Estonia (part of Sweden at the time), attempting to secure its surrender via siege. A Saxon-Polish army commanded by August II and Steinau was outside Riga in Swedish Livonia. The Saxon-Polish army however had gone into winter camp south of the river Daugava so Charles XII decided to deal with the more immediate Russian threat against Narva. [ November 2009 ] King Charles moved to relieve the city and push Peter&apos;s forces back into Russia. [ The battle ] On 19 ( OS ) or 30 ( NS ) November 1700 [ The Northern Wars. War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe 1558-1721 Robert I Frost Longman 2000 978-0-582-06429-4 230 ] (20 November in the Swedish transitional calendar ), Charles XII positioned his 8,000 men (another 2,500 men were garrisoned in the city and would also take part in the battle at a later stage) opposite the besieging Russian army of about 33,000 [ Peter Englund Peter Englund The Battle That Shook Europe: Poltava and the Birth of the Russian Empire London 2003 Taurus 1-86064-847-9 37 ] to 35,000 troops. [ The Northern Wars. War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe 1558-1721 Robert I Frost Longman 2000 978-0-582-06429-4 230, 232 ] The Swedish army was commanded personally by Charles XII, assisted by General Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld. [ Black Jeremy Warfare. Renaissance to revolution, 1492-1792 Cambridge Illustrated Atlases 2 Cambridge University Press 1996 0-521-47033-1 111 ] The Russian forces were commanded by Tsar Peter and Charles Eugène de Croy. Claiming important domestic events in Russia to which he was required to attend, Peter had left Narva just days before and was therefore not present during the actual fighting. He trusted that his commanders would draw success from the battle and presumed that Charles would not immediately attack his well fortified forces of superior number. Some interpretations view his flight from Narva days before the battle an act of cowardice; most of Europe mocked the Tsar after the battle for his departure. However, some scholars believe this accusation has little merit, as reportedly the Tsar had placed himself in physical danger too many times previously for his flight to be out of cowardice. { Massie, Robert K. (1980). Peter the Great, His Life and World. Ballantine Books. p 341. } The battle of Narva, 1700 For much of the day, a blizzard engulfed both armies, making attacks impossible. However, at midday, the winds changed and the snowstorm blew directly into the eyes of the Russians. Charles saw his opportunity and advanced on the Russian army under cover of the weather. The Swedes attacked in two columns, quickly broke through the Russian lines cutting them in three, and rounded them up. At one crucial point, a bridge over the Narova river collapsed under retreating Russian troops: The stampede led to the overall losses of 6,000-18,000 dead russians { Peter Ullgren, Det stora nordiska kriget 1700-1721 ( } { 2008 ) Stockholm, Prisma. Sidan 57. ISBN 978-91-518-5107-5 } The remains surrendered. The Russian surrender brought to Charles XII&apos;s army all of Peter&apos;s cannons, muskets and military supplies. This left Russia&apos;s remaining armed forces with essentially no equipment. If Sweden, or any other aggressor, had invaded Russia immediately after Narva, Peter would have been almost powerless to stop them. However, the tactical Swedish victory also contained the seed of the future strategical defeat. After Narva, Charles XII became convinced that he knocked the Russians out of the war for a long time and heavily underestimated them until the battle of Poltava. Peter, at the same time, learned the lesson of Narva and initiated a series of efficient military reforms. Russian memorial near Narva [ Russian Memorial ] In 1900, 200 years after the battle of Narva, the Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky regiment s initiated the construction of a memorial to the Russian soldiers who had fallen in the battle of Narva. The memorial consists of a granite pedestal with a cross on top, placed on a mound of earth. The inscription says: &quot; Our heroic ancestors who fell in November 1700. &quot; { Петров А. В. Город Нарва, его прошлое и достопримечательности. СПб, 1901. С. 354-355 } [ Victory Monument ] The Swedish Lion Monument in Narva, Estonia On November 20, 2000, the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lena Hjelm Wallén inaugurated the new memorial/monument to celebrate the victory. It was erected with economic contribution from the Swedish Institute, and was a replacement for an older memorial erected in 1936, that disappeared during the Second world war. The monument is in the shape of a Swedish Lion, standing on a pedestal of granite. On the pedestal it says in Latin MDCC (1700) and Svecia Memor (Sweden Remembers). { http://www.si.se/Svenska/Innehall/Om-Svenska-institutet/Historia/Storytelling/Svenska-institutet-och-Narva/ } [ Second battle ] [ Battle of Narva (1704) ] Four years after the first battle of Narva, Tsar Peter marched again in an attempt to capture Narva. Peter marched with 45,000 men. The garrison of Narva was under the Commandant Major-General Henning Rudolf Horn af Ranzien and consisted of 3,800 infantry and 1,300 cavalry. The Russians made a three-fronted attack and after a long battle they took Narva. General Horn, several officers and a large number of Swedish soldiers were captured, with about 3,200 casualties while the Russians lost over 10,000 men during the siege and the battle.
