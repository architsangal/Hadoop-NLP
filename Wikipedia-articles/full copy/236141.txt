After beginning his career in his home country, he went on to have successful spells in Netherlands and England, winning the UEFA Champions League with Liverpool in 2005, appearing in 186 official games for the club over the course of six seasons. He also spent four years at Real Madrid. Dudek played 59 times for Poland - the second most-capped player in his position for several years - representing the nation at the 2002 World Cup. [ Club career ] [ Early years ] Dudek began playing football at twelve, for Górnik Knurów. Six years later he made his senior debuts, with Concordia Knurów in the third division, where he set a record of 416 minutes without conceding a goal. Dudek only played one season in the Polish top flight, appearing in roughly half of the matches for Sokół Tychy as the club finished in mid-table, making his debut in the competition against Legia Warsaw. [ Feyenoord ] Dudek left his country in 1996 at the age of 23, joining Feyenoord Rotterdam, but had to wait a year before he made his debut, proceeding to appear in all Eredivisie games for the club in the following four seasons combined. He won his first trophy in 1998 –99 – the national championship – along with the following season &apos;s Dutch Super Cup, after a 3 –2 win against Ajax Amsterdam. Dudek won the Dutch Golden Shoe award in 2000, becoming the first foreign player to win the award. He played his final game for Feyenoord on 26 August 2001, against Ajax. [ Liverpool ] Dudek joined Liverpool in England in late August 2001, and immediately replaced Sander Westerveld as coach Gérard Houllier &apos;s first-choice. Following a splendid first season where his clean sheets and fine performances helped the club finish second in the Premier League behind double -winners Arsenal, he was nominated alongside Oliver Kahn and Gianluigi Buffon for the UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year award. The following season, Dudek rebounded spectacularly from a series of poor errors in the league to win the League Cup with a Man of the match performance against Manchester United in the final. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2811805.stm Liverpool lift Worthington Cup BBC Sport 3 March 2003 31 December 2008 ] [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2814453.stm Dudek&apos;s day of deliverance BBC Sport McNulty Phil 3 March 2003 31 December 2008 ] Pope John Paul II, who was a goalkeeper in his youth, met personally with Dudek in 2004, telling him that he was a fan of Dudek&apos;s and followed Liverpool whenever they played; the player presented the Pope with a souvenir goalkeeper shirt, and would later dedicate Liverpool&apos;s UEFA Champions League success to the late pontiff. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/mar/28/smalltalk.sportinterviews Small Talk: Jerzy Dudek The Guardian Lowe Sid 28 March 2008 31 December 2008 ] Dudek was a catalyst in Liverpool&apos;s 2005 Champions League victorious run, performing a double save against A.C. Milan &apos;s Andriy Shevchenko at the end of extra time in the final, after Liverpool had rallied from a 0 –3 deficit to tie the match 3 –3. He saved from Andrea Pirlo and Shevchenko in the ensuing penalty shootout, in an eventual 3 –2 win: during the shootout, he attempted to distract the Milan players with the &quot; spaghetti legs &quot; tactic that was used by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar in the 1984 European Cup Final. Being European Cup winners for the fifth time, Liverpool kept the trophy and received the UEFA badge of honour, and as a tribute to Dudek&apos;s heroics, a group of Liverpool fans, the Trophy Boyz, recorded a successful novelty single called &apos; Du the Dudek &apos;; he became the third Polish footballer after Zbigniew Boniek (with Juventus FC ) and fellow goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk ( F.C. Porto ) to win the Champions League - he also received his second Goalkeeper of the Year nomination.

Despite courting controversy by accusing manager Rafael Benítez of &apos;treating him like a slave&apos;, he insisted that he had no ill feelings towards the club or anyone associated with it and only wanted to leave after failing to make Poland&apos;s World Cup squad, but still stayed on for another year at the manager&apos;s request.

[ http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/polls/ The greatest Champions League moments UEFA.com 15 September 2011 1 April 2012 ] [ Real Madrid ] 34-year old Dudek moved to Real Madrid for 2007 –08, but only played in two La Liga matches in four years, due to the presence of Iker Casillas. Nevertheless, his attitude and work ethic earned praise from his fans, teammates, coaching staff and several Spanish journalists; his Man of the match performance in his debut, in the penultimate game of the season against Real Zaragoza was hailed in the Spanish press, despite not being enough to earn selection for Poland&apos;s squad for Euro 2008.

O&apos;Connell Michael 12 May 2008 31 December 2008 ] In Juande Ramos &apos;s first game as Madrid manager, in December 2008, Dudek was handed a rare start in a 3 –0 home win against FC Zenit Saint Petersburg, as the club was already qualified from the Champions League group stages. In a match where Madrid&apos;s attacking play made headlines, he made several fine saves and exuded an air of calm solidity and confidence, particularly on crosses, earning a clean sheet in the process. This performance earned glowing praise from the manager, who highlighted the goalkeeper&apos;s qualities and referred to him as a &apos;magnificent player&apos;.

Speculation was rife about Dudek&apos;s dissatisfaction with life at Real, and an end-of-season return to Feyenoord where he would work more closely with coach Leo Beenhakker - his former boss at Feyenoord and also at the helm of the Polish national team - was a possibility, but nothing materialised, and with former teammate Jordi Codina leaving to join Getafe CF, the 36-year old eventually accepted a new one-year deal to remain at the club, while also speaking about his contentment.

On 10 April 2010, following news of the horrific air crash which claimed the lives of 96 Polish people including president Lech Kaczyński and several top government officials, the players of both Real Madrid and Barcelona agreed, at Dudek&apos;s request, to observe a minute&apos;s silence for the evening&apos;s El Clásico match. His teammates also agreed to wear black armbands for the match. [ I had no choice but to fulfill an obligation, and asked the officials to give a minute of silence before the most important match of the season. After an hour I came to the club president Florentino Pérez and director Jorge Valdano and they told me not to worry, and that everything will then be honored. They said, &quot; We know what happened. Sincerest condolences. We are with you. &quot; Minute of silence before the El Clásico; Polish Soca, 13 April 2010 ] On 15 July 2010, Dudek accepted another one-year contract to stay with Real Madrid.

Dudek was named as a substitute for the 2010 –11 Spanish Cup final, a 1 –0 win against FC Barcelona. He made his final appearance for the Merengues on 21 May 2011, in a 8 –1 home win over UD Almería, and was substituted in the 77th minute to a guard of honour from his Real Madrid team-mates.

He also captained the team once in a friendly against Estonia. Dudek played nine of the national team&apos;s ten 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as it finished top of its group, and started in the finals in Japan and South Korea, in an eventual group stage exit. He also played in seven of his country&apos;s ten qualifying matches for the 2006 World Cup, but owing to a lack of appearances at club level during the season, he was dropped from the starting line-up in favour of Artur Boruc and left off the final squad as a result, at which point he had earned 56 caps. Dudek&apos;s omission from the World Cup squad was greeted with shock among Polish fans and media alike, with one newspaper&apos;s headline reading &apos;Has Janas [national team manager] gone mad?!&apos;. During a warm-up match against Colombia, where both Boruc and Tomasz Kuszczak were at fault for each of the goals in a 2 –1 defeat, the angered Polish fans started to chant Dudek&apos;s name as a reminder of what they perceived as a mistake by Janas to drop him. It is worth noting that the goal Kuszczak conceded, which prompted the chants, was directly from a goal-kick from the opposing goalkeeper Neco Martínez.

Despite a period of three years in the wilderness, he always believed that he would return to the national team and, in September 2009 he was called-up to the squad for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Slovakia by interim manager Stefan Majewski : after being on the bench for the first match in Prague, which saw Poland&apos;s slim World Cup hopes shattered, Dudek won his 59th cap against the latter on 14 October, in Poland&apos;s final competitive game before Euro 2012 : in a match which was played in heavy snow and in front of a near-empty Stadion Slaski in Chorzów, he was denied a clean sheet by a Seweryn Gancarczyk own goal, as Poland lost 0 –1. He trained with the Polish side in their build-up to Euro 2012, as Przemyslaw Tyton and Lukasz Fabianski both suffered injuries. However his call up to the squad for Euro 2012 is very unlikely. [ Ambassador for Euro 2012 ] Dudek&apos;s status as an icon in Poland played a crucial role in securing the status of joint host nation for the Euro 2012 for his country. Along with his Champions&apos; League opponent Shevchenko of Ukraine, he was a part of the joint delegation and was involved in a presentation with the striker. On May 30 he took part in a football tournament organized by the Polish delegation of the EPP Group at the European Parliament to promote Euro 2012 and Poland, playing as the Polish team&apos;s goalkeeper as they captured third place.

His brother, Dariusz, is also a footballer. Dudek refused to wear the &apos;13&apos; jersey for two seasons after arriving at Real Madrid, stating that Polish goalkeepers generally do not use 13; the numbers 1, 12 and 22 are traditionally used. He therefore wore &apos;25&apos; as it was the next best thing while Codina wore &apos;13&apos; until his departure.

In 2005, Dudek received the title of the honourable citizen of Knurów, during a charity match called &quot; Jerzy Dudek &amp; Friends. &quot; He also made his Polish television debut as an analyst for the 2005 UEFA Super Cup final between Liverpool and PFC CSKA Moscow, which he missed due to injury. In 2006, while on summer vacation in Poland, his home on the Wirral Peninsula was burgled and several valuables and treasured football memorabilia were stolen.
