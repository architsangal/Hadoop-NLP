A public subscription of $1000 raised the funds to build a depot in the city. Subsequent growth is attributed the depot&apos;s completion. [ History of Republic http://www.republicmo.com/history www.republicmo.com City of Republic Missouri 19 October 2011 ] In 2005, the cities of Republic and Brookline consolidated as Missouri State laws allow after a vote of the residents of both communities approved the consolidation with Republic taking over all aspects of city government. Originally, Brookline was to retain its own identity, but the city limit signs have since been changed to Republic&apos;s. However, according to Section I (b) of the Intergovernmental Agreement: &quot; Name of Consolidated Municipality - The name of the consolidated municipality shall be &quot; City of Republic. &quot; To help preserve the identity of the Village, the City will place signs with text “Village of Brookline” at the current corporate limits of the Village. Placement of signage is subject to State sign regulations when placed in State right-of-way. The City of Republic will work with the United States Postal Service to help preserve the history and operation of the Brookline Station Post Office. &quot; Therefore, Brookline has retained its identity per intergovernmental agreement although city limit signs have been placed at the old borders of the village. The Brookline signs are still located to identify the original village area near the post office.
