It is the only move in chess (leaving aside promotion ) in which a player moves two pieces at the same time. Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player&apos;s first rank, then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed. [ http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id%3D124%26amp%3Bview%3Darticle Laws of Chess FIDE ] { (Castling is in rule 3.8) } Castling can only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are not occupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check. Castling is one of the rules of chess and is technically a king move [ Hooper Whyld 1992 71 ]. The notation for castling, in both the descriptive and the algebraic systems, is 0-0 with the kingside rook and 0-0-0 with the queenside rook. (In PGN, O-O and O-O-O are used instead.) Castling on the kingside is sometimes called castling short and castling on the queenside is called castling long; the difference being based on whether the rook moves a short distance (two squares) or a long distance (three squares) [ Hooper Whyld 1992 ]. Castling is in most European languages other than English known as &apos;rochieren/rochada/roque/arrocco&apos; or some other derivative of the same root (from which also the English word &apos;rook&apos; is derived), while the local adjectives meaning &apos;long&apos; and &apos;short&apos; are used in those countries to refer to &apos;queenside/kingside castling&apos;. Castling was added to European chess in the 14th or 15th century and did not develop into its present form until the 17th century. The Asian versions of chess do not have such a move.

The chosen rook has not previously moved. There are no pieces between the king and the chosen rook. The king is not currently in check. The king does not pass through a square that is under attack by enemy pieces. http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=124 &amp; view=article The king does not end up in check (true of any legal move). The king and the chosen rook are on the same rank. Without this additional restriction, which was added to the FIDE rules in 1972, it would be possible to promote a pawn on the e file to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was &quot; discovered &quot; by Max Pam and used by Tim Krabbé in a chess puzzle before the rules were amended to disallow it. See Chess Curiosities by Krabbé, see also :de:Pam-Krabbé-Rochade for the diagrams online. Conditions 4 through 6 may be summarized with the more memorable phrase &quot; One cannot castle out of, through, or into check. &quot; It is a common mistake [ March 2012 ] to think that the requirements for castling are even more stringent than the above. To clarify: The rook involved in castling may be under attack. In queenside castling, the square next to the rook involved may be under attack. (Kingside castling is not legally possible when the square next to the rook involved is under attack: Because only two squares separate the king and the king&apos;s rook, the king would be moved to that square and thereby be placed in check.) [ Strategy ] Castling is an important goal in the early part of a game, because it serves two valuable purposes: it moves the king into a safer position away from the center of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board (it is even possible to checkmate with castling). The choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a- file is undefended; the king is thus often moved to the b-file to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more effectively – on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a tempo may be required to move the rook to a more effective square. It is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called opposite castling. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight as both players&apos; pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king&apos;s castled position without exposing the player&apos;s own castled king. An example is the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence. If the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called artificial castling, or castling by hand. [ Tournament rules ] Under the strict touch-move rule s enforced in most tournaments, castling is considered a king move. But under current US Chess Federation rules, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to perform castling, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to first move the king. As usual, the player&apos;s mind may change between all legal destination squares for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player has formally chosen to castle (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does not apply to the rook [ Just Burg 2003 13–14,17–18,23 ]. It is also required by the official rules that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players [ Just Burg 2003 13–14,17–18,23 ]. The right to castle must be the same in all three positions for a valid draw claim under the threefold repetition rule. [ Chess variants and problems ] Some chess variant s, for example Chess960, have modified castling rules to handle modified starting positions. Castling can also be adapted to large chess variants, like Capablanca chess, which is played on 10x8 board. In chess problem s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by retrograde analysis that either the king or chosen rook has previously moved. [ Notable examples ] [ tright Averbakh vs. Purdy, 1960 rd kd bd rd pd pd pd pd bd pd pd pl pl pl nl pl pl pl rl bl kl rl Black to move, castled queenside, with the rook going over the attacked square b8. ] [ Evans 1970 38–39 ] [ Lombardy Daniels 1975 188 ] In this game Averbakh vs. Purdy between Yuri Averbakh and Cecil Purdy, Black castled queenside. Averbakh pointed out that the rook passed over a square controlled by White and thought it was illegal. Purdy proved that the castling was legal since this applies only to the king, to which Averbakh replied &quot; Only the king? Not the rook? &quot;,. Viktor Korchnoi, in his 1974 Candidates final match with Anatoly Karpov, famously asked the arbiter if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack. Korchnoi vs. Karpov The answer was in the affirmative, and Korchnoi ended up winning the game. Three castlings occurred in the game between Wolfgang Heidenfeld and Nick Kerins, in Dublin in 1973. Of course, the third one (the second one by White) was illegal. See this link, &quot; Greatest number of castlings &quot;. The game is as follows: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.

The loophole in the definition of castling upon which this problem was based was removed by the new requirement that the castling rook must occupy the same rank as the king.

There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king could move once like a knight, and (2) the king could move two squares on his first move. The knight-move could be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat. This second form was used in Europe as early as the 13th Century. In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second rank and (2) the rook moved to the king&apos;s original square and the king moved to the rook&apos;s original square [ Davidson 1949 48 ]. Before the bishop and queen acquired their current moves in the 16th Century they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board. When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier [ Davidson 1949 16 ]. The rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1, if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king could move similarly.) In Lombardy, the white king could jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move. In Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook could be placed on any square up to and including the king&apos;s square, and the king could be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called &quot; free castling &quot;. In the Göttingen manuscript (ca. 1500) and a game published by Luis Ramirez de Lucena in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king. The current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 [ Sunnucks 1970 66 ]. In the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, Johann Allgaier introduced the 0-0 symbol. He differentiated between &quot; 0-0r &quot; (r=right) and &quot; 0-0l &quot; (l=left). The 0-0-0 symbol for queenside castling was added in 1837 by Aaron Alexandre. { Stefan Bücker: &quot; Was bedeutet 0-0? &quot; (What does 0-0 mean?), in: } { Kaissiber, No. 18, 2002, p.70–71 } The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the Handbuch des Schachspiels.
