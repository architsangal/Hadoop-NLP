[ History ] Seymour was founded by settlers from Oregon, who called the town Oregon City; it was originally located where the Western Trail crossed the Brazos River, which flows just south of the townsite. A post office was established in 1879, at which time the town&apos;s name was changed to honor local cowboy Seymour Munday, after whom nearby Munday was also named. Commerce, a newspaper, a hotel, and the county courthouse all followed soon after, as did violence between cowboys and settlers. The town experienced two distinct economic booms: the first, short-lived, with the construction of the Wichita Valley rail line in 1880, and the second due to the discovery of oil in 1906. The population grew from 500 in 1884 to almost 3800 in 1950; it remained at about that level for more than thirty years, but has declined since to 2,740 in the 2010 census. Agribusiness, as well as some tourism from nearby Lake Kemp, has overtaken oil as the driving factor of the local economy. The Old Settlers Reunion and Rodeo has been held each July since 1896.
