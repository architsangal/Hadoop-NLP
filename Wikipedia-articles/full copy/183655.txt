Launched in 1764 as the collier Earl of Pembroke, she was purchased by the Navy in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean, and to explore the seas for the surmised Terra Australis Incognita or &quot; unknown southern land &quot;. Renamed and commissioned as His Majesty&apos;s Bark the Endeavour, she departed Plymouth in August 1768, rounded Cape Horn, and reached Tahiti in time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of Huahine, Borabora, and Raiatea to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasman &apos;s Heemskerck 127 years earlier. In April 1770, Endeavour became the first seagoing vessel to reach the east coast of Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay. Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef, and was beached on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in Batavia (now named Jakarta ) in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years. Largely forgotten after her epic voyage, Endeavour spent the next three years shipping Navy stores to the Falkland Islands. Renamed and sold into private hands in 1775, she briefly returned to naval service as a troop transport during the American Revolutionary War and was scuttled in a blockade of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island in 1778. Her wreck has not been precisely located, but relics, including six of her cannons and an anchor, are displayed at maritime museum s worldwide. A replica of Endeavour was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney Harbour. The space shuttle Endeavour is named for the original ship. Endeavour features on the New Zealand fifty cent piece in recognition of its significant place in the nation&apos;s history. [ Construction ] Endeavour was originally a merchant collier named Earl of Pembroke, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of Whitby in North Yorkshire, and as such is known locally as the Whitby Cat. She was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad, flat bow, a square stern and a long box-like body with a deep hold. { Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 41 } Her length was [ 106 ft m ], and [ 97 ft 7 in ] on her lower deck, with a beam of [ 29 ft 3 in m ]. { Blainey 2008, p. 17 } Her burthen was 368 71 &amp; frasl; 94  tons. [ 1966 Ships, Famous An Encyclopedia of New Zealand A.H. McLintock Ministry for Culture and Heritage/Te Manatū Taonga, Government of New Zealand http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/S/ShipsFamous/Endeavour/en 5 May 2009 ] A flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors and futtock s were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm and her masts from pine and fir. { Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 19 } Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place. { Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 33–41 } Some doubt exists about the height of her masts, as surviving diagrams of Endeavour depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan. While her main and foremasts are accepted to be a standard [ 129 and 110 ft ] respectively, an annotation on one surviving ship plan records the mizzen as &quot; 16  yards 29  inches &quot; (  m). If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full [ 9 ft m ] shorter than the standards of the day. { Sutherland, Rushton, Cooper 1711 } { Davis and Edson 1985 } Modern research suggests the annotation may be a transcription error and should read &quot; 19  yards  29 inches &quot; (  m), which woul d more closely conform with both the naval standards and the lengths of the other masts. { Marquardt 1995, pp. 19–20 } The replica is built to this shorter measurement, as are all current commercial models, and the model in the National Maritime Museum built by the NMM Greenwich. Note, for example, the differences between the height of the mizzen for-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts. [ Purchase and refit by Admiralty ] On 16 February 1768, the Royal Society petitioned King George III to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun. { Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 24 } Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the Admiralty elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent Terra Australis Incognita (or &quot; unknown southern land &quot; ). [ Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30  July 1768 (UK) National Library of Australia 2005 http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID%3D34 26 August 2008 ] The Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. However, First Lord of the Admiralty Edward Hawke refused, going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a Navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman. [ 14423 A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, Vol. 12 ] {, editor } { Robert Kerr &apos;s introduction footnote 3 } In refusing Dalrymple&apos;s command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop [ Paramour 6 ] in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. Edmond Halley. The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography.

On the rear lower deck, cabins facing on to the mate&apos;s mess were assigned to Lieutenants Zachary Hicks and John Gore, ship&apos;s surgeon William Monkhouse, the gunner Stephen Forwood, ship&apos;s master Robert Molyneux, and the captain&apos;s clerk Richard Orton.

A longboat, pinnace and yawl were provided as ship&apos;s boats, though the longboat was rotten and had to be rebuilt and painted with white lead before it could be brought aboard. { Hough 1994, p. 56 } These were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs, one belonging to the boatswain John Gathrey, and the other to Banks. { Marquardt 1995, p. 17 } The ship was also equipped with a set of [ 28 ft m on ] sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted. The refitted vessel was commissioned as His Majesty&apos;s Bark the Endeavour, to distinguish her from another [ Endeavour 1763 sloop 2 ] already commissioned in the Royal Navy, a 14-gun sloop. On 21 July 1768, Endeavour sailed to Galleon&apos;s Reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold. Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck, sides and bow. { Marquardt 1995, p. 13 } The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12   Royal Marines. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 1–2 } Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast. [ Voyage of discovery ] [ First voyage of James Cook ] [ Outward voyage ] Endeavour departed Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94  people and 18 months of provisions. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 4 } [ provisions [b] ] Livestock on board included pigs, poultry, two greyhounds and a milking goat. { Marquardt 1995, p. 15 } The first port of call was Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which Endeavour reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage. { Hough 1994, pp. 75–76 } While in port, an accident cost the life of the master&apos;s mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 7 } To replace him, Cook shanghaiied a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby. [ Thurman [c] ] Endeavour then continued south along the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic to South America, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 1768. Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for Cape Horn, which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. However, attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, with Endeavour repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down the crests of waves. At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 41–44 } The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks&apos; servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm. { Hough 1994, pp. 91–97 } Endeavour resumed her voyage on 21 January 1769, heading west-northwest into warmer weather. She reached Tahiti on 10 April, where she remained for the next two months. The transit of Venus across the Sun occurred on 3 June, and was observed and recorded by astronomer Charles Green from Endeavour’s deck. [ Pacific exploration ] The transit observed, Endeavour departed Tahiti on 13 July and headed northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the Society Islands. { Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 34 } Landfall was made at Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories. However, an attempt to land the pinnace on the Austral Island of Rurutu was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline. { Hough 1994, pp. 133–134 } On 15 August, Endeavour finally turned south to explore the open ocean for Terra Australis Incognita. In October 1769, Endeavour reached the coastline of New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to do so since Abel Tasman &apos;s Heemskerck in 1642. Unfamiliar with such ships, the Māori people at Cook&apos;s first landing point in Poverty Bay thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of Hawaiki. [ HMB Endeavour replica – Cook and Endeavour: Endeavour&apos;s People Australian National Maritime Museum 2008 http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u%3D584 28 August 2008 http://web.archive.org/web/20080720095453/http%3A//www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u%3D584 20 July 2008 ] Endeavour spent the next six months sailing close to shore, while Cook mapped the coastline and reached the conclusion that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for Terra Australis. In March 1770, the longboat from Endeavour carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand. On his return, Endeavour resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 299 } On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship&apos;s boats on the southern shore of what is now known as Botany Bay, New South Wales. { Hough 1994, pp. 168–170 } An 1893 chart showing &apos;&apos;Endeavour&apos;&apos;’s track [ Shipwreck ] For the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11  pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef, { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 343–345 } today called Endeavour Reef, within the Great Barrier Reef system. The sails were immediately taken down, a kedging anchor set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef Endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to [ 70 ft ] less than one ship&apos;s length away. Cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship&apos;s guns were thrown overboard, and the ship&apos;s drinking water pumped out. Buoy s were attached to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later, { Parkin 2003, p. 317 } but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks. { Parkin 2003, p. 313 } When, by Cook&apos;s reckoning, about [ 40 to 50 long ton t ] of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free. { Hough 1994, p. 179 } In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20  pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 345–346 } The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned. As expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about [ 18 in cm ] between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak. The prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was [ 24 mi ] from shore and the three ship&apos;s boats could not carry the entire crew. { Parkin 2003, p. 311 } Despite this, the journal of Joseph Banks noted the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing command in such circumstances. { Blainey 2008, p. 236 } Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse proposed fother ing the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. { Parkin 2003, p. 321 } He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing two of the three pumps to be stopped. { Parkin 2003, p. 322 } { Endeavour River for repairs after her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in 1770. By Johann Fritzsch, published 1786. } Endeavour then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the Endeavour River. [ Shipping The Brisbane Courier 2 Brisbane Newspaper Company Ltd 13 October 1873 http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1329404?searchTerm%3DJames%2BCook 27 August 2008 ] Attempts were made to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented Endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June. Briefly grounded on a sand spit, she was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles. { Blainey 2008, pp. 252–257 } An examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man&apos;s fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef. { Parkin 2003, pp. 335–336 } [ Northward to Batavia ] After waiting for the wind, Endeavour resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 August 1770, reaching the northern-most point of Cape York Peninsula fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland. { Blainey 2008, pp. 299–300 } Cook christened his landing place Possession Island, and the occasion was marked by ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the shore and Endeavour′s deck. { Hough 1994, pp. 189–190 } Route of the Endeavour from the Torres Strait to Java, August and September 1770 Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward along the coast, picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 386–389 } By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavour’s voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 426 } After a three-day layover off the island of Savu, Endeavour sailed on to Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, on 10 October. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 431–432 } A day later the ship was struck by lightning during a sudden tropical storm, but serious damage was avoided thanks to the rudimentary &quot; electric chain &quot; or lightning rod that Cook had ordered rigged to Endeavour’s mast. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 433 } The ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June. The ship′s carpenter John Seetterly observed that she was &quot; very leaky – makes from twelve to six  inches an hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, false keel gone from beyond the midships. Wounded on her larbord side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water. &quot; { Carpenter&apos;s Report, J. Seetterly, 10 October 1770, cited in Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 55–56 } An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within ⅛  inch (3  mm). Cook noted it was a &quot; surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water &quot; for the previous three-month voyage across open seas. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 437 } After riding at anchor for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved out of the water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworm s, which required careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. { Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 55–58 } Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped for shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean. [ Return voyage ] Though Endeavour was now in good condition, her crew were not. During the ship&apos;s stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94  people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery. { Blainey 2008, pp. 338–344 } [ Disease [d] ] By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties. Over the following twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship&apos;s surgeon William Monkhouse. Cook attributed the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered that it be purified with lime juice, but this had little effect. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 447 } Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship&apos;s carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed Endeavour to resume her voyage. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 449–450 } The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 452 } On 13 March 1771, Endeavour rounded the Cape of Good Hope and made port in Cape Town two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 457 } The ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts. { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 460–461 } On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and Endeavour resumed her homeward voyage. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 597 } { Beaglehole 1968, pp. 463–466 } The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and Endeavour entered the port of Dover two days later. { Beaglehole 1968, p. 477 } Approximately one month after his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of Commander, and by November 1771 was in receipt of Admiralty Orders for a second expedition, this time aboard HMS &apos;&apos;Resolution&apos;&apos;. { Hough 1994, p. 217 } He was killed during an altercation with native Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779.

Within a week of her return to England, she was directed to Woolwich Dockyard for refitting as a naval transport. She then made two routine return voyages to the Falkland Islands, the first to deliver provisions and the second to bring home the British garrison. { Hough 1994, p. 215 } She was paid off in September 1774, { Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 62 } and in March 1775 was sold by the Navy to shipping magnate J.

After extensive repairs the ship was finally accepted as a troop transport in February 1776 and embarked a contingent of Hessian soldiers bound for New York and Rhode Island. Upon delivery of her human cargo, Lord Sandwich sailed to Newport, which had been occupied by British forces in December 1776. There she was retained at anchor and intermittently used as a prison ship under the British flag.

The British commander, Captain John Brisbane, determined to blockade Newport Harbor by sinking surplus vessels in its approaches. Between 3 and 6 August, a fleet of Royal Navy frigates and transports, including Lord Sandwich, were scuttled at various locations in Narragansett Bay. [ scuttle [e] ] The owners of the sunken vessels were compensated by the Admiralty for the loss of their ships. The Admiralty valuation for the sunken vessel recorded the specifications of Lord Sandwich as matching those of the former Endeavour, including construction in Whitby, a burthen of 368 and 71/94  tons, and re-entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776.

In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, or RIMAP, began research into the identity of the ten transports sunk as part of the Narragansett Bay blockade, including whether the Lord Sandwich recorded as having sunk there was originally Cook&apos;s Endeavour. Evidence from the Public Records Office in London confirmed that Endeavour had been renamed Lord Sandwich, had served as a troop transport to North America, and had been scuttled as part of the blockade of Narragansett Bay. In 1999 a combined research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum began examining known wrecks in the Bay, to determine if any could be Endeavour. { Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 23–26 } In 2000, a site was identified containing the remains of one of the blockaded vessels, partly covered by a separate wreck of a twentieth-century barge. The older remains were those of a vessel of the same size, design and materials of Lord Sandwich, the ex-Endeavour. Confirmation that Cook&apos;s former ship was indeed in Narragansett Bay sparked considerable media and public interest in confirming her location.

In 1886, the Working Men&apos;s Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the six  cannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.
