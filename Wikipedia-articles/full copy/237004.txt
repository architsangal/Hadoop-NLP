The area where the stadium once stood is now the site of the Mall of America. The Minneapolis Millers minor league baseball team played at Met Stadium from 1956 to 1960. The Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings then played at the &quot; Met &quot; from 1961 to 1981. The NASL soccer team Minnesota Kicks also played there from 1976 to 1981. [ History ] [ Origins and Construction ] Beginning in 1953, inspired by the Boston Braves &apos; move to Milwaukee, Gerald Moore, the president of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce, led the drive to lure a Major League team to Minnesota by constructing a modern stadium. After the rejection of numerous sites, a stadium committee appointed by Moore approved a [ 160 acre km2 on ] plot of farmland in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. [ El-Hai Jack Lost Minnesota: stories of vanished places 2000 U of Minnesota Press 0-8166-3515-3 ] The stadium would serve as the new home, replacing Nicollet Park, of the minor league Minneapolis Millers until an MLB team came to Minnesota. After a plan by architects Thorshov &amp; Cerny won approval, groundbreaking was scheduled to begin on June 20, 1955. The construction was almost delayed, however, when the owners of the property on which the stadium would be built on began a protest, claiming they had not yet been paid. One of these owners created a barricade of farm equipment along his property line that ran directly through where the stadium&apos;s infield would be. The dispute was settled in time for the groundbreaking to move forward as planned. [ Thornley Stew Baseball in Minnesota: the definitive history 2006 Minnesota Historical Society 0-87351-551-X ] Many spectators and dignitaries attended the groundbreaking, including Minneapolis mayor Eric G. Hoyer and several members of the Minneapolis Millers. On February 7, 1956, an accident occurred on the construction site when a portable heater used to cure concrete exploded in the stadium&apos;s basement. After $50,000 of repairs and a three-week delay in construction, Metropolitan Stadium opened in time to hold its first game, a minor league contest between the Millers and the Wichita Braves on April 24 of that year. (At the time of its opening, the stadium still lacked an official name; the park was not named until a July announcement declaring it &quot; Metropolitan Stadium &quot;.)

The Millers were then the top farm team of Stoneham&apos;s New York Giants, and there was some hope or expectation that the Giants might relocate there. Under major league rules of the time, the Giants had priority rights to a major league team in the Twin Cities. Negotiations were also held with the Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators. [ Noll Roger G. Zimbalist, Andrew S.

San Francisco had long been home to the Pacific Coast League &apos;s San Francisco Seals, the top farm team of the Boston Red Sox. As part of the deal, the Millers&apos; parent team then became the Red Sox, who had no plan to move anywhere. Multiple exhibition games featuring Major League teams were held at the Met at this time; a game between the Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds was held at the Met in 1957, and a matchup between the Senators and the Philadelphia Phillies was held shortly after the 1958 All-Star break. The latter game brought 15,990 fans to the stadium, including Calvin Griffith, who described the stadium as &quot; terrific. &quot; [ Baseball and football ] Batting practice before a 1963 game at Metropolitan Stadium. In 1961, Calvin Griffith announced the move of the Washington Senators to Minnesota to become the Twins. The Twins played their first home game on April 21, with a loss to the new Washington Senators. The Millers and their perennial crosstown rival St. Paul Saints were then promptly folded by Major League Baseball. An increase in capacity was then needed to house a major league team, with $9 million being spent to increase the seating capacity from about 22,000 to over 30,000 by the completion of the Twins&apos; inaugural season.

The National Football League (NFL) was also interested in placing a team at the Met. Conversations were had with Viola Wolfner, owner of the Chicago Cardinals, about moving his team to the stadium. The Cardinals moved two of their home games against the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles to Bloomington for the 1959 NFL season. [ Snyder John Twins Journal: Year by Year and Day by Day with the Minnesota Twins Since 1961 2010 Clerisy Press 1-57860-380-3 ] A preseason football game was held each year at the Met from 1956 to 1960.

The Met was often considered a substandard venue for football. The gridiron ran from around third base to right field, with barely enough room to fit the playing field and end zone s. Wooden bleachers were brought onto the field during football season to bring fans closer to the game. For 1965, a large double-decked grandstand was installed in left field to replace the temporary wooden bleachers. The left-field grandstand was actually paid for by the Vikings in return for reduced rent; [ Metropolitan Stadium http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/ballpark/min_ballpark_metropolitan_stadium.jsp Minnesota.twins.mlb.com Major League Baseball 2011-10-01 ] this location was prime sideline seating in the football configuration. This left the Met with the unique configuration of a double deck in left field, and bleachers behind third base. The big left field stand was originally planned to be capable of sliding toward or away from the gridiron (as Denver&apos;s Mile High Stadium later would be), but that part of the project was never realized. A Twins game at the Met, 1965. The park had a skeletal feel, and it was obvious that it had once been a minor league baseball stadium. For instance, fans in the bleachers literally had to leave the stadium to get to the grandstand because the bleachers did not exist when the stadium was originally built. { Metropolitan Stadium at Ballpark Digest } Unlike most multipurpose stadiums built during this time, there were very few bad seats for baseball. The stadium was built using cantilever construction for the overhanging decks, eliminating posts that blocked the fans&apos; view. It was well known as a hitter&apos;s park; its short foul lines —343 to left, 330 to right —were particularly friendly to pull hitters such as Harmon Killebrew. The [ 330 ft m on ] marker in right was actually closer to right-center, leading to speculation that right field was even closer. Since the Met was built in 1956, however, this would not have been a problem for the Twins; baseball required all parks built after 1958 to have foul lines of at least [ 325 ft m ].

In 1965, both the Major League All-Star Game and the World Series were played at Metropolitan Stadium, one of the few times that coincidence has happened since the former event was inaugurated in 1933. (Game 7 of that year&apos;s world series drew 50,596 fans to the Met, the only time a baseball crowd exceeded 50,000 and the biggest-ever attendance for baseball at the stadium.)

Large crowds continued for the Kicks, who drew 41,505 for that year&apos;s opening playoff game. Four days later, another record was set when 49,571 fans came to see the Kicks defeat San Jose, 3-1.

However, the Vikings would not even consider playing at the University of Minnesota &apos;s Memorial Stadium, and demanded a brand-new stadium as a condition of staying in town.

This accelerated the push for construction of a new stadium, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which was completed in 1981. A Twins game in 1981.
