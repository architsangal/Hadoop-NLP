[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1377974 } [ 3 ] Bartonville is a town in Denton County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,093 at the 2000 census. [ History ] Bartonville was originally part of the Chinn&apos;s Chapel settlement, but then it decided to change to a place that was established in 1853 by Elisha Chinn. Chinn&apos;s Chapel eventually became three small communities with Bartonville being the lone remaining town. Bartonville was settled in 1878 and was named for T. Bent Barton. In 1886 a local post office was established, and by 1890 Bartonville had twenty-five residents, a general store, a gristmill, and a cotton gin, all owned by the Barton family. By 1896 Bartonville&apos;s population was estimated at 100 and the town had three general stores. The post office was discontinued in 1906. Slow growth continued, and by 1930 Bartonville had a population of 300 and a business establishment. In 1960, with cities such as Irving looking to expand northward, local residents feared annexation and Bartonville incorporated for the first time. The town then included Double Oak and Copper Canyon, as well as present-day Bartonville. Once the fear of annexation subsided a few years later, Bartonville citizens voted for disincorporation. The present town of Bartonville was incorporated in 1973, and the town has continued to grow as part of the general development of the area north of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Bartonville is adjacent to the master-planned Lantana residential development, which is currently not incorporated. [ 2010 Cyclist Controversy ] In June 2010, Bartonville Town Council amended the Race/Rally ordinance. The ordinance now includes groups of ten or more that are training for an event. Groups may include runners, bicycles, motorized vehicles etc. that will use the roadway. The group must apply for a permit 45 days prior to the date of their event. In recent years Bartonville has become a popular destination for large groups of bicyclists in the Dallas/Ft Worth area to train for their events.
