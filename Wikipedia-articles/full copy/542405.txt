[ the synthesizer sound the musical performance technique accent (music) and sforzando (musical direction) ] [ Orchestra hit Orchestra hit.ogg Synthesized orchestra hit from Roland &apos;s VSC3 other Digital sample Early 1980s David Vorhaus, Trevor Horn, Duran Duran ] An orchestra hit, also known as an orchestral hit, orchestra stab, or orchestral stab, is a sound created through the layering of the sounds of a number of different orchestra l instruments playing a single staccato note or chord. [ Best 2004 72 ] The orchestra hit sound was propagated by the use of early samplers, particularly the Fairlight CMI where it was known as the ORCH5 sample. The sound is used in pop, hip hop and techno genres to accentuate passages of music. [ Fink 2005 14 ] The orchestra hit has been identified as a &quot; hip hop cliché &quot;. [ Fink 2005 6 ] In 1990, Musician magazine stated that Fairlight&apos;s ORCH5 sample was &quot; the orchestral hit that was heard on every rap and techno-pop record of the early 1980s &quot;. [ Musician 1990 ] The orchestra hit has been described as popular music&apos;s equivalent to the Wilhelm scream. [ Kopstein 2011 ] [ History ] [ Owner of a lonely heart-YES.ogg Owner of a Lonely Heart Orchestra hit is used after the chorus in &quot; Owner of a Lonely Heart &quot; by Yes ] Use of short samples (such as the orchestra hit) became popular in the early 1980s with the advent of digital sampler s. [ Warner 2003 69 ] These devices allowed sounds to be replayed at specific times and at regular intervals by sequencing, which was extremely difficult through previous methods of tape splicing. Samplers also began to allow sections of audio to be edited and played by a keyboard controller. The orchestra hit was popularised in Afrika Bambaataa &apos;s &quot; Planet Rock &quot; (1982) [ Fink 2005 1 ] and used soon after in Kate Bush &apos;s &quot; The Dreaming &quot;. [ Fink 2005 5 ] Other examples of use in popular music include En Vogue &apos;s &quot; Hold On &quot; (1990) [ GPI Publications 1994 11 ] and Duran Duran &apos;s &quot; A View to a Kill &quot; (1985). [ Holmes 1997 ] Yes &apos;s &quot; Owner of a Lonely Heart &quot; (1983) used an orchestra hit which was possibly sampled from Kool and the Gang &apos;s &quot; Celebration &quot;. [ Di Nicolantonio 2004 ] By the mid 1980s, the orchestra hit had become commonplace in hip hop music, [ Fink 2005 15 ] and its ubiquitous use became a cliché. [ Warner 2003 105 ] Use in other genres extends to jazz funk, where it was used on the title track of Miles Davis &apos;s 1986 album Tutu. [ Sabin 2002 206 ] By the mid 1990s the sound had begun to be used in caribbean music. [ Best 2004 73 ] Anne Dudley and Trevor Horn used an orchestra hit in the Art of Noise as an effect, rather than a melodic instrument. The sample was used in &quot; Close (to the Edit) &quot;, where it was sequenced alongside sound effects of chainsaw s, breaking glass and motorcycle s. [ Weisbard 2007 238 ] Similarly, the brass orchestra hits in &quot; Owner of a Lonely Heart &quot; are used as a rhythmic device, rather than an effect to evoke a specific environment (in a similar way to samples in Yes&apos;s earlier recordings). The stabs in the song may also be substitutes for other instruments in the rhythm section, possibly drum fill s, and the use of orchestra hits and other samples is particularly noticeable between the first chorus and the start of the guitar solo. Orchestra hits can be used in film music to represent loud noises such as closing doors. [ Machin 2010 157 ] Additionally, some games developed by Konami make usage of digitized Orchestra Hits. The most prominent examples being Super C and Contra Force for the NES, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time for the SNES. [ Technical ] Orchestra hit is defined in the General Midi sound set. [ Rothstein 1995 56 ] It is assigned voice 56, in the ensemble sub group. The Fairlight CMI synthesizer included a sampled orchestra hit voice, which was later included in many sample libraries. The voice was given the name ORCH5, and was possibly the first famous orchestra hit sample. [ Fink 2005 2 ] The sound was a low-resolution, eight-bit digital sample from a recording of Stravinsky&apos;s Firebird Suite – specifically, the chord that opens the &quot; Infernal Dance &quot; section, pitched down a minor sixth and at a reduced speed. [ Fink 2005 3 ] It was sampled by David Vorhaus. Music magazine The Wire suggests that the prototype sample is owned by Vivian Kubrick. [ The Wire 2007 64 ] Early orchestra hits were short in duration (often less than a second) both due to the nature of the sound (a staccato note) and the restrictions on bit rates and depths. A compromise for longer durations would be lower bitrates, which would leave the sample with little timbre. Fairlight produced a number of orchestra hit samples, including a chord version (TRIAD), a percussion version (ORCHFZ1) and a looped version (ORCH2). Samples ORCH4, ORCH5 and ORCH6 were located on the CMI&apos;s disk 8, within the STRINGS1 library. [ Synthiman 2007 ] [ Samples ] The following samples are examples of orchestra hit voices on different sound module s. Each note is played at C4 (see scientific pitch notation ).
