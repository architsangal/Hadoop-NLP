Prime Television launched on 17 March 1962 as CBN/CWN in Orange and Dubbo, New South Wales, and has since expanded to cover regional New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory as a Seven Network affiliate. PRIME7&apos;s administration and broadcast facilities are based in Canberra, alongside the network&apos;s parent company Prime Media Group Limited and the playout facilities for the Golden West Network. [ http://www.primetv.com.au/files/1/33/84/37/PrimeAnnualReportFinalWeb.pdf 2005 Annual Report 17 September 2007 Prime Television Limited ] [ History ] [ Origins ] Prime Television originally began as a group of separate stations and networks - Midstate Television in Orange, Dubbo and Griffith, RVN/AMV in Albury and Wagga Wagga, and NEN/ECN in Tamworth and Taree. [ http://www.austvhistory.com/prime/preaggregation.htm Prime Television 1960s-1980s 17 September 2007 Brooklyn Ross-Hulands AusTVHistory ] CBN-8 Orange began on 17 March 1962, followed by CWN-6 Dubbo on 1 December 1965. The two stations were both licensed to Country Broadcasting Services (also the owner of radio station 2GZ in Orange). CWN was a full-time relay of CBN--the first Australian television station to relay another. The two stations thus formed the country&apos;s first regional television network. At the same time, RVN-2 Wagga Wagga began on 19 June 1964, and MTN-9 Griffith began on 15 December 1965. The two stations merged in 1971 as the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty Ltd, RVN/AMV on air. In northern New South Wales, NEN-9 Tamworth began transmission on 27 September 1965, with a relay in Armidale (NEN-1, later NEN-10) on 15 July 1966. ECN-8 Taree started on 27 May 1966. At one stage, ECN-8 was tied NRN-11 Coffs Harbour (now owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting as Southern Cross Ten ), however the two stations split. NEN later merged with ECN as NEN-9/ECN-8. [ Television 6-8-9 ] As a result of the financial difficulties that many independent stations faced, MTN-9 joined CWN-6 and CBN-8 to form Television 6-8-9 in 1973. Relays were launched in Portland, Lithgow, Mudgee, Cobar, Kandos and Rylstone and Bathurst. In 1981, 6-8-9 changed its name to Midstate Television. Colour television was introduced at the same time as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 - one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date. The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including Tennis and Rugby. In 1979 a documentary titled Goin&apos; Down The Road, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an &apos;Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station&apos;. Midstate produced a number of local programs, including the Weekend Report, Early Shift, Rural Roundup and Around the Schools. Since 1968 CBN was able to access the Postmaster General &apos;s microwave link for national news and other major events. [ Aggregation ] Former RVN now (CBN-2) the Prime Television studios in Wagga Wagga Midstate Television was bought out by media magnate Paul Ramsay&apos;s Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987. It was soon merged with Ramcorp&apos;s other stations, RVN/AMV and NEN/ECN. The name The Prime Network had been in use since 1986. By 1988 the network began to show increased Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation. When aggregation took place, Prime began broadcasting to both southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. Transmission problems meant that aggregation in southern New South Wales took place in two stages - first the Australian Capital Territory and NSW south coast on 31 March 1989, followed by Orange, Dubbo, and Wagga Wagga on 31 December 1989. These changes led to the de-merger of RVN-AMV, with RVN becoming CBN-2. Griffith remained a one-station market, however instead of taking programming from Prime in line with the network&apos;s other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary license, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. [ http://www.austvhistory.com/prime/90s.htm Prime Television 1990s 17 September 2007 Brooklyn Ross-Hulands AusTVHistory ] Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes - mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura license area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. [ Tanner, Stephen The Rise and Fall of Edmund Rouse University of Queensland 1995 http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00000280/01/tanner95.pdf PDF 19 August 2007 ] In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new license for the area at a cost of $3.2 million.

Although advertising revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined as a result of the costs incurred by the network&apos;s expansion - an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation. After losses of $50 million, it was not until 1993 that the renamed Prime Television Limited posted a profit.

[ Kidman Matthew Prime buys Golden West Sydney Morning Herald 29 13 November 1996 ] Western Australia, similar to Griffith and Mildura, remained a one-station commercial market until 1999 when GWN became a Seven Network affiliate, after WIN Television began transmission as an affiliate of both the Nine Network and Network Ten. The network began to expand into New Zealand in 1997, when a number of licenses were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $3.6 million.

The network&apos;s relationship with Seven was further developed throughout the early 2000s, leading to the unsuccessful introduction of 7onPrime branding for Seven Network -produced programs.

This logo was used across the network until 1991, when a new gold logo was introduced. Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the circle. This logo has been used since, and was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the Golden West Network.
