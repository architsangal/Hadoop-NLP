Ramakrishna was born in a poor Brahmin Vaishnava family in rural Bengal. He became a priest of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, dedicated to the goddess Kali, which had the influence of the main strands of Bengali bhakti tradition. The most widely known amongst his first spiritual teachers was an ascetic woman skilled in Tantra and Vaishnava bhakti. Later an Advaita Vedantin ascetic taught him non-dual meditation, and according to Ramakrishna, he experienced nirvikalpa samadhi under his guidance. Ramakrishna also experimented with other religions, notably Islam and Christianity, and said that they all lead to the same God. Though he quit conventional education, he attracted the attention of the middle class, upper middle class and numerous Bengali intellectuals.

From his tenth or eleventh year on, the trance s became common, and by the final years of his life, Ramakrishna&apos;s &apos;&apos;samādhi&apos;&apos; periods occurred almost daily. { Neevel, Transformation of Sri Ramakrishna, p.70 } Ramakrishna&apos;s father died in 1843, after which time family responsibilities fell on his elder brother Ramkumar.

When Ramkumar died in 1856, Ramakrishna took his place as the priest of the Kali temple. [ Harding 1998 251 ] After Ramkumar&apos;s death Ramakrishna became more contemplative. He began to look upon the image of the goddess Kali as his mother and the mother of the universe. Ramakrishna reportedly had a vision of the goddess Kali as the universal Mother, which he described as &quot;... houses, doors, temples and everything else vanished altogether; as if there was nothing anywhere! And what I saw was an infinite shoreless sea of light; a sea that was consciousness.

Ramakrishna&apos;s mother and his elder brother Rameswar decided to get Ramakrishna married, thinking that marriage would be a good steadying influence upon him—by forcing him to accept responsibility and to keep his attention on normal affairs rather than his spiritual practices and visions. Ramakrishna reportedly mentioned that they could find the bride at the house of Ramchandra Mukherjee in Jayrambati, three miles to the north-west of Kamarpukur. The five-year-old bride, Saradamani Mukhopadhyaya (later known as Sarada Devi) was found and the marriage was duly solemnised in 1859. { Sil, Divine Dowager, p. 42 } Ramakrishna was 23 at this point, but the age difference was typical for 19th century rural Bengal.

Analogous to the Western betrothal, child marriage committed the partners to one another, with the actual of living together and assuming family responsibilities delayed until puberty. &quot; } They later spent three months together in Kamarpukur. Sarada Devi was fourteen while Ramakrishna was thirty-two. Ramakrishna became a very influential figure in Sarada’s life, and she became a strong follower of his teachings. After the marriage, Sarada stayed at Jayrambati and joined Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar at the age of 18. [ Spivak 2007 ] {, &quot; Moving Devi &quot;, pp.207–208 } By the time his bride joined him, Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life of a sannyasi; as a result, the marriage was never consummated. As a priest Ramakrishna performed the ritual ceremony—the Shodashi Puja–where Sarada Devi was made to sit in the seat of goddess Kali, and worshiped as the Divine mother. [ Rolland Romain The Life of Ramakrishna 1929 59 The Return to Man ] Ramakrishna regarded Sarada as the Divine Mother in person, addressing her as the Holy Mother, and it was by this name that she was known to Ramakrishna&apos;s disciples. Sarada Devi outlived Ramakrishna by 34 years and played an important role in the nascent religious movement. [ Spivak 2007 207 ] [ Religious practices and teachers ] After his marriage Ramakrishna returned to Calcutta and resumed the charges of the temple again, and continued his sadhana. According to his official biographers, he continued his sadhana under teachers of Tantra, Vedanta and Vaishnava. [ Bhairavi Brahmani and Tantra ] [ Views on Ramakrishna#Tantra Sadhana Ramakrishna&apos;s views on Tantra Sadhana ] In 1861, Ramakrishna accepted Bhairavi Brahmani, an orange-robed, middle-aged female ascetic, as a teacher. She carried with her the Raghuvir Shila, a stone icon representing Ram and all Vaishnava deities. She was thoroughly conversant with the texts of Gaudiya Vaishnavism and practiced Tantra. [ Sen 2001 ] {, p.101 } According to the Bhairavi, Ramakrishna was experiencing phenomena that accompany mahabhava—the supreme attitude of loving devotion towards the divine –and quoting from the bhakti shastras, she said that other religious figures like Radha and Chaitanya had similar experiences. [ Jestice Phyllis G. Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia ABC-CLIO 2004 723 ] The Bhairavi initiated Ramakrishna into Tantra. Tantrism focuses on the worship of shakti and the object of Tantric training is to transcend the barriers between the holy and unholy as a means of achieving liberation and to see all aspects of the natural world as manifestations of the divine shakti. [ Jackson 1994 ] {, p.18 } [ Jean Varenne Derek Coltman Yoga and the Hindu Tradition University of Chicago Press 1977 151 we know that certain Tantric practices, condemned as shockingly immoral, are aimed solely at enabling the adept to make use of the energy required for their realization in order to destroy desire within himself root and branch ] Under her guidance, Ramakrishna went through sixty four major tantric sadhanas which were completed in 1863. { Neevel, pp. 74–77 } He began with mantra rituals such as japa and purascarana and many other rituals designed to purify the mind and establish self-control. He later proceeded towards tantric sadhanas, which generally include a set of heterodox practices called vamachara (left-hand path), which utilize as a means of liberation, activities like eating of parched grain, fish and meat along with drinking of wine and sexual intercourse. According to Ramakrishna and his biographers, Ramakrishna did not directly participate in the last two of those activities, all that he needed was a suggestion of them to produce the desired result. Ramakrishna acknowledged the left-hand tantric path, though it had &quot; undesirable features &quot;, as one of the &quot; valid roads to God-realization &quot;, he consistently cautioned his devotees and disciples against associating with it. [ Sen 2001 99 ] [ Hixon 2002 xliii ] The Bhairavi also taught Ramakrishna the kumari-puja, a form of ritual in which the Virgin Goddess is worshiped symbolically in the form of a young girl. Under the tutelage of the Bhairavi, Ramakrishna also learnt Kundalini Yoga. The Bhairavi, with the yogic techniques and the tantra played an important part in the initial spiritual development of Ramakrishna. [ Richards Glyn A Source-book of modern Hinduism Routledge 1985 [Ramakrishna] received instructions in yogic techniques which enabled him to control his spiritual energy. 63 ] { Neevel, Transformation of Sri Ramakrishna, p.70, &quot; Ramakrishna&apos;s practice of tantra played an important role in Ramakrishna&apos;s transformation from the uncontrollable and self-destructive madman of the early years into the saintly and relatively self-controlled—if eccentric and ecstatic—teacher of the later years. &quot; } [ Vaishnava Bhakti ] The Vaishnava Bhakti traditions speak of five different moods, [ Spivak 2007 ] {, p.197 } referred to as bhāvas—different attitudes that a devotee can take up to express his love for God. They are: śānta, the “peaceful attitude”; dāsya, the attitude of a servant; sakhya, the attitude of a friend; vātsalya, the attitude of a mother toward her child; and madhura, the attitude of a woman towards her lover.

Hindu Psychology Its meaning for the West Routledge 1999 180 ] At some point in the period between his vision of Kali and his marriage, Ramakrishna practiced dāsya bhāva, during which he worshiped Rama with the attitude of Hanuman, the monkey-god, who is considered to be the ideal devotee and servant of Rama. According to Ramakrishna, towards the end of this sadhana, he had a vision of Sita, the consort of Rama, merging into his body. { Isherwood, pp. 70–73 } In 1864, Ramakrishna practiced vātsalya bhāva under a Vaishnava guru Jatadhari. [ Sen 2001 138 ] During this period, he worshipped a metal image of Ramlālā (Rama as a child) in the attitude of a mother. According to Ramakrishna, he could feel the presence of child Rama as a living God in the metal image. { Isherwood, p. 197–198. } [ Nikhilananda Swami The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna Introduction http://www.belurmath.org/gospel/introduction.htm ] Ramakrishna later engaged in the practice of madhura bhāva— the attitude of the Gopi s and Radha towards Krishna. During the practise of this bhava, Ramakrishna dressed himself in women&apos;s attire for several days and regarded himself as one of the Gopis of Vrindavan. According to Sri Ramakrishna, madhura bhava is practised to root out the idea of sex, which is seen as an impediment in spiritual life. [ Sharma Arvind Rita M. Gross Beyond Androcentrism Ramakrishna Paramahamsa: A Study in a Mystic&apos;s Attitudes towards Women Scholars Press ( American Academy of Religion ) 1977 118–119, p.122, p.124 ] According to Ramakrishna, towards the end of this sadhana, he attained savikalpa samadhi—vision and union with Krishna. { Parama Roy, Indian Traffic: Identities in Question in Colonial and Post-Colonial India Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998 } [ September 2010 ] Ramakrishna visited Nadia, the home of Chaitanya and Nityananda, the 15th-century founders of Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava bhakti. According to Ramakrishna, he had an intense vision of two young boys merging into his body. Earlier, after his vision of Kali, he is said to have cultivated the Santa bhava—the child attitude — towards Kali.

[ Jackson 1994 ] {, p.19 } [ Harding 1998 263 ] Totapuri first guided Ramakrishna through the rites of sannyasa—renunciation of all ties to the world. Then he instructed him in the teaching of advaita—that &quot; Brahman alone is real, and the world is illusory; I have no separate existence; I am that Brahman alone. &quot; { The Great Master, p. 255. } Under the guidance of Totapuri, Ramakrishna reportedly experienced nirvikalpa samadhi, which is considered to be the highest state in spiritual realisation. { Roland, Romain The Life of Ramakrishna (1984), Advaita Ashram } Totapuri stayed with Ramakrishna for nearly eleven months and instructed him further in the teachings of advaita. Ramakrishna said that this period of nirvikalpa samadhi came to an end when he received a command from the Mother Kali to &quot; remain in Bhavamukha; for the enlightenment of the people &quot;. Bhavamukha being a state of existence intermediate between samādhi and normal consciousness. [ Isherwood Christopher Ramakrishna and his Disciples Tota Puri 123 ] [ Islam and Christianity ] In 1866, Govinda Roy, a Hindu guru who practiced Sufism, initiated Ramakrishna into Islam. Ramakrishna said that he &quot; devoutly repeated the name of Allah, wore a cloth like the Arab Moslems, said their prayer five times daily, and felt disinclined even to see images of the Hindu gods and goddesses, much less worship them—for the Hindu way of thinking had disappeared altogether from my mind. &quot; [ Isherwood Christopher Ramakrishna and his Disciples 124 ] According to Ramakrishna, after three days of practice he had a vision of a &quot; radiant personage with grave countenance and white beard resembling the Prophet and merging with his body &quot;. [ Rolland Romain The Life of Ramakrishna 1929 49–62 The Return to Man ] At the end of 1873 he started the practice of Christianity, when his devotee Shambu Charan Mallik read the Bible to him. Ramakrishna said that for several days he was filled with Christian thoughts and no longer thought of going to the Kali temple. Ramakrishna describes of a vision in which the picture of Madonna and Child Jesus became alive and had a vision in which Jesus merged with his body. In his own room amongst other divine pictures was one of Christ, and he burnt incense before it morning and evening. There was also a picture showing Jesus Christ saving St Peter from drowning in the water.

Many prominent people of Calcutta— Pratap Chandra Mazumdar, Shivanath Shastri and Trailokyanath Sanyal —began visiting him during this time (1871–1885). Mozoomdar wrote the first English biography of Ramakrishna, entitled The Hindu Saint in the Theistic Quarterly Review (1879), which played a vital role in introducing Ramakrishna to Westerners like the German indologist Max Müller. Newspapers reported that Ramakrishna was spreading &quot; Love &quot; and &quot; Devotion &quot; among the educated classes of Calcutta and that he had succeeded in reforming the character of some youths whose morals had been corrupt. Ramakrishna also had interactions with Debendranath Tagore, the father of Rabindranath Tagore, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, a renowned social worker. He had also met Swami Dayananda. Ramakrishna is considered as one of the main contributors to the Bengali Renaissance.

Philosopher Lex Hixon writes that the Gospel is &quot; spiritually authentic &quot; and &quot; powerful rendering of the Kathamrita &quot; [ Hixon 2002 xiv ] [ Teachings ] [ Teachings of Ramakrishna ] Ramakrishna&apos;s teachings were imparted in rustic Bengali, using stories and parables. These teachings made a powerful impact on Calcutta&apos;s intellectuals, despite the fact that his preachings were far removed from issues of modernism or national independence. His spiritual movement indirectly aided nationalism, as it rejected caste distinctions and religious prejudices. [ Menon Parvathi November 1, 1996 A History of Modern India: Revivalist Movements and Early Nationalism India Abroad http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-3127993.html harv ] In the Calcutta scene of the mid to late nineteenth century, Ramakrishna was opinionated on the subject of Chakri. Chakri can be described as a type of low-paying servitude done by educated men—typically government or commerce-related clerical positions. On a basic level, Ramakrishna saw this system as a corrupt form of European social organization that forced educated men to be servants not only to their bosses at the office but also to their wives at home. What Ramakrishna saw as the primary detriment of Chakri, however, was that it forced workers into a rigid, impersonal clock-based time structure. He saw the imposition of strict adherence to each second on the watch as a roadblock to spirituality. Despite this, however, Ramakrishna demonstrated that Bhakti could be practiced as an inner retreat to experience solace in the face of Western-style discipline and often discrimination in the workplace. { Sumit Sarkar, “ ‘Kaliyuga’, ‘Chakri’ and ‘Bhakti’: Ramakrishna and His Times,” Economic and Political Weekly 27, 29 (Jul 18, 1992): 1548–1550. } Ramakrishna emphasised God-realisation as the supreme goal of all living beings. Ramakrishna taught that kamini-kanchana is an obstacle to God-realization. Kamini-kanchan literally translates to &quot; woman and gold. &quot; Partha Chatterjee wrote that figure of a woman stands for concepts or entities that have &quot; little do do with women in actuality &quot; and &quot; the figure of woman-and-gold signified the enemy with: that part of one&apos;s own self which was susceptible to the temptations of ever-unreliable worldly success. &quot; [ Chaterjee 1993 68–69 ] Carl T. Jackson interprets kamini-kanchana to refer to the idea of sex and the idea of money as delusions which prevent people from realizing God. { Carl T. Jackson (1994), pp. 20–21. } Jeffrey Kripal translates the phrase as &quot; lover-and-gold &quot; and associates it with Ramakrishna&apos;s alleged disgust for women as lovers. { Kali&apos;s Child p 281; 277–287 passim } Kripal&apos;s translation is disputed by Swami Tyagananda, who argues this to be a &quot; linguistic misconstruction. &quot; [ Tyagananda Vrajaprana 2010 243 ] Ramakrishna also cautioned his women disciples against purusa-kanchana ( &quot; man and gold &quot; ) and Tyagananda writes that Ramakrishna used Kamini-Kanchana as &quot; cautionary words &quot; instructing his disciples to conquer the &quot; lust inside the mind. &quot; [ Tyagananda Vrajaprana 2010 256–257 ] Ramakrishna looked upon the world as Maya and he explained that avidya maya represents dark forces of creation (e.g. sensual desire, evil passions, greed, lust and cruelty), which keep people on lower planes of consciousness. These forces are responsible for human entrapment in the cycle of birth and death, and they must be fought and vanquished. Vidya maya, on the other hand, represents higher forces of creation (e.g. spiritual virtues, enlightening qualities, kindness, purity, love, and devotion), which elevate human beings to the higher planes of consciousness. { Neevel, p. 82. } Ramakrishna practised several religions, including Islam and Christianity, and taught that in spite of the differences, all religions are valid and true and they lead to the same ultimate goal—God.

His teaching, &quot; Jive daya noy, Shiv gyane jiv seba &quot; (not kindness to living beings, but serving the living being as Shiva Himself) is considered as the inspiration for the philanthropic work carried out by his chief disciple Vivekananda. [ Y. Masih A Comparative Study of Religions 207 Motilal Banarsidass 2000 ] Ramakrishna used rustic colloquial Bengali in his conversations. According to contemporary reports, Ramakrishna&apos;s linguistic style was unique, even to those who spoke Bengali. It contained obscure local words and idioms from village Bengali, interspersed with philosophical Sanskrit terms and references to the Vedas, Puranas, Tantras. For that reason, according to philosopher Lex Hixon, his speeches cannot be literally translated into English or any other language. [ Hixon Lex Great Swan Motilal Banarsidass 1997 xi Introduction 978-0-943914-80-0 ] Scholar Amiya P.

His speeches reportedly revealed a sense of joy and fun, but he was not at a loss when debating with intellectual philosophers. [ Isherwood Christopher Christopher Isherwood Vedanta for the Western World: A Symposium on Vedanta Vedanta Press 1945 267 978-0-87481-000-4 ] Philosopher Arindam Chakrabarti contrasted Ramakrishna&apos;s talkativeness with Buddha&apos;s legendary reticence, and compared his teaching style to that of Socrates. { Arindam Chakrabarti, &quot; The Dark Mother Flying Kites: Sri Ramakrishna&apos;s Metaphysic of Morals &quot; Sophia, 33 (3), 1994 } Ramakrishna&apos;s explicitly sexual language shocked 19th-century Westerners, even scholars Max Müller who were otherwise his admirers. Müller wrote that his language was at times &quot; abominably filthy &quot;. He admitted however that such direct speech was natural to contemporary Hindus, &quot; where certain classes of men walk stark naked &quot;, and should not be considered intentional filthiness or obscenity. Citing examples of classical poems like Bhartrihari, the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare, Müller felt that few of the sayings would have to be bowdlerize d. { Max Müller (1898), Râmakrishna his Life and Sayings. } { Preface and chapter &apos;&apos; Râmakrishna&apos;s Language.

The Ramakrishna Math and Mission is one of the main organizations founded by Swami Vivekananda in 1897. The Mission conducts extensive work in health care, disaster relief, rural management, tribal welfare, elementary and higher education. The movement is considered as one of the revitalization movements of India. Other organizations include the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society founded by Swami Abhedananda in 1923, the Ramakrishna Sarada Math founded by a rebel group in 1929,the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission formed by Swami Nityananda in 1976, and the Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission founded in 1959 as a sister organization by the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. { Beckerlegge,Swami Vivekananda&apos;s Legacy of Service pp.1–3 } Ramakrishna is considered as an important figure in Bengali Renaissance of 19th-20th Century. Max Müller, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sri Aurobindo, and Leo Tolstoy have acknowledged Ramakrishna&apos;s contribution to humanity. Ramakrishna&apos;s influence is also seen in the works of artists such as Franz Dvorak (1862–1927) and Philip Glass. On Swami Vivekananda &apos;s guru, Ramakrishna, Rabindranath Tagore wrote a poem: &quot; To the Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Ramakrishna Deva &quot;. { Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York. (1996). Sri Ramakrishna Tributes. } [ Diverse courses of worship from varied springs of fulfillment have mingled in your meditation. The manifold revelation of the joy of the Infinite has given form to a shrine of unity in your life where from far and near arrive salutations to which I join my own. ] Tagore was the chief guest on the occasion of birth centenary celebration of Ramakrishna by the Ramakrishna Mission and paid rich tribute to Ramakrishna. During the 1937 Parliament of Religions, which was held at the Ramakrishna Mission in Calcutta, Tagore acknowledged Ramakrishna, whose birth centenary was being celebrated, as a great saint because “the largeness of his spirit could comprehend seemingly antagonistic modes of sadhana, and because the simplicity of his soul shames for all time the pomp and pedantry of pontiffs and pundits.” { Katheleen M O&apos;Connell.

[ Tyagananda Vrajaprana 2010 172 ] Amiya Sen writes that that Vivekananda&apos;s &quot; social service gospel &quot; stemmed from direct inspiration from Ramakrishna and rests substantially on the &quot; liminal quality &quot; of the Master&apos;s message.

[ Sen 2001 22 ] [ Psychoanalysis and sexuality ] The dialogue on psychoanalysis and Ramakrishna began in 1927 when Sigmund Freud &apos;s friend Romain Rolland wrote to him that he should consider spiritual experiences, or &quot; the oceanic feeling, &quot; in his psychological works. { &quot; Oceanic Feeling &quot; by Henri Vermorel and Madeleline Vermoral in International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis } Romain Rolland described the mystical states achieved by Ramakrishna and other mystics as an &quot; &apos;oceanic&apos; sentiment &quot;, one which Rolland had also experienced. { The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling: Revisioning the Psychoanalytic Theory of Mysticism By William Barclay Parsons, Oxford University Press US, 1999 ISBN 0-19-511508-2, p 37 } Rolland believed that the universal human religious emotion resembled this &quot; oceanic sense. &quot; { page 12 Primitive Passions: Men, Women, and the Quest for Ecstasy By Marianna Torgovnick University of Chicago Press, 1998 } In his 1929 book La vie de Ramakrishna, Rolland distinguished between the feelings of unity and eternity which Ramakrishna experienced in his mystical states and Ramakrishna&apos;s interpretation of those feelings as the goddess Kali. { Parsons 1999, 14 } In 1995, Jeffrey J. Kripal argued in Kali&apos;s Child that the Ramakrishna Movement had manipulated Ramakrishna&apos;s biographical documents, that the Movement had published them in incomplete and bowdlerized editions (claiming among other things, hiding Ramakrishna&apos;s homoerotic tendencies), and that the Movement had suppressed Ram Chandra Datta&apos;s Srisriramakrsna Paramahamsadever Jivanavrttanta. { Kripal(1995) Kali&apos;s Child 1 edition } [ September 2010 ] These views were disputed by Swami Atmajnanananda, who wrote that Jivanavrttanta had been reprinted nine times in Bengali as of 1995. name= &quot; atma &quot; [ Atmajnanananda Swami Scandals, cover-ups, and other imagined occurrences in the life of Ramakrishna: An examination of Jeffrey Kripal&apos;s Kali&apos;s child International Journal of Hindu Studies 1 2 pp.401–420 Springer Netherlands August 1997 http://www.springerlink.com/content/k1g8l97203k25047/ 10.1007/s11407-997-0007-8 harv ] Christopher Isherwood who wrote the book Ramakrishna and his Disciples (1965) said in a late interview, &quot; Ramakrishna was completely simple and guileless.
