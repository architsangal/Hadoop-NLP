[ April 2012 ] [ the Arabic word &quot; Allah &quot; the Islamic view of God God in Islam ] { Hâfız Osman } Allah ( [ lang pron ˈ æ l ə ] or [ ˈ ɑː l ə ]; [ الله ] [ ar DIN Allāh ], [ ʔɑlˈlɑː IPA Ar-allah.ogg ], [ ʔalˤˈlˤɑː ] ) is a word for God used mainly in the context of Islam. [ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allah Allah Merriam-Webster Merriam-Webster 25 February 2012 ] In Arabic, the word means simply &quot; the God &quot;. [ http://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/faithgod.html God Islam: Empire of Faith PBS 18 December 2010 ] { &quot; Islam and Christianity &quot;, Encyclopedia of Christianity (2001): Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews also refer to God as Allāh. } [ Allah Encyclopaedia of Islam Online L. Gardet 2 May 2007 ] It is used primarily by Muslims, and often, albeit not exclusively, used by Bahá&apos;í s, Arabic-speaking Eastern Catholic Christians, Maltese Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, Mizrahi Jews and Sikhs. { &quot; Allah. &quot; } { Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007.

Gardet, Allah, Encyclopaedia of Islam } Cognates of the name &quot; Allāh &quot; exist in other Semitic languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic. { Columbia Encyclopaedia says: Derived from an old Semitic root referring to the Divine and used in the Canaanite } { El, the Mesopotamian } { ilu, and the biblical } { Elohim and } { Eloah, the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other monotheists. } Biblical Hebrew mostly uses the plural form (but functional singular) Elohim. The corresponding Aramaic form is [ ʼĔlāhā ] [ arc ܐܠܗܐ ] in Biblical Aramaic and ʼAlâhâ [ arc ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ ] in Syriac as used by the Assyrian Church, both meaning simply &quot; God &quot;. { The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon – Entry for } [ ʼlh ] In the Sikh scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib, the term Allah ( [ ਅਲਹੁ ] ) is used 46 times respectively. [ May 2012 ] The name was previously used by pagan Mecca ns as a reference to a creator deity, possibly the supreme deity in pre-Islamic Arabia. { L. Gardet, &quot; Allah &quot;, Encyclopedia of Islam } [ Smith Peter A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá&apos;í Faith prayer 2000 Oneworld Publications Oxford 978-1-85168-184-6 274–275 ] The concepts associated with the term Allah (as a deity) differ among religious traditions. In pre-Islamic Arabia amongst pagan Arabs, Allah was not considered the sole divinity, having associates and companions, sons and daughters–a concept that was deleted under the process of Islamization. In Islam, the name Allah is the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name, and all other divine names are believed to refer back to Allah. [ Murata Sachiko 1992 The Tao of Islam : a sourcebook on gender relationships in Islamic thought Albany NY USA SUNY 978-0-7914-0914-5 ] Allah is unique, the only Deity, creator of the universe and omnipotent. Arab Christians today use terms such as [ ar DIN Allāh al-ʾAb ] ( [ ar الله الأب ], &quot; God the Father &quot; ) to distinguish their usage from Muslim usage. [ Lewis, Bernard; Holt, P. M.; Holt, Peter R.; Lambton, Ann Katherine Swynford The Cambridge history of Islam University Press Cambridge, Eng 1977 32 978-0-521-29135-4 ] There are both similarities and differences between the concept of God as portrayed in the Qur&apos;an and the Hebrew Bible. It has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept. { Nation of Islam – personification of Allah as Detroit peddler W D Fard } { &quot; A history of Clarence 13X and the Five Percenters &quot;, referring to Clarence Smith as Allah } Unicode has a codepoint reserved for Allāh, [ ar ﷲ ] = U+FDF2. { &apos;&apos;Unicode Standard 5.0&apos;&apos;, p.479,492 } Many Arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for Allah. Arabic fonts and Mac OS X Programs for Arabic in Mac OS X [ Usage in Arabic ] [ Pre-Islamic Arabia ] In pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was used by Meccans as a reference to the creator-god, possibly the supreme deity. { See Qur&apos;an } [ 13 16 nosup no ] {; } [ 29 61–63 nosup no ] {; } [ 31 25 nosup no ] {; } [ 39 38 nosup no ] { ) } Allah was not considered the sole divinity; however, Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain. The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion. Allah was associated with companions, whom pre-Islamic Arabs considered as subordinate deities. Meccans held that a kind of kinship existed between Allah and the jinn. { See Qur&apos;an } [ 37 158 nosup no ] { ) } Allah was thought to have had sons { See Qur&apos;an ( } [ 6 100 nosup no ] { ) } and that the local deities of ar DIN al-ʿUzzā, Manāt and al-Lāt were His daughters. { See Qur&apos;an ( } [ 53 19–22 nosup no ] {; } [ 16 57 nosup no ] {; } [ 37 149 nosup no ] { ) } The Meccans possibly associated angels with Allah. { See Qur&apos;an ( } [ 53 26–27 nosup no ] { ) } Allah was invoked in times of distress. { Gerhard Böwering, God and his Attributes, Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } { See Qur&apos;an } [ 6 109 nosup no ] {; } [ 10 22 nosup no ] {; } [ 16 38 nosup no ] {; } [ 29 65 nosup no ] { ) } Muhammad&apos;s father &apos;s name was [ ar DIN ʿAbd-Allāh ] meaning &apos;&apos; &quot; the slave of Allāh &quot;. [ Islam ] [ God in Islam ] [ Names of God in the Qur&apos;an ] { Hagia Sophia, } { Istanbul, Turkey. } According to Islamic belief, Allah is the proper name of God, { Böwering, Gerhard, God and His Attributes, Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007. } and humble submission to His Will, Divine Ordinances and Commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith. &quot; He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind. &quot; { Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, Allah } &quot; He is unique ( [ ar DIN wāḥid ] ) and inherently one ( [ ar DIN ʾaḥad ] ), all-merciful and omnipotent. &quot; The Qur&apos;an declares &quot; the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures. &quot; { Eski Cami (The Old Mosque) in } { Edirne, Turkey. } In Islamic tradition, there are 99 Names of God ( [ ar DIN al-ʾasmāʾ al-ḥusnā ] lit. meaning: &quot; The best names &quot; ) each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah. [ Bentley David The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book William Carey Library 1999 September 978-0-87808-299-5 ] All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name. Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are &quot; the Merciful &quot; ( ar-raḥmān ) and &quot; the Compassionate &quot; ( [ ar DIN al-raḥīm ] ). Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase ar DIN ʾinšāʾ Allāh (meaning &quot; God willing &quot; ) after references to future events. { Gary S. Gregg, The Middle East: A Cultural Psychology, Oxford University Press, p.30 } Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of ar DIN bismi-llāh (meaning &quot; In the name of God &quot; ). { Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Islamic Society in Practice, University Press of Florida, p.24 } There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including &quot; Subhan-Allah &quot; (Holiness be to God), &quot; Alhamdulillah &quot; (Praise be to God), ar DIN lā ʾilāha ʾilla-llāh (There is no deity but God) and &quot; Allāhu Akbar &quot; (God is great) as a devotional exercise of remembering God ( zikr ). { M. Mukarram Ahmed, Muzaffar Husain Syed, Encyclopaedia of Islam,Anmol Publications PVT. LTD, p.144 } In a Sufi practice known as zikr Allah (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name Allah or other divine names while controlling his or her breath. { Carl W. Ernst, Bruce B. Lawrence, Sufi Martyrs of Love: The Chishti Order in South Asia and Beyond, Macmillan, p.29 } Some scholars [ December 2008 ] have suggested that Muhammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful. According to Böwering, in contrast with Pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. { Allah, } { Encyclopædia Britannica } According to Francis Edwards Peters, &quot; The Qur&apos;an insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews ( [ 29 46 nosup no ] ). The Koran&apos;s Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham &quot;. Peters states that the Qur&apos;an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows Israel ites. { F.E. Peters, Islam, p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003 } [ Christianity ] The Aramaic word for &quot; God &quot; in the language of Assyrian Christians is [ ʼĔlāhā ], or Alaha. Arabic -speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word &quot; Allah &quot; to mean &quot; God &quot;. The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for &apos;God&apos; than &apos;Allah&apos;. (Even the Arabic-descended Maltese language of Malta, whose population is almost entirely Roman Catholic, uses Alla for &apos;God&apos;.) Arab Christians for example use terms [ ar DIN Allāh al-ʾab ] ( [ ar الله الأب ] ) meaning God the Father, [ ar DIN Allāh al-ibn ] ( [ ar الله الابن ] ) mean God the Son, and [ ar DIN Allāh ar-rūḥ al-quds ] ( [ ar الله الروح القدس ] ) meaning God the Holy Spirit (See God in Christianity for the Christian concept of God). Arab Christian s have used two forms of invocations that were affix ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim [ ar DIN bismi-llah ], and also created their own Trinitized [ ar DIN bismi-llah ] as early as the eight century CE. The Muslim [ ar DIN bismi-llah ] reads: &quot; In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. &quot; The Trinitized [ ar DIN bismi-llah ] reads: &quot; In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God. &quot; The Syria c, Latin and Greek invocations do not have the words &quot; One God &quot; at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims. { Thomas E. Burman, Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs, } { Brill, 1994, p.103 } According to Marshall Hodgson, it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator. { Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization, } { University of Chicago Press, p.156 } [ Judaism ] [ Mizrahi Jews Names of God in Judaism ] As Hebrew and Arabic are closely related Semitic languages, it is commonly accepted that Allah (root, ar DIN ʾilāh ) and the Biblical Elohim are cognate derivations of same origin, as in Eloah a Hebrew word which is used (e.g. in the Book of Job ) to mean &quot; (the) God &quot; and also &quot; god or gods &quot; as in the case of Elohim, ultimately deriving from the root El, &quot; strong &quot;, possibly genericized from El (deity), as in the Ugaritic &apos;lhm &quot; children of El &quot; (the ancient Near Eastern creator god in pre-Abrahamic tradition). In Jewish scripture Elohim is used as a descriptive title for the God of the scriptures whose name is YHWH, as well as for pagan gods. [ As a loanword ] [ English and other European languages ] The history of the word &quot; Allāh &quot; in English was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in 19th century; for example, Thomas Carlyle (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muhammad (1934), Tor Andræ always used the term Allah, though he allows that this &apos;conception of God&apos; seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies. { William Montgomery Watt, Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue, } { Routledge, 1983, p.45 } Languages which may not commonly use the term Allah to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, the word ojalá in the Spanish language and oxalá in the Portuguese language exist today, borrowed from Arabic (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This word literally means &quot; God willing &quot; (in the sense of &quot; I hope so &quot; ). { Islam in Luce López Baralt, Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present, Brill, 1992, p.25 } The German poet Mahlmann used the form &quot; Allah &quot; as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity, though it is unclear how much Islamic thought he intended to convey. Some Muslims leave the name &quot; Allāh &quot; untranslated in English. { F. E. Peters, The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition, } { Princeton University Press, p.12 } [ Malaysian and Indonesian language ] Christians in Indonesia and Malaysia also use Allah to refer to God in the Malaysian language and Indonesian language (both languages forms of the Malay language which is referred to as Bahasa Melayu). Mainstream Bible translations in both languages use Allah as the translation of Hebrew Elohim (translated in English Bibles as &quot; God &quot; ). { Example: Usage of the word &quot; Allah &quot; from Matthew 22:32 in Indonesian bible versions (parallel view) as old as 1733 } This goes back to early translation work by Francis Xavier in the 16th century. { The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society Sneddon, James M.; University of New South Wales Press; 2004 } { The History of Christianity in India from the Commencement of the Christian Era: Hough, James; Adamant Media Corporation; 2001 } The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by A.C. Ruyl, Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in 1650 recorded &quot; Allah &quot; as the translation of the Dutch word &quot; Godt &quot;. { Justus Heurnius, Albert Ruyl, Caspar Wiltens. &quot; Vocabularium ofte Woordenboeck nae ordre van den alphabeth, in &apos;t Duytsch en Maleys &quot;. 1650:65 } Ruyl also translated Matthew in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after King James Version was published { Barton, John (2002–12). The Biblical World, Oxford, UK: Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-27574-3. } { North, Eric McCoy; Eugene Albert Nida ((2nd Edition) 1972). The Book of a Thousand Tongues, London: United Bible Societies. } ), which was printed in the Netherlands in 1629. Then he translated Mark which was published in 1638. { Biography of Ruyl } { Encyclopædia Britannica: Albert Cornelius Ruyl } The government of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed usage of the term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay for more than four centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of Allah by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government has in turn appealed the court ruling, and the High Court has suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal is heard. [ In other scripts and languages ] [ ar DIN Allāh ] in other languages with Arabic script is spelled in the same way. This includes Urdu, Persian / Dari, Uyghur among others.

This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using [ ar DIN ʾalif ] to spell [ ar DIN ā ]. However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic [ ar DIN ʾalif ] is added on top of the ar DIN šaddah to indicate the pronunciation. One exception may be in the pre-Islamic Zabad inscription, [ Zebed Inscription: A Pre-Islamic Trilingual Inscription In Greek, Syriac &amp; Arabic From 512 CE http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/zebed.html Islamic Awareness 17 March 2005 ] where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone-standing h with a lengthened start, or may be a non-standard conjoined [ ar DIN l-h ] :- [ ar الاه ] [ ar DIN Allāh ] [ ar DIN ʾalif ] [ ar DIN ā ] [ ar الإله ] [ ar DIN Al-ʾilāh ] [ ar DIN ʾalif ] [ ar DIN ā ] : This reading would be spelled phonetically with for the. : This reading would be = &quot; the god &quot; (an older form, without contraction), by older spelling practice without for. [ Unicode ] Unicode has a codepoint reserved for [ ar DIN Allāh ], [ ﷲ ] = U+FDF2.This character according to the official Unicode specification is a ligature of alif-lām-lām-shadda-(superscript alif)-hā ( اللّٰه U+0627 U+0644 U+0644 U+0651 U+0670 U+0647). { Arabic calligraphy. } There is, however some confusion arising from the fact that Arabic typography usually features a [ ar DIN llāh ] glyph without the preceding [ ar DIN ʾalif ], which only occurs phrase-initially (or with [ ar DIN hamza tu l-waṣl ] [ Arab ٱ ] in Qur&apos;anic orthography). Consequently, the majority of Arabic Unicode fonts do not conform with the specification and have a glyph without the alif at this position (e.g. those provided by Linotype, the great majority of those licensed to or developed by Microsoft, those of Arabeyes.org, SIL &apos;s Lateef and the fonts of CRULP developed in Pakistan),while others have the prescribed form with alif (e.g. SIL&apos;s Scheherazade, Adobe Arabic distributed with the Middle-Eastern versionof the Adobe Reader 7, Arial Unicode MS, and Arabic Typesetting, distributed with VOLT and with Microsoft Office Proofing Tools 2003 ). The calligraphic variant of the word used as the Coat of arms of Iran is encoded in Unicode, in the Miscellaneous Symbols range, at codepoint U+262B ( [ ☫ ] ).
