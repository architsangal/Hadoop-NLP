The senior squad play home games at the Madejski Stadium in Reading and compete in the top division of English rugby union, the Aviva Premiership. The club also compete in the Anglo-Welsh Cup as well as one of the two Europe-wide club competitions—the Heineken Cup or European Challenge Cup, depending on their performance in the previous season. The club will continue to play their home games at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, Berkshire until 2026. The team plays in green and white colours, with a reversed away strip. London Irish won its first major trophy in 2002, claiming the Powergen Cup (the competition that later became the Anglo-Welsh Cup). Irish have also reached the final of the 2009 Guinness Premiership, losing 10-9 to Leicester at Twickenham. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/8048413.stm BBC News Bryn Palmer Leicester 10-9 London Irish 16 May 2009 ] In the 2007/08 the team came close to a place in the Heineken Cup Final losing out to Toulouse 15-21 in a tense encounter at Twickenham. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/7363046.stm BBC News London Irish 15-21 Toulouse 26 April 2008 ] The club&apos;s mascot is an Irish Wolfhound called Digger. [ History ] { Madejski Stadium with 22,648 people in attendance } { Leicester Tigers } { Madejski Stadium } Also known as The Exiles, London Irish RFC was founded in 1898 for the young Irishmen of London; it was modelled on the already established London Welsh and London Scottish teams. London Irish suffered during World War I and the Irish War of Independence. It was not until 1923 when the Irish Free State was established and peace returned that the club was able to welcome players from across the Irish Sea on a regular basis. By the late 1920s the club boasted its first &quot; home grown &quot; Ireland international in S J &apos;Cags&apos; Cagney who won 13 caps between 1925 and 1929. The club developed a home of its own in 1931 at The Avenue in Sunbury, the first game was played on 5 December against London Welsh; the result was an honourable 8–8 draw. Although the club now play their games as tenants of Reading FC at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, the ground at Sunbury is still its spiritual home. The 1950s was a period of mixed fortunes for London Irish. In 1959–1960 season London Irish only lost 2 games all season, featuring Ireland International players such as Andy Mulligan &amp; Sean McDermott, Mike (C.M.H.) Gibson (played 1 game in the late 1960s), Tony O&apos;Reilly (who played a handful of games in 1970) and Ollie Waldron (who played in the late 1960s-early 70s), all graced the Sunbury pitch. The improving quality of fixtures demanded a change in attitude to training and playing as the sixties became the seventies. Under the leadership of the great hooker Ken Kennedy, with the assistance of exceptional players like Nick Hegarty, Mick Molloy and Barry Bresnihan, London Irish became a force to be reckoned with once more. In 1976–77 the Rugby Football Union introduced proper club merit tables and in that season London Irish finished first in the London Division with six wins out of seven. The Irish made visits to France and famously to South Africa in 1977 where the club became the first touring side to play so many mixed race teams. In playing terms the eighties were another period of inconsistency. The first team struggled to find reliable form as work pressures made more demands on players&apos; time making them unavailable for regular training and matches. Happily, at the lower levels and socially London Irish continued to thrive. In 1990–91 London Irish were promoted to the first division with a side containing four new Ireland internationals: Simon Geoghegan, Jim Staples, David Curtis and Rob Saunders, the youngest ever captain of his country at 22 years of age. The harsh financial realities of playing at the top end of the game in England gradually became clear to all the country&apos;s senior clubs including London Irish in the early years of the decade. Operating losses mounted and but for the generosity of key benefactors at the time, the club would have struggled to survive. The financial struggles were reflected on the pitch where London Irish failed to make any impact in the leagues despite employing the services of a number of high profile coaches. In 1999 London Irish merged with London Scottish and Richmond to form a new umbrella company to support the professional team which now competes in the Aviva Premiership in England. An amateur club was also formed at this time, London Irish Amateur RFC, which remains in Sunbury. The club won its first piece of silverware in 2002 by beating Northampton Saints in the Powergen Cup final at Twickenham. [ Academy ] London Irish have a thriving academy set up, with players such as Nick Kennedy, Topsy Ojo and Delon Armitage having gone on to play for the senior side and be internationally capped. [ Stadium ] London Irish play at the Madejski Stadium, in Reading. Madejski is the home of Reading FC and was opened in August 1998. The ground is a 24,161 all-seater capacity. All London Irish home matches are played at the Madejski. The largest crowd for a London Irish match was for a game against London Wasps on 15 March 2008 during the 2007-08 Guinness Premiership. The crowd of 23,790 was also the highest attendance for a regular season Guinness Premiership match [ No Luck on Paddy&apos;s Day for Irish Guinness Premiership.com http://www.guinnesspremiership.com/127_23371.php 16 march 2008 ] until December 2008.
