The Purcell Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south from Canada, carving the basin of present-day Lake Pend Oreille and damming the Clark Fork river. The impounded river repeatedly filled to form Glacial Lake Missoula and broke through the ice dam, resulting in massive floods that filled the Rathdrum Prairie area with sand, gravel, and boulders. Large eddy bar s formed downstream from bedrock obstructions, thereby damming tributary valleys and creating lakes. [ History ] Hayden Lake’s unique beauty attracted several wealthy people in the early 1900s. F. Lewis Clark Mansion was built in 1910 and was the most expensive home in Idaho at the time. In 1914 Lewis mysteriously disappeared and he was never heard from again. { | Clarkhouse.com History } Today the Clark House is beautifully restored as a restaurant / bed and breakfast. In 1907, The Hayden Lake Country Club became a gathering place for area for many socialites, like Bing Crosby. A railway expansion made travel easy from nearby Spokane. HLCC opened the first 18-hole golf course in the state of Idaho in 1912. { | Country Club History } From the 1970s until 2001, the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations had its headquarters in a [ 20 acre ha on ] compound at Hayden Lake.
