He acted in more than 100 films in roles covering a wide range of genres, from light comedy to serious drama. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances. Although his early film roles were partly the result of his good looks, by the later half of the 1950s he became a notable and strong screen presence. He began proving himself to be a “fine dramatic actor,” having the range to act in numerous dramatic and comedy roles. In his earliest parts he acted in a string of &quot; mediocre &quot; films, including swashbucklers, westerns, light comedies, sports films, and a musical. However, by the time he starred in Houdini (1953) with his wife Janet Leigh, &quot; his first clear success, &quot; notes critic David Thomson, his acting had progressed immensely. { Siegel, Scott and Barbara. &apos;&apos;The Encyclopedia of Hollywood’’ 2nd ed. Checkmark Books (2004) pp. 108-109 } { Thomson, David. The New Biographical Dictionary of Film Alfred A. Knopf (2002) pp. 196-197 } He won his first serious recognition as a skilled dramatic actor in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in another drama, The Defiant Ones (1958). Curtis then gave what many believe was his best acting, in a completely different role, the comedy Some Like It Hot (1959). Thomson calls it an &quot; outrageous film, &quot; and it was voted the number 1 funniest film in history from a survey done by the American Film Institute. { &quot; Hollywood Legend Tony Curtis Dead at 85 &quot; Fox News, Sept. 30, 2010 } It costarred Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, and was directed by Billy Wilder. That was followed by Blake Edwards ’ comedy Operation Petticoat (1959) with Cary Grant. They were both “frantic comedies,” and displayed &quot; his impeccable comic timing. &quot; { Broeske, Pat H. And McCarty, John. International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers: Actors and Actresses (3rd Ed.) St. James Press (1997) pp. 275-277 } He often collaborated with Edwards on later films. His most significant serious part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama The Boston Strangler, which some consider his &quot; last major film role. &quot; The part reinforced his reputation as a serious actor with his &quot; chilling portrayal &quot; of serial killer Albert DeSalvo. He gained 30 pounds and had his face &quot; rebuilt &quot; with a false nose to look like the real DeSalvo. Curtis was the father of actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Kelly Curtis [ http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/2010/09/30/15537731.html Jamie Lee Honours Her Dad wenn.com October 1, 2010 ] by his first wife, actress Janet Leigh.

[ Tony Curtis biography http://www.biography.com/articles/Tony-Curtis-9263844 biography.com A &amp; E Television Networks 11 August 2011 ] [ Curtis, Tony 1925– http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Tony_Curtis.aspx Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television encyclopedia.com 11 August 2011 ] His parents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants from Mátészalka, Hungary. Hungarian was Curtis&apos; only language until he was five or six, postponing his schooling. His father was a tailor and the family lived in the back of the shop — the parents in one corner and Curtis and his brothers Julius and Robert in another. His mother once made an appearance as a participant on the television show You Bet Your Life, hosted by Groucho Marx. [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DfD8WHdPpMCA You Bet Your Life 0 YouTube 2011-07-01 ] Curtis said, &quot; When I was a child, Mom beat me up and was very aggressive and antagonistic. &quot; His mother was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. His brother Robert was also institutionalized with the same mental illness. When Curtis was eight, he and his brother Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a neighborhood gang whose main crimes were playing hooky from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. Aged 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play. Curtis enlisted in the United States Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor and war was declared. After being inspired by Cary Grant &apos;s role in Destination Tokyo and Tyrone Power in Crash Dive ( 1943 ), he joined the Pacific submarine force. { Private Screenings: Tony Curtis } { Turner Classic Movies, 1999-01-19. } Curtis served aboard a submarine tender, the USS &apos;&apos;Proteus&apos;&apos; until the end of the Second World War. On September 2, 1945, Curtis witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay from his ship&apos;s signal bridge about a mile away. [ http://tendertale.com/ttiii/ttiii1.html TenderTale TenderTale 2010-06-18 ] Following his discharge from US Navy, Curtis attended City College of New York as a result of the G.I. Bill. He then studied acting at the The New School in Greenwich Village under the influential German stage director Erwin Piscator. Fellow contemporaries included Elaine Stritch, Walter Matthau, Bea Arthur, and Rod Steiger. While still at college, Curtis was discovered by Joyce Selznick, the notable talent agent, casting director, and niece of film producer David O. Selznick. He later claimed it was because he &quot; was the handsomest of the boys. &quot; In 1948, Curtis arrived in Hollywood aged 23. When he was placed under contract at Universal Pictures, he changed his name from Bernard Schwartz to Tony Curtis. The first name was from the novel Anthony Adverse and &quot; Kurtz &quot; from a surname in his mother&apos;s family.

Neither was he hopeful of his chances of becoming a major star. Curtis biggest fear was having to return home to the Bronx as a failure: I was a million-to-one shot, the least likely to succeed. I wasn&apos;t low man on the totem pole, I was under the totem pole, in a sewer, tied to a sack. { Life magazine, Nov. 17, 1961 pp. 161-176 } [ Career ] { Houdini &apos;&apos; (1953) } Curtis&apos;s uncredited screen debut came in Criss Cross (1949) playing a rumba dancer. In his second film, City Across the River (also in 1949), he was credited as &quot; Anthony Curtis &quot;. [ 0041251 City Across the River ] Later, as &quot; Tony Curtis &quot;, he cemented his reputation with breakthrough performances such as in the role of the scheming press agent Sidney Falco in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with Burt Lancaster (who also starred in Criss Cross) and an Oscar -nominated performance as a bigoted escaped convict chained to Sidney Poitier in The Defiant Ones. He did both screen comedy and drama, and became one of the most sought after stars in Hollywood. Curtis&apos; comedies include Some Like It Hot (1959, although voice actor Paul Frees read his and Jack Lemmon &apos;s &quot; Daphne &quot; and &quot; Josephine &quot; dialogues), Sex and the Single Girl (1964) and The Great Race (1965), and his dramas included playing the slave Antoninus in Stanley Kubrick &apos;s Spartacus (1960) co-starring Kirk Douglas and Laurence Olivier, { &quot; Full cast and crew for &apos;&apos;Spartacus&apos;&apos; &quot;.

The latter film was praised for Curtis&apos; performance. He was also part of the all-star ensemble in Elia Kazan &apos;s 1976 drama The Last Tycoon. Curtis was nominated for a Golden Globe for Supporting actor for his performance in Spartacus (1960) alongside co star Kirk Douglas. Curtis appeared frequently on television; he co-starred with Roger Moore in the TV series The Persuaders!. Later, he co-starred in McCoy and Vega$. In the early 1960s, he was immortalized as &quot; Stony Curtis, &quot; a voice-over guest star on The Flintstones. Throughout his life, Curtis enjoyed painting, and since the early 1980s, painted as a second career. His work commands more than $ 25,000 a canvas now. In the last years of his life, he concentrated on painting rather than movies. A surrealist, Curtis claimed &quot; Van Gogh, [Paul] Matisse, Picasso, Magritte &quot; as influences. &quot; I still make movies but I&apos;m not that interested in them any more. But I paint all the time. &quot; In 2007, his painting The Red Table was on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. His paintings can also be seen at the Tony Vanderploeg Gallery in Carmel, California. Curtis spoke of his disappointment at never being awarded an Oscar. In March 2006, Curtis received the Sony Ericsson Empire Lifetime Achievement Award. He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters) from France in 1995. [ Personal life ] [ Marriages and children ] With his first wife, Janet Leigh Curtis was married six times. His first wife was actress Janet Leigh, to whom he was married from 1951 to 1962, and with whom he fathered actresses Kelly and Jamie Lee Curtis. &quot; For a while, we were Hollywood&apos;s golden couple, &quot; he said. &quot; I was very dedicated and devoted to Janet, and on top of my trade, but in her eyes that goldenness started to wear off.

In response, Curtis and Leigh decided to defy the studio heads and instead eloped and were married by a local judge in Greenwich Connecticut. Comedian and close friend Jerry Lewis came as a witness. It was Leigh&apos;s third marriage. They divorced in 1962, and in 1963, Curtis married Christine Kaufmann, the 17-year old German co-star of his latest film, Taras Bulba.
