Note the } { grid fin s. } The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB pronounced [ ˈ m oh. ae b ], commonly known as the Mother of All Bombs) is a large-yield conventional bomb developed for the United States military by Albert L. Weimorts, Jr. [ http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/27/local/me-passings27.3 Albert L. Weimorts Jr. 67; Engineer Created &apos;Bunker Buster&apos; Bombs Times Wire Services Los Angeles Times 2005-12-27 2010-07-08 ] At the time of development, it was touted as the most powerful non- nuclear weapon ever designed. { GBU-43/B / &quot; Mother Of All Bombs &quot; / Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb } The bomb was designed to be delivered by a C-130 Hercules, primarily the MC-130E Combat Talon I or MC-130H Combat Talon II variants. Since then, Russia has tested its Father of All Bombs, which is claimed to be four times more powerful than the MOAB.

It was again tested on November 21, 2003. Aside from two test articles, the only known production is of 15 units at the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in 2003 in support of the Iraq War. A single MOAB was moved to the Persian Gulf area in April 2003 but it was never used. { MOAB bomb moved to Iraq war region } Since none of those are known to have been used as of early 2007, the U.S. inventory of GBU-43/B presumably remains at approximately 15. [ Evaluations ] The basic operational concept bears some similarity to the BLU-82 Daisy Cutter, which was used to clear heavily wooded areas in the Vietnam War and in Iraq to clear mines and later as a psychological weapon against the Iraqi military. After witnessing the psychological impact of the BLU-82 on enemy soldiers, and not having any BLU-82 weapons remaining, the MOAB was developed partly to continue the role of intimidating the Iraqi soldiers. Pentagon officials had suggested their intention to use MOAB as an anti-personnel weapon, as part of the &quot; shock and awe &quot; strategy integral to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. [ http://www.nationalreview.com/owens/owens031203.asp Enter Moab 2011-12-09 2003 National Review Online ] The MOAB is not a penetrator weapon and is primarily intended for soft to medium surface targets covering extended areas and targets in a contained environment such as a deep canyon or within a cave system. However, multiple strikes with lower yield ordnance may be more effective and can be delivered by fighter/bombers such as the F-16 with greater stand-off capability than the C-130 and C-17. High altitude carpet-bombing with much smaller 2,000 or 1,000 pound bombs delivered via B-52s is also highly effective at covering large areas.
