[ May 2012 ] [ Aesthetician a cosmetologist who specializes in the study of skin care Esthetician ] [ ascetic ] [ Branches ] [ May 2012 ] Aesthetics ( also spelled æsthetics or esthetics) is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of beauty, art, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty. { Definition 1 of &apos;&apos;aesthetics&apos;&apos; from the } { Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online. } It is more scientifically defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgment s of sentiment and taste. { Zangwill, Nick. &quot; Aesthetic Judgment &quot;, } { Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008. } More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as &quot; critical reflection on art, culture and nature. &quot; { Kelly (1998) p. ix } { Review by Tom Riedel ( } { Regis University ) } [ Etymology ] The word aesthetic is derived from the Greek αἰσθητικός (aisthetikos, meaning &quot; esthetic, sensitive, sentient &quot; ), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (aisthanomai, meaning &quot; I perceive, feel, sense &quot; ). { Definition of &apos;&apos;aesthetic&apos;&apos; from the } { Online Etymology Dictionary } The term &quot; aesthetics &quot; was appropriated and coined with new meaning in the German form Æsthetik (modern spelling Ästhetik) by Alexander Baumgarten in 1735. [ History of aesthetics ] [ History of aesthetics before the 20th century ] { Bronze sculpture, thought to be either } { Poseidon or } { Zeus, } { National Archaeological Museum of Athens } [ Ancient aesthetics ] Examples of pre-historic art are rare. The context of their production and use is unclear. Aesthetic doctrines that guided their production and interpretation are mostly unknown. Ancient art was largely, but not entirely, based on the eight great ancient civilizations: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, China, Rome, India, the Celtic peoples, and Maya. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Greece had the most influence on the development of aesthetics in the West. This period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of corresponding skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. Furthermore, in many Western and Eastern cultures alike, traits such as body hair are rarely depicted in art that addresses physical beauty. [ January 2009 ] In contrast with this Greek-Western aesthetic taste is the genre of the grotesque. { Grotesque entry in Kelly 1998, pp.338-341 } Greek philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in and of themselves. Plato felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, harmony, and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the Metaphysics, Aristotle found that the universal elements of beauty were order, symmetry, and definiteness.An example of ancient aesthetics in Greece through poetry is the quote &quot; For the authors of those great poems which we admire, do not attain to excellence through the rules of any art; but they utter their beautiful melodies of verse in a state of inspiration, and, as it were, possessed by a spirit not their own, &quot; Plato. (History of Aesthetics) [ Islamic aesthetics ] Islamic art does not pertain to religion only. The term &quot; Islamic &quot; refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art created in an Islamic culture or in an Islamic context. Not all Muslims are in agreement on the use of art in religious observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to religious precepts. Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians. { Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson&apos;s History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, ISBN 0-13-193455-4 pg. 277 } According to Islam, human works of art are inherently flawed compared to the work of God; thus, it is believed by many that attempting to realistically depict the form of an animal or person is insolence to God. This tendency effected the narrowing field of artistic possibility to such forms of art as Arabesque, mosaic, Islamic calligraphy, and Islamic architecture, as well as any form of abstraction that can claim the status of non-representational art. Limited possibilities have been explored by artists as an outlet to artistic expression, and has been cultivated to become a positive style and tradition, emphasizing the decorative function of art, or its religious functions via non-representational forms such as Geometric patterns, floral patterns, and arabesques. Human or animal depiction is generally forbidden. Muslims believe these depictions lead to sculptural pieces, which then leads to worship of that sculpture or &quot; idol &quot;. Human portrayals can be found in early Islamic cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. Human representation for the purpose of worship is uniformly considered idolatry as forbidden in Sharia law. { &apos;&apos;The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries&apos;&apos;, } { Wijdan Ali, American Univ in Cairo Press, 10 December 1999, ISBN 977-424-476-1 } { &apos;&apos;From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad&apos;s(s.a.w) Portrayal from 13th century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th century Ottoman Art&apos;&apos;, } { Steve Mwai, EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies), volume IV, issue 7, p. 1-24, 2001 } The calligraphic arts grew out of an effort to devote oneself to the study of the Quran. By patiently transcribing each word of the text, the writer was made to contemplate the meaning of it. As time passed, these calligraphic works began to be prized as works of art, growing increasingly elaborate in the illumination and stylizing of the text. These illuminations were applied to other works besides the Quran, and it became a respected art form in and of itself. [ Indian aesthetics ] Indian art evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically. According to Kapila Vatsyayan, &quot; Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kāvya), music, and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail. &quot; In the Pan Indian philosophic thought the term &apos;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&apos; is another name for the concept of the Supreme. &apos;Sat&apos; is the truth value, &apos;Shiv&apos; is the good value &amp; &apos;Sundaram&apos; is the beauty value. Man through his &apos;Srabana&apos; or education, &apos;Manana&apos; or experience and conceptualization and &apos;Sadhana&apos; or practice, through different stages of life (Asramas) comes to form and realize the idea of these three values to develop a value system. This Value-system helps us to develop two basic ideas 1) that of &apos;Daksha&apos; or the adept/expert and 2) of Mahana/Parama or the Absolute and thus to judge anything in this universe in the light of these two measures, known as &apos;Adarsha&apos;. A person who has mastered great amounts of knowledge of the grammars, rules, &amp; language of an art-form are adepts (Daksha), whereas those who have worked through the whole system and journeyed ahead of these to become a law unto themselves is called a Mahana. Individuals idea of &apos;Daksha&apos; and &apos;Mahana&apos; is relative to one&apos;s development of the concept of &apos;Satyam-Shivam-Sundaram.&apos; For example, Tagore&apos;s idea of these two concepts should be way above any common man&apos;s and many perceive Tagore as a &apos;Mahana&apos; Artist in the realm of literature. This concept of Satyam-Shivam-Sundaram, a kind of Value Theory is the cornerstone of Indian Aesthetics. Of particular concern to Indian drama and literature are the term &apos;Bhava&apos; or the state of mind and rasa referring generally to the emotional flavors/essence crafted into the work by the writer and relished by a &apos;sensitive spectator&apos; or sahṛdaya or one with positive taste and mind. Poets like Kālidāsa were attentive to rasa, which blossomed into a fully developed aesthetic system. Even in contemporary India the term rasa denoting &quot; flavor &quot; or &quot; essence &quot; is used colloquially to describe the aesthetic experiences in films; &quot; māsala mix &quot; describes popular Hindi cinema films which serve a so called balanced emotional meal for the masses, savored as rasa by these spectators. Rasa theory blossoms beginning with the Sanskrit text Nātyashāstra (nātya meaning &quot; drama &quot; and shāstra meaning &quot; science of &quot; ), a work attributed to Bharata Muni where the Gods declare that drama is the &apos;Fifth Veda&apos; because it is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction. While the date of composition varies wildly among scholars, ranging from the era of Plato and Aristotle to the seventh century CE. The Nātyashāstra presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhāvas in Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the work as a whole. Eight rasas and associated bhāvas are named and their enjoyment is likened to savoring a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that arise from the proper preparation of ingredients and the quality of ingredients. What rasa actually is, in a theoretical sense, is not discussed and given the Nātyashāstra &apos;s pithy wording it is unlikely the exact understanding of the original author(s) will be known. The theory of the rasas develops significantly with the Kashmiri aesthetician Ãndandavardhana&apos;s classic on poetics, the Dhvanyāloka which introduces the ninth rasa, shānta-rasa as a specifically religious feeling of peace (śānta) which arises from its bhāva, weariness of the pleasures of the world. The primary purpose of this text is to refine the literary concept dhvani or poetic suggestion, by arguing for the existence of rasa-dhvani, primarily in forms of Sanskrit including a word, sentence or whole work &quot; suggests &quot; a real-world emotional state or bhāva, but thanks to aesthetic distance, the sensitive spectator relishes the rasa, the aesthetic flavor of tragedy, heroism or romance. The 9th - 10th century master of the religious system known as &quot; the nondual Shaivism of Kashmir &quot; (or &quot; Kashmir Shaivism &quot; ) and aesthetician, Abhinavagupta brought rasa theory to its pinnacle in his separate commentaries on the Dhvanyāloka, the Dhvanyāloka-locana (translated by Ingalls, Masson and Patwardhan, 1992) and the Abhinavabharati, his commentary on the Nātyashāstra, portions of which are translated by Gnoli and Masson and Patwardhan. Abhinavagupta offers for the first time a technical definition of rasa which is the universal bliss of the Self or Atman colored by the emotional tone of a drama. Shānta-rasa functions as an equal member of the set of rasas but is simultaneously distinct being the most clear form of aesthetic bliss. Abhinavagupta likens it to the string of a jeweled necklace; while it may not be the most appealing for most people, it is the string that gives form to the necklace, allowing the jewels of the other eight rasas to be relished. Relishing the rasas and particularly shānta-rasa is hinted as being as-good-as but never-equal-to the bliss of Self-realization experienced by yogis. [ Chinese aesthetics ] Chinese art has a long history of varied styles and emphases. Confucius emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding &quot; li &quot; (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent Mozi, however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich over the poor. By the 4th century AD, artists were debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. Gu Kaizhi has 3 surviving books on this theory of painting. For example, and it is not uncommon to find later artists or scholars who both create art and write about the creation of it. Religious and philosophical influences on art were common (and diverse) but never universal. [ African aesthetics ] { Great Mosque &apos;s signature trio of minarets overlooks the central market of Djenné. Unique Malian aesthetic } African art existed in many forms and styles, and with fairly little influence from outside Africa. Most of it followed traditional forms and the aesthetic norms were handed down orally as well as written. Sculpture and performance art are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest. The Nok culture is testimony to this. The mosque of Timbuktu shows that specific areas of Africa developed unique aesthetics. [ Western medieval aesthetics ] Surviving medieval art is primarily religious in focus and funded largely by the State, Roman Catholic or Orthodox church, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. These art pieces often served a liturgical function, whether as chalices or even as church buildings themselves. Objects of fine art from this period were frequently made from rare and valuable materials, such as gold and lapis, the cost of which commonly exceeded the wages of the artist. Medieval aesthetics in the realm of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of Plotinus by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. Bonaventure ’s “Retracing the Arts to Theology”, a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts; which light is guided by the light of sense perception which discloses the world of natural forms; which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth; finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth. Saint Thomas Aquinas&apos;s aesthetic is probably the most famous and influential theory among medieval authors, having been the subject of much scrutiny in the wake of the neo-Scholastic revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and even having received the approbation of the celebrated Modernist writer, James Joyce. Thomas, like many other medievals, never gives a systematic account of beauty itself, but several scholars have conventionally arranged his thought—though not always with uniform conclusions—using relevant observations spanning the entire corpus of his work. While Aquinas&apos;s theory follows generally the model of Aristotle, he develops a singular aesthetics which incorporates elements unique to his thought. Umberto Eco &apos;s The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas identifies the three main characteristics of beauty in Aquinas&apos;s philosophy: integritas sive perfectio, consonantia sive debita proportio, and claritas sive splendor formae. While Aristotle likewise identifies the first two characteristics, St. Thomas conceives of the third as an appropriation from principles developed by neo-Platonic and Augustinian thinkers. { Lorsch Gospels 778–820. } { Charlemagne&apos;s Court School. } With the shift from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, art likewise changed its focus, as much in its content as in its mode of expression. [ Modern aesthetics ] From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called modernism. German and British thinkers emphasised beauty as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at absolute beauty. For Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For Immanuel Kant the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but similar human truth, since all people should agree that “this rose is beautiful” if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For Friedrich Schiller aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature. For Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, the philosophy of art is the &quot; organon &quot; of philosophy concerning the relation between man and nature. So aesthetics began now to be the name for the philosophy of art. Friedrich von Schlegel, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel have also given lectures on aesthetics as philosophy of art after 1800. For Hegel all culture is a matter of &quot; absolute spirit &quot; coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage, changing to a perfection that only philosophy can approach. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty. For Arthur Schopenhauer aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty. It is thus for Schopenhauer one way to fight the suffering. The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. For Ludwig Wittgenstein aesthetics consisted in the description of a whole culture which is a linguistic impossibility. That which constitutes aesthetics lies out side the realm of the language game. For Oscar Wilde the contemplation of beauty for beauty&apos;s sake was not only the foundation for much of his literary career but was quoted as saying &quot; Aestheticism is a search after the signs of the beautiful. It is the science of the beautiful through which men seek the correlation of the arts. It is, to speak more exactly, the search after the secret of life. &quot;. { &quot; Oscar Wilde &quot; by } { Richard Ellman p 159, pub Alfred A Knopf, INC. 1988 } Wilde famously toured the United States in 1882. He travelled across the United States spreading the idea of Aesthetics in a speech called &quot; The English Renaissance. &quot; In his speech he proposed that Beauty and Aesthetics was &quot; not languid but energetic. By beautifying the outward aspects of life, one would beautify the inner ones. &quot; The English Renaissance was, he said, &quot; like the Italian Renaissance before it, a sort of rebirth of the spirit of man &quot;. { Ellman, p164 } { William Hogarth, self-portrait, 1745 } For Francis Hutcheson beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like Henry Home, Lord Kames, William Hogarth, and Edmund Burke hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye on &quot; a wanton kind of chase &quot;; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of psychology (such as James Mill ) or biology (such as Herbert Spencer ). [ Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis ] Early twentieth century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, Eli Siegel, American philosopher and poet, founded Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that &quot; The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites. &quot; { Green, Edward, &quot; Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology, &quot; International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music, 2005, p. 227. } { Siegel, Eli, &quot; Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? &quot;, Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism, 1955. } Various attempts have been made to define Post-modern aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify &quot; beauty &quot; into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo. Croce suggested that “expression” is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. George Dickie suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. [ The Aesthetic Attitude http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/ ] Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a &quot; counter-environment &quot; designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society. [ September 2010 ] Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. Hal Foster attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture. Arthur Danto has described this reaction as &quot; kalliphobia &quot; (after the Greek word for beauty - &apos;kalos&apos;). { &apos;Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art&apos; in Art Journal v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p. 24-35 } André Malraux explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art. { Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux&apos;s Theory of Art (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009) } Brian Massumi suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. { Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. ISBN 0-415-23804-8 } Daniel Berlyne created the field of experimental aesthetics in the 1970s, for which he is still the most cited individual decades after his death. { Daniel Berlyne (1924-1976): Biographical Analysis. http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/furedy/daniel_berlyne.htm } Pneumaist aestheticism is a theory of art and a highly experimental approach to art negating historical preconceptions of the aesthetic. Jean-François Lyotard re-invokes the Kantian distinction between taste and the sublime. Sublime painting, unlike kitsch realism, &quot;...will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain. &quot; { Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, What is Postmodernism?, in The Postmodern Condition, Minnesota and Manchester, 1984. } { Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, Scriptures: Diffracted Traces, in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004. } Sigmund Freud inaugurated aesthetical thinking in Psychoanalysis mainly via the &quot; Uncanny &quot; as aesthetical affect. { Freud, Sigmund, &quot; The Uncanny &quot; (1919).

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989. } and sublimity. { Guy Sircello, &quot; How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible? &quot; The Journal of Aesthetics and Art CriticismVol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541-550 } In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis. Edward De Bono in his book I Am Right You Are Wrong write that art is directly concerned with redirecting existing perceptions and changing them, but does not encourage perceptual skills. In the end art is a form of communication while in his book Water Logic he writes that art need to highlight, to deepen perception and to open up insights. This is done by disrupting the patterns, by juxtaposing patterns by providing new pattern framework and he give us the example that when anything new arise such as Impressionism it was first was judged ugly, hideous by most art critic. This was because it was “ugly” when viewed through the frames of expectation of existing and traditional painting. He continues that people had to be trained to look at the painting in a different way to appreciate their beauty. Carrying this to the extreme is Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes or put a pile of scattered bricks in an art gallery and you ask the people as a work of art then they really do become a work of art. Our normal perception patterns treat bricks and treated the Brillo boxes as mundane material but if we break the loop of our perception pattern we see them differently but still keep a faint echo of their constructive value. This is because when we explore a rouse clearly we set perception but then we pass that perception as we just see it and put it somewhere generally and we don&apos;t break any pattern anymore. [ Evolutionary aesthetics ] Evolutionary aesthetics refers to evolutionary psychology theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of Homo sapiens are argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer landscape s which were good habitat s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry is an important aspect of physical attractiveness which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of evolutionary musicology, Darwinian literary studies, and the study of the evolution of emotion. [ Aesthetics and information ] { Mandelbrot set zoom sequence with continuously coloured environment } In the 1970s, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory. { A. Moles: Théorie de l&apos;information et perception esthétique, Paris, Denoël, 1973 ( } { Information Theory and aesthetical perception) } { F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as } { information processing ). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, ISBN 3-211-81216-4, ISBN 978-3-211-81216-7 } In the 1990s, Jürgen Schmidhuber described an algorithmic theory of beauty which takes the subjectivity of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer’s previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data. { J. Schmidhuber. } { Low-complexity art. Leonardo, Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology, 30(2):97–103, 1997. http://www.jstor.org/pss/1576418 } { J. Schmidhuber. Papers on the theory of beauty and } { low-complexity art since 1994: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html } This is closely related to the principles of algorithmic information theory and minimum description length. One of his examples: mathematician s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their formal language. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few bit s of information, { J. Schmidhuber. Facial beauty and fractal geometry. Cogprint Archive: http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk, 1998 } { J. Schmidhuber. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity.

Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. } [ 0709.0674 ] drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer. Schmidhuber&apos;s theory explicitly distinguishes between what&apos;s beautiful and what&apos;s interesting, stating that interestingness corresponds to the first derivative of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and symmetries and fractal self-similarity. Whenever the observer&apos;s learning process (which may be a predictive neural network - see also Neuroesthetics ) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer bit s than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer&apos;s internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A reinforcement learning algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional interesting input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of artificial curiosity. { J. Schmidhuber. Curious model-building control systems.

Aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency [ Giannini AJ Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences Journal of clinical pharmacology 33 12 1139–46 1993 December 7510314 ] This coupling was made to reinforce the learning paradigm when English-language speakers used translators to address audiences in their own country. These audiences were generally not fluent in the English language. It can also be used in topics as diverse as mathematics, gastronomy, fashion and website design. { Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: Interrnational Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 68 (10), 689-709. PDF } [ Aesthetic ethics ] Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. John Dewey { Dewey, John. (1932)&apos;Ethics&apos;, with James Tufts. In: The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882-1953 Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275. } has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being &quot; fair &quot; - the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, James Page { Page, James S. (2008) Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. ISBN 978-1-59311-889-1. } has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for peace education. [ Truth as beauty, mathematics, analytic philosophy, and physics ] Mathematical considerations, such as symmetry and complexity, are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty. Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define truth, outside of empirical considerations. Beauty and Truth have been argued to be nearly synonymous, { Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, } { Ian Stewart, 2008 } as reflected in the statement &quot; Beauty is truth, truth beauty &quot; in the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats. The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by processing fluency, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth. { Reber, R, } { Schwarz, N, Winkielman, P: &quot; Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver&apos;s processing experience? &quot;, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8(4):364-382 } Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks. { Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: &quot; The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment &quot;, Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 15(6):1174-1178 } [ Computational inference of aesthetics ] Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.

Leyton is the president of the International Society for Mathematical and Computational Aesthetics and theInternational Society for Group Theory in Cognitive Science and has developed a generative theory of shape. There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess and music. { Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007. } [ Aesthetic judgment ] Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. Aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon. Immanuel Kant, writing in 1790, observes of a man &quot; If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to me, &quot; because &quot; Everyone has his own ( sense of) taste &quot;. The case of &quot; beauty &quot; is different from mere &quot; agreeableness &quot; because, &quot; If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things. &quot; Aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination. For David Hume, delicacy of taste is not merely &quot; the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition &quot;, but also our sensitivity &quot; to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind. &quot; (Essays Moral Political and Literary. Indianapolis, Literary Classics 5, 1987.) Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure. For Kant &quot; enjoyment &quot; is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be &quot; beautiful &quot; has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Viewer interpretations of beauty possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education. { Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. ISBN 0-674-21277-0 } According to Kant, beauty is objective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone. [ November 2011 ] [ November 2010 ] The contemporary view of beauty is not based on innate qualities, but rather on cultural specifics and individual interpretations. [ November 2010 ] [ Factors involved in aesthetic judgment ] Rainbows often have aesthetic appeal. Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinct ual ways to facial expression s, and even behaviors like the gag reflex. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man&apos;s beard is disgusting even though neither soup nor beard s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. Seeing a sublime view of a landscape may give us a reaction of awe, which might manifest physically as an increased heart rate or widened eyes. These unconscious reactions may even be partly constitutive of what makes our judgment a judgment that the landscape is sublime. Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability. Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value. { Holm, Ivar (2006). Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and } { Industrial design : How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. ISBN 82-547-0174-1. } In a current context, one might judge a Lamborghini to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values. { Korsmeyer, Carolyn ed. Aesthetics: The Big Questions 1998 } &quot; Part and Parcel in Animal and Human Societies &quot;. in Studies in animal and human behavior, vol. 2. pp.  115–195. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1971 (originally pub. 1950.)Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aestheti c judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th century thinkers. The point is already made by Hume, but see Mary Mothersill, &quot; Beauty and the Critic’s Judgment &quot;, in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behavior, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs. [ Are different art forms beautiful, disgusting, or boring in the same way? ] A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a fragrance, and a mathematical proof beautiful. What characteristics do they share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as beautiful? What makes a painting beautiful is quite different from what makes music beautiful, which suggests that each art form has its own language for the judgement of aesthetics. { Consider Clement Greenberg’s arguments in &quot; On Modernist Painting &quot; (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts. } At the same time, there is seemingly quite a lack of words to express oneself accurately when making an aesthetic judgment. An aesthetic judgment cannot be an empirical judgement. Therefore, due to impossibility for precision, there is confusion about what interpretations can be culturally negotiated. Due to imprecision in the standard English language, two completely different feelings experienced by two different people can be represented by an identical verbal expression. Wittgenstein stated this in his lectures on aesthetics and language games. A collective identification of beauty, with willing participants in a given social spectrum, may be a socially negotiated phenomenon, discussed in a culture or context. Is there some underlying unity to aesthetic judgment and is there some way to articulate the similarities of a beautiful house, beautiful proof, and beautiful sunset? { Immanuel Kant, } { The Critique of Judgment. } Defining it requires a description of the entire phenomenon, as Wittgenstein argued in his lectures on aesthetics. Likewise there has been long debate on how perception of beauty in the natural world, especially perception of the human form as beautiful, is supposed to relate to perceiving beauty in art or artefacts. This goes back at least to Kant, with some echoes even in St. Bonaventure. [ April 2008 ] [ Aesthetics and the philosophy of art ] [ Aesthetics is for the artist as Ornithology is for the birds. Barnett Newman Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952 Retrieved August 30, 2010 The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art, By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, ISBN 0-8126-9540-2, ISBN 978-0-8126-9540-3 ] For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since Hegel, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object ), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an art work. Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art work s, but has also to give a definition of what art is. Art is an autonomous entity for philosophy, because art deals with the senses (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics : art as knowledge or art as action, but aesthetics is neither epistemology nor ethics. { Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert, Introduction to Aesthetics (Einführung in die Ästhetik), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7. } [ What is &quot; art &quot; ? ] Harmony of colors How best to define the term “art” is a subject of constant contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art”. { Davies, 1991, Carroll, 2000, et al. } Theodor Adorno claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident.” { Danto, 2003 } { Goodman, } Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that vary considerably. Furthermore, it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term &quot; art &quot; has changed several times over the centuries, and has continued to evolve during the 20th century as well. The main recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for creative art or “ fine art.” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the “finer” things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object, people will consider it a craft instead of art, a suggestion which is highly disputed by many Contemporary Craft thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered design instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called applied art. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with the actual function of the object than any clear definitional difference. { Novitz, 1992 } Art usually implies no function other than to convey or communicate an idea. Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that wasn&apos;t trying to be beautiful couldn&apos;t count as art. The cubists, dada ists, Stravinsky, and many later art movements struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to Danto, &quot; Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960’s but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well. &quot; Perhaps some notion like &quot; expression &quot; (in Croce’s theories) or &quot; counter-environment &quot; (in McLuhan’s theory) can replace the previous role of beauty. Brian Massumi brought back &quot; beauty &quot; into consideration together with &quot; expression &quot;. { Brian Massumi, Deleuze, } { Guattari and the Philosophy of Expression, CRCL, 24:3, 1997. } Another view, as important to the philosophy of art as &quot; beauty, &quot; is that of the &quot; sublime, &quot; elaborated upon in the twentieth century by the postmodern philosopher Jean-François Lyotard. A further approach, elaborated by André Malraux in works such as The Voices of Silence, is that art is fundamentally a response to a metaphysical question (&apos;Art&apos;, he writes, &apos;is an &apos;anti-destiny&apos;). Malraux argues that, while art has sometimes been oriented towards beauty and the sublime (principally in post-Renaissance European art) these qualities, as the wider history of art demonstrates, are by no means essential to it. { Derek Allan. Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux’s Theory of Art. (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009) } Perhaps (as in Kennick&apos;s theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a Wittgensteinian fashion (as in Weitz or Beuys ). Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums and artists define as art is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This &quot; institutional definition of art &quot; (see also Institutional Critique ) has been championed by George Dickie. Most people did not consider the depiction of a Brillo Box or a store-bought urinal to be art until Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the art gallery ), which then provided the association of these objects with the associations that define art. Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. If a poet writes down several lines, intending them as a poem, the very procedure by which it is written makes it a poem. Whereas if a journalist writes exactly the same set of words, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. Leo Tolstoy, on the other hand, claims that what decides whether or not something is art is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like Monroe Beardsley argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure). &apos; [ Classificatory disputes about art ] [ What should we judge when we judge art? ] Nature provides aesthetic ideals. Art can be difficult at the metaphysical and ontological levels as well as at the value theory level. When we see a performance of Hamlet, how many works of art are we experiencing, and which should we judge? Perhaps there is only one relevant work of art, the whole performance, which many different people have contributed to, and which will exist briefly and then disappear. Perhaps the manuscript by Shakespeare is a distinct work of art from the play by the troupe, which is also distinct from the performance of the play by this troupe on this night, and all three can be judged, but are to be judged by different standards. Perhaps every person involved should be judged separately on his or her own merits, and each costume or line is its own work of art (with perhaps the director having the job of unifying them all). Similar problems arise for music, film, dance, and even painting. Is one to judge the painting itself, the work of the painter, or perhaps the painting in its context of presentation by the museum workers? These problems have been made even more difficult by the rise of conceptual art since the 1960s. Warhol’s famous Brillo Boxes are nearly indistinguishable from actual Brillo boxes at the time. It would be a mistake to praise Warhol for the design of his boxes (which were designed by Steve Harvey), yet the conceptual move of exhibiting these boxes as art in a museum together with other kinds of paintings is Warhol&apos;s. Are we judging Warhol’s concept? His execution of the concept in the medium? The curator ’s insight in letting Warhol display the boxes? The overall result? Our experience or interpretation of the result? Ontologically, how are we to think of the work of art? Is it a physical object? Several objects? A class of objects? A mental object? A fictional object? An abstract object ? An event? Or simply an Act? [ What should art be like? ] Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. Clement Greenberg, for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form. { Clement Greenberg, “On Modernist Painting”. } The Dada ist Tristan Tzara on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. “We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits.” { Tristan Tzara, Sept Manifestes Dada. } Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like. [ The value of art ] Tolstoy defined art (and by no coincidence also characterized its value) as the following: &quot; Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them. &quot; The value of art, then, is one with the value of empathy. Other possible views are these: Art can act as a means to some special kind of knowledge. Art may give insight into the human condition. Art relates to science and religion. Art serves as a tool of education, or indoctrination, or enculturation. Art makes us more moral. It uplifts us spiritually. Art is politics by other means. Art has the value of allowing catharsis. In any case, the value of art may determine the suitability of an art form. Do they differ significantly in their values, or (if not) in their ability to achieve the unitary value of art? But to approach the question of the value of art systematically, one ought to ask: for whom? For the artist? For the audience? For society at large, and/or for individuals beyond the audience? Is the &quot; value &quot; of art different in each of these different contexts? Working on the intended value of art tends to help define the relations between art and other acts. Art clearly does have spiritual goals in many contexts, but what exactly is the difference between religious art and religion per se? The truth is complex; art is both useless in a functional sense, and also the most important human activity. An argument for the value of art, used in the fictional work &apos; The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy &apos;, proceeds that, should some external force presenting imminent destruction of Earth, ask the inhabitants, of what use is humanity, what should humanity&apos;s response be? The argument continues that the only justification humanity could give for its continued existence would be the past creation and continued creation of things like a Shakespeare play, a Rembrandt painting or a Bach concerto. The suggestion is that these are the things of value which define humanity. { The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams } [ Aesthetic universals ] The philosopher Denis Dutton identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics: { Denis Dutton &apos;s Aesthetic Universals summarized by } { Steven Pinker in } { The Blank Slate } Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills. Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art&apos;s sake, and don&apos;t demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table. Style. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style. Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art. Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world. Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience. It might be objected, however, that there are rather too many exceptions to Dutton&apos;s categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist Thomas Hirschhorn deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. &quot; Rules of composition &quot; that might be read into Duchamp &apos;s Fountain or John Cage &apos;s 4′33″ do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works&apos; realisation). Moreover, some of Dutton&apos;s categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton&apos;s categories seek to universalise traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea &quot; art &quot; itself) were non-existent. { Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux&apos;s Theory of Art. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009) } Increasingly, academics in both the sciences and the humanities look to evolutionary psychology and cognitive science in an effort to understand the connection between psychology and aesthetics. Aside from Dutton, others exploring this realm include David Bordwell, Brian Boyd, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Noël Carroll, Ellen Dissanayake, Nancy Easterlin, Bracha Ettinger, David Evans, Jonathan Gottschall, Torben Grodal, Paul Hernadi,, Patrick Hogan, Carl Plantinga, Rolf Reber, Elaine Scarry, Murray Smith, Wendy Steiner, Robert Storey, Frederick Turner, and Mark Turner. [ Criticism ] The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. Raymond Williams argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By &quot; art &quot; we may frame several artistic &quot; works &quot; or &quot; creations &quot; as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible &quot; art &quot; outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as &quot; art &quot;. Pierre Bourdieu disagrees with Kant&apos;s idea of the &quot; aesthetic &quot;. He argues that Kant&apos;s &quot; aesthetic &quot; merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid &quot; aesthetic &quot; experiences which lay outside Kant&apos;s narrow definition.
