[ May 2012 ] [ May 2012 ] [ 1955 12 23 yes ] { Glasgow, Scotland } { Poet, playwright } { English } { Scottish } { B.A. (Hons) Philosophy } { University of Liverpool } { Ella (born 1995) with } { Peter Benson } { May Black (mother) died 2005; Frank Duffy (father) } { OBE 1995; } { CBE 2002; } { poet laureate 2009 } Carol Ann Duffy, CBE, FRSL (born 23 December 1955) is a Scottish poet and playwright. She is Professor of Contemporary Poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and was appointed Britain&apos;s poet laureate in May 2009. { &apos;&apos;Manchester Metropolitan University, Profile: Professor Carol Ann Duffy&apos;&apos;, accessed 2 November 2009. } She is the first woman, the first Scot, and the first openly gay person to hold the position. { Duffy reacts to new Laureate post, BBC News, 1 May 2009. } Her collections include Standing Female Nude (1985), winner of a Scottish Arts Council Award; Selling Manhattan (1987), which won a Somerset Maugham Award; Mean Time (1993), which won the Whitbread Poetry Award; and Rapture (2005), winner of the T. S. Eliot Prize. Her poems address issues such as oppression, gender, and violence, in an accessible language that has made them popular in schools. { Carol Ann Duffy, Encyclopaedia Britannica, accessed 2 November 2009. } [ Early life ] Carol Ann Duffy was born to a Roman Catholic family in the Gorbals, a very poor part of Glasgow, the first child of Frank Duffy, an electrical fitter and May Black. The couple went on to have another four children, all boys, the family moving to Stafford, England, when Duffy was six years old. Her father worked for English Electric. He was also a trade unionist, and stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party in 1983; he also managed Stafford Rangers football club in his spare time. Duffy was educated in Stafford at Saint Austin&apos;s RC Primary School (1962–1967), St. Joseph&apos;s Convent School (1967–1970), and Stafford Girls&apos; High School (1970–1974), her literary talent encouraged by two English teachers, June Scriven at St Joseph&apos;s, and Jim Walker at Stafford Girls&apos; High. She was a passionate reader from an early age, and always wanted to be a writer, producing poems from the age of 11. When one of her English teachers died, she wrote: &quot; You sat on your desk,/ swinging your legs, reading a poem by Yeats/ to the bored girls, except my heart stumbled and blushed/ as it fell in love with the words and I saw the tree/ in the scratched old desk under my hands, heard the bird in the oak outside scribble itself on the air. &quot; { Edemariam, Aida. &quot; Carol Ann Duffy: I don&apos;t have Ambassadorial Talents &quot;, The Guardian, 26 May 2009. } [ Career ] Some days, although we cannot pray, a prayerutters itself. So, a woman will lifther head from the sieve of her hands and stareat the minims sung by a tree, a sudden gift. Some nights, although we are faithless, the truthenters our hearts, that small familiar pain;then a man will stand stock-still, hearing his youthin the distant Latin chanting of a train. [ 330px right true #FFFFF0 right ] When Duffy was 15, June Scriven sent her poems to Outposts, a publisher of pamphlets, where it was read by the bookseller Bernard Stone, who published some of them. When she was 16, she met Adrian Henri, one of the Liverpool poets, and decided she wanted to be with him, living with him until 1982. &quot; He gave me confidence, &quot; she said, &quot; he was great. It was all poetry, very heady, and he was never faithful. He thought poets had a duty to be unfaithful. &quot; { Winterson, Jeanette. &quot; Carol Ann Duff &quot;, Jeanettewinterson.com, accessed 18 December 2009. } She applied to the University of Liverpool to be near him, and began a philosophy degree there in 1974. She had two plays performed at the Liverpool Playhouse, wrote a pamphlet, Fifth Last Song, and received an honours degree in philosophy in 1977. She worked as poetry critic for The Guardian from 1988–1989, and was editor of the poetry magazine, &apos;&apos;Ambit&apos;&apos;. In 1996, she was appointed as a lecturer in poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and later became creative director of its Writing School. Duffy was almost appointed Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1999 after the death of Ted Hughes, but lost out on the position to Andrew Motion. Duffy said she would not have accepted the position at that time anyway, because she was in a relationship with Scottish poet Jackie Kay, had a young daughter, and would not have welcomed the public attention. { Flood, Alison. &quot; Betting closed on next poet laureate amid speculation that Carol Ann Duffy has been chosen &quot;, The Guardian, 27 April 2009. } She was appointed as Poet Laureate on 1 May 2009, [ http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/world/europe/02poet.html After 341 Years, British Poet Laureate Is a Woman Lyall Sarah 2 May 2009 The New York Times 2 May 2011 ] when Motion&apos;s 10-year term was over. Duffy was featured on the South Bank Show with Melvyn Bragg in December 2009 { Press Release, South Bank Show, 6 December 2009. } and on 7 December she presented the Turner Prize to artist Richard Wright. { Higgins, Charlotte. &quot; Artist Richard Wright strikes gold as winner of this year&apos;s Turner prize &quot;, The Guardian, 7 December 2009. } [ Poet laureate ] In her first poem as poet laureate, Duffy tackled the scandal over British MPs expenses in the format of a sonnet. { &apos;&apos;Politics by Carol Ann Duffy,&apos;&apos; The Guardian, 13 June 2009 } Her second, &quot; Last Post &quot;, was commissioned by the BBC to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch, the last two British soldiers to fight in World War I. { &quot; Carol Ann Duffy, Poem for the last of WWI &quot;, Today Programme, BBC Radio 4, 30 July 2009. } Her third, &quot; The Twelve Days of Christmas 2009 &quot;, addresses current events such as species extinction, the climate change conference in Copenhagen, the banking crisis, and the war in Afghanistan. { Duffy, Carol Ann. &quot; The Twelve Days of Christmas 2009 &quot;, Radio Times, 6 December 2009. } In March 2010, she wrote &quot; Achilles (for David Beckham) &quot; about the Achilles tendon injury that left England Footballer David Beckham out of the 2010 FIFA World Cup; the poem was published in The Daily Mirror and treats modern celebrity culture as a kind of mythicisation. { &quot; Achilles (David Beckham) &quot;, The Guardian, 16 March 2010, accessed 16 March 2010. } &quot; Silver Lining &quot;, written in April 2010, acknowledges the grounding of flights caused by the ash of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull. { Duffy, Carol Ann. “Silver Lining | Carol Ann Duffy”, The Guardian, 20 April 2010. } On 30 August 2010 she premièred her poem &quot; Vigil &quot; for the Manchester Pride Candlelight Vigil in memory of LGBT people who have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS. { Manchester vigil. &apos;&apos;The Advocate&apos;&apos; 2010-08 -30. } Duffy wrote a 46 line poem Rings for the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. The poem celebrates the rings found in nature and does not specifically mention the couple&apos;s names. It begins for both to say and continues &quot; I might have raised your hand to the sky / to give you the ring surrounding the moon / or looked to twin the rings of your eyes / with mine / or added a ring to the rings of a tree / by forming a handheld circle with you, thee, /... &quot;. She wrote the verse with Stephen Raw, a textual artist, and a signed print of the work was sent to the couple as a wedding gift. [ Harrison David Royal wedding: Poet laureate writes verse for big day http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8469503/Royal-wedding-Poet-laureate-writes-verse-for-big-day.html 30 April 2011 The Daily Telegraph 23 April 2011 ] [ Poems for a wedding http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/23/wedding-carol-ann-duffy-poetry 30 April 2011 The Guardian 23 April 2011 ] In a Stylist magazine, Duffy said of becoming poet laureate, &quot; There’s no requirement. I do get asked to do things and so far I’ve been happy to do them. &quot; She also spoke about being selected for the role by The Queen, saying, &quot; She’s lovely! I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an ‘audience’ with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me. &quot; [ http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/interviews-and-profiles/interview-carol-ann-duffy Stylist Interview: Carol Ann Duffy 4 October 2011 ] [ Poetry ] [ Style ] Duffy&apos;s work explores both everyday experience and the rich fantasy life of herself and others. In dramatising scenes from childhood, adolescence, and adult life, she discovers moments of consolation through love, memory, and language. Charlotte Mendelson writes in The Observer: Part of Duffy&apos;s talent  – besides her ear for ordinary eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety  – is her ventriloquism. Like the best of her novelist peers  ... she slides in and out of her characters&apos; lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter  ... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets  – that is, she makes it look easy. { Mendelson, Charlotte. The gospel truth, The Observer, 13 October 2002. } Of her own writing, Duffy has said, &quot; I&apos;m not interested, as a poet, in words like &apos;plash&apos;— Seamus Heaney words, interesting words. I like to use simple words, but in a complicated way. &quot; { Forbes, Peter. &quot; Winning Lines &quot;, The Guardian, 31 August 2002. } She told The Observer: &quot; Like the sand and the oyster, it&apos;s a creative irritant. In each poem, I&apos;m trying to reveal a truth, so it can&apos;t have a fictional beginning. &quot; { Anderson, Hephzibah. Christmas Carol, The Observer, 4 December 2005. } Duffy rose to greater prominence in UK poetry circles after her poem &quot; Whoever She Was &quot; won the Poetry Society National Poetry Competition in 1983. { &apos;&apos;Carol Ann Duffy,&apos;&apos; The Poetry Society } In her first collection, Standing Female Nude (1985), she uses the voices of outsiders, for example in the poems &apos;Education for Leisure&apos; and &apos;Dear Norman&apos;. Her next collection Feminine Gospels (2002) continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery. Her 2005 publication, Rapture (2005), is a series of intimate poems charting the course of a love affair, for which she won the £10,000 T.S. Eliot Prize. In 2007, she published The Hat, a collection of poems for children. Online copies of her poems are rare, but her poem dedicated to U A Fanthorpe, Premonitions, is available through The Guardian, { &apos;&apos;Premonitions&apos;&apos; The Guardian, 2 May 2009, accessed 16 March 2010. } and several others via The Daily Mirror. { &apos;&apos;Duffy&apos;s poems for children&apos;&apos;, Daily Mirror, 4 May 2009 accessed 16 March 2010. } { &apos;&apos;A previously unpublished poem on the nature of her work&apos;&apos;, Daily Mirror, 2 May 2009, accessed 16 March 2010. } [ In schools ] Her poems are studied in British schools at GCSE, A-level, and Higher levels. { Martin, Ben. &quot; Carol Ann Duffy: Profile of the new Poet Laureate &quot;, The Daily Telegraph, 1 May 2009. } In August 2008, her Education for Leisure, a poem about violence, was removed from the AQA examination board&apos;s GCSE poetry anthology, following a complaint about its references to knife crime and a goldfish being flushed down a toilet. The poem begins, &quot; Today I am going to kill something. Anything./I have had enough of being ignored and today/I am going to play God. &quot; The protagonist kills a fly, then a goldfish. The budgie panics and the cat hides. It ends with him, or her, leaving the house with a knife. &quot; The pavements glitter suddenly. I touch your arm. &quot; According to The Guardian, schools were urged to destroy copies of the unedited anthology, { Curtis, Polly. &quot; Top exam board asks schools to destroy book containing knife poem &quot;, The Guardian, 4 September 2008. } though this was later denied by AQA. { Addley, Ester. &quot; Poet&apos;s rhyming riposte leaves Mrs Schofield &apos;gobsmacked&apos; &quot;, The Guardian, 6 September 2008. } Duffy called the decision ridiculous. &quot; It&apos;s an anti-violence poem, &quot; she said. &quot; It is a plea for education rather than violence. &quot; She responded with Mrs Schofield&apos;s GCSE, a poem about violence in other fiction, and the point of it. &quot; Explain how poetry/pursues the human like the smitten moon/above the weeping, laughing earth... &quot; { Duffy, Carol Ann. Mrs Schofield&apos;s GCSE, The Guardian, 6 September 2009. } The Mrs. Schofield of the title refers to Pat Schofield, an external examiner at Lutterworth College, Leicestershire, who complained about Education for Leisure, calling it &quot; absolutely horrendous &quot;. { Addley, Esther. &quot; Poet&apos;s rhyming riposte leaves Mrs Schofield &apos;gobsmacked&apos; &quot;, The Guardian, 6 September 2008. } [ Plays and songs ] Duffy is also a playwright, and has had plays performed at the Liverpool Playhouse and the Almeida Theatre in London. Her plays include Take My Husband (1982), Cavern of Dreams (1984), Little Women, Big Boys (1986) Loss (1986), Casanova (2007). Her radio credits include an adaptation of Rapture. { Radio play Rapture, performed by Fiona Shaw, with Eliana Tomkins, on BBC Radio Four on 24 July 2007. } Her children&apos;s collections include Meeting Midnight (1999) and The Oldest Girl in the World (2000). She also collaborated with the Manchester composer, Sasha Johnson Manning, on The Manchester Carols, a series of Christmas songs that premiered in Manchester Cathedral in 2007.She also participated in the Bush Theatre &apos;s 2011 project Sixty Six, for which she wrote a piece based upon a chapter of the King James Bible { http://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/biography/writers/ } [ Honours and awards ] She holds honorary doctorate s from the University of Dundee, the University of Hull, the University of St Andrews, and the University of Warwick, as well as an Honorary Fellowship at Homerton College, Cambridge.
