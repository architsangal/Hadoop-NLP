[ Early life ] Jeanette &quot; Jennie &quot; Jerome was born in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn in 1854, { G. H. L. Le May, ‘Churchill, Jeanette [Lady Randolph Churchill] (1854–1921)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed September 18, 2010 } the second of three daughters of financier, sportsman, and speculator Leonard Jerome and his wife Clarissa (always called Clara [ Lovell Mary The Churchills In Love And War 2011 WW Norton &amp; Company New York, NY 978-0-393-06230-4 24 ] ), daughter of Ambrose Hall, a landowner and sometime New York State Assembly man. She was raised in Brooklyn and other parts of what would become New York City. She had two sisters, Clarita and Leonie. Leonard Jerome was rumored to also be the father of the American opera singer Minnie Hauk. { Anne Sebba, American Jennie, Norton, 2008, page 13 } There is some controversy regarding the time and place of her birth. A plaque at 426 Henry St. gives her year of birth as 1850, not 1854. However, on January 9 in 1854, the Jeromes lived nearby at 8 Amity Street (since renumbered as 197). It is believed that the Jeromes were temporarily staying at the Henry Street address, which was owned by Leonard&apos;s brother Addison, and that Jennie was born there during a snowstorm.

Cobble Hill Association JUNE 15, 2011 February 24, 2012 ] A noted beauty (an admirer, Lord d&apos;Abernon, said that there was &quot; more of the panther than of the woman in her look &quot; [ Lovell Mary The Churchills In Love And War 2011 WW Norton &amp; Company New York, NY 978-0-393-06230-4 65 ] ) Jennie Jerome worked as a magazine editor in early life. Hall family lore insists that Jennie had Iroquois ancestry, through her maternal grandmother; { Ralph G. Martin Jennie: The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill-The Romantic Years, 1854-1895 } however, there is no research or evidence to corroborate this. { The Churchill Centre &amp; Museum website } [ Marriage and personal life ] Jennie Jerome in the 1880s. Long considered one of the most beautiful women of the time, she was married for the first time on April 15, 1874, aged 20, at the British Embassy in Paris, to Lord Randolph Churchill, the second son of John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane. { Anita Leslie. Jennie: The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill, 1969 } Although the couple became engaged within three days of their initial meeting, the marriage was delayed for months while their parents argued over settlements. { William Manchester, The Last Lion, ISBN 0-440-54681 } By this marriage, she was properly known as Lady Randolph Churchill and would have been referred to in conversation as Lady Randolph. The Churchills had two sons. Winston (1874–1965), the future prime minister, was born less than eight months after the marriage. According to his biographer William Manchester, Winston was most likely conceived before the marriage, rather than born prematurely. When asked about the circumstances of his birth, he would reply, &quot; Although present on the occasion, I have no clear recollection of the events leading up to it. &quot; { William Manchester, The Last Lion, ISBN 0-440-54681 } Jennie&apos;s sisters believed that the biological father of the second son, John (1880–1947) was Evelyn Boscawen, 7th Viscount Falmouth. { Anne Sebba, &apos;&apos;American Jennie: The Remarkable Life of Lady Randolph Churchill &quot;, Norton, 2008 } Lady Randolph is believed to have had numerous lovers during her marriage, including Karl Kinsky, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and Herbert von Bismarck. { Manchester, William, Winston Spencer Churchill, The Last Lion, Laurel, Boston, 1989 edition, p. 137, ISBN 0-440-54681-8. } As was the custom of the day, Lady Randolph played a limited role in her sons&apos; upbringing, relying largely upon nannies, especially Mrs. Elizabeth Everest. Winston worshipped his mother, writing her numerous letters during his time at school and begging her to visit him, which, however, she rarely did. He wrote about her in My Early Life: &apos;She shone for me like the evening star. I loved her dearly - but at a distance&apos;. { Churchill, Winston., My Early Life, 1930, Touchstone, 1996 edition, p.28. } After he became an adult, they became good friends and strong allies, to the point where Winston regarded her almost as a political mentor, more as a sister than as a mother. She was well-respected and influential in the highest British social and political circles. She was said to be intelligent, witty, and quick to laughter. It was said that Queen Alexandra especially enjoyed her company, despite the fact that Jennie had been involved in an affair with her husband, Edward VII, a fact that was well known by Alexandra. { Edward VII } Through her family contacts and her extramarital romantic relationships, Jennie greatly helped Lord Randolph&apos;s early career, as well as that of her son Winston. In 1909 when American impresario Charles Frohman became sole manager of the The Globe Theatre, the first production was His Borrowed Plumes, written by Lady Randolph Churchill. Although Mrs. Patrick Campbell produced and took the lead role in the play, it was a commercial failure. It was at this point that Mrs. Campbell began an affair with Lady Randolph&apos;s then husband, George Cornwallis-West. { Lovell, Mary S., The Churchills, Little Brown, London, 2011, p.259. } Lady Randolph was a talented amateur pianist, having been tutored as a girl by Stephen Heller, a friend of Chopin. Heller believed that his young pupil was good enough to attain &apos;concert standard&apos; with the necessary &apos;hard work&apos;, which, according to Lovell, he was not confident she was capable of. { Lovell, Mary S., The Churchills, Little Brown, London, 2011, p.28. } [ Later marriages ] Lord Randolph died in 1895, aged 45. On July 28, 1900, Jennie married George Cornwallis-West (1874–1951), a captain in the Scots Guards who was the same age as her elder son Winston. Around this time, she became well known for chartering a hospital ship to care for those wounded in the Boer War, and in 1908, she wrote The Reminiscences of Lady Randolph Churchill. She separated from her second husband in 1912, and they were divorced in April 1914, whereupon Cornwallis-West married the actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell. Jennie dropped the surname Cornwallis-West, and resumed, by deed poll, the name Lady Randolph Churchill. Her third marriage, on June 1, 1918, was to Montagu Phippen Porch (1877–1964), a member of the British Civil Service in Nigeria, who was three years Winston&apos;s junior. At the end of World War I, Porch resigned from the colonial service, and after Jennie&apos;s death returned to West Africa where his business investments had proven successful. { Lovell, Mary S., The Churchills, Little Brown, London, 2011, p.332, ISBN 978-1-4087-0247-5. } [ Death ] In May 1921, while Montagu Porch was away in Africa, Jennie slipped while coming down a friend&apos;s staircase wearing new high-heeled shoes, breaking her ankle. Gangrene set in, and her left leg was amputated above the knee on June 10. She died at her home in London on June 29, following a haemorrhage of an artery in her thigh (resulting from the amputation). She was 67 years old. { Jenkins, Roy., Churchill, Pan Books, London, 2002 edition, pp.353-354, ISBN 0-330-48805-8. } She was buried in the Churchill family plot at St Martin&apos;s Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire, next to her first husband. [ Legacy ] According to legend, Jennie Churchill was responsible for the invention of the Manhattan cocktail. She allegedly commissioned a bartender for a special drink to celebrate the election of Samuel J. Tilden to the governorship in 1874. While the drink is believed to have been invented by the Manhattan Club (an association of New York Democrats) on that occasion, Jennie could not have been involved, as she was in Europe at the time, about to give birth to her son Winston later that month.
