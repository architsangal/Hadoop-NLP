Kevin Spacey stars as office worker Lester Burnham, who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter&apos;s best friend, Angela ( Mena Suvari ). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester&apos;s materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane; Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney also feature. The film has been described by academics as a satire of American middle class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis has focused on the film&apos;s explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, alienation, self-liberation and redemption. Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992. He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry. The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball&apos;s frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks; the fledgling film studio bought Ball&apos;s script for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15  million production and served as the North American distributor. American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director Mendes&apos; film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver! and Cabaret, Mendes was nevertheless only given the job after twenty others were considered and several &quot; A-list &quot; directors turned down the opportunity. Spacey was Mendes&apos; first choice for the role of Lester, even though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better-known actors; similarly, the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without DreamWorks&apos; knowledge. Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes&apos; dominant style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes&apos; style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone. Released in North America on September  15, 1999, American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences alike; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350  million worldwide. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase American Beauty s chances of Academy Award success; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year, the film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography. [ Plot ] Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) is a middle-aged magazine writer who despises his job. His wife, Carolyn ( Annette Bening ), is an ambitious real-estate broker; their sixteen-year-old daughter, Jane ( Thora Birch ), abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams&apos; new neighbors are retired United States Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts ( Chris Cooper ) and his introverted wife, Barbara ( Allison Janney ); their teenage son, Ricky ( Wes Bentley ), is a secret marijuana smoker and drug dealer whom the colonel subjects to a strict disciplinarian lifestyle. Ricky, who had been forced into a military academy and mental hospital, spends time recording his surroundings with a camcorder; he keeps dozens of taped videos in his bedroom. Lester becomes infatuated with Jane&apos;s cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes ( Mena Suvari ), after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine at a high school basketball game. He begins to have sexual fantasies about Angela, during which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with a business rival, Buddy Kane ( Peter Gallagher ). When Lester is about to be laid off his job he blackmails his boss for $60,000 and quits, taking employment serving fast food. He buys his dream car and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he improved his physique. He begins smoking marijuana bought from Ricky and flirts with Angela whenever she visits Jane. Jane becomes involved with Ricky and they bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag dancing in the wind. { Mendes, Sam (Director). (1999). American Beauty [Motion picture]. United States: } { DreamWorks. } Lester discovers Carolyn&apos;s infidelity but reacts indifferently. Buddy ends the affair, saying he is facing an expensive divorce. Frank becomes suspicious of Lester and Ricky&apos;s friendship, and finds his son&apos;s footage of Lester lifting weights while nude, which Ricky captured by chance. Carolyn becomes distraught, loads a gun and drives home. That night, after watching Ricky and Lester through Lester&apos;s garage window, Frank mistakenly concludes the pair are sexually involved. He later beats Ricky and accuses him of being gay. Ricky falsely admits the charge and goads his father into kicking him out of their home. Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City, and tells the vain Angela she is ordinary. Frank confronts Lester and attempts to kiss him; Lester rebuffs the colonel, who leaves. Lester finds a distraught Angela, who begins to seduce him. After learning that Angela is a virgin, Lester stops and comforts her; the pair instead bond over their shared frustrations. Angela goes to the bathroom and Lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen. A gunshot sounds and blood splatters on the wall. Ricky and Jane find Lester&apos;s body. Carolyn is seen crying in the bedroom, and Frank returns home, bloodied, a gun missing from his collection. Lester&apos;s closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life; he says that despite his death he is happy, as there&apos;s so much beauty in the world. [ Themes and analysis ] [ Multiple interpretations ] Academics have offered many possible readings of American Beauty; film critics are similarly divided, not so much about the quality of the film as their interpretations of it. [ Booth 2002 129 ] Described by many as about &quot; the meaning of life &quot; or &quot; gender identification &quot; or &quot; the hollow existence of the American suburbs &quot;, [ Hall 2006 23 ] the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: &quot; a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories  ... it was about imprisonment  ... loneliness [and] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad. &quot; The literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: &quot; [American Beauty] cannot be adequately summarized as &apos;here is a satire on what&apos;s wrong with American life&apos;; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as &apos;a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds&apos;; but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball&apos;s disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester&apos;s or Ricky&apos;s philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live  ... &quot; He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who &quot; [unites] all of the choices &quot;. [ Some postmodernist readings would posit no need for an identified voice; see Death of the Author. &quot; nb &quot; ] [ Booth 2002 126 ] He contends that in American Beauty s case it is neither Mendes nor Ball. [ Booth 2002 128 ] Mendes considers the voice to be Ball&apos;s, but even while the writer was &quot; strongly influential &quot; on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. [ Booth 2002 126–128 ] With &quot; innumerable voices intruding on the original author&apos;s, &quot; Booth says, those who interpret American Beauty &quot; have forgotten to probe for the elusive center &quot;. According to Booth, the film&apos;s true controller is the creative energy &quot; that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting &quot;. [ Imprisonment and redemption ] Lester&apos;s reflection in the monitor is intended to resemble a man in a jail cell, evoking the director&apos;s intended theme of imprisonment and escape from imprisonment. Mendes called American Beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester&apos;s existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing. In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, &quot; reiterating rituals that hardly please him &quot;. He masturbates in the confines of his shower; [ Hausmann 2004 118 ] the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, [ Anker 2004 348–349 ] such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, &quot; confined [and] nearly crossed out &quot;. The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester&apos;s journey is the story&apos;s center. His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to &quot; [throw] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise &quot;. After Lester shares a joint with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 8 ] Changed by Ricky&apos;s &quot; attractive, profound confidence &quot;, Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his &quot; banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence &quot;; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could &quot; see his whole life ahead of him &quot;. [ Hausmann 2004 118–119 ] When Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn&apos;s &quot; superficial investments in others &quot;, Lester is trying to &quot; regain a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and daughter &quot;. His final turning point comes when he and Angela almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and &quot; wraps her up &quot;. Mendes called it &quot; the most satisfying end to [Lester&apos;s] journey there could possibly have been &quot;. With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a &quot; mythical quest &quot;. After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks &quot; to meet his fate &quot;. Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. [ Pennington 2007 105 ] As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester&apos;s death. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 26 ] His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky&apos;s staring into Lester&apos;s dead eyes is &quot; the culmination of the theme &quot; of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 27 ] [ Conformity and beauty ] Like other American films of 1999 —such as Fight Club, Bringing Out the Dead and Magnolia —American Beauty instructs its audience to &quot; [lead] more meaningful lives &quot;. { Desowitz, Bill (December  12, 1999). &quot; Finding Spiritual Rebirth In a Valley of Male Ennui &quot;. } { The New York Times : 215. } The film argues the case against conformity, but does not deny that people need and want it; even the gay characters just want to fit in. Jim and Jim, the Burnhams&apos; other neighbors, are a satire of &quot; gay bourgeois coupledom &quot;, [ Munt 2006 274 ] who &quot; [invest] in the numbing sameness &quot; that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples. [ Despite their desire to conform, Jim and Jim are openly, proudly gay, a contradiction that Sally R. Munt says may seem strange to heterosexual audiences. &quot; nb &quot; ] [ Hausmann 2004 112 ] The feminist academic and author Sally R. Munt argues that American Beauty uses its &quot; art house &quot; trappings to direct its message of non-conformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a &quot; cliché of bourgeois preoccupation  ... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual &apos;self&apos; through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel. &quot; [ Munt 2006 264–265 ] Professor Roy M. Anker argues that the film&apos;s thematic center is its direction to the audience to &quot; look closer &quot;. The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams&apos; neighborhood with Lester&apos;s narrated admission that he will soon die, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. [ Anker 2004 345 ] It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, &quot; from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story?  ... if he&apos;s already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive?  ... There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die. &quot; Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane&apos;s discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. [ Anker 2004 347 ] Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside &quot; to view the film and its philosophical issues &quot;. [ Hall 2006 24 ] Through this examination of Lester&apos;s life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. [ Anker 2004 347–348 ] Even Lester&apos;s transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a &quot; willing devotee of the popular media&apos;s exultation of pubescent male sexuality as a route to personal wholeness &quot;. [ Anker 2004 348 ] Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in &quot; house beautiful &quot; domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn&apos;s domain is a &quot; fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden &quot;. [ Anker 2004 349–350 ] The Burnhams are unaware that they are &quot; materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically &quot; who expect the &quot; rudiments of American beauty &quot; to give them happiness. Anker argues that &quot; they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes  ... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation. &quot; The film presents Ricky as its &quot; visionary  ... its spiritual and mystical center &quot;. [ Hall 2006 27 ] He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was &quot; an entire life behind things &quot;; he feels that &quot; sometimes there&apos;s so much beauty in the world I feel like I can&apos;t take it  ... and my heart is going to cave in. &quot; Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the &quot; cultural dross &quot;, has &quot; [grasped] the radiant splendor of the created world &quot; to see God. [ Anker 2004 356 ] As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky&apos;s view of the world. [ Anker 2004 360 ] Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film&apos;s end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so Lester sees himself, Angela and his family &quot; for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are &quot;. He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, [ Anker 2004 358–359 ] and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with &quot; wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude &quot; —he has finally seen the world as it is. According to Patti Bellantoni, colors are used symbolically throughout the film, [ Bellantoni 2005 25 ] none more so than red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and &quot; [defines] Lester&apos;s arc &quot;. First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality. [ Bellantoni 2005 27 ] The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester&apos;s desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a &quot; façade for suburban success &quot;. Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams&apos; home, where they signify &quot; a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality &quot;. [ Anker 2004 350 ] Carolyn feels that &quot; as long as there can be roses, all is well &quot;. She cuts the roses and puts them in vases, where they adorn her &quot; meretricious vision of what makes for beauty &quot; and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela–Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester&apos;s previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses—and thus Carolyn—out of the shot. Lester&apos;s epiphany at the end of the film is expressed via rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels. The constant use of red &quot; lulls [the audience] subliminally &quot; into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall. [ Sexuality and repression ] Pennington argues that American Beauty defines its characters through their sexuality. Lester&apos;s attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela, [ Pennington 2007 104 ] and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from &quot; cold perfectionist &quot; to a more carefree soul who &quot; [sings] happily along with &quot; the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela&apos;s descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. [ Pennington 2007 105–106 ] Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela&apos;s hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester&apos;s attraction to her. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 23 ] Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, &quot; How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless? &quot; To which Ricky replies, &quot; That&apos;s the thing, Dad—they don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s anything to be ashamed of. &quot; Pennington argues that Col. Fitts&apos; reaction is not homophobic, but an &quot; anguished self-interrogation &quot;. [ Pennington 2007 106 ] With other turn-of-the-millennium films such as Fight Club, In the Company of Men  (1997), American Psycho  (2000) and Boys Don&apos;t Cry  (1999), American Beauty &quot; raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis &quot;. [ 2004 117 ] Professor Vincent Hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity &quot; against threats posed by war, by consumerism, and by feminist and queer challenges &quot;, these films present a need to &quot; focus on, and even to privilege &quot; aspects of maleness &quot; deemed &apos;deviant. Lester&apos;s transformation conveys &quot; that he, and not the woman, has borne the brunt of [lack of being] &quot; [ According to Hausmann, &quot; These films appear to suggest that [the film theorist] Kaja Silverman &apos;s wish &apos;that the typical male subject, like his female counterpart, might learn to live with lack&apos;—namely, the &apos;lack of being&apos; that remains &apos;the irreducible condition of subjectivity&apos;— has not yet been fulfilled. &quot; See Silverman, Kaja (1992). Male Subjectivity at the Margins(New York: Routledge ): 65+20. ISBN 9780415904193. &quot; nb &quot; ] and he will not stand for being emasculated. [ Hausmann 2004 117 ] Lester&apos;s attempts to &quot; strengthen traditional masculinity &quot; conflict with his responsibilities as a father. Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively, he does not become &quot; the hypermasculine figure implicitly celebrated in films like Fight Club &quot;. Hausmann concludes that Lester&apos;s behavior toward Angela is &quot; a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again &quot;. Hausmann says the film &quot; explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest &quot;; [ Hausmann 2004 113 ] a recurring theme of Ball&apos;s work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality. [ Munt 2006 267 ] Instead of making an overt distinction, American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence. [ Munt 2006 266 ] Col. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester; by comparison, the openly gay Jim and Jim are the most well-adjusted characters in the film. Ball said, &quot; The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [they] can do. &quot; The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires: [ Munt 2006 265 ] Lester&apos;s pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter, [ Munt 2006 264 ] while Col. Fitts&apos; repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls Ricky. Consequently, Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual. Col. Fitts represents Ball&apos;s father, [ Hausmann 2004 127 ] whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness. [ Hausmann 2004 148 ] Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual, which Munt reads as a possible &quot; deferment of Ball&apos;s own patriarchal-incest fantasies &quot;. [ Temporality and music ] American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Dr Jacqueline Furby says that the plot &quot; occupies  ... no time [or] all time &quot;, citing Lester&apos;s claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it &quot; stretches on forever like an ocean of time &quot;. [ Furby 2006 22 ] Furby argues that a &quot; rhythm of repetition &quot; forms the core of the film&apos;s structure. [ Furby 2006 25 ] For example, two scenes see the Burnhams&apos; sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester&apos;s new-found assertiveness. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 17 ] [ Furby 2006 25–26 ] Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly &quot; voyeuristic and exhibitionist &quot; scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment. Lester&apos;s fixation on Angela is given life by the non-diegetic score, which creates and maintains the narrative stasis of his fantasy. Lester&apos;s fantasies are emphasized by slow motion and repetitive motion shots; [ Furby 2006 23 ] Mendes uses double-and-triple cut backs in several sequences, and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 9 ] One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester&apos;s first encounter with Angela. While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to &quot; On Broadway &quot;, Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his &quot; voyeuristic hypnosis &quot; and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela&apos;s performance is for him alone. [ Link 2004 84 ] &quot; On Broadway &quot; —which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; [ Link 2004 84–85 ] it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Associate Professor Stan Link likens to &quot; vertical time &quot;, described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imparts &quot; a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite &apos;now&apos; that nonetheless feels like an instant &quot;. [ Kramer uses the analogy of looking at a sculpture: &quot; We determine for ourselves the pacing of our experience: we are free to walk around the piece, view it from many angles, concentrate on some details, see other details in relationship to each other, step back and view the whole, see the relationship between the piece and the space in which we see it, leave the room when we wish close our eyes and remember, and return for further viewings. &quot; &quot; nb &quot; ] The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of &quot; On Broadway &quot; and teleological time. [ Link 2004 86 ] According to Drew Miller of Stylus, the soundtrack &quot; [gives] unconscious voice &quot; to the characters&apos; psyches and complements the subtext. The most obvious use of pop music &quot; accompanies and gives context to &quot; Lester&apos;s attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music. [ Another example comes with the songs that Carolyn picks to accompany the Burnhams&apos; dinners—upbeat &quot; elevator music &quot; which is later replaced with more discordant tunes that reflect the &quot; escalating tension &quot; at the table. When Jane plays &quot; Cancer for the Cure &quot;, she switches off after a few moments because her parents return home. The moment reinforces her as someone whose voice is &quot; cut short &quot;, as does her lack of association with as clearly defined genres as her parents. &quot; nb &quot; ] Mendes&apos; song choices &quot; progress through the history of American popular music &quot;. Miller argues that although some may be over familiar, there is a parodic element at work, &quot; making good on [the film&apos;s] encouragement that viewers look closer &quot;. Toward the end of the film, Thomas Newman &apos;s score features more prominently, creating &quot; a disturbing tempo &quot; that matches the tension of the visuals. The exception is &quot; Don&apos;t Let It Bring You Down &quot;, which plays during Angela&apos;s seduction of Lester. At first appropriate, its tone clashes as the seduction stops. The lyrics, which speak of &quot; castles burning &quot;, can be seen as a metaphor for Lester&apos;s view of Angela— &quot; the rosy, fantasy-driven exterior of the &apos;American Beauty —as it burns away to reveal &quot; the timid, small-breasted girl who, like his wife, has willfully developed a false public self &quot;. { Miller, Drew (July  20, 2004). &quot; A Kiss After Supper: American Beauty &quot;. } { Stylus. Retrieved November  26, 2009. } [ Production ] [ Development ] In 1997, Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and Cybill. He joined the United Talent Agency  (UTA), where his representative, Andrew Cannava, suggested he write a spec script to &quot; reintroduce [himself] to the town as a screenwriter &quot;. Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava: two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty, [ At that point called American Rose. &quot; nb &quot; ] { Cohen, David S. (March  7, 2000). &quot; Scripter Ball hits a home run &quot;. Variety. } which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s. Despite the story&apos;s lack of an easily marketable concept, Cannava selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one Ball had the most passion for. [ Chumo II 2000 26 ] While developing the script, Ball created another television sitcom, Oh, Grow Up. He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show—and during his tenures on Grace Under Fire and Cybill—into writing American Beauty. Ball did not expect to sell the script, believing it would act as more of a calling card, but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies. Cannava passed the script to several producers, including Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen, who took it to DreamWorks. [ Kazan 2000 28 ] With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper, and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner, Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks; [ Kazan 2000 28–29 ] he received assurances from the studio—known at the time for its more conventional fare—that it would not &quot; iron the [edges] out &quot;. [ Ball said he decided on DreamWorks after an accidental meeting with Spielberg in the Amblin Entertainment car park, where the writer became confident that Spielberg &quot; got &quot; the script and its intended tone. &quot; nb &quot; ] [ Chumo II 2000 27 ] In an unusual move, DreamWorks decided not to option the script; [ Kazan 2000 30 ] instead, in April 1998, the studio bought it outright { Staff (April  14, 19 98). &quot; DreamWorks grateful for &apos;American Beauty. } { The Hollywood Reporter. } for $250,000, outbidding Fox Searchlight Pictures, October Films, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lakeshore Entertainment. { Cox, Dan (April  14, 1998). &quot; D&apos;Works courts &apos;Beauty&apos; spec &quot;. Variety. } DreamWorks planned to make the film for $6–8  million. [ Lowenstein 2008 251 ] Jinks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film&apos;s development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about twenty interested directors, [ Kazan 2000 31 ] several of whom were considered &quot; A-list &quot; at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become &quot; nervous about the content &quot;. Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis; neither accepted. In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall. Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. [ Lowenstein 2008 248 ] { &quot; nb &quot; } Mendes came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at Swofford&apos;s house, [ Lowenstein 2008 249 ] and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film Paris, Texas  (1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty, as well as parallels with his own childhood. [ Lowenstein 2008 250–251 ] Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes&apos; productions of Oliver! and Cabaret, { Fanshawe, Simon (January  22, 2000). &quot; Sam smiles &quot;. } { The Guardian : 32. } Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty. Mendes found that he still had to convince DreamWorks&apos; production executives to let him direct. He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him. [ Lowenstein 2008 252 ] Ball was also keen; having seen Cabaret, he was impressed with Mendes&apos; &quot; keen visual sense &quot; and thought he did not make obvious choices. Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story&apos;s surface, a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty. Mendes&apos; background also reassured him, because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production. Over two meetings—the first with Cooper, Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald, the second with Cooper alone —Mendes pitched himself to the studio. The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules—$150,000. Mendes accepted, and later recalled that after taxes and his agent&apos;s commission, he only earned $38,000. [ Lowenstein 2008 253 ] In June 1998, DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film. { Hindes, Andrew (June  16, 1998). &quot; Staging a transfer: Legit helmer Mendes makes pic bow with &apos;Beauty. Variety. } [ Writing ] [ &quot; I think I was writing about  ... how it&apos;s becoming harder and harder to live an authentic life when we live in a world that seems to focus on appearance  ... For all the differences between now and the [1950s], in a lot of ways this is just as oppressively conformist a time  ... You see so many people who strive to live the unauthentic life and then they get there and they wonder why they&apos;re not happy  ... I didn&apos;t realize it when I sat down to write [American Beauty], but these ideas are important to me. &quot; right 30em padding:8px ] Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for ten minutes, saying later that it provoked an &quot; unexpected emotional response &quot;. [ Kazan 2000 24 ] In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. [ Kazan 2000 25 ] He said he &quot; felt like there was a real story underneath [that was] more fascinating and way more tragic &quot; than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character&apos;s story was &quot; intensely personal &quot;, it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles. [ Kazan 2000 37 ] Ball based Lester&apos;s story on aspects of his own life. [ Chumo II 2000 26–27 ] Lester&apos;s re-examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid-30s; [ Chumo II 2000 32–33 ] like Lester, Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect. Scenes in Ricky&apos;s household reflect Ball&apos;s own childhood experiences. Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. Fitts, a man who &quot; gave up his chance to be himself &quot;. { Kilday, Gregg (January  18, 2000). &quot; Worth a Closer Look &quot;. The Advocate: 91–92. } Ball said the script&apos;s mix of comedy and drama was not intentional, but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life. He said the juxtaposition produced a starker contrast, giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone. [ Chumo II 2000 30 ] In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors, Lester and Angela had sex; by the time of shooting, Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version. [ Chumo II 2000 33 ] Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script, feeling they were being puritanical; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks&apos; then-president Walter Parkes. He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology, the hero &quot; has a moment of epiphany before  ... tragedy occurs &quot;. [ Kazan 2000 32–33 ] Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey—to achieve redemption. Jinks and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene straight away, as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired. [ Kazan 2000 33 ] Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. Fitts service in the Marines, a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings. In love with another Marine, Col. Fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the &quot; sin &quot; of being gay. Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film—Col. Fitts was the only character to have a flashback —and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. Fitts&apos; later pass at Lester. Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col. Fitts, even though all that remained in later drafts was subtext. [ Chumo II 2000 33–34 ] Ball remained involved throughout production; he had signed a television show development deal, so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty. [ Kazan 2000 32 ] Ball was on-set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming. [ Kazan 2000 35 ] His original bookend scenes—in which Ricky and Jane are prosecuted for Lester&apos;s murder after being framed by Col. Fitts { Wolk, Josh (March  27, 2000). &quot; Pitching Fitts &quot;. } { Entertainment Weekly. } —were excised in post-production; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary, saying they were a reflection of his &quot; anger and cynicism &quot; at the time of writing (see &quot; Editing &quot; ). Ball and Mendes revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors, and twice more before the first read-through. The shooting script features a scene in Angela&apos;s car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a &quot; big scene on a freeway &quot; in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. [ Kazan 2000 36 ] The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky&apos;s where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: &quot; When you see something like that, it&apos;s like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you&apos;re careful, you can look right back. &quot; Jane asks: &quot; And what do you see? &quot; Ricky: &quot; Beauty. &quot; Ball said, &quot; They wanted to cut that scene. They said it&apos;s not important. I said, &apos;You&apos;re out of your fucking mind. It&apos;s one of the most important scenes in the movie!&apos;  ... If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line. &quot; [ Chumo II 2000 35 ] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a &quot; turning point &quot; for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through ten drafts. [ Chumo II 2000 28 ] [ Casting ] Principal cast. &apos;&apos;First row, left to right&apos;&apos;: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari &apos;&apos;Second row&apos;&apos;: Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley, Allison Janney Mendes had Spacey and Bening in mind for the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks executives were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star &quot; weighing the film down &quot;; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992&apos;s Glengarry Glen Ross. [ Lowenstein 2008 253–254 ] Spacey was surprised; he said, &quot; I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart  ... I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one step at a time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts. &quot; Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio&apos;s consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening. { Fleming, Michael (September  15, 1998). &quot; Spacey nears &apos;Beauty&apos; deal &quot;.

Variety. } Spacey loosely based Lester&apos;s early &quot; schlubby &quot; deportment on Walter Matthau. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 2 ] During the film, Lester&apos;s physique improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body, [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 22 ] but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. { Gordinier, Jeff (March  1, 2000). &quot; Kevin Spacey  – American Beauty &quot;. Entertainment Weekly (529). } Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon &apos;s performance in The Apartment  (1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate &quot; the way [Lemmon] moved, the way he looked, the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man &quot;. Spacey&apos;s voiceover is a throwback to Sunset Boulevard  (1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester&apos;s—and the film&apos;s—loneliness. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 1 ] Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: &quot; I used to babysit constantly. You&apos;d go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference. &quot; Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a &quot; PTA president coif &quot; hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail order catalogs to better establish Carolyn&apos;s environment of a &quot; spotless suburban manor &quot;. To help Bening get into Carolyn&apos;s mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. [ Lowenstein 2008 257–258 ] He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of the song &quot; Don&apos;t Rain on My Parade &quot;, which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car. { Gordinier, Jeff (March  1, 2000). &quot; Annette Bening  – American Beauty &quot;. Entertainment Weekly (529). } For the roles of Jane, Ricky and Angela, DreamWorks gave Mendes carte blanche. [ Lowenstein 2008 257 ] By November 1998, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari had been cast in the parts { Honeycutt. Kirk (November  6, 1998). Beloved&apos; actor sees &apos;Beauty.

Peter Gallagher and Alison Janney were cast (as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts) after filming began in December 1998. { Galloway, Stephen (December  23, 1998). &quot; Gallagher role: thing of &apos;Beauty.

He told her, &quot; Your character is in there somewhere. &quot; Mendes cut much of Barbara&apos;s dialogue, [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 16 ] including conversations between her and Col. Fitts, as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 6 ] Chris Cooper plays Col. Fitts, Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer, and Sam Robards plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy—and boring—couple in the film. { Ball, Alan (March  28, 2000). &quot; Beauty and the Box Office &quot;. } { The Advocate : 11. } Ball&apos;s inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a &quot; bland, boring, heterosexual couple &quot; who wore matching clothes: &quot; I can&apos;t wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring. &quot; Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename. Mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals, although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater, and the actors could not be present at every one. Several improvisations and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script. An early scene showing the Burnhams leaving home for work was inserted late on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester&apos;s relationship had reached. Spacey and Bening worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another; for example, the scene in which Lester almost seduces Carolyn after the pair argue over Lester&apos;s buying a car was originally &quot; strictly contentious &quot;. [ Kazan 2000 34 ] [ Filming ] Principal photography lasted about 50 days [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 19 ] from December  14, 1998, { Staff (November  6, 1998). &quot; Players &quot;.

Production designer Naomi Shohan likened the locale to Evanston, Illinois, but said, &quot; it&apos;s not about a place, it&apos;s about an archetype  ... The milieu was pretty much Anywhere, USA—upwardly mobile suburbia. &quot; The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters, who are also archetypes. Shohan said, &quot; All of them are very strained, and their lives are constructs. &quot; The Burnhams&apos; household was designed as the reverse of the Fitts&apos;—the former a pristine ideal, but graceless and lacking in &quot; inner balance &quot;, leading to Carolyn&apos;s desire to at least give it the appearance of a &quot; perfect all-American household &quot;; the Fitts&apos; home is depicted in &quot; exaggerated darkness [and] symmetry &quot;. The aerial shots of the Burnhams&apos; neighborhood at the beginning and end of the film were captured above Sacramento, California. The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot&apos;s &quot; Blondie Street &quot; for the Burnhams&apos; and Fitts&apos; homes. [ One of which director of photography Conrad Hall had filmed for Divorce American Style  (1967). &quot; nb &quot; ] The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight—between Ricky and Jane&apos;s bedroom windows, and between Ricky&apos;s bedroom and Lester&apos;s garage. [ Probst Heuring Holben Thomson 2000 75 ] The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts—watching from Ricky&apos;s bedroom—mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex. Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 10 ] The house interiors were filmed on the backlot, on location, and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed. The inside of the Burnhams&apos; home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles; the inside of the Fitts&apos; home was shot in the city&apos;s Hancock Park neighborhood. Ricky&apos;s bedroom was designed to be cell-like to suggest his &quot; monkish &quot; personality, while at the same time blending with the high-tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side. The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams&apos; home uses cool blues, while the Fitts&apos; is kept in a &quot; depressed military palette &quot;. Mendes&apos; dominating visual style was deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided &quot; a sparse, almost surreal feeling—a bright, crisp, hard edged, near Magritte -like take on American suburbia &quot;; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame. He made Lester&apos;s fantasy scenes &quot; more fluid and graceful &quot;, and Mendes made minimal use of steadicam s, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams&apos; dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He wanted to keep the tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 21 ] { &quot; nb &quot; } Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a &quot; kinetic  ... off balance energy &quot;. He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky&apos;s camcorder footage. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 18 ] It took Mendes a long time to get the quality of Ricky&apos;s footage to the level he wanted. For the plastic bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag. [ Lowenstein 2008 268 ] Mendes avoided using close-up s, as he believed the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg&apos;s advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [ 40 ft m 1 on ] screen. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 25 ] Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a &quot; great idea &quot; toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, &quot; That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie. &quot; { Stein, Ruthe (September  12, 1999). &quot; From &apos;Cabaret&apos; to California &quot;. } { San Francisco Chronicle : 55. } Despite Spielberg&apos;s support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget—although the studio interfered little with the film&apos;s content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15  million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. [ Kemp 2000 27 ] Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days&apos; filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, &quot; I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. [ The scene at the fast food outlet where Lester discovers Carolyn&apos;s affair. &quot; nb &quot; ] And the actors played it way too big  ... It was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault  ... And everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault. &quot; Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: &quot; I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn&apos;t understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, &apos;I don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re talking about, please explain it. { Weinraub, Bernard (September  12, 1999). &quot; The New Season / Film: Stage to Screen; A Wunderkind Discovers the Wonders of Film &quot;. The New York Times: 271. } Mendes encouraged some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in bed beside Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, &quot; I wanted that not just because it was funny  ... but because I didn&apos;t want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [Spacey] is so in control—I wanted him to break through. &quot; Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot ten times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester&apos;s fantasies were added in post-production, [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 4 ] although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 5 ] When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 11 ] [ Editing ] American Beauty was edited by Christopher Greenbury and Tariq Anwar; Greenbury began in the position, but had to leave halfway through post-production because of a scheduling conflict with Me, Myself and Irene  (2000). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for ten days between the appointments. [ Lowenstein 2008 270 ] Mendes realized during editing that the film was different to the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a &quot; much more whimsical  ... kaleidoscopic &quot; film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. [ Kemp 2000 25–26 ] In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit. The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against bluescreen, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical— &quot; like a Coen brothers movie &quot; —and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair were not responsible for Lester&apos;s death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane&apos;s request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening—and when the full scene plays out later—Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt. [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 20 ] The subsequent shot—an aerial view of the neighborhood—was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence. Mendes spent more time re-cutting the first ten minutes than the rest of the film taken together. He trialled several versions of the opening; the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester&apos;s murder, [ Mendes Ball 2000 chapter 12 ] but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery, { Staff (July  7, 2000). Beauty&apos; mark: DVD due with 3 hours of extras &quot;. The Hollywood Reporter. } and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film &quot; into an episode of NYPD Blue &quot;. Instead, he wanted the ending to be &quot; a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution &quot;. [ Kemp 2000 26 ] When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they &quot; didn&apos;t really register &quot;. He and Mendes argued, but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that &quot; for all its darkness had a really romantic heart &quot;. [ Cinematography ] Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography; Mendes believed he was &quot; too old and too experienced &quot; to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked Fred Elmes, who turned the job down because he did not like the script. [ Lowenstein 2008 259 ] Hall was recommended to Mendes by Tom Cruise, because of Hall&apos;s work on Without Limits  (1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise&apos;s then-wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during pre-production on American Beauty, and had already storyboard ed the whole film. Hall was involved for one month during pre-production; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes. [ Probst 2000 80 ] Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals. Hall&apos;s approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked classicism, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences to take in the action. Hall and Mendes would first discuss the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene&apos;s subject by &quot; painting in &quot; the blacks and whites, before adding fill light, which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35  mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T-stop (T1.9); [ Probst Heuring Holben Thomson 2000 76 ] given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company&apos;s Primo series of prime and zoom lens es. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak&apos;s newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8  inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended. A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light from the top of the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot &quot; worked perfectly for the tone of the scene &quot;. Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester&apos;s encounter with Angela at the Burnhams&apos; home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. [ Probst 2000 81 ] He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room. [ Probst 2000 82 ] [ Music ] [ track listings American Beauty (soundtrack) American Beauty: Original Motion Picture Score ] Thomas Newman &apos;s score was recorded in Santa Monica, California. He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm, the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes. Newman &quot; favored pulse, rhythm and color over melody &quot;, making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created.

Blockbuster&apos;s strategy leaked before May  9, leading to a 30% order increase from other retailers. In its first week of rental release, American Beauty made $6.8  million.

Chicago Sun-Times. } Kevin Jackson of Sight &amp; Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of &quot; both sap and hero &quot;. Writing in Film Quarterly, Gary Hentzi praised the actors, [ Hentzi 2000 50 ] but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes. [ Hentzi 2000 47 ] Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their &quot; fantasy figure &quot; —a teenaged boy who&apos;s an absurdly wealthy artist able to &quot; finance [his] own projects &quot;. [ Hentzi 2000 49–50 ] Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her &quot; painfully familiar &quot; attempts to &quot; live up to an unworthy image of herself &quot;. Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the actors coped &quot; faultlessly &quot; with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey&apos;s performance &quot; the energy that drives the film &quot;, saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester&apos;s not always being sympathetic. &quot; Against considerable odds, we do like [these characters], &quot; Turan concluded. { Turan, Kenneth (September  15, 1999). &quot; American Beauty: The Rose&apos;s Thorns &quot;. Los Angeles Times. } Maslin felt that Mendes directed with &quot; terrific visual flair &quot;, saying his minimalist style balanced &quot; the mordant and bright &quot; and that he evoked the &quot; delicate, eroticized power-playing vignettes &quot; of his theater work. Jackson said Mendes&apos; theatrical roots rarely showed, and that the &quot; most remarkable &quot; aspect was that Spacey&apos;s performance did not overshadow the film. He said that Mendes worked the script&apos;s intricacies smoothly, to the ensemble&apos;s strengths, and staged the tonal shifts skillfully. McCarthy believed American Beauty a &quot; stunning card of introduction &quot; for film débutantes Mendes and Ball. He said Mendes&apos; &quot; sure hand &quot; was &quot; as precise and controlled &quot; as his theater work. McCarthy cited Hall&apos;s involvement as fortunate for Mendes, as the cinematographer was &quot; unsurpassed &quot; at conveying the themes of a work. Turan agreed that Mendes&apos; choice of collaborators was &quot; shrewd &quot;, naming Hall and Newman in particular. Turan suggested that American Beauty may have benefited from Mendes&apos; inexperience, as his &quot; anything&apos;s possible daring &quot; made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided. Turan felt that Mendes&apos; accomplishment was to &quot; capture and enhance [the] duality &quot; of Ball&apos;s script—the simultaneously &quot; caricatured  ... and painfully real &quot; characters. Hentzi, while critical of many of Mendes and Ball&apos;s choices, admitted the film showed off their &quot; considerable talents &quot;. Turan cited Ball&apos;s lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script&apos;s subtle changes in tone. McCarthy said the script was &quot; as fresh and distinctive &quot; as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball&apos;s dialogue &quot; tart &quot; and said the characters—Carolyn excepted—were &quot; deeply drawn &quot;. One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts&apos; homosexuality, which he said evoked &quot; hoary Freudianism &quot;. Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a &quot; wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy &quot;. He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with &quot; unexpected nuance &quot;. Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester&apos;s murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense. McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating &quot; ironic counterpoint[s] &quot; to the story. Hentzi concluded that American Beauty was &quot; vital but uneven &quot;; he felt the film&apos;s examination of &quot; the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other&apos;s lives &quot; was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela&apos;s dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside &quot; the most enduring literary treatments &quot; of the theme, such as Lolita. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film&apos;s themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were &quot; hackneyed &quot;. McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a &quot; starting point &quot; from which to tell its &quot; subtle and acutely judged tale &quot;. Maslin agreed; she said that while it &quot; takes aim at targets that are none too fresh &quot;, and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own &quot; corrosive novelty &quot;. Ebert awarded American Beauty four stars out of four, and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex and surprising, concluding it was &quot; a hell of a picture &quot;. A few months after the film&apos;s release, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press, and the years since have seen its critical regard wane. { Brown, Joel (June  22, 2001). &quot; The Tube Has Few Intriguing Choices to Offer &quot;. } { The Tuscaloosa News : 14. } [ Lowenstein 2008 271–272 ] In 2005, Premiere named American Beauty as one of 20 &quot; most overrated movies of all time &quot;; { Staff (September 2005). &quot; The 20 most overrated movies of all time &quot;. } { Premiere 19 (1): 103–108. } Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying, &quot; I thought some of it was entirely justified—it was a little overpraised at the time. &quot; [ Accolades ] [ List of accolades received by American Beauty ] American Beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. { Lyman, Rick (March  27, 2000). &quot; Early Oscars to Caine, Jolie and &apos;Topsy-Turvy.

New York Times Online. Retrieved January  14, 2010. } they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture; { Kilday, Gregg (January  8, 2001). &quot; Road to best pic: An &apos;American&apos; dream &quot;. Variety. } however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, American Beauty won Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay. As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached, a frontrunner had not emerged. DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for American Beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 Academy Award voters. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in &quot; casual, comfortable settings &quot; in voters&apos; communities. The studio&apos;s candidate for Best Picture the previous year, Saving Private Ryan, lost to Shakespeare in Love, so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to &quot; think small &quot;. Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of American Beauty, to set up displays of the film in the communities&apos; bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Dale Olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills —home to many voters—in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen American Beauty to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins, meeting several voters who were in attendance. { Wallace, Amy (March  28, 2000). &quot; Aggressive campaign may have helped &apos;Beauty&apos;s&apos; win &quot;. } { The Journal Gazette. (Reprinted from the Los Angeles Times.) } In February 2000, American Beauty was nominated for eight Academy Awards; its closest rivals, The Cider House Rules and The Insider, received seven nominations each. In March 2000, the major industry labor organizations [ The Writers Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Producers Guild of America, the American Society of Cinematographers and the Directors Guild of America. &quot; nb &quot; ] all awarded their top honors to American Beauty; perceptions had shifted—the film was now favorite to dominate the Academy Awards. American Beauty s closest rival for Best Picture was still The Cider House Rules, from Miramax.
