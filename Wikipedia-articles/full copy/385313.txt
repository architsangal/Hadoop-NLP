The team plays its home matches at Selhurst Park, where it has been based since 1924. The club currently competes in the second tier of English Football, The Championship.Crystal Palace was formed in 1905 by workers at The Crystal Palace. The club reached the top division of English Football in 1969–70, and its first major final was in 1990. It was relegated from the top division in 1973 and once again in the following season. That left the club playing in the third tier of English football for the 1974–75 season, before being promoted back to the top level by 1979–80. Crystal Palace&apos;s most recent successful period began in 1988–89, when the club finished third in the Second Division and was promoted to the First Division. It reached the 1990 FA Cup Final only to lose the replay against Manchester United, and finished 3rd in the First Division in 1990–91. Palace was a founding member of the FA Premier League (1992–93) but was relegated that season. Since then Palace has been relegated from and promoted to the FA Premier League on 4 separate occasions. Its most recent relegation from the top flight was in the 2004–05 season. Crystal Palace&apos;s main rival is Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, though it also shares rivalries with fellow South London teams Millwall and Charlton Athletic. The club has twice gone into administration, first in 1998, which ended in 2000 with its purchase by Simon Jordan. His tenure also ended with administration in 2010, leading to a takeover by the CPFC 2010 consortium consisting of Steve Parish, owner of marketing agency Tag: Worldwide, Martin Long, founder of Churchill Insurance, Farr Vintners chairman Stephen Browett and investment fund manager Jeremy Hosking. [ History ] [ History of Crystal Palace F.C. ] Crystal Palace Football Club was formed on 10 September 1905 by the builders of the The Crystal Palace and initially played its home games at the cup final ground at The Crystal Palace. [ http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~639642%2C00.html Business: Club History CPFC 26 August 2009 ] The club joined the Southern League Second Division in 1905–06 and in its inaugural season was promoted to the First Division, crowned as champions. Crystal Palace also joined the United Counties League, finishing runner-up to Watford. Horace Colclough became the club&apos;s first England representative when he played against Wales in Cardiff on 16 March 1914. The outbreak of World War I led to the Admiralty requisitioning the Crystal Palace and the club was forced to move to the home of West Norwood FC, Herne Hill. Three years later the club moved again to The Nest due to the folding of Croydon Common FC. The club joined the Football League Third Division in the 1920–21 season, finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the Second Division. Palace moved to the purpose-built stadium Selhurst Park in 1924, the ground the club plays at today. The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against Sheffield Wednesday and, in front of a crowd of 25 000, Palace lost 0–1. Palace finished 21st that season and was relegated to the Third Division South where the club stayed until 1957–58 when it finished in the bottom half of the table and joined the newly formed Fourth Division. This was alongside the other 11 bottom half clubs of Third Division South and 12 bottom half clubs of Third Division North. In 1960–61 Palace were promoted out of the lowest tier of English League Football and this proved a turning point in the club&apos;s history as promotions followed in 1963–64 and 1968–69, taking it back to Division 2 and then Division 1. { 2009–10 } Despite surviving in the top flight from 1969 until 1972, the club once again experienced great disappointments when it was relegated in consecutive seasons, and played in the third tier for the 1974–75 season. This proved short-lived as Palace were promoted in 1976–77 and 1978–79 back up to Division 1. The 1980s began with relegation from Division 1 in the first season under new owner Ron Noades and this is where the club stayed until it achieved promotion via the play-offs in 1988–89. The club also reached the 1990 FA Cup Final, drawing 3–3 with Manchester United. It lost the replay 1–0. The club built on the success of the previous season in 1990–91 by achieving its highest league finish of 3rd and returning to Wembley to win the Zenith Data Systems Cup, beating Everton 4–1 in the final, its only cup win to date. The following season started promisingly with Palace lying in third place with two games in hand on the clubs above it. However, following a programme on Channel Four called &quot; Great Britain United &quot;, the then Chairman Ron Noades made disparaging comments about the work ethic of the club&apos;s black players, although he denied this and insisted that his comments had been taken out of context. The fall-out soon saw Ian Wright, the club&apos;s talismanic striker, leaving to join Arsenal and the season fizzled out into an anti-climax with Palace finishing 10th. However this allowed the club to become a founding member of the first season of the FA Premier League in 1992–93. Crystal Palace fans protest – and await anxiously for news – outside the Lloyds HQ in London on 1 June 2010 The damage from the previous season had been done there were few replacements coming into the squad and Palace went from being a mid-table team to one battling against relegation. Despite an opening day six-goal thriller against Blackburn Rovers which ended in a 3–3 draw, the players who had served the club so well wanted to move on, among them 1989–90 club player of the year Mark Bright. The club battled through the season and, despite having a purple patch in December, looked to have done enough as a 3–1 victory over Ipswich Town left Palace comfortably on 49 points. The only club that could catch them was Oldham Athletic, which had three games remaining and was 8 points adrift. Oldham Athletic then beat Liverpool and Aston Villa to set up a final day showdown with Southampton while Palace went to Highbury to face Arsenal. Former player Ian Wright scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win while Oldham beat Southampton to condemn The Eagles to relegation. The club immediately returned to the FA Premier League in the following season after the resignation of manager Steve Coppell. Alan Smith, Coppell&apos;s assistant at the club, took over but he was unable to keep the club up and it was relegated once again (Smith immediately departed the club at this time). Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of Ray Lewington and latterly Dave Bassett &apos;s managership Palace reached the play-offs. Although ultimately unsuccessful against Leicester City in the final, Coppell (now first-team manager following Bassett&apos;s departure to Nottingham Forest in early 1997) was successful in taking the club back to the FA Premier League at the second time of asking when the club defeated Sheffield United in the same end-of-season showdown at Wembley. However, in true yo-yo club fashion the club was relegated back to the First Division for the 1998–99 season. This began worrying times for the club as it was plunged into administration when owner Mark Goldberg was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/289590.stm The Company File: Palace on the rocks 3 March 1999 BBC News 26 August 2009 ] The next owner was entrepreneur Simon Jordan, who had made his money as an owner of Pocket Phone Shop. The club spent much of its time in the Championship over the next 10 years with a brief spell in the Premier League during 2004/05, but the club went straight back down on the last day of the season after drawing at local rivals Charlton Athletic. Jordan was unable to put the club on a sound financial footing after 2008, and the club was subject to transfer embargoes. Palace was placed in administration once again in January 2010, owing Jordan himself around £20m. The Football League &apos;s regulations saw the Eagles deducted ten points, and they were forced to sell key players including Victor Moses and José Fonte. Survival in The Championship was only secured on the final day of the season after a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday. During the close season CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans successfully negotiated the purchase of the club stadium. Led by Steve Parish, the vocal representative for a consortium that included Jeremy Hosking, CPFC 2010 eventually secured a deal for the football club itself, with Parish becoming chairman. Crucially, CPFC 2010 also secured the freehold of the ground, the consortium paying tribute to a fans&apos; campaign which helped pressure Lloyds bank into selling the ground back to the club. The consortium swiftly installed George Burley as the Eagles&apos; new manager. { Crystal Palace appoint George Burley as new boss BBC Sport, 17 June 2010 } However a poor start to the season led to the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December. On 1 January 2011, after a 3–0 defeat to Millwall, Burley was sacked and his assistant Dougie Freedman named caretaker manager. Freedman was appointed manager on a full-time basis on 11 January 2011, with former Charlton boss Lennie Lawrence as his assistant. Soon after, on 10 February, it was announced that former Palace legend Tony Popovic was returning to the club as first team coach. This represented a major re-shuffle to help to push Palace away from the drop. Palace edged up the table and by securing a 1–1 draw at Hull on 30 April, the club was safe from relegation with one game of the season left. [ Club Crest ] Since Crystal Palace formed in 1905, they have had a total of 9 official club crests as well as a 2005 centenary badge. 1935-1937 1964-1966 1967-1972 1972-1973 1987-1994 1994-2013 (current) In 2010 after the most recent administration spell, new owners CPFC 2010 revealed they plan to change the club crest to save the club money and a new club crest should be in place for the 2013-14 season. 6 crests were revealed and only 3 have progressed for further testing, these are crest A, crest B and crest E.

Its present capacity is 26 309 and is located in the London suburb of South Norwood in the Borough of Croydon. Crystal Palace National Sports Centre was the first home of Crystal Palace. In 1905, the owners wanted a professional club to play at the venue, so a new Crystal Palace FC, was formed. It was previously the home of the original Crystal Palace football club from 1861. It also hosted the FA Cup final from 1895 to 1914 as well as other sports. It was forced to leave the National Sports Centre by the military in 1914 as it was to be used for World War I purposes. Palace then moved to the Velodrome which was temporarily the home of Crystal Palace F.C. from 1914 until 1918. In 1918, the club moved to The Nest opposite Selhurst Station. In 1924 the club built a new ground, Selhurst Park, which is still its home today. The record attendance in Selhurst Park was achieved in 1979, when 51 801 people saw Crystal Palace defeat Burnley 2–0 to clinch the Second Division championship. On 20 January 2011, Palace owners CPFC 2010 unveiled plans for a new stadium in Crystal Palace Park – its original home. If the plans succeed, the club will build an all-seater stadium able to hold between 25 000 and 40 000 spectators, depending on the club&apos;s position at the time of building. The stadium would include an aquatic centre and a separate running track and could be ready by 2015. [ Supporters and rivalries ] [ South London derby ] Crystal Palace has a number of rivalries. The most prominent rivalries are with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Charlton and Millwall. In an extensive census on FootballFansCensus.com in December 2003, the surveyed fans placed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion as the main rival of Crystal Palace, followed by Millwall and then Charlton Athletic. [ http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf Derbies FootballFansCensus December 2003 2 August 2010 PDF ] As of the 2012–13 season, Charlton, Crystal Palace and Millwall will all play in The Championship, the first time all three clubs have been in the same league in sixteen years. The 1995–96 season in Division One was the last time all three were in the same division. Millwall finished 22nd and were relegated to Division Two, while Palace and Charlton finished 3rd and 6th respectively. They met in a play-off semi-final, which Palace won to progress to the final. [ Brighton rivalry ] Palace and Brighton are over 40 miles apart and their rivalry did not develop until Palace&apos;s relegation to the Third Division in 1974. The clubs had two of the division&apos;s biggest followings, communications between Croydon and Brighton were good and many fans were keen to travel to an away fixture. The rivalry reached a climax when the two teams were drawn together in the First Round of the FA Cup in 1976. The first game took place on 20 November at the Goldstone Ground, and Rachid Harkouk came off the bench to score a stunning equaliser and take the match to a replay after a 2–2 draw. Back at Selhurst Park the replay ended up 1–1, with Rachid Harkouk scoring the goal. This meant a second replay being held at Stamford Bridge. The second and final replay ended 1–0 to Palace, with Phil Holder grabbing the only goal but only after a disputed Brian Horton penalty miss. Horton had scored with his first attempt, but the referee ordered the kick to be retaken, due to a Palace player encroaching on the box, which he missed. Brighton supporters and Brighton manager Alan Mullery were understandably outraged, with Palace fans not surprisingly jubilant. Alan Mullery disparaged Palace fans, an act never forgotten by fans of that time, and made his appointment as manager a few years later all the more surprising. However, the two did not play in a league encounter between 1988 and 2002, leading to a lull in the rivalry, and Palace fans turning their attentions to neighbours Millwall during the 1990s. However, the return of Brighton to the second tier saw Brighton lose to Palace 5–0 in a memorable game with Andrew Johnson scoring a hat-trick. Brighton gained revenge in 2005 with a 1–0 win at Selhurst Park, however, a month later at the Withdean, Palace twice came from behind, with Dougie Freedman scoring his 100th goal and Jobi McAnuff scoring in the last minute to win the game 3–2. On Brighton&apos;s return to the championship on 2011–12, Palace again came from behind to win 3–1 with three goals in the final ten minutes.
