(protonated pyrimidine) ] Pyrimidine is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound similar to benzene and pyridine, containing two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3 of the six-member ring. [ Gilchrist, Thomas Lonsdale; Gilchrist, T. L. Heterocyclic chemistry Longman New York 1997 0-582-27843-0 ] It is isomer ic with two other forms of diazine : Pyridazine, with the nitrogen atoms in positions 1 and 2; and Pyrazine, with the nitrogen atoms in positions 1 and 4. [ Chemical properties ] A pyrimidine has many properties in common with pyridine, as the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring increases the ring pi electron s become less energetic and electrophilic aromatic substitution gets more difficult while nucleophilic aromatic substitution gets easier. An example of the last reaction type is the displacement of the amino group in 2-aminopyrimidine by chlorine { Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 4, p.182 (1963); Vol. 35, p.34 (1955) Link } and its reverse. { Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 4, p.336 (1963); Vol. 35, p.58 (1955) Link } Reduction in resonance stabilization of pyrimidines may lead to addition and ring cleavage reactions rather than substitutions. One such manifestation is observed in the Dimroth rearrangement. Compared to pyridine, N-alkylation and N-oxidation is more difficult, and pyrimidines are also less basic : The pKa value for protonated pyrimidine is 1.23 compared to 5.30 for pyridine. Pyrimidine is also found in meteorites, but scientists still do not know its origin. Pyrimidine also photolytically decomposes into uracil under UV light.

Astrobiology 9 7 683–695 2009 19778279 10.1089/ast.2008.0324 2009AsBio...9..683N ] [ Organic synthesis ] Pyrimidines can also be prepared within the laboratory by organic synthesis. One method is the classic Biginelli reaction. Many other methods rely on condensation of carbonyl s with amine s for instance the synthesis of 2-Thio-6-methyluracil from thiourea and ethyl acetoacetate { Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 4, p.638 (1963); Vol. 35, p.80 (1955) Link } or the synthesis of 4-methylpyrimidine with 4,4-dimethoxy-2-butanone and formamide. { Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.794 (1973); Vol. 43, p.77 (1963) Link } A novel method is by reaction of certain amide s with carbonitrile s under electrophilic activation of the amide with 2-chloro-pyridine and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride { Single-Step Synthesis of Pyrimidine Derivatives Mohammad Movassaghi and Matthew D. Hill } { J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 2006; 128(44) pp 14254–14255; (Communication) } [ 10.1021/ja066405m ] : Pyrimidine Synthesis Movassaghi 2006 [ Nucleotides ] Three nucleobase s found in nucleic acid s, cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U), are pyrimidine derivatives: Chemical structure of cytosine Chemical structure of thymine Chemical structure of uracil In DNA and RNA, these bases form hydrogen bond s with their complementary purine s. Thus, in DNA, the purines adenine (A) and guanine (G) pair up with the pyrimidines thymine (T) and cytosine (C), respectively. In RNA, the complement of adenine (A) is uracil (U) instead of thymine (T), so the pairs that form are adenine : uracil and guanine : cytosine. Very rarely, thymine can appear in RNA, or uracil in DNA. Other than the three major pyrimidine bases presented, some minor pyrimidine bases can also occur in nucleic acids. These minor pyrimidines are usually methylated versions of major ones and are postulated to have regulatory functions. { Nelson David L. and Michael M. Cox. Principles of Biochemstry, ed. 5. W.H. Freeman and Company (2008) p. 272–274. } These hydrogen bonding modes are for classical Watson-Crick base pair ing. Other hydrogen bonding modes ( &quot; wobble pairings &quot; ) are available in both DNA and RNA, although the additional 2&apos;-hydroxyl group of RNA expands the configurations, through which RNA can form hydrogen bonds.
