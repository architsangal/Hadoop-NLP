[ History ] The city of Lipscomb was first incorporated on June 30, 1910, and was named for L. Y. Lipscomb, one of three brothers who first settled in the area in 1885. As early as the 1880s, the community was called Wheeling and the town had 200-300 residents by 1906. The community was originally named after Wheeling, West Virginia because the owners of Woodward Iron Company, who employed many of the residents, also had business interests in that state.Y. L. Lipscomb ran a general store on the old South Bessemer car line which opened in 1890, though the first settlers actually came to the area in the 1830s, when Vincent Loveless established his farm in the area. The first church was established in the area in June, 1834 when a log structure was built named Union Baptist Church which sat on the site of the present church. { The Birmingham District, An Industrial History and Guide, page 209, published 1981, Marjorie L.
