The franchise centers on a series of dramatic fantasy and science-fantasy tactical role-playing adventure video games, which consist of tactical wargame and dating sim elements, but includes a motion picture, anime, printed media, and other merchandise. The series began in 1996 as an eponymous video game; the game was a success and spawned sequels. The video game series has since branched into other genres and platforms, such as portable game s and games for mobile phones. The original storyline, said to be inspired by the Shochiku Revue and Takarazuka Revue, { Interview with Ouji Hiroi, partially translated at the Takarazuka Revue Community LiveJournal page.

It follows the adventures of an all-female secret task force known as the Imperial Assault Force — Flower Division as they defend the Imperial Capital Tokyo against evil. They are led by Ichiro Ogami, a newly graduated male Imperial Navy Ensign who had been assigned to the squad partly due to his unique ability to use a special type of armor, about which it was previously believed that only women possessing high levels of spiritual powers could operate. The setting eventually moved on to other locations such as Paris and New York. The various OVA tie-ins, the animated TV series, and the motion picture were licensed in North America by ADV Films, Funimation, and Geneon (previously Pioneer Entertainment). The manga version, previously serialized in Kodansha &apos;s Magazine Z and now in Magazine Great, [ http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-01-26/5-manga-to-continue-after-magazine-z-end 5 Manga to Continue after Magazine Z&apos;s End 2009-03-05 ] is also released in English by Tokyopop.

Although the alternate timeline&apos;s history is similar to that of the real world, a crucial difference lies in technology, where most of the benefits of today&apos;s modern era are made possible in the early 1900s with the effective utilization of steam. In particular, the Imperial Capital Tokyo, also known as the Teito (the capital), stood at the forefront of that period&apos;s technological revolution. This was thanks in part to the company called Kanzaki Heavy Industries, who were considered world-leaders in steam-powered machinery. [ When you say Japan, you must be talking about Kanzaki Heavy Industries. They&apos;re the world leaders in steam-powered machinery. They&apos;ve always fascinated me! Kohran Sakura Taisen: Ouka Kenran, Act 1, &quot; The Demon Wars Begin Again &quot; ] On Taishō 7 (1918), an event known as &quot; The Kouma War &quot; took place, where a huge demon appeared at Nihonbashi in Tokyo. It was eventually sealed away by the Imperial Army &apos;s Counter-Demon Team, but their success came at a huge cost. Due to this incident, an internationally approved effort was made to secure Tokyo from future spiritual threats, [ After all, the Capital Defense Program’s approval was globally unanimous, and it was the first program to bring so many countries together. Hanakoji Sakura Taisen: Ouka Kenran, Act 1, &quot; The Demon Wars Begin Again &quot; ] thus the formation of the Imperial Capital Defense Program and the Imperial Assault Force. To increase the defenses of those who would be enlisted by the new organization to fight against demons, part of the preparations involved the development of a dual-powered steam/spirit armor by Kanzaki Heavy Industries. While experiments were being made on a prototype called &quot; Oobu &quot;, only a young girl bearing high levels of spiritual power was shown to have been capable of moving it, giving birth to the misconception that only women could operate the armor. The center of the top secret corps was hidden underneath a theater in the heart of Ginza called the [ Grand Imperial Theater 大帝国劇場 Dai Teikoku Gekijō ]. Here, the women of the Imperial Assault Force — Flower Division lived and worked undercover as actors performing theatrical plays under the alias &quot; Imperial Opera Troupe, &quot; or &quot; Imperial Revue &quot;. { The Japanese words for } [ &quot; Imperial (Floral) Assault Force &quot; 帝国華撃団 Teikoku Kagekidan ] { and } [ &quot; Imperial Opera Troupe &quot; 帝国歌劇団 Teikoku Kagekidan ] { are pronounced the same way, and only the characters used in writing are different, resulting in a clever } { pun. Thus, the Flower Division performs as one during the day, and &quot; changes characters &quot; come time for battle. The term &apos;revue&apos;, &quot; which is a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance and sketches &quot;, was used in a number of official song titles, in both title and lyrics. } The reasoning behind this was both spiritual and mental: song and dance were considered to be traditional methods that could suppress evil, [ Classic Japanese dance was used as part of a ritual of offering to the gods, or to do away with evil spirits.

An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player&apos;s destiny in the game is not predetermined, character interaction plays a major role. The player&apos;s interaction with the game dramatically influences the storyline and the ending, as the player nurtures relationships between certain characters, their performance in battle will also improve and the strength of their attacks soars. This means that the game&apos;s social elements are closely tied to the battle system. Sakura Wars carved out a whole new genre for itself; it&apos;s the first in gaming history to combine elements of dating simulation and strategy. [ 2009 RPG Fan Reviews http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/sakurataisen/Sakura_Taisen.html May 9 ] The story for the main video games are told in an episodic format, each with its own eyecatch es and next episode previews, emulating the feeling of watching a Japan ese anime. Eyecatches provide the player with the only way to properly track and save his progress, and are often used to indicate a switch between the game&apos;s two main gameplay modes, though this is not always the case. [ Adventure mode ] Adventure mode allows the player to control the male squad leader of the assault force the game is focused upon. By visiting certain locations within a building or a city, he may interact with various characters by a real-time system known as the Live Interactive Picture System (LIPS). LIPS presents the player with options to choose from during conversations and events, where the player must make a choice within a certain time limit, or choose not to respond at all by not making a choice within that time. Choices made, including not having made a decision at all, adds or deducts &quot; trust points &quot; from the characters involved. These points have various effects throughout the game, including shaping the player&apos;s relationship with the rest of the cast, affecting their performance in battle, and ultimately, deciding the ending scene of the game. [ Sakura Wars ~So Long My Love~ Interview RPGamer 2010 http://www.rpgamer.com/games/sakura/sakura5/sakura5int.html 2011-03-30 ] Corresponding chimes will sound if the player losses or gains trust points when answering to a prompt, sometimes there won&apos;t be any chime when picking a choice, this indicates that the player has chosen a &quot; neutral &quot; response that does not have any effect on the character&apos;s trust. A similar type of conversation system later appeared in a more recent action role-playing game published by Sega, Alpha Protocol. [ Alpha Protocol Has A Touch Of Sakura Wars http://www.siliconera.com/2010/03/17/alpha-protocol-has-a-touch-of-sakura-wars/ Siliconera 7 March 2012 Spencer March 17, 2010 ] Later Sakura Wars games introduced several variations to the LIPS system. These include Analog LIPS, which the player can raise the action gauge up or down depending on the situation; Double LIPS, which gives the player a longer amount of time to make decisions; and Stick LIPS, where the player can manipulate the analog stick to raise a gauge depending on the situation. [ Battle mode ] In the first two Sakura Wars games, the battle mode gameplay is similar to that of tactical role-playing game s. The player gives commands to all attack squad members piloting a spirit armor in a square-based grid. Commands are arranged in groups, and only two commands from different groups can be issued for each turn. Beginning with Sakura Wars 3, this had since evolved into a gridless action-point based combat scheme known as Active and Real-time Machine System (ARMS). In ARMS, a unit can move as far and attack as many as its action points would allow it, although some orders are still limited to once per turn. [ Sakura Wars 3 RPGFan Sumire Kanzaki http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/sakurataisen3/Sakura_Taisen_3-2.html 2011-05-21 ] This type of combat system would later be the basis for Valkyria Chronicles, developed by much of the same team.

A unit performs better if the pilot has a higher trust rating for the squad leader and performs worse if the pilot has a low trust for the squad leader. If an attack squad member&apos;s unit is destroyed in battle, she is removed from the battlefield, and the player loses trust points with her. If the squad leader&apos;s unit is destroyed, or if the player fails to meet the given requirements, the game is over. [ A Long Day ] Before the main menu is shown, the game searches for a system file. If found, the player is asked to load the file; else, he is prompted to create one. Although optional, system files can be loaded into succeeding games in the series for continuity purposes. They also compile various events encountered by the player, such as movie files and mini-games, and provides access to this collection in a mode known as &quot; A Long Day &quot;. The mode appears on the main menu after the player saves into the system file for the first time. It allows the player to browse through the different items the system file has collected by visiting various locations in a limited area, similar to adventure mode, with each place having a particular use.
