R. R. Tolkien &apos;s The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955). It was followed by The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003), based on the second and third volumes of The Lord of the Rings. Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins ( Elijah Wood ). The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. Released on 10 December 2001, the film was highly acclaimed by critics and fans alike, especially as many of the latter judged it to be the most sufficiently faithful adaptation of the original story out of Jackson&apos;s film trilogy. It was a major box office success, earning over $870  million worldwide, and the second highest-grossing film of 2001 in the U.S. and worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone ) which made it the 5th highest-grossing film ever at the time. Today it is the 26th highest-grossing worldwide film of all time. It won four Academy Award s and five BAFTAs, including Best Film and Best Director BAFTA awards. The Special Extended Edition was released to DVD on November 12, 2002 and to Blu-ray on June 28, 2011. In 2007, The Fellowship of the Ring was voted number 50 on the American Film Institute &apos;s list of 100 greatest American films. The AFI also voted it the second greatest fantasy film of all time during their AFI&apos;s 10 Top 10 special.

Upon learning that the Ring belonged to Sauron, the Wizard Gandalf the Grey warns Frodo that Sauron&apos;s forces will come for him. Gandalf catches Frodo&apos;s gardener Samwise Gamgee eavesdropping underneath a window and sends him with Frodo to leave the Shire. Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the head of his order, Saruman the White, who reveals that Sauron&apos;s servants, the Nazgûl, have been sent to capture the Ring. Saruman reveals himself to be in service to Sauron, and imprisons Gandalf atop his tower. Saruman commands Sauron&apos;s Orcs to construct weapons of war and produce a new breed of Orc fighters: the Uruk-hai. While traveling to Bree, Frodo and Sam are joined by Merry and Pippin, and are nearly captured by the Nazgûl. At the Inn of the Prancing Pony, Frodo meets the mysterious ranger Aragorn, who hides them from their pursuers and agrees to lead them to Rivendell. During the journey they are attacked by the Nazgûl. Aragorn fights off the creatures, but Frodo is wounded by their morgul blade, which will turn him into a wraith. While chased by the Nazgûl, Frodo is saved by the Elf Arwen who uses her magic to summon a surge of water that sweeps away the pursuing Nazgûl. Arwen takes Frodo to Rivendell where he is healed by her father, Elrond. Gandalf escapes Saruman&apos;s tower with the aid of Gwaihir the eagle and travels to Rivendell. Elrond calls a council of the races still loyal to Middle-Earth to decide what should be done with the Ring. It is revealed that the Ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, and Aragorn. They are joined by the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, and Boromir, man of Gondor, to form the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship set out but are hindered by Saruman&apos;s magic. They travel through the dwarf Mines of Moria. Inside, they find that Orcs have overrun the mines and slain the Dwarves; they also realize that Gollum is following them, determined to reclaim the Ring. The Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, an ancient demon of fire and shadow. Gandalf confronts the Balrog, allowing the others to escape, but both Gandalf and the Balrog fall into an abyss. Mourning Gandalf&apos;s death, the group flees to Lothlórien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, the Elves Galadriel and Celeborn. That night, Galadriel informs Frodo that it is his destiny to destroy the Ring. The Fellowship continue their journey. Meanwhile, Saruman assembles a force of Uruk-hai to hunt the Fellowship. After arriving at Parth Galen, Boromir gives in to the Ring&apos;s corruption and tries to take it from Frodo, believing that it is the only way to save his realm. Frodo manages to escape by wearing the Ring and becoming invisible. Boromir realizes what he has done, and attempts to find Frodo, who decides to continue his journey alone, heeding Galadriel&apos;s warning that the Ring will eventually corrupt the other members of the Fellowship. The Uruk-hai arrive and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli attempt to hold them off while Frodo escapes. Merry and Pippin lead the Orcs away from Frodo and are nearly killed. Boromir tries to save them, but in the process is shot fatally by the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz. The Uruk-Hai capture Merry and Pippin. Aragorn slays Lurtz and tends to a dying Boromir, and promises him that the world of men will not fall. Boromir dies with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas by his side. Sam finds Frodo, who reluctantly lets Sam join him. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin. As Frodo and Sam gaze out at the land before them, they grieve over the others. Frodo says that he is glad that Sam is with him and the two Hobbits set off towards Mordor. [ Cast ] The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli. Before filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson ), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.

He is accompanied on his quest by his best friend and fellow hobbit, Samwise Gamgee. Elijah Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999. Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel. Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey : An Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo, who helps him decide what to do with the Ring. He becomes the leader of the Fellowship after it is decided to take the Ring to Mount Doom and destroy it. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot, while Patrick Stewart turned it down, as he disliked the script. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men. He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films, and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits, instead working with their scale doubles. Sean Astin as Samwise &quot; Sam &quot; Gamgee : A Hobbit gardener and Frodo&apos;s best friend. When caught eavesdropping, Sam is made to become Frodo&apos;s companion and from then on becomes very loyal. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam&apos;s relationship with Frodo. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn : Dubbed Strider, he is a Dúnedain ranger and the heir to the throne of Gondor. He travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor. He is unsure of whether to become King following the failure of his ancestor, Isildur, to destroy the Ring. Nicolas Cage turned down the role because of &quot; family obligations &quot;, while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn. Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young. Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator. Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen&apos;s son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role. Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop. Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume and carrying his &quot; hero &quot; sword around with him offscreen. Sean Bean as Boromir : A prince of the Stewards of Gondor, he journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor, although he is tempted by the power of the Ring. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed. Orlando Bloom as Legolas : Prince of the Elves&apos; Woodland Realm and a skilled archer who accompanies the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham. Billy Boyd as Peregrin &quot; Pippin &quot; Took : A Hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor, along with his best friend Merry. He is a prankster, often being a nuisance for Gandalf. Together with Meriadoc Brandybuck (see below), he serves as a comic relief. Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc &quot; Merry &quot; Brandybuck : A Hobbit and a friend (and distant cousin) of Frodo. He helps him find a raft-ferry to escape the Nazgûl, and later travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor, along with his best friend Pippin. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo. Together with Pippin (see above), he serves as a comic relief. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli : A Dwarf who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. He initially hates Elves, but changes his attitude in the course of the story, particularly after meeting Lady Galadriel. Billy Connolly was considered for the part of Gimli. Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White : The fallen head of the Istari Order, who succumbed to Sauron&apos;s will via his use of the palantír. After capturing Gandalf, he creates an army of Uruk-hai to find and capture the Ring from the Fellowship. Lee is a major fan of the book, and reads it once a year. He has also met J. R. R. Tolkien. He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old. Sala Baker as Sauron : The titular character of the story, who created the One Ring to conquer Middle-earth. He lost the Ring to Isildur, and now seeks it in order to initiate his reign over Middle-earth. He cannot yet take physical form, and is spiritually incarnate as an Eye. Hugo Weaving as Elrond : The Elven master and Lord of Rivendell, who leads the Council of Elrond which ultimately decides to destroy the One Ring. He lost faith in the strength of Men after witnessing Isildur&apos;s failure 3,000 years before. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, &quot; To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable. &quot; Marton Csokas as Celeborn : An Elf and the co-ruler of Lothlórien along with his wife Galadriel. Cate Blanchett as Galadriel : An Elf and the co-ruler of Lothlórien along with her husband Celeborn. She shows Frodo a possible outcome of events in her mirror and gives him the Light of Eärendil. Tilda Swinton was also a possibility to the role, but she turned it down, since she was going to play a similar role as Jadis, the White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Liv Tyler as Arwen : An elf, Arwen escorts Frodo to Rivendell after he is stabbed by the Witch-king. She is the daughter of Elrond, and Aragorn&apos;s lover to whom she gives the Evenstar necklace. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett &amp; Macleane, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role. Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, and bonded most with Bloom. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999. Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins : Frodo&apos;s uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. At Rivendell, he gives Frodo a mithril mail-shirt and his own sword, Sting, which can detect the presence of nearby orcs by emitting a bluish glow. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of &apos;&apos;The Lord of the Rings&apos;&apos;, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance. Sylvester McCoy was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm. Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz : The commander of Saruman&apos;s orc forces who leads the hunt for the Fellowship as they head to Mordor. Craig Parker as Haldir : Leader of The Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien. Mark Ferguson as Gil-galad : An Elven-King and last ruler of Noldor who fought in the War of the Last Alliance. Peter McKenzie as Elendil : High King of Arnor and Gondor who fought in The War Of The Last Alliance and father of Isildur. Killed by Sauron. Harry Sinclair as Isildur : Son of Elendil and ancestor of Aragorn who fought in The War Of The Last Alliance. He got ambushed by Mordor Orcs when The One Ring is passed onto him after he cut off Sauron&apos;s hand with his father&apos;s sword, Narsil during the war. [ Comparison with the source material ] Image showing the inscriptions on the Ring. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the &quot; backbone &quot; of the story. [ From Book to Screen DVD New Line Cinema 2002 ] The prologue condenses Tolkien&apos;s backstory, in which The Last Alliance&apos;s seven year siege of the Barad-dûr is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees. [ Tolkien J.R.R. The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien 978-0-618-05699-6 1981 Houghton Mifflin ] Events at the beginning of the film are condensed or omitted altogether. In the book the time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years, is compressed for timing reasons. [ Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens Director/Writers Commentary DVD New Line Cinema 2002 ] Frodo also spends a few months preparing to move to Buckland, on the eastern border of the shire. This move is omitted and combined with him setting out for Rivendell. Also compressed is the time between Frodo and Sam leaving Bag End and their meeting Merry and Pippin. Characters such as Tom Bombadil are left out to simplify the plot and increase the threat of the Ringwraiths. Such sequences are left out to make time to introduce Saruman, who in the book doesn&apos;t appear until a flashback told at the Council of Elrond. Saruman&apos;s role is enhanced: he is to blame for the blizzard on Caradhras, a role taken from Sauron and/or Caradhras itself in the book. Gandalf&apos;s capture by Saruman is also expanded with a fight sequence. The role of Barliman Butterbur at the Prancing Pony is largely removed for time and dramatic flow. The events at Weathertop were also altered. The location of the fight against the Ringwraiths was changed to the ruins on top of the hill rather than a campsite at its base. When Frodo was stabbed in the book, the party spent two weeks travelling to Rivendell, but in the film this is shortened to less than a week, with Frodo&apos;s condition worsening at a commensurately greater rate. Arwen was given a greater role in the film, accompanying Frodo all the way to Rivendell, while in the book Frodo faced the Ringwraiths alone at the Ford of Bruinen. The character of Glorfindel was omitted entirely and his scenes were also given to Arwen. She was tacitly credited with the river rising against the Ringwraiths, which was the work of her father Elrond with aid from Gandalf in the book. A significant new addition is Aragorn&apos;s self-doubt, which causes him to hesitate to claim the kingship of Gondor. This element is not present in the book, where Aragorn intends to claim the throne at an appropriate time. In the book Narsil is reforged immediately when he joins the Fellowship, but this event is held over until Return of the King in film to symbolically coincide with his acceptance of his title. These elements were added because Peter Jackson believed that each character should be forced to grow or change over the course of the story. Elrond &apos;s character gained an adversarial edge; he expresses doubts in the strength of Men to resist Sauron&apos;s evil after Isildur&apos;s failure to destroy the ring as depicted in the prologue. Jackson also shortens the Council of Elrond by spreading its exposition into earlier parts of the film. Elrond&apos;s counsellor, Erestor —who suggested the Ring be given to Tom Bombadil —was completely absent from this scene. Gimli&apos;s father, Glóin, was also deemed unnecessary. The tone of the Moria sequence was altered. Although in the book the Fellowship only realises the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin &apos;s tomb, the filmmakers chose to use foreshadowing devices instead. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf&apos;s reticence, and also reveals an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria. [ Rejina Doman Can Hollywood Be Restrained? Hollywood Jesus 7 January 2008 http://live.hollywoodjesus.com/?p%3D1313 31 January 2008 ] In terms of dramatic structure, the book simply ends; there is no climax, because Tolkien wrote the &quot; trilogy &quot; as a single story published in three volumes. Jackson&apos;s version incorporates the first chapter of &apos; &quot; The Two Towers &quot; and makes its events, told in real time instead of flashback, simultaneous with the Breaking of the Fellowship. This finale is played as a climactic battle, into which he introduces the Uruk-hai referred to as Lurtz in the script. In the book, Boromir is unable to tell Aragorn which hobbits were kidnapped by the orcs before he dies. From there, Aragorn deduces Frodo&apos;s intentions when he notices that a boat is missing and Sam&apos;s pack is gone. In the film, Aragorn and Frodo have a scene together in which Frodo&apos;s intentions are explicitly stated. [ Production ] Jackson began working with Christian Rivers to storyboard the trilogy in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth. [ Russell Gary Gary Russell The Art of the Two Towers Harper Collins 2003 8 0-00-713564-5 ] Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, to think of Middle-earth in a historical manner. [ Designing Middle-earth DVD New Line Cinema 2002 ] In November, Alan Lee and John Howe became the primary conceptual designers for the film trilogy, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as Rivendell, Isengard, Moria and Lothlórien, giving art nouveau and geometry influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively. [ Big-atures DVD New Line Cinema 2002 ] Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath, he focused working on armour having studied it all his life. { Sibley (2001), p.90 } Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department&apos;s designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations. On 1 April 1999, Ngila Dickson joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, ageing and wearing them out for impression of age.

One noticeable illusion that appears in almost every scene involves setting a proper scale so that the characters are all the correct height. Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo, is 5  ft 6in (1.68  m) tall in real life, but the character of Frodo Baggins is barely four feet in height. Many different tricks were used to depict the hobbits (and Gimli the Dwarf) as being of diminutive stature. (In a happy coincidence, John-Rhys Davies  — who played Gimli  — is as tall compared to the Hobbit actors as his character needed to be compared to theirs, so he did not need to be filmed separately as a third variation of height, and is quite taller than Orlando Bloom, who played Legolas.) Large and small scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would look as though the short Hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers&apos; surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion. For the battle between the Last Alliance and the forces of Sauron that begins the film, an elaborate CGI animation system, called MASSIVE, was developed by Stephen Regelous; it allowed thousands of individual animated &quot; characters &quot; in the program to act independently. This helped give the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The &quot; Making of &quot; Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy. The digital creatures were important due to Jackson&apos;s requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface was scanned from large maquette s before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gary Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire. [ Score ] [ Music of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ] The musical score for the Lord of the Rings films was composed by Howard Shore. It was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, The London Philharmonic Orchestra, The London Voices, and featured several vocal soloists. Two original songs, &quot; Aníron &quot;, and the end title theme &quot; May It Be &quot;, were composed and sung by Enya, who allowed her label, Reprise Records, to release the soundtrack to this and its two sequels. In addition to this, Shore composed &quot; In Dreams &quot;, which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.
