[ For the food products made from gluten, see Wheat gluten (food). ] Sources of gluten. Top: High-gluten wheat flour. Right: European spelt. Bottom: Barley. Left: Rolled rye flakes. Gluten (from Latin gluten, &quot; glue &quot; ) is a protein composite found in foods processed from wheat and related grain species, including barley and rye. It gives elasticity to dough, helping it to rise and to keep its shape, and often giving the final product a chewy texture. Gluten is the composite of a gliadin and a glutelin, which is conjoined with starch in the endosperm of various grass-related grains. The prolamin and glutelin from wheat ( gliadin, which is alcohol-soluble, and glutenin, which is only soluble in dilute acids or alkalis) constitute about 80% of the protein contained in wheat seed. Being insoluble in water, they can be purified by washing away the associated starch. Worldwide, gluten is a source of protein, both in foods prepared directly from sources containing it, and as an additive to foods otherwise low in protein. The seeds of most flowering plant s have endosperms with stored protein to nourish embryonic plants during germination. True gluten, with gliadin and glutenin, is limited to certain members of the grass family. The stored proteins of maize and rice are sometimes called glutens, but their proteins differ from gluten. [ Extraction ] Gluten is extracted from flour by kneading the flour, agglomerating the gluten into an elastic network, a dough, and then washing out the starch. Starch granules disperse in cold water, and the dispersed starch will be sedimented and dried. If a saline solution is used instead of water, a purer protein is obtained, with certain harmless impurities going into solution with the starch. Where starch is the prime product, cold water is the favored solvent because the impurities stay with the gluten. In home or restaurant cooking, a ball of wheat flour dough is kneaded under water until the starch disperses out. In industrial production, a slurry of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass. This mass is collected by centrifugation, then transported through several stages integrated in a continuous process. [ http://www.westfalia-separator.com/applications/renewable-resources/wheat-starch-wheat-gluten.html Wheat Starch and Wheat Gluten GEA Westfalia Separator Group 19 October 2011 ] Approximately 65% of the water in the wet gluten is removed by means of a screw press; the remainder is sprayed through an atomizer nozzle into a drying chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature a short time to evaporate the water without denaturing the gluten. The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is air cooled and pneumatically transported to a receiving vessel. In the final step, the collected gluten is sifted and milled to produce a uniform product. [ http://www.barr-rosin.com/applications/wheat.asp Wheat GEA Barr-Rosin 8 September 2009 ] [ Uses ] { Wheat, a prime source of gluten } Fried gluten balls [ Bread products ] Gluten forms when glutenin molecule s cross-link to form a sub-microscopic network attached to gliadin, which contributes viscosity (thickness) and extensibility to the mix. [ Woychick JH et al. http://www.friedli.com/research/PhD/gluten/chap2.html The Gluten Proteins and Deamidated Soluble Wheat Protein 8 September 2009 ] If this dough is leavened with sugar, fermentation produces carbon dioxide bubbles, which, trapped by the gluten network, cause the dough to rise. Baking coagulates the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes the shape of the final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the staling of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration. { Sahlstrom, S. &amp; Brathen, E. (1997). &quot; Effects of enzyme } { preparations for baking, mixing time and resting time on } { bread quality and bread staling &quot;. Food Chemistry, 58, 1, } { 75-80. Effects of wheat variety and processing conditions } { in experimental bread-baking studied by univariate and } { multivariate analysis. } The development of gluten (i.e., enhancing its elasticity) affects the texture of the baked goods. Gluten&apos;s attainable elasticity is proportional to its content of glutenins with low molecular weights as this portion contains the preponderance of the sulfur atoms responsible for the cross-linking in the network.

[ http://www.bakersassist.nl/processing5-2.htm Baking Technology, Bread Bakersassist 2007-08-14 ] Generally, bread flour s are high in gluten (hard wheat); pastry flours have a lower gluten content. Kneading promotes the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked product that is chewier in proportion to the length of kneading. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development, [ http://www.bakersassist.nl/processing5-2.htm Baking Technology, Bread Bakersassist 2007-08-14 ] and very wet doughs left to rise for a long time require no kneading (see no-knead bread ). Shortening inhibits formation of cross-links and is used, along with diminished water and less kneading, when a tender and flaky product, such as a pie crust, is desired. The strength and elasticity of gluten in flour is measured in the baking industry using a farinograph. This gives the baker a measurement of quality for different varieties of flours in developing recipes for various baked goods. [ Added gluten ] Gluten, when dried and milled to a powder and added to ordinary flour dough, improves a dough&apos;s ability to rise and increases the bread&apos;s structural stability and chewiness. { Amendola, J., Rees, N., &amp; Lundberg, D. E. (2002). } { Understanding Baking. } Gluten-added dough must be worked vigorously to induce it to rise to its full capacity; an automatic bread machine or food processor may be required for kneading. { Echkardt, LW &amp; Butts, DC. (1997). Rustic European Breads from your Bread Machine } The added gluten provides supplemental protein to products with low or nonexistent protein levels. [ Imitation meats ] [ Wheat gluten (food) the use of gluten in cooking ] Gluten, especially wheat gluten, is often the basis for imitation meats resembling chicken, duck ( mock duck ), fish, pork and beef. When cooked in broth, gluten absorbs some of the surrounding liquid (including the taste) and becomes firm to the bite. [ Added to other foods ] The &quot; Codex Alimentarius &quot; international standard s for food labeling has a standard relating to the labeling of products as &quot; gluten-free &quot;, but this standard does not apply to foods that &quot;...in their normal form do not contain gluten. &quot; [ http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/291/CXS_118e.pdf Codex Alimentarius Codex Standard For &quot; Gluten-Free Foods &quot; CODEX STAN 118-1981 February 22, 2006 PDF ] Gluten is used as a stabilizing agent in products like ice cream and ketchup, where it might be unexpected.
