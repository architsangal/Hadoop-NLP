It is a form of vasculitis. The name ( giant cell arteritis) reflects the type of inflammatory cell involved [ one/000008441 giant cell arteritis ] as seen on a biopsy. The terms &quot; giant-cell arteritis &quot; and &quot; temporal arteritis &quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, because of the frequent involvement of the temporal artery. However, it can involve other large vessels (such as the aorta in &quot; giant-cell aortitis &quot; [ Walter MA, Melzer RA, Graf M, Tyndall A, Müller-Brand J, Nitzsche EU [18F]FDG-PET of giant-cell aortitis Rheumatology (Oxford) 44 5 690–1 2005 May 15728420 10.1093/rheumatology/keh551 http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D15728420 ] ). Giant-cell arteritis of the temporal artery is referred to as &quot; temporal arteritis, &quot; and is also known as &quot; Cranial arteritis &quot; and &quot; Horton&apos;s disease. &quot; [ James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al.

In 76% of cases involving the eye, the ophthalmic artery is involved causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. [ Hayreh Ocular Manifestations of GCA http://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/dept/GCA/04-ocular.htm April 3, 2003 University of Iowa Health Care 2007-10-15 ] Loss of vision in both eyes may occur very abruptly and this disease is therefore a medical emergency. [ Associated conditions ] The disorder may coexist (in one quarter of cases) with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which is characterized by sudden onset of pain and stiffness in muscles ( pelvis, shoulder ) of the body and is seen in the elderly. GCA and PMR are so closely linked that they are often considered to be different manifestations of the same disease process. Other diseases related with temporal arteritis are systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and severe infection s. [ Diagnosis ] [ Physical exam ] Palpation of the head reveals prominent temporal arteries with or without pulsation. The temporal area may be tender. Decreased pulses may be found throughout the body Evidence of ischemia may be noted on fundal exam. [ Laboratory tests ] LFTs, liver function tests, are abnormal particularly raised ALP- alkaline phosphatase Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an inflammatory marker, &gt; 60  mm/hour (normal 1–40  mm/hour). C-reactive protein, another inflammatory marker, is also commonly elevated. Platelets may also be elevated. [ Biopsy ] The gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis is biopsy, which involves removing a small part of the vessel and examining it microscopically for giant cell s infiltrating the tissue. Since the blood vessel s are involved in a patchy pattern, there may be unaffected areas on the vessel and the biopsy might have been taken from these parts. Unilateral biopsy of a 1.5–3  cm length is 85-90% sensitive (1  cm is the minimum). [ Br J Surg 98 11 1556–1560 November 2011 Ypsilantis E, et al. Importance of specimen length during temporal artery biopsy 10.1002/bjs.7595 21706476 ] So, a negative result does not definitely rule out the diagnosis. Thus, currently biopsy is only considered confirmatory for the clinical diagnosis, or one of diagnostic criteria. [ Imaging studies ] Radiological examination of the temporal artery with ultrasound yields a halo sign.Contrast enhanced brain MRI and CT is generally negative in this disorder.Recent studies have shown that 3T MRI using super high resolution imaging and contrast injection can non-invasively diagnose this disorder with high specificity and sensitivity.

Steroids do not prevent the diagnosis from later being confirmed by biopsy, although certain changes in the histology may be observed towards the end of the first week of treatment and are more difficult to identify after a couple of months. [ Font RL, Prabhakaran VC Histological parameters helpful in recognising steroid-treated temporal arteritis: an analysis of 35 cases The British journal of ophthalmology 91 2 204–9 2007 16987903 10.1136/bjo.2006.101725 1857614 ] The dose of prednisone is lowered after 2–4 weeks, and slowly tapered over 9–12 months. Tapering may require two or more years.
