[ July 2010 ] { Oregon Country Fair in } { Veneta, Oregon } [ Toplessness ] Topfreedom is a cultural and political movement seeking to advance gender equality by the recognition of the right of women and girls to be topless in public on the same basis that men and boys are permitted to be barechested. In addition, topfreedom advocates seek recognition of the right of nursing mothers to openly breastfeed in public, and of women to sun bathe topless. The Topfree Equal Rights Association (TERA) also assists women in Canada who have been charged for being topless, while GoTopless organizes demonstrations in the United States to protest against the legal and public attitude to the inequality. In Sweden, Bara Bröst is active in advancing topfreedom, as is Topless Front in Denmark. [ Social and legal attitudes ] [ Indecent exposure Public indecency ] Legally, many jurisdictions treat the public display of women&apos;s breasts as indecent exposure or as public indecency. However, in about 2000, the Topfree Equal Rights Association was formed in Canada to challenge the legality of prosecutions in that country. TERA does not itself promote toplessness, but endeavors to help women who are prosecuted merely for being topless in public, and seeks to change public attitudes to the exposure of women&apos;s breasts. TERA seeks the recognition of the right of women to be bare chested on an equal basis, should they individually choose to exercise it. TERA claims several successes in persuading courts in North America to overturn prosecutions on the basis of sex discrimination, arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his. Successful cases include the District of Columbia in 1986, New York State in 1992, Columbus, Ohio in 1995, Ontario, Canada in 1996, Moscow, Idaho in 1998, and Maine in 1998. [ 10 successful court cases http://www.gotopless.org/news.php?item.3.1 Gotopless.org 26 August 2009 ] GoTopless.org was formed in 2007 in the United States, and claims that women have a constitutional right in the United States to be bare chested in public places on the same basis as men. Unlike TERA, which does not organise demonstrations, GoTopless organises protests in favor of recognition of women&apos;s top freedom rights. [ National GoTopless Protest day http://www.gotopless.org Gotopless.org 26 August 2009 ] GoTopless is affiliated with Raëlism; TERA is not affiliated with any other organization. { Exposing the « cover-up » for what it is ! } In several countries in Europe non-sexual toplessness is not illegal. However, private or public establishments can establish a dress code which requires women to wear tops, and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards. Topless swimming and sunbathing on beaches have become common in many parts of Europe, though the practice remains controversial in many places, and not common in most places. Many public swimming pools are owned by municipalities, which are treated as private organisations. [ Breastfeeding ] [ Breastfeeding in public ] In many countries around the world, breastfeeding in public is not unusual. During 2006-2010 and earlier, a number of news reports in the United States cited incidents where women were refused service or harassed for breastfeeding in public. In response, a majority of U.S. states have passed laws explicitly permitting nursing in public.

[ Attitudes to topfreedom ] A society&apos;s attitude to toplessness depends to some extent on the context in which it appears. It may be more readily accepted, for example, in the context of topless sunbathing than, say, walking down the street.

[ Sweden ] In Sweden, toplessness is not illegal. However, private or public establishments are permitted to establish dress code s which may require women to wear tops, and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards. In September 2007, &quot; Bara Bröst &quot; (a pun meaning both &quot; Just Breasts &quot; and &quot; Bare Breasts &quot; ) appeared to promote topless equality in these semi-public facilities.
