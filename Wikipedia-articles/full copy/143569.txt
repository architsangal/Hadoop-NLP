In the 2001 census it had a usually resident population of 1,818. There is a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest, including the only location in Great Britain where prehistoric mummies have been found. The population is about 70% Roman Catholic. The island, in common with the rest of the Hebrides, is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland. In 2006 South Uist, and neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay were involved in Scotland&apos;s biggest community land buyout to date. In the north west there is a missile testing range. Its inhabitants are known in Gaelic as &quot; Deasaich &quot; (Southerners). [ Geography and geology ] { Our Lady of the Isles } The west is machair (fertile low-lying coastal plain) with a continuous sandy beach whilst the east coast is mountainous with the peaks of Beinn Mhòr [ 620 m ft 0 ] and Hecla [ 606 m ft 0 ].The main village on the island is Lochboisdale (Loch Baghasdail), from which ferries sail to Oban on the mainland and to Castlebay (Bàgh a&apos; Chaisteil) on Barra. The island is also linked to Eriskay and Benbecula by causeway s. Smaller settlements include Daliburgh (Dalabrog), Howmore (Tobha Mòr) and Ludag. South Uist has a bedrock of Lewisian Gneiss, [ http://maps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyviewer_google/googleviewer.html Geology of Britain viewer Maps.bgs.ac.uk 2011-07-13 ] [ http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/undergrad/fieldwork/image/assynt/assynt/astrat.htm Assynt Stratigraphy Es.ucl.ac.uk 2011-07-13 ] high grade Regional Metamorphism dating back to 2900  million years ago in the Archaean. Some show Granulite facies metamorphism, but most are the slightly lower temperature Amphibolite facies. These formed part of the Earth’s deep ancient crust, left here when the North Atlantic was formed. These are the oldest rocks in the British Isles today and they have been brought to the surface by tectonic movements. They now bear the scars of the last glaciation which has exposed them. &quot; South Uist Machair &quot; on the west coast is one of 40 National Scenic Area s in Scotland. { &quot; National Scenic Areas &quot;. SNH. Retrieved 30 Mar 2011. } [ History ] South Uist was clearly home to a thriving Neolithic community. The island is covered in archaeological sites including chambered tombs, Beaker sites, a Bronze Age hoard, roundhouses, brochs, cairns, ogham inscriptions, Viking settlements, medieval longhouses and post-medieval industry. After the Norse occupation, South Uist was held by the MacDonalds of Clanranald until 1838 when Colonel Gordon of Cluny bought the island and initiated Highland Clearances to make way for sheep farming, supplanting the crofters with farmers from the Borders, who brought Blackface sheep flocks. The population of South Uist fell from a total of 5093 in 1841 to its present level of 2285. As a result there was large scale emigration from the island. { South Uist:Archaeology and History of a Hebridean Island. Pearson, Shaples, Symonds. 2004. ISBN 978-0-7524-2905-2 } Lochboisdale became a major herring port later in the nineteenth century. The island is one of the last surviving strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland and the crofting industries of peat cutting and seaweed gathering are still an important part of everyday life. [ Economy ] Tourism is important to the island&apos;s economy and attractions include the Kildonan Museum housing the sixteenth century Clanranald Stone and the ruins of the house where Flora MacDonald was born. South Uist is home to the Askernish Golf Course. The oldest course in the Outer Hebrides, Askernish was designed by Old Tom Morris, who also worked on the Old Course at St. Andrews. The Askernish course existed intact until the 1930s, but was partly destroyed to make way for a runway, abandoned, and ultimately lost. Its identity remained hidden for many years before its apparent discovery, a claim disputed by many locals. { cybergolf.com re Askernish course.

After a protracted campaign South Uist residents took control of the island on 30 November 2006 in Scotland&apos;s biggest community land buyout to date. The previous landowners, a sporting syndicate, sold the assets of the [ 92000 acre km2 2 ] estate for £4.5  million [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6195966.stm Land buyout reality for islanders BBC News 2009-08-10 30 November 2006 4 January 2010 ] to a Community Company known as Stòras Uibhist which was set up to purchase the land and to manage it in perpetuity. { Stòras Uibhist } { &apos;&apos;Islanders pay £4.5m to be rid of feudal lairds&apos;&apos; The Independent newspaper.

(19 January 2007) Broadford. West Highland Free Press. } The proposal for community ownership has received the overwhelming support of the people of the islands who look forward to participating in the opportunity to regenerate the local economy, to reverse decline and depopulation, to reduce dependency while remaining aware of the environmental needs, culture and history of the islands. The company name Stòras Uibhist symbolises hope for the future wealth and prosperity of the islands. [ Missile testing ] In the north west of the island at ( [ 57 20 N 07 20 W region:GB_type:isle inline ] ), a missile testing range was built in 1957-58 to launch the Corporal missile, Britain and America&apos;s first guided nuclear weapon. This development went ahead despite significant protests, some locals expressing concern that the Scottish Gaelic language would not survive the influx of English-speaking army personnel. The British Government claimed that there was an &apos;overriding national interest&apos; in establishing a training range for their newly purchased Corporal, a weapon that was to be at the front line of Cold War defence. The Corporal missile was tested from 1959 to 1963, before giving way to Sergeant and Lance tactical nuclear missiles. The &apos;rocket range&apos; as it is known locally has also been used to test high altitude research rockets, Skua and Petrel. The range is still owned by the MoD operated by QinetiQ as a testing facility for missile systems such as the surface-to-air Rapier missile and Unmanned Air Vehicles { QinetiQ: Hebrides Operations } [ http://www.qinetiq.com/home/defence/test_and_evaluation/tande_services/singlesitefacilities/hebrides_facilities/hebrides_operations.html August 2009 ] In 2009 the MOD announced that is was considering running down its missile testing ranges in the Western Isles, [ Ross, John 31 July 2009 In 1930, the last islanders left.

[ Nature reserve ] [ Flora and fauna of the Outer Hebrides ] { machair on South Uist } Loch Druidibeg in the north of the island is a National Nature Reserve owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage. The reserve covers 1,677  hectares of machair, bog, freshwater loch s, estuary, heather moorland and hill. { SNH Loch Druidibeg Retrieved 29 July 2007. } Over 200 species of flowering plants have been recorded on the reserve, some of which are nationally scarce. South Uist is considered the best place in the UK for the aquatic plant Slender Naiad (Najas flexilis) { JNCC Slender Naiad report Retrieved 29 July 2007. } which is a European Protected Species. Nationally important populations of breeding waders are also present, including redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The reserve is also home to greylag geese on the loch and in summer corncrake s on the machair. Otter s and hen harrier s are also seen. There has been considerable controversy over hedgehog s on South Uist. The animals are not native to the islands, having been introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests. It is claimed they pose a threat to the eggs of ground nesting wading birds on the island. In 2003 the Uist Wader Project - headed by Scottish Natural Heritage - began a cull of hedgehogs in the area. Following a campaign and concerns over animal welfare, this cull was called off in 2007, instead hedgehogs are being captured and translocated to mainland Scotland. { Epping Forest Hedgehog Rescue Retrieved 1 January 2007. } [ Ross, John 21 February 2007 Hedgehogs saved from the syringe as controversial Uist cull called off Edinburgh The Scotsman http://news.scotsman.com/hedgehogs/Hedgehogs-saved-from-the-syringe.3348351.jp 2009-08-10 ] [ Campaign wins reprieve for Uist hedgehogs Paul Kelbie http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/campaign-wins-reprieve-for-uist-hedgehogs-437050.html The Independent 2007-02-20 ] [ Archaeology ] { Beinn Mhòr on the left, and } { Hecla on the right. } The SEARCH project (Sheffield Environmental and Archaeological Research Campaign in the Hebrides) on South Uist has been developing a long-term perspective on changes in settlement and house form from the Bronze Age to the 19th century.
