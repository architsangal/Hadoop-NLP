I-39 was built in the 1980s and 1990s. In Illinois, the route has a total length of [ 140.82 mi km 2 ]. [ Illinois Technology Transfer Center http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html T2 GIS Data Illinois Department of Transportation November 8, 2007 2006 ] In Wisconsin, I-39 has a distance of 182  mi (293  km). With the exception of an eight-mile (13  km) segment around Portage, the Interstate shares a route with at least one other route number in the state. From Illinois to Portage, I-39 is concurrent with I-90. I-94 joins the pair in Madison until Portage. From Portage northward, US 51 is co-signed with the interstate. At [ 29 mi km ] in length, this concurrency of three Interstates is the longest in the country. [ Route description ] |-|IL|141|227|-|WI|182|293|-|Total|323|520|} [ Illinois ] { Minonk, Illinois. April 2012. } In Illinois, I-39 begins from Interstate 55 north of the Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, area alongside of Route 251. It runs north largely through rural areas from the city of Normal. About [ 55 mi km 0 ] north of the city, I-39 crosses the Illinois River over the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge, which is [ 2170.8 m mi 1 ] long.

North of I-80, the wind turbines of the Mendota Hills Wind Farm can be seen from milepost 72 at Mendota north to near Paw Paw. Further north I-39 runs along the south and east sides of Rockford, concurrent with U.S. 20. The interstate joins the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway and Interstate 90 near Cherry Valley, during which there is a toll booth in South Beloit. U.S. 51 leaves I-39/90 in South Beloit, while I-39/90 continue north into Wisconsin. For all but [ 1 mi km 0 ] that Interstate 39 is in Illinois, it is designated concurrently with U.S. Route 51. The southern terminus of I-39 is less than [ 1 mi km 0 ] from Interstate 74 as it runs around Normal. [ Wisconsin ] Interstate 39, along with U.S. 51, in northern Wisconsin I-39 enters from Illinois along with I-90, passing under Stateline road, and bypasses Beloit to the east. East of the town, the route has a cloverleaf interchange that serves as the terminus for both WIS 81 – which heads westward into Beloit – and I-43, which provides access to Milwaukee. The I-39/90 concurrency continues to the north and is joined by WIS 11 about 7  mi (11  km) north of the I-43 interchange. The route bypasses Janesville to the east, although interchanges with US 14 (where WIS 81 leaves the concurrency) and WIS 26 provide access to the town. The route continues generally to the north, crossing the Rock River before having an interchange with WIS 59 that provides access to Edgerton to the west.

It is joined by US 51 and serves as the southern terminus of WIS 73. US 51 leaves the route 4  mi (6  km) to the north, about 7  mi (11  km) east of Stoughton. The Interstate gradually turns westward around Utica to an interchange with CTH N. It then turns gradually back to the north and interchanges with US 12 and US 18 in Madison. I-39 and I-90 bypass Madison to the east, and I-94 joins the concurrency at the eastern terminus of WIS 30, an interchange known as the Badger Interchange.

The last two Madison area interchanges are US 51 three miles (5  km) northwest of the US 151 interchange and WIS 19 another mile northwest of the US 51 interchange.

The highway crosses the Wisconsin River four miles (6  km) north of CTH CS. At three miles (5  km) further along the route from the river, I-39 leaves the concurrency with I-90 and I-94 and turns northward while the other two interstates turn northwest. WIS 78 terminates at this interchange and heads southwest. This is the starting point of the segment of freeway that carries the I-39 route alone. The interstate crosses WIS 33, the first of three interchanges accessing Portage, two miles (3  km) north of I-90/I-94. After crossing the Wisconsin River again, I-39 crosses the second interchange - this one with WIS 16 and turns northeast to an interchange with US 51. The US route joins the Interstate and both turn north once again and leave the Portage area and, after four miles (6  km), enter Marquette County.

The three highways pass along Buffalo Lake and encounter a south-side half interchange with CTH D in the town of Packwaukee. WIS 23 leave the concurrency to the east at WIS 82 near Oxford. and the freeway takes a due north route to pass Westfield. I-39/US 51 enters Waushara County six miles (10  km) north of Westfield.

The WIS 54 interchange and the CTH B interchange a mile and a half north of it provide access for Plover. The next four interchanges - CTH HH, US 10 Eastbound / WIS 66 Westbound, Stanley Street and Business US 51 provide access to Stevens Point.

An initial request was made for a north-south highway from South Beloit, Wisconsin to Salem, Illinois. and in 1956, legislation provided funding for the highway. However, the project was deemed a low priority and was shelved. During 1962 there were 531 crashes along U.S. 51 between Rockford and Decatur, with 11 fatlities. In 1969, the Illinois legislation started prompting the need for a highway in this corridor and the project was revived. When I-39 was being planned in the mid-1970s, it was to run from U.S Route 20 in Rockford to Interstate 57 near Salem, but only the area between Rockford and Decatur got the high priority funding. [ Illinois Deparment of Transportation http://www.midwestroads.com/illinois/il%20supp%20fwy.pdf PDF Priority Primary Routes April 12, 1978 March 23, 2010 ] Due budgetary difficulties, I-39 only made it to Bloomington. U.S 51 was instead upgraded to a four-lane divided expressway between Bloomington and Decatur, with some traffic lights. When traveling on Interstate 72, between mileposts 139 and 140, one can see embankments for an expressway interchange that was never constructed, which was supposed to be where I-39 was to merge. At one time there were pavement stubs leading onto the embankments but they have since been removed. Interstate 39 was considered at one point for the unbuilt Peoria-to-Chicago Highway. I-39 was established in 1984 on the section from Illinois Route 5 (now called Interstate 88 ) in Rochelle, to U.S. Route 20 in Rockford. [ http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-039.html Interstate 39 11 January 2009 Interstate Guide AA Roads (Self-published) July 29, 2008 ] I-39 was completed south from Route 5 to I-80 in 1986. By December 1987, construction on the section of I-39 between I-80 and Illinois Route 251 was finished. The next section, between Illinois Route 251 and Interstate 55 in Bloomington, opened in 1992, completing the southern part of I-39.

US 51 between Bloomington and Decatur has been improved to be a 4-lane divided highway with minimal stops. In Wisconsin, the route was officially designated in 1992.

However, this part of the highway was not marked as I-39 for another four years, primarily because the Wisconsin Highway Department had to reconstruct the interchange connecting I-90 and I-94 with Wisconsin Highway 78 near Portage. Signs denoting I-39 were placed along the highway in Wisconsin until 1996, when the section between Portage and Rothschild, Wisconsin (near Wausau) received its signs. This occurred after then Governor Tommy Thompson designated the stretch between Portage and Wausau in 1996 after a five-year push to get the interstate designation approved.
