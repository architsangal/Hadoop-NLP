[ the US newspaper strip Dennis the Menace Dennis the Menace (disambiguation) ] [ September 2007 ] [ Dennis the Menace Image:Dennisketcham.jpg Hank Ketcham Marcus Hamilton Ron Ferdinand March 12, 1951 present DailyINK Fantagraphics Books ] Dennis the Menace is a daily syndicated newspaper comic strip originally created, written and illustrated by Hank Ketcham. It debuted on March 12, 1951 in 16 newspapers [ http://www.dennisthemenace.com/ Dennis the Menace Website Dennisthemenace.com 2010-04-30 ] and was originally distributed by Post-Hall Syndicate. [ http://www.toonopedia.com/dennis.htm Don Markstein&apos;s Toonopedia: Dennis the Menace entry Toonopedia.com 2010-04-30 ] It is now written and drawn by Ketcham&apos;s former assistants, Marcus Hamilton and Ron Ferdinand, and distributed to at least 1,000 newspapers in 48 countries and 19 languages by King Features Syndicate. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/02/obituaries/02KETC.html?ex%3D1196053200%26amp%3Ben%3D3fcf74bbd8d829ed%26amp%3Bei%3D5070 2001-06-02 Hank Ketcham, Father of Dennis the Menace, Dies at 81 2007-11-24 The New York Times Lawrence Van Gelder ] [ October 2010 H3llBot ] The comic strip usually runs for a single panel on weekdays and a full strip on Sundays. The comic strip became so successful that it was adapted to many other kinds of popular media, including several television shows, both live-action and animated; and several feature film s, including theatrical and direct-to-video releases. [ Characters and setting ] Dennis the Menace takes place in a middle-class suburban neighborhood in Wichita, Kansas. [ The Mitchell family ] Dennis Mitchell - a precocious but lovable, freckle-faced five-and-a-half-year-old boy with a famous blond cowlick and a penchant for mischief. His long-suffering parents can only shake their heads and try to explain their son&apos;s antics to others. Despite this, they really do love him very much. Dennis&apos; wide-eyed curiosity, his well-meaning attempts to help, his innocent, matter-of-fact bluntness and his youthful energy and enthusiastic nature always seem to lead to trouble wherever he goes (most often at Mr. Wilson&apos;s expense). He wears a blue/black striped shirt, tennis shoes, and red overalls with pockets that are sometimes filled with snakes, frogs, or his slingshot. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer, ketchup, mud puddles and TV Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Henry Mitchell - Dennis&apos; father is a workaday aerospace engineer. Henry seems to understand Dennis more than his wife does in affairs of the heart. One example was when a furious Dennis stormed in saying, &quot; Wimmin can say some of the stupidest things! &quot;; Henry knowingly said to Alice, &quot; Margaret. &quot; Also, while on an outing with Dennis&apos; friend Gina, Alice asked if Dennis would eventually come to know that he likes Gina. Henry, again knowingly, said, &quot; I think he already does. &quot; Like his creator Hank Ketcham, Henry served in the US Navy. Sometimes, he and Alice will get into arguments (which even showed his chauvinistic side at times), but they remain devoted to each other. Alice Mitchell, née Johnson - Dennis&apos; stay-at-home mother Alice is usually the reassuring figure Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. As a running gag, Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag involves Dennis&apos; ever-changing parade of new babysitters. No one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis&apos; misbehavior by having him sit in the corner in a rocking chair for timeout, although a couple of times she has instituted tougher discipinary measures such as spanking, where Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity. Ruff - Dennis&apos; big, lovable, faithful dog (an Airedale mix) and best pal. Ruff is always eagerly following him around, accompanying him while Dennis is running, riding his bike or his skateboard. Hot Dog - Dennis&apos; rarely seen cat, who usually commiserates with him while he sits in the corner and reflects on his wrongdoings. Grampa Johnson (Oliver &quot; Swede &quot; Johnson) - Alice&apos;s father who spoils Dennis often. He evokes the unintentional jealousy of Mr. Wilson, for he gets to see Dennis only on occasion, but Mr. Wilson sees him all the time. Because they are so much alike, Dennis and Grampa Johnson get along beautifully. Mr. Wilson also thinks that Johnson should act his age, but this advice is often ignored. To Grampa, life is worth living and he encourages Dennis to live it to the fullest. [ The Wilsons ] George Everett Wilson Sr. - Dennis&apos;s cranky, cantankerous middle aged next-door neighbor; a retired postal carrier and (at least as far as Dennis is concerned) his best human friend. Dennis likes Mr. Wilson but unintentionally annoys him, as he regularly disrupts Mr. Wilson&apos;s attempts at a serene, quiet life. Dennis often interrupts Mr. Wilson&apos;s hobbies such as gardening, as well as coin and stamp collecting, at times accidentally damaging his property. As a result, the gruff old retiree displays a less-than-cordial attitude towards the young boy, though Dennis continues his well-meaning intrusions unabated. Actually, as many readers suspected, he is secretly fond of Dennis and misses him when he&apos;s away - although he&apos;d never openly admit it. Mr. Wilson is named after a teacher Hank Ketcham knew. Dennis will often (especially in the TV series) refer to him as &quot; Good Ol&apos; Mr. Wilson &quot;. Martha Wilson - Mr. Wilson&apos;s engaging wife, who adores Dennis. Mrs. Wilson freely dotes on him and plies him with freshly baked cookies and milk. Martha sees Dennis as a surrogate grandson. Earl Wilson - Mr. Wilson&apos;s Estranged Son. George Wilson Jr. - Mr. Wilson&apos;s Son. Tammy Wilson - Mr. Wilson&apos;s Daughter. Edna Wilson - George Jr.&apos;s Wife. George Wilson III - Mr. Wilson&apos;s Grandson. Will Wilson - Mr. Wilson&apos;s Grandson. Helga Wilson - Mr. Wilson&apos;s Granddaughter. [ Dennis&apos;s friends ] [ http://www.fantagraphics.com/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Bdo_pdf%3D1%26amp%3Bid%3D977 Dennis the Menace - Introduction by Brian Walker Brian Walker Fantagraphics Books 9 February 2010 ] Tommy Anderson - Dennis&apos;s best friend (after Mr. Wilson). This character eventually disappeared from the strip. Joey McDonald - loyal, timid and not too bright (but he&apos;s a year younger), he usually plays the sidekick to Dennis&apos;s schemes, and sees him as a big brother figure. Dennis often gives him advice, and gives him little &quot; nuggets &quot; of wisdom and insight. Margaret Wade - a freckled, red-haired, bespectacled know-it-all whose cloying and self-important demeanor is always getting on Dennis’s nerves. She is attracted to Dennis and is stubbornly confident in the belief that she will marry him when they are adults, but he will have none of it because Dennis clearly has no interest in her. She always tries to improve Dennis and his manners, but only succeeds in annoying him. She has a certain amount of dislike for Gina, whom she sees as her competition. Gina gains Dennis&apos;s respect and admiration by just being herself and Margaret&apos;s pretensions fail to make a mark on him. Gina Gillotti - a fiercely independent young Italian American girl, who Dennis is mostly unaware he secretly has a crush on. Gina is tomboyish yet still feminine in appearance. She also likes Dennis in a future romantic way, but unlike Margaret, Dennis actually enjoys being with Gina. He likes her because she is as independent minded as he is, and she enjoys the same things that he does. Gina is also highly aware that she is a girl, and woe betide anyone who doesn&apos;t think so. It is presumed that Gina is the oldest of the kids. Jackson - in the late 1960s, Ketcham decided to add an African American character to the cast named Jackson. Ketcham designed Jackson in the tradition of a stereotypical cartoon pickaninny, with huge lips, big white eyes, and just a suggestion of an Afro hair style. In one cartoon that featured Jackson, he and Dennis were playing in the backyard, when Dennis said to his father, http://i46.tinypic.com/2nhhunr.jpg &quot; I&apos;m havin&apos; some race trouble with Jackson. He runs faster than me. &quot; The attempt to integrate the feature did not go over well. Protests erupted in Detroit, Little Rock, Miami, and St. Louis, and debris was thrown at the offices of the Post Dispatch. Taken aback, Ketcham issued a statement explaining that his intentions were innocent, and Jackson went back into the ink bottle. However, another African American character named Jay Weldon appeared in the 1986 animated series to far less controversy as he was not a stereotype. Cowboy Bob - A film cowboy whom Dennis idolizes. Appears in a series of westerns known as Cowboy Bob films. Dennis fails to realize that westerns are rarely made today and that the films he is seeing are actually re-released from long ago. In one story arc where Dennis&apos; parents invite the retired actor to a party, they have Dennis meet him, to which Dennis comments he must be &quot; Cowboy Bob&apos;s grandpa! &quot; [ History ] [ Inspiration ] The inspiration for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real life son of Hank Ketcham, [ Weinraub Judith Dennis&apos;s&apos; Dear Old Dad The Washington Post 1990-05-05 http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72586949.html?dids%3D72586949%3A72586949%26amp%3BFMT%3DABS%26amp%3BFMTS%3DABS%3AFT%26amp%3Bdate%3DMAY%2B05%2C%2B1990%26amp%3Bauthor%3DJudith%2BWeinraub%26amp%3Bpub%3DThe%2BWashington%2BPost%26amp%3Bdesc%3DDennis%27s%27%2BDear%2BOld%2BDad%3BCartoonist%2BHank%2BKetcham%2C%2BIn%2Ba%2BWorld%2BWithout%2BMenace%26amp%3Bpqatl%3Dgoogle ] who was only four years old when he refused to take a nap and somehow messed up his whole room. Hank tried many possible names for the character, and translated them into rough pencil sketches. But when his studio door flew open and his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, &quot; Your son is a menace! &quot;, [ Van gelder Lawrence Hank Ketcham, Father of Dennis the Menace, Dies at 81 The New York Times 2001-06-02 http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec%3Dhealth%26amp%3Bres%3D9B01E4D8163FF931A35755C0A9679C8B63%26amp%3Bn%3DTop%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FCompanies%2FGoogle%20Inc. 2007-09-17 ] the &quot; Dennis the Menace &quot; name stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham. The Mitchell family of Dennis, Hank/Henry and Alice were all named after the Ketchams. [ Visuals ] Ketcham&apos;s linework has been highly praised over the years. A review on comicbookbin.com states: &quot;...a growing legion of cartoonists, scholars, aficionados, etc. have come to appreciate the artistry of Dennis’s creator, Hank Ketcham. Ketcham’s beautiful artwork defines cartooning elegance. The design, the composition, and the line: it’s all too, too beautiful. &quot; [ Douresseaux Leroy Hank Ketcham&apos;s Complete Dennis the Menace: 1953-1954 (review) comicbookbin.com August 20, 2007 http://www.comicbookbin.com/completedennisthemenace002.html 2008-12-21 ] AV Club reviewer Noel Murray wrote: &quot; Ketcham also experimented with his line a little early on, tightening and thickening without losing the looseness and spontaneity that remains the strip&apos;s best aspect even now. &quot; [ Murray Noel Hank Ketcham&apos;s Complete Dennis The Menace 1951-1952 (review) The Onion&apos;s avlub.com September 28, 2005 http://www.avclub.com/content/node/41135 2008-12-21 ] In 2005, Dennis appeared as a guest for Blondie and Dagwood&apos;s 75th anniversary party in the comic strip Blondie.

[ The Reuben Award 1946 - 1974 The National Cartoonists Society http://www.reuben.org/ncs/archive/divisions/reuben.asp 2007-09-18 ] He also was made honorary mayor of Wichita. He was quoted as saying, &quot; I set the whole thing in Wichita, Kansas, and as a result I got made an honorary mayor of Wichita. &quot; [ Biography for Hank Ketcham http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0450477/bio 2007-09-18 ] [ UK Dennis the Menace ] [ Dennis the Menace (DC Thomson comics) Dennis the Menace (UK) ] Coincidentally, another cartoon strip titled Dennis the Menace was published in the British comic The Beano (dated March 17 - the &quot; off sale &quot; date) in 1951. The comic went on sale several days in advance of the cover date (actually being published up to ten days previously), and therefore predates the debut of Ketcham&apos;s version. { http://www.cracked.com/article_18788_the-5-most-mind-blowing-coincidences-all-time.html } The UK Dennis is quite different in appearance and character, characterised by his red-and-black striped jersey, his dog Gnasher, and his gang of friends. Like the American character, the UK one remains popular to this day and has made the transition to television cartoons. Ketcham&apos;s comic strip was dubbed Just Dennis or The Pickle there to avoid confusion with the native UK version of Dennis the Menace. [ December 2008 ] The television version screened in the UK simply as Dennis. [ Ketcham retires ] Hank Ketcham retired from the comic strip in 1994, turning the production of the strip over to his assistants Ron Ferdinand and Marcus Hamilton. They continued it as a &quot; zombie strip &quot; after Ketcham&apos;s death in 2001, and they still produce it to this day. [ Advertising ] Dennis the Menace has appeared in Dairy Queen marketing from 1971 until 2001, when he was dropped because Dairy Queen felt children could no longer relate to him. [ Comic books ] Dennis the Menace has been published in comic books and comic digests from the 1950s through the 1980s by a variety of publishers, including Standard/Pines (1953–58), Fawcett Comics (1958–80, during their only return to comics after losing the Captain Marvel lawsuit), and Marvel Comics (1981–82). These included both newspaper strip reprints and original Dennis the Menace comic book stories, produced by others besides Ketcham. Al Wiseman, one of Ketcham&apos;s assistants in the 1950s and 60s, worked on many of them. Ron Ferdinand, Ketcham&apos;s Sunday page artist, drew several of the Dennis stories in the Marvel books, including the cover for issue #11. [ Giant series ] The main comic book series (simply named Dennis the Menace) ran in tandem with the “Giant” series. The Dennis the Menace Giant Vacation Special [ http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID%3D11130 The Grand Comics Database (GCD) Comics.org 2010-04-30 ] and Dennis the Menace Christmas Issue [ http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID%3D11248 The Grand Comics Database (GCD) Comics.org 2010-04-30 ] were published by Standard in 1955. Those issues inaugurated the Giants series, which was published by Pines for issues 2-6, [ http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID%3D11131 The Grand Comics Database (GCD) Comics.org 2010-04-30 ] and continued by Hallden/Fawcett for issues 6-75. [ http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID%3D11132 The Grand Comics Database (GCD) Comics.org 2010-04-30 ] The Giant series was later renamed the Dennis the Menace Bonus Magazine Series, which started with issue #76 in 1970. [ http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID%3D11133 The Grand Comics Database (GCD) Comics.org 2010-04-30 ] CBS and Hallden later retitled the series as The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series, which it ran through issue #194 in October 1979. [ Other series ] By October 1979, Fawcett began publishing a separate series of 36 issues entitled Dennis the Menace and Mr. Wilson. By the second issue, the Dennis and Mr. Wilson series was re-christened Dennis the Menace and His Friends which now involved Dennis, Mr. Wilson and friends, Joey, Margaret and dog, Ruff. Because of this, the Mr. Wilson stories were alternated with the three characters as Ruff, Joey and Margaret who each shared a #1 issue with Dennis. There were also other series of Dennis the Menace comic books published in 1961, first there was Dennis the Menace and His Dog, Ruff and Dennis the Menace and His Pal, Joey published the summer and the last but not least was Dennis the Menace and Margaret published in the winter of 1969. In 1972, as part of a bonus magazine series Fawcett published a &quot; Short Stuff Special &quot; where Dennis visited Children&apos;s Fairyland in Oakland, California. [ Bible kids series ] In 1977, Word Books, Inc. commissioned Hank Ketcham Enterprises, Inc. to produce a series of ten comic books under the title Dennis and the Bible Kids, with the usual cast of characters reading (and sometimes partly acting out) the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, Esther, Jesus, and other Biblical characters. These were sold through Christian bookstore s and related outlets. Each issue contained several inspirational renderings by Hank Ketcham himself. [ Marvel series ] The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest and the Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series were revived for a short issue run in 1980.January: The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest #16 February: The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus #10 March: The Dennis the Menace Fun Fest #17 April: The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus #11 After this revival series, the Hallden and CBS comics run came to an end in 1980. Ketcham had half of the comic book rights purchased by Stan Lee and Marvel Comics, so they were able to produce a new series of Dennis the Menace comic books. The new Marvel series started in December, 1981 and ended in November, 1982. The smaller Dennis the Menace comic digests were published continually by Fawcett and Hallden between 1969 and 1980, and they were briefly resurrected in reprints by Marvel in 1982 for a run of three issues. [ &quot; Spider-Kid &quot; ] The seventh issue featured a Spider-Man spoof called “Spider-Kid”. The story featured Dennis arriving at Margaret&apos;s Valentine&apos;s Day party dressed as a pint-sized Spider-Man when asked to come to the party dressed as a &quot; Romantic Hero &quot;. { This description comes from a copy of this comic that this editor personally owns in his collection. } The cover showed Dennis as Spider-Kid jumping from a cloud and unmasking himself.
