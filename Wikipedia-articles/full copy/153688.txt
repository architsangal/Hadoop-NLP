right Well dressing (also once known as well flowering) is a summer custom practised in rural England in which well s, spring s or other water sources are decorated with designs created from flower petal s. The custom is most closely associated with the Peak District of Derbyshire and Staffordshire. { Well Dressing, Historic-UK, accessed August 2009. } { Well Dressing History, Buxton &amp; Derbyshire Peakdistrict, accessed August 2009. } [ History ] The origins of the tradition are alternatively said to lie in pagan tradition or in giving thanks for the purity of the water drawn from certain wells during the period of the Black Death. It has been said to have originated in Tissington, Derbyshire in 1349. { Wirksworth in the 1860s } Well dressing was celebrated in only one or two villages in Derbyshire by the 19th century, and in Buxton it wasn&apos;t introduced until 1840, &quot; to commemorate the beneficence of the Duke of Devonshire who, at his own expense, made arrangements for supplying the Upper Town, which had been much inconvenienced by the distance to St Anne&apos;s well on the Wye, with a fountain of excellent water within easy reach of all &quot;. [ Buxton well dressing of 1856 Anon 28 April 1858 The Derby Mercury 19 April 2010 Derby, UK ] Similarly, well dressing was revived at this time in Youlgreave, to celebrate the supplying of water to the village &quot; from a hill at some distance, by means of pipes laid under the stream of an intervening valley &quot;, largely due to the support of a &quot; Miss Bowman &quot;. [ Well dressing Anon 10 August 1842 The Derby Mercury 20 April 2010 Derby, UK ] With the arrival of piped water the tradition was adapted so that, not only wells but also taps were decorated, although the resulting creations were still advertised as well dressings. { 1860s picture, PictureThePast, accessed August 2009. } According to William Hone, writing in 1835: Rhodes, who has traversed almost every part of the peak with indefatigable zeal, gives the following account in his Peak Scenery. &quot; An ancient custom still prevails in the village of Tissington, to which indeed it appears to be confined, for I have not met with any thing of a similar description in any other part of Derbyshire. It is denominated well-flowering, and Holy Thursday is devoted to the rites and ceremonies of this elegant custom. The day is regarded as a festival; and all the wells in the place, five in number, are decorated with wreaths and garlands of newly-gathered flowers, disposed in various devices. Sometimes boards are used, which are cut to the figure intended to be represented, and covered with moist clay into which the stems of the flowers are inserted to preserve their freshness; and they are so arranged to form a beautiful mosaic work, often tasteful in design, and vivid in colouring; the boards thus adorned are placed in the spring, that the water appears to issue from among the beds of flowers. On this occasion the villagers put on their best attire and open their houses to their friends. There is a service at the church, where a sermon is preached: afterwards a procession takes place, and the wells are visited in succession: the psalms for the day, the epistle and gospel are read, one at each well, and the whole concludes with a hymn which is sung by the church singers, and accompanied by a band of music. This done they separate, and the remainder of the day is spent in rural sports and pastimes. &quot; [ http://books.google.com/?id%3DtWMMAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DRA6-PA638%26amp%3Bdq%3Dwell%2Bdressing%26amp%3Bcd%3D2#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dwell%20dressing%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Hone William The Every-day book and Table book: or, Everlasting calandar of popular amusements, sports, pastimes, ceremonies, manners, customs and events 1835 638â€“9 20 April 2010 ] The custom had almost died out altogether by the early years of the 20th century, but was revived in the 1920s and 1930s largely through the efforts of the Shimwell family of Tideswell. [ March 2011 ] The custom has since been revived in numerous villages and small towns in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, South Yorkshire, Cheshire, { Well dressing in Sutton, Cheshire. } and even as far afield as Much Wenlock in Shropshire and Malvern in Worcester. {, Malvern Spa Association]. } Another boost to the tradition was the Festival of Britain; in villages like Wormhill where the custom appears to have ceased in the late 18th century, it was revived as part of the Festival of Britain, and has continued nearly every year since.

A design is sketched on paper, often of a religious theme, and this is traced onto the clay. The picture is then filled in with natural materials, predominantly flower petals and moss es, but also bean s, seed s and small cone s. Wirksworth and Barlow are two of the very few dressings where the strict use of only natural materials is still observed. Each group uses its own technique, with some areas mandating that only natural materials be used while others feel free to use modern materials to simplify production.
