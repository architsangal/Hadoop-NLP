[ Loudon, Marc G. 2002 Organic Chemistry Chemistry of Naphthalene and the Aromatic Heterocycles. Fourth 1135–1136 Oxford University Press New York 0-19-511999-1 ] It is a colourless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air. Substituted derivatives are also called pyrroles, e.g., N-methylpyrrole, C 4 H 4 NCH 3. Porphobilinogen, a trisubstituted pyrrole, is the biosynthetic precursor to many natural products such as heme. [ Cox, Michael; Lehninger, Albert L; Nelson, David R. Lehninger principles of biochemistry Worth Publishers New York 2000 1-57259-153-6 ] Pyrroles are components of more complex macrocycles, including the porphyrin s of heme, the chlorin s, bacteriochlorins, chlorophyll, porphyrinogens. [ The aromatic pathways of porphins, chlorins and bacteriochlorins Jonas Jusélius and Dage Sundholm Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2000 2 2145–2151 10.1039/b000260g Open access 10 ] [ Properties ] Pyrrole has very low basicity compared to conventional amine s and some other aromatic compounds like pyridine. This decreased basicity is attributed to the delocalization of the lone pair of electron s of the nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring. Pyrrole is a very weak base with a pK aH of about −1 to -2. Protonation results in loss of aromaticity, and is, therefore, unfavorable. Like many amines, pyrrole slowly decomposes on exposure to air and light. It turns brown over time due to accumulation of impurities such as polypyrrole and various amine oxide s. It is usually purified by distillation immediately before use. [ Purification of Laboratory Chemicals 5th Armarego, Wilfred, L.F.; Chai, Christina, L.L. 2003 Elsevier 346 ] Impure pyrrole being distilled to separate it from colored impurities Pure pyrrole collected from the still is now colorless and transparent to all wavelengths of visible light due to the removal of impurities [ Synthesis ] Pyrrole is prepared industrially by treatment of furan with ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalyst s. { Albrecht Ludwig Harreus &quot; Pyrrole &quot; in Ullmann&apos;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. } [ 10.1002/14356007.a22_453 ] Synthesis of pyrrole from furan One synthetic route to pyrrole involves the decarboxylation of ammonium mucate, the ammonium salt of mucic acid. The salt is typically heated in a distillation setup with glycerol as a solvent. { Practical Organic Chemistry, Vogel, 1956, Page 837, Link (12 MB) } Synthesis of pyrrole from ammonium mucate [ Substituted pyrroles ] Many methods exist for the organic synthesis of pyrrole derivatives. Classic &quot; named reactions &quot; are the Knorr pyrrole synthesis, the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis, and the Paal-Knorr synthesis. More specialized methods are listed here. The starting materials in the Piloty-Robinson pyrrole synthesis are 2 equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine. [ Piloty, O. Chem. Ber. 1910 43 489 10.1002/cber.19100430182 Synthese von Pyrrolderivaten: Pyrrole aus Succinylobernsteinsäureester, Pyrrole aus Azinen ] [ J. Chem. Soc. 1918 113 639 10.1039/CT9181300639 LIV.—A new synthesis of tetraphenylpyrrole Robinson, Gertrude Maud Robinson Robert ] The product is a pyrrole with specific substituents in the 3 and 4 positions. The aldehyde reacts with the diamine to an intermediate di- imine (R–C=N−N=C–R), which, with added hydrochloric acid, gives ring-closure and loss of ammonia to the pyrrole. In one modification, propionaldehyde is treated first with hydrazine and then with benzoyl chloride at high temperatures and assisted by microwave irradiation : [ Microwave-Assisted Piloty-Robinson Synthesis of 3,4-Disubstituted Pyrroles Benjamin C. Milgram, Katrine Eskildsen, Steven M. Richter, W. Robert Scheidt, and Karl A. Scheidt J. Org. Chem. 2007 72 10 3941–3944 Note 10.1021/jo070389 17432915 1939979 ] Piloty-Robinson reaction Milgram 2007 In the second step, a [3,3] sigmatropic reaction takes place between two intermediates. Pyrrole can be polymerized to form polypyrrole. [ Reactivity ] The NH proton in pyrroles is moderately acidic with a pK a of 16.5. Pyrrole can be deprotonated with strong base s such as butyllithium and sodium hydride. The resulting alkali pyrrolide is nucleophilic. Treating this conjugate base with an electrophile such as methyl iodide gives N-methylpyrrole. Resonance Contributors of Pyrrole The resonance contributors of pyrrole provide insight to the reactivity of the compound. Like furan and thiophene, pyrrole is more reactive than benzene towards electrophilic aromatic substitution because it is able to stabilize the positive charge of the intermediate carbocation. Pyrrole undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution predominantly at the 2 and 5 positions. Two such reactions that are especially significant for producing functionalized pyrroles are the Mannich reaction and the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction (depicted below) [ Comparison of Benzene, Nitrobenzene, and Dinitrobenzene 2-Arylsulfenylpyrroles Jose R. Garabatos-Perera, Benjamin H. Rotstein, and Alison Thompson J. Org.

Formylation of a pyrrole derivative (Garabatos-Perera 2007 ) Pyrroles react with aldehyde s to form porphyrin s. For example, benzaldehyde condenses with pyrrole to give tetraphenylporphyrin. Pyrrole compounds can also participate in cycloaddition ( Diels-Alder ) reactions under certain conditions, such as under Lewis acid catalysis, heating, or high pressure. Pyrrole polymerizes in light. An oxidizing agent, such as ammonium persulfate, can also be used, typically at 0 ºC and in darkness to control the polymerization. [ Commercial uses ] Pyrrole has no significant commercial application other than being used as an additive to cigarettes. N-methylpyrrole is a precursor to N-methylpyrrolecarboxylic acid, a building-block in pharmaceutical chemistry.
