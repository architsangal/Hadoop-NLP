Word of mouth, or viva voce, { http://www.thefreedictionary.com/by+word+of+mouth } is the passing of information from person to person by oral communication. Storytelling is the oldest form of word-of-mouth communication where one person tells others of something, whether a real event or something made up. { http://42explore.com/story.htm } Oral tradition is cultural material and traditions transmitted by word of mouth (orally) from one generation to another. Storytelling and oral tradition are forms of word of mouth that play important roles in folklore and mythology. Another important form of word of mouth is oral history — the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information, based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker. Oral history preservation is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of oral history materials collected by word of mouth, whatever format they may be in. An important area of marketing is called word-of-mouth marketing, which relies on the added credibility of person-to-person communication, a personal recommendation. { http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/term/82660.html } [ Storytelling ] Storytelling often by improvisation or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and in order to instill moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative The earliest forms of storytelling were thought to have been primarily oral combined with gesture storytelling for many of the ancient cultures. The Australian Aboriginal people painted symbols from stories on cave walls as a means of helping the storyteller remember the story. The story was then told using a combination of oral narrative, music, rock art and dance. Ephemeral media such as sand, leaves and the carved trunks of living trees have also been used to record stories in pictures or with writing. Traditionally, oral stories were committed to memory and then passed from generation to generation. However, in Western, literate societies, written and televised media has largely surpassed this method of communicating local, family and cultural histories. Oral storytelling remains the dominant medium of learning in many countries with low literacy rates. [ Oral tradition ] Oral tradition (sometimes referred to as &quot; oral culture &quot; or &quot; oral lore &quot; ) is cultural material and traditions transmitted orally from one generation to another. Vansina, Jan : &quot; Oral Tradition as History &quot;, 1985, James Currey Publishers, ISBN 0-85255-007-3, ISBN 978-0-85255-007-6; at page 27 and 28, where Vasina defines oral tradition as &quot; verbal messages which are reported statements from the past beyond the present generation &quot; which &quot; specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken sung or called out on musical instruments { only &quot;; &quot; There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation &quot;. He points out that &quot; Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge. In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists). &quot; } { Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: &quot; Methodology and African Prehistory &quot;, 1990, UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa; James Currey Publishers, ISBN 0-85255-091-X, 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; &quot; Oral tradition and its methodology &quot; at pages 54-61; at page 54: &quot; Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another. Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted. &quot; } The messages or testimony are verbally transmitted in speech or song and may take the form, for example, of folktales, sayings, ballads, songs, or chants. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledges across generations without a writing system. Sociologists emphasize a requirement that the material is held in common by a group of people, over several generations, and thus distinguish oral tradition from testimony or oral history. { Henige, David. Oral, but Oral What? The Nomenclatures of Orality and Their Implications Oral Tradition, 3/1-2 (1988): 229-38. p 232; Henige cites Jan Vansina (1985). Oral tradition as history. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press } In a general sense, &quot; oral tradition &quot; refers to the transmission of cultural material through vocal utterance, and was long held to be a key descriptor of folklore (a criterion no longer rigidly held by all folklorists). { Degh, Linda. American Folklore and the Mass Media. Bloomington:IUP, 1994, p. 31 } As an academic discipline, it refers both to a set of objects of study and a method by which they are studied { Dundes, Alan, &quot; Editor’s Introduction &quot; to &quot; The Theory of Oral Composition, &quot; } { John Miles Foley. Bloomington, IUP, 1988, pp. ix-xii } -- the method may be called variously &quot; oral traditional theory, &quot; &quot; the theory of Oral-Formulaic Composition &quot; and the &quot; Parry-Lord theory &quot; (after two of its founders). The study of oral tradition is distinct from the academic discipline of oral history, { Henige, David. Oral, but Oral What? The Nomenclatures of Orality and Their Implications Oral Tradition, 3/1-2 (1988): 229-38. p 232; Henige cites Jan Vansina (1985). Oral tradition as history. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press } which is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events. { Oral History } It is also distinct from the study of orality, which can be defined as thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population. { Ong, Walter, S.J., &quot; Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word. &quot; London: Methuen, 1982 p 12 } [ Oral history ] Oral history is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events. Oral history is a method of historical documentation, using interviews with living survivors of the time being investigated. Oral history often touches on topics scarcely touched on by written documents, and by doing so, fills in the gaps of records that make up early historical documents. Oral history preservation is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of oral history materials, whatever format they may be in. { Keakopa, M. (1998). The role of the archivist in the collection and preservation of oral traditions. S.A. Archives Journal, 40,87-93. } [ Word-of-mouth marketing ] Word-of-mouth marketing, which encompasses a variety of subcategories, including buzz, blog, viral, grassroots, brand advocates, cause influencers and social media marketing, as well as ambassador programs, work with consumer-generated media and more, can be highly valued by product, social media and performance marketers. Because of the personal nature of the communications between individuals, it is believed that product information communicated in this way has an added layer of credibility. Research points to individuals being more inclined to believe WOMM than more formal forms of promotion methods; the receiver of word-of-mouth referrals tends to believe that the communicator is speaking honestly and is unlikely to have an ulterior motive (i.e. they are not receiving an incentive for their referrals). { Grewal, R., T.W. Cline, and A. Davies, 2003. Early-Entrant Advantage, Word-of-Mouth Communication, Brand Similarity, and the Consumer Decision-Making Process. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 13(3). } Word-of-mouth depends on the extent of customer satisfaction with the product or service, { Stach, A. and A. Serenko, 2010. The Impact of Expectation Disconfirmation on Customer Loyalty and Recommendation Behavior: Investigating Online Travel and Tourism Services. Journal of Information Technology Management, XX(3), p. 26-41. } and on the degree of its perceived value. { Turel, O., A. Serenko, and N. Bontis, 2010. User Acceptance of Hedonic Digital Artifacts: A Theory of Consumption Values Perspective. Information &amp; Management, 47(1), p. 53-59. } To promote and manage word-of-mouth communications, marketers use publicity techniques as well as viral marketing methods to achieve desired behavioral response. Companies can focus on Brand Advocates, the people who proactively recommend their favorite brands and products online and offline without being paid to do so. { http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/08/us-vcj-zuberance-idUSTRE6A731G20101108 } Influencer marketing is also increasingly used to seed WOMM by targeting key individuals that have authority and a high number of personal connections. Marketers place significant value on positive word-of-mouth, which is traditionally achieved by creating products, services and customer experiences that generate conversation-worthy &quot; buzz &quot; naturally. { Word of mouth advertising: Marketing-made-simple.com } The relatively new practice of word of mouth marketing attempts to inject positive &quot; buzz &quot; into conversations directly. While marketers have always hoped to achieve positive word-of-mouth, intentional marketing relying on such techniques is legislated in some jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, deliberate efforts to generate beneficial consumer conversations must be transparent and honestly conducted in order to meet the requirements of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits &quot; unfair or deceptive acts or practices. &quot; { Laws Enforced by the Federal Trade Commission } To help marketers understand the difference between legitimate and unfair practices, a number of professional organizations have put forward recommendations for ethical conduct. { Word of Mouth Marketing Association Ethics Code } { American Marketing Association Best Practices for Word of Mouth Communications } [ See also ] Communication Oral communication Oral history Oral tradition Storytelling Word-of-mouth marketing Train of thought The Social IQ Klout PeerIndex [ References ] [ 2 ] Category:Communication Category:Human communication Category:History of communication de:Mundpropaganda es:Boca a boca eo:Perbuŝo ko:입소문 마케팅 it:Buzz marketing nl:Mond-tot-mondreclame ja:口コミ no:Jungeltelegrafen pl:Buzz marketing pt:Buzz marketing sv:Mun till mun zh:口口相传
