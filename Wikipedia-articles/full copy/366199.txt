The French zoologist Henri de Blainville first described the species in 1817 from a small piece of jaw — the heaviest bone he had ever come across — which resulted in the name densirostris (Latin for &quot; dense beak &quot; ). { Sharks and Whales (Carwardine et al. 2002), p. 357. } Off the northeastern Bahamas, the animals are particularly well documented, and a photo identification project started sometime after 2002. [ Taxonomy ] Blainville named the species Delphinus densirostris, based on the description of a nine-inch piece of rostrum of unknown origin housed in the Paris Museum. The second specimen, a complete skull sent from the Seychelles by a M. Leduc in 1839, was named Ziphius seychellensis by the English zoologist John Edward Gray in 1846; the French scientist Paul Gervais later placed this specimen in the genus Dioplodon ( &quot; two-toothed &quot; ). { Raven, Henry C. 1942.

An account of the beaked whales of the family Ziphiidae in the collection of the United States National Museum, with remarks on some specimens in other American museums. Washington: Government Printing Office. } [ Physical description ] The body of Blainville&apos;s beaked whale is robust, but also somewhat compressed laterally compared with other mesoplodon ts. The males have a highly distinctive appearance, the jaws overarch the rostrum, like a handful of other species, but does it towards the beginning of the mandible and then sloped down into a moderately long beak. Before the jaw sloped down, a forward-facing, barnacle infested tooth is present. One of the more remarkable features of the whale is the extremely dense bones in the rostrum, which have a higher density and mechanical stiffness than any other bone yet measured. [ Curry J. The design of mineralized hard tissues for their mechanical functions Journal of experimental biology 1999 202 3285–3294 ] At present, the function of these bones is unknown, as the surrounding fat and the brittleness of the bone make it unlikely to be used for fighting. It has been suggested that it may play a role in echolocation or as ballast, but without sufficient behavioral observation, this cannot be confirmed. The melon of the whale is flat and hardly noticeable. Coloration is dark blue/gray on top and lighter gray on the bottom, and the head is normally brownish. Males have scars and cookie cutter shark bites typical of the genus. Males reach at least 4.4 m (14  ft 6 in) and 800  kg (1800 pounds), whereas females reach at least 4.6 m (15&apos;) and 1 tonne (2200 pounds). Juveniles are 1.9 m long (6  ft 4 in) when born and weigh 60  kg (130  lb). [ Population and distribution ] This species of beaked whale is found in tropical and warm waters in all oceans, and has been known to range into very high latitudes. Strandings have occurred off Nova Scotia, Iceland, the British Isles, Japan, Rio Grande do Sul, South Africa, central Chile, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The most common observations take place off Hawaii, the Society Islands, and the Bahamas. The species does not migrate. It inhabits water 1600 to 3000 feet deep. Despite the relatively common nature of the whale, no population estimates are available.

Dives have been measured to at least 22 minutes. When the cetacean surfaces, it does so slowly and with little splashing, research has shown that these whales typically fall silent above 170 meters, probably in order to avoid Orcas from preying on them.
