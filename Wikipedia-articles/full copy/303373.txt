[ Obituary: Lili St Cyr http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990208/ai_n14215654 Lili St Cyr was actually Willis Marie Van Schaack, born in Minneapolis in 1918. She adopted a patronymic of the French aristocracy when first booked as a nude performer in Las Vegas, having studied ballet and worked as a chorus girl. She established her reputation as an ecdysiast with a long tenure at the Gaiety burlesque house in Montreal. As the Montreal Gazette was to recall in 1996 when the theatre re-opened, &quot; That midwinter night in 1944 was the beginning of Lili St. Cyr&apos;s seven-year reign as Montreal&apos;s most famous woman, the city femme fatale, a person whose name invoked sophistication, mystery, sin and - for many males - instant arousal. &quot; Among the innovations she brought to her act was a variation in precedence, emerging on stage in minimal attire then putting her clothes on. She also played various characters in order, she said, to present herself in &quot; interesting roles &quot;. The Independent February 8, 1999 2007-08-21 http://web.archive.org/web/20071210011225/http%3A//findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990208/ai_n14215654 2007-12-10 ] Having taken ballet lessons throughout her youth, she began to dance professionally as a chorus line girl in Hollywood. Unlike other women who have stroke-of-luck stories about being plucked from the chorus line and selected for a feature role, St. Cyr had to beg her manager at the club to let her do a solo act. From her self-choreographed act she eventually landed a bit part at a club called the Music Box in San Francisco, with an act called the Duncan Sisters. [ http://www.clubpinup.com/StCyr/lili_st_cyr1.htm Lili St. Cyr 2007-08-26 Club Pinup ] [ December 2010 ] It was here that she found a dancer&apos;s salary was only a small fraction of what the featured star&apos;s salary was. The difference was that the featured star was nude. From the 1940s and most of the 1950s, St. Cyr with Gypsy Rose Lee and Ann Corio were the most recognized acts in striptease. { Lili St. Cyr - Biography. } { Internet Movie Database. } St. Cyr&apos;s stage name is a patronymic of the French aristocracy, which she first used when booked as a nude performer in Las Vegas. Although more obscure towards the end of her life, her name popped up regularly in 1950s tabloids: stories of her many husbands, brawls over her, and her attempted suicides. St. Cyr was married six times. Her best-known husbands were the motorcycle speedway rider Cordy Milne, musical-comedy actor and former ballet dancer Paul Valentine, restaurateur Armando Orsini, and actor Ted Jordan.

Time March 7, 1955 2007-08-21 ] [ Career ] St. Cyr started her professional career as a chorus line dancer at the Florentine Gardens, in Hollywood. Two years later, her stripping debut was at the Music Box, in an Ivan Fehnova production. The producer had not even seen her perform—her striking looks were what won him over. The act was a disaster. Instead of firing her, Fehnova reconsidered and put together a new act. At the end of the dance, a stagehand would pull a fishing rod attached to St. Cyr&apos;s G-string. It would fly into the balcony and the lights would go dim. This famous act was known as &quot; The Flying G &quot;, and such creative shows would be St. Cyr&apos;s trademark. Over the ensuing years and in a variety of different venues, many of St. Cyr&apos;s acts were memorable, with names like &quot; The Wolf Woman &quot;, &quot; Afternoon of a Faun &quot;, &quot; The Ballet Dancer &quot;, &quot; In a Persian Harem &quot;, &quot; The Chinese Virgin &quot;, as well as &quot; Suicide &quot; (where she tried to woo a straying lover by revealing her body), and &quot; Jungle Goddess &quot; (in which she appeared to make love to a parrot). [ Montreal ] Lili St. Cyr received the title of the most famous woman in Montreal throughout the late 1940s into the 1950s. { Sex and the city } However, Quebec&apos;s Catholic clergy condemned her act, declaring that whenever she dances &quot; the theater is made to stink with the foul odor of sexual frenzy. &quot; { Important Dates in Burlesque History } The clergy&apos;s outcry was echoed by the Public Morality Committee. St. Cyr was arrested and charged with behavior that was &quot; immoral, obscene and indecent. &quot; She was acquitted but the public authorities eventually closed down the Gayety Theatre where she performed. In the 1980s, St. Cyr wrote a French autobiography, &quot; Ma Vie de Stripteaseuse. &quot; In the book, she declared her appreciation for the Gayety Theatre and her love for the city of Montreal. { Lili St. Cyr } [ Hollywood: nightclubs, films and photographs ] While performing at Ciro&apos;s in Hollywood (billed as the &quot; Anatomic Bomb &quot; ), St. Cyr was taken to court by a customer who considered her act lewd and lascivious. In court, St. Cyr insisted to the jury that her act was refined and elegant. As St. Cyr pointed out, what she did was slip off her dress, try on a hat, slip off her brassiere (there was another underneath), slip into a négligée. Then, undressing discreetly behind her maid, she stepped into a bubble bath, splashed around, and emerged, more or less dressed. After her appearance as a witness, as a newspaper account of the time put it, &quot; The defense rested, as did everyone else. &quot; St. Cyr was acquitted. While St. Cyr starred in several movies, an acting career never really materialized. In 1955, with the help of Howard Hughes, St. Cyr landed her first acting job in a major motion picture in the Son of Sinbad. The film, described by one critic as &quot; a voyeur&apos;s delight &quot;, has St. Cyr as a principal member of a Baghdad harem populated with dozens of nubile starlets. The film was condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency. St. Cyr also had a role in the movie version of Norman Mailer &apos;s The Naked and the Dead in 1958. [ Decoded http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C810604%2C00.html The Naked and the Dead, in which Stripper Lili St. Cyr gets about halfway through her act before the cops raid the joint. Time November 3, 1958 2007-08-21 ] In this film, St. Cyr plays &apos;Jersey Lili&apos;, a stripper in a Honolulu night-club and girlfriend of a soldier who boasts to his pals that he has her picture painted inside his groundsheet. Regrettably, heavy edits of St. Cyr&apos;s night-club routine by censors result in some choppy editing in an otherwise finely crafted film. But St. Cyr&apos;s movie career was short lived, and typically she settled for playing a secondary role as a stripper, or playing herself. Her dancing is featured prominently in two Irving Klaw films, Varietease and Teaserama. St. Cyr was also known for her pin-up photography, especially for photos taken by Bruno Bernard, known professionally as &quot; Bernard of Hollywood &quot;, a premier glamor photographer of Hollywood&apos;s Golden Era. Bernard said that she was his favorite model and referred to her as his muse. { Java&apos;s Bachelor Pad: Lili St. Cyr } [ Retirement ] When St. Cyr retired from the stage she began a lingerie business in which she would retain an interest until her death. Similar to Frederick&apos;s of Hollywood, the &quot; Undie World of Lili St. Cyr &quot; designs offered costuming for strippers, and excitement for ordinary women. Her catalogs featured photos or drawings of her modeling each article, lavishly detailed descriptions, and hand-selected fabrics. Her marketing for &quot; Scantie-Panties &quot; advertised them as &quot; perfect for street wear, stage or photography. &quot; St. Cyr spent her final years in obscurity and in seclusion, tending to her cats. [ January 2010 ] [ Death ] She died January 29, 1999 in Los Angeles under her birth name, &quot; Willis Marie VanSchaack &quot;. [ Lili St. Cyr, 80, Burlesque Star Famous for Her Bubble Baths http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9D01E6DE173BF935A35751C0A96F958260 Lili St. Cyr, the tall, blond beauty who left almost nothing to the imagination when she stepped dripping wet out of her signature onstage bubble bath, died on Jan. 29 at her apartment in Hollywood. She was 80. In a field that began when a Syrian beauty who called herself Little Egypt danced her way into legend at the 1893 Chicago World&apos;s Fair, Miss St. Cyr was a master of elegant invention. Her well-choreographed acts included portrayals of famous seductresses, few of whom could hold a candle to Miss St. Cyr.... For all that, her six husbands included a waiter, a dancer, a sometime actor and the restaurateur Armando Orsini, who got his start with financing from Miss St. Cyr.... She is survived by a sister, Rosemary Minsky of Los Angeles. The New York Times February 6, 1999 2007-08-21 ] She had borne no children in any of her marriages. [ Legacy ] After St. Cyr&apos;s death, with a renewed interest in burlesque, and especially in Bettie Page, legions of new fans began rediscovering some of the dancers in Irving Klaw &apos;s photos and movies. During this time, A &amp; E devoted a special to burlesque in 2001 which included a piece on St. Cyr. { It&apos;s Burlesque (2001) (TV) } [ Influences and cultural references ] St. Cyr is famously referenced in two different songs that were both stage and movie musicals. In the song &quot; Zip &quot; from the 1940 musical Pal Joey by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, the singer (reporter/would-be stripper Melba Snyder) rhetorically asks at the climax of the song &quot; Who the hell is Lili St. Cyr? &quot; [I.e., what has she got that I don&apos;t have?]. Meanwhile, in the 1975 musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the final line of the song &quot; Don&apos;t Dream It &quot; (sung by the character Janet Weiss, as played by Susan Sarandon ) is &quot; God bless Lili St. Cyr! &quot; In 1981, actress Cassandra Peterson became famous for her character Elvira, who achieved her trademark cleavage wearing a Lili St. Cyr deep plunge bra. In 1989, one of St. Cyr&apos;s husbands, Ted Jordan, wrote a biography of Marilyn Monroe entitled Norma Jean: My Secret Life with Marilyn Monroe (New York: William Morrow and Company, 1989), in which Jordan claims that St. Cyr and Monroe had a lesbian affair. The claim is widely disparaged by Monroe biographers. Liza Dawson, editor for William Morrow, publisher of the Jordan book, makes a more credible claim in an interview with Newsday in 1989. Dawson stated that &quot; Marilyn very much patterned herself on Lili St. Cyr—her way of dressing, of talking, her whole persona. Norma Jean was a mousy, brown-haired girl with a high squeaky voice, and it was from Lili St. Cyr that she learned how to become a sex goddess. &quot; The song, &quot; Lily Sincere &quot; on the 2009 Kristeen Young album, Music for Strippers, Hookers, and the Odd On-Looker is an homage to Lili St. Cyr. In 2010, Elvis Costello &apos;s title track of his album National Ransom mentions &quot; And Millicent St. Cyr &quot; in its introduction. See liner notes for full lyrics.
