[ the historical person the biographical opera Lucrezia Borgia (opera) ] [ February 2011 ] [ 1480 4 18 y ] { Subiaco, Italy } [ 1519 6 24 1480 4 18 y ] { Ferrara } Lucrezia Borgia ( [ luˈkrɛttsja ˈbɔrdʒa ]; 18 April 1480 – 24 June 1519) was the illegitimate daughter of Rodrigo Borgia, the powerful Renaissance Valencian who later became Pope Alexander VI, and Vannozza dei Cattanei. Her brothers included Cesare Borgia, Giovanni Borgia, and Gioffre Borgia. It is often suggested that Cesare and Lucrezia may have had an incest uous relationship. { The Borgias by Ivan Cloulas, p. 52 } Lucrezia&apos;s family later came to epitomize the ruthless Machiavellian politics and sexual corruption alleged to be characteristic of the Renaissance Papacy. Lucrezia was cast as a femme fatale, a role she has been portrayed as in many artworks, novels, and films. Very little is known of Lucrezia, and the extent of her complicity in the political machinations of her father and brothers is unclear. They certainly arranged several marriages for her to important or powerful men in order to advance their own political ambitions. Lucrezia was married to Giovanni Sforza (Lord of Pesaro), Alfonso of Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie ), and Alfonso I d&apos;Este (Duke of Ferrara). Tradition has it that Alfonso of Aragon was an illegitimate son of the King of Naples and that her brother Cesare may have had him murdered after his political value waned. [ Early life ] [ House of Borgia ] Lucrezia Borgia c. 1494 Lucrezia Borgia was born at Subiaco, near Rome. Her mother was Vannozza dei Cattanei, one of the many mistresses of Lucrezia&apos;s father Rodrigo Borgia, who is better known as Pope Alexander VI. [ Appearance ] She is described as having heavy blonde hair which fell past her knees, a beautiful complexion, hazel eyes which changed colour, a full, high bosom, and a natural grace which made her appear to &quot; walk on air &quot;; { George R. Marek The Bed and the Throne: the Life of Isabella d&apos;Este, } { Harper &amp; Row, 1976, ISBN 978-0-06-012810-4 p.  142 } these were the physical attributes that were highly appreciated in Italy during that period. Another description said that &quot; her mouth is rather large, the teeth brilliantly white, her neck is slender and fair, and the bust is admirably proportioned &quot;. { The Times Arts section page 14, 31 Jan 2011 } One painting, Portrait of a Youth by Dosso Dossi at the National Gallery of Victoria, was identified as a portrait of Lucrezia in November 2008. { NGV&apos;s Renaissance mystery woman revealed, } { The Age, 25 November 2008, retrieved on 25 November 2008. } { Only known painting of Lucrezia Borgia discovered in Australian gallery } { The Times, London, 25 November 2008 } { Infamous Renaissance woman subject of mystery portrait – Australian Broadcasting Corporation 26 November 2008, retrieved on 26 November 2008. } { Gallery unveils portrait of infamy, } { The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 November 2008, retrieved on 26 November 2008. } { Portrait of Renaissance femme fatale Lucrezia Borgia found at NGV, } { The Age, 26 November 2008, retrieved on 26 November 2008. } This painting may be the only surviving formal portrait of Lucrezia Borgia; however, doubts have been cast on that claim. { Art detective says the brother did it, } { The Age, 27 November 2008 } Several other paintings, such as Veneto &apos;s fanciful portrait, have also been said to depict her but none has been accepted by scholars at present. [ Marriages ] [ First marriage: Giovanni Sforza ] [ July 2010 ] On February 26, 1491, a matrimonial arrangement was drawn up between Lucrezia and the Lord of Val D&apos;Ayora in the kingdom of Valencia, Don Cherubino Joan de Centelles, which was annulled less than two months later in favour of a new contract engaging Lucrezia to Don Gaspare Aversa, count of Procida. [ Bellonci Maria Lucrezia Borgia 2000 Phoenix Press London 1-84212-616-4 18 ] When Rodrigo became Pope Alexander VI he sought to be allied with powerful princely families and founding dynasties of Italy. As such, he called off Lucrezia&apos;s previous engagements and arranged for her to marry Giovanni Sforza, a member of the house of Sforza who was Lord of Pesaro and titled Count of Catignola. [ Bellonci Maria Lucrezia Borgia 2000 Phoenix Press London 1-84212-616-4 23 ] Giovanni was an illegitimate son of Costanzo I Sforza and a Sforza of the second rank. He married Lucrezia on June 12, 1493 in Rome. Before long, the Borgia family no longer needed the Sforzas, and the presence of Giovanni Sforza in the papal court was superfluous. The Pope needed new, more advantageous political alliances, so he may have covertly ordered the execution of Giovanni. The generally accepted version is that Lucrezia was informed of this by her brother Cesare, and she warned her husband, who fled Rome. It is possible that Pope Alexander VI never made such an order, and it was a plot on the part of Cesare and Lucrezia to drive her husband away. Regardless, Alexander and Cesare were said to be pleased with the chance to arrange another advantageous marriage for Lucrezia. Alexander asked Giovanni&apos;s uncle, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, to persuade Giovanni to agree to a divorce. Giovanni refused and accused Lucrezia of paternal and fraternal incest. The pope asserted that his daughter&apos;s marriage had not been consummated and was thus invalid. Giovanni was offered her dowry in return for his cooperation. The Sforza family threatened to withdraw their protection should he refuse. Giovanni signed confessions of impotence finally and documents of annulment before witnesses. [ Affair with Perotto ] There has been speculation that during the prolonged process of the annulment, Lucrezia consummated a relationship with someone, perhaps Alexander&apos;s messenger Perotto. In any case, she is said to have been pregnant at the time her marriage was annulled for non-consummation. In June 1497, she is known to have retired to the convent of San Sisto to await the outcome of the divorce which was finalized in December of that year. In February 1498, the bodies of a servant, Pedro Calderon, and a maid, Pantasilea, were found in the Tiber. In March 1498 the Ferrarese ambassador reported that Lucrezia had given birth. Although this was denied, a child was born in that year before Lucrezia&apos;s marriage to Alfonso of Aragon. He was named Giovanni but known to historians as the Roman Infante. In 1501, two papal bull s were issued concerning the child, Giovanni Borgia. In the first, he was recognized as Cesare&apos;s child from an affair before his marriage. The second, contradictory, bull recognized him as the son of Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia&apos;s name is not mentioned in either, and rumors that she was his mother have never been proven. The second bull was kept secret for many years, and Giovanni was assumed to be Cesare&apos;s son. This is supported by the fact that in 1502, he became Duke of Camerino, one of Cesare&apos;s recent conquests, hence the natural inheritance of the Duke of Romagna &apos;s oldest son. However, some time after Alexander&apos;s death, Giovanni went to stay with Lucrezia in Ferrara, where he was accepted as her half-brother. Tomb of Alfonso I d&apos;Este and Lucrezia Borgia, Ferrara [ Second marriage: Alfonso of Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie) ] Following her divorce from Sforza, Lucrezia was married to the Neapolitan Alfonso of Aragon, the half-brother of Sancha of Aragon who was the wife of Lucrezia&apos;s brother Gioffre Borgia. The marriage was a short one, lasting from 1498 until Alfonso&apos;s murder in 1500. It is widely rumored that Lucrezia&apos;s brother Cesare was responsible for Alfonso&apos;s death, as he had recently allied himself (through marriage) with France against Naples. Lucrezia and Alfonso had only one child, Rodrigo, who predeceased his mother in August 1512 at the age of 12. [ Third marriage: Alfonso d&apos;Este (Duke of Ferrara) ] After the death of her second husband, Lucrezia&apos;s father, Pope Alexander VI, wanted to arrange a third marriage. She then married Alfonso I d&apos;Este, Duke of Ferrara in early 1502 in Ferrara. She gave her third husband a number of children and proved to be a respectable and accomplished Renaissance duchess, effectively rising above her previous reputation and surviving the fall of the Borgias following her father&apos;s death. Neither partner was faithful: beginning in 1503, Lucrezia enjoyed a long relationship with her brother-in-law, Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua { Lucrezia Borgia: Life, Love and Death in Renaissance Italy, Sarah Bradford, Viking, 2004 } { Observer review of &apos;&apos;Lucrezia Borgia: Life, Love and Death in Renaissance Italy&apos;&apos; } as well as a love affair with the poet Pietro Bembo. Francesco&apos;s wife was the cultured intellectual Isabella d&apos;Este, the sister of Alfonso, to whom Lucrezia had made overtures of friendship to no avail. The affair between Francesco and Lucrezia was passionate, more sexual than sentimental as can be attested in the fevered love letters the pair wrote one another. { Marek, pp.166–67 } The affair ended when Francesco contracted syphilis and had to end sexual relations with Lucrezia. { Marek (1976) p. 169 } Lucrezia met the famed French soldier, the Chevalier Bayard while the latter was co-commanding the French allied garrison of Ferrara in 1510. According to his biographer, the Chevalier became a great admirer of Lucrezia&apos;s, considering her a &quot; pearl among women &quot;. How much she returned his admiration is unknown. Lucrezia Borgia died in Ferrara on 24 June 1519 from complications after giving birth to her eighth child. She was buried in the convent of Corpus Domini.
