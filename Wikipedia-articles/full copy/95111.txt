As of the 2000 census, the population was 51,104. It is part of the South Bend – Mishawaka, IN -MI, Metropolitan Statistical Area which has a total population of 316,663 and is sometimes considered part of Greater Michiana. Cass County has numerous lakes and is popular for fishing and boating. [ History ] The county is named for Lewis Cass, [ May 2011 ] the Michigan Territorial Governor at the time the county was created in 1829. Cass later served as the United States Secretary of War under President Andrew Jackson, thus making a case for including Cass County as one of Michigan&apos;s &quot; cabinet counties &quot;. Cass County was not so heavily forested and had more fertile prairie land than other nearby areas of Michigan, and thus during early settlement it grew more rapidly in population. As early as 1830, a carding mill was started in the county on Dowagiac Creek, a branch of the St. Joseph River. Although the Sauk Trail ( Chicago Road ) passed through the southern part of the county, early settlement did not come primarily from eastern Michigan. Instead, settlers from Ohio and Indiana who had heard of the prairie lands came to occupy them, reaching the Michigan Territory over a branch of the Chicago Road leading from Fort Wayne, Indiana. The population of Cass County was over 3,000 by 1834. { Fuller, George Newman (1916). &apos;&apos;Economic and Social Beginnings of Michigan: A Study of the Settlement of the Lower Peninsula During the Territorial Period, 1805-1837&apos;&apos;, pp. 244-51. } Among the most prominent early settlers of Cass County were Baldwin Jenkins and Uzziel Putnam, who both came from Ohio by way of the Carey Mission in Berrien County. Jenkins had been born at Fort Jenkins in Green County, Pennsylvania, and had migrated to Tennessee, but then left that state to avoid the presence of slavery. Putnam, who had lived in Massachusetts and New York, came to Cass from Erie County, Ohio, by way of Fort Wayne. These settlers, and their families, established the nucleus of the village of Pokagon on Pokagon Prairie in 1825. The next year, a settlement was made on Beardsley’s Prairie, where the village of Edwardsburg was laid out in 1831. { Fuller (1916), pp. 261-62, 274. } The village of Cassopolis was platted in 1831 and intended as the county seat, although no settlers yet lived there, because it was the geographical center of the county. { Fuller (1916), p. 275. } [ Black settlers ] After 1840, the black population of Cass County grew rapidly as families were attracted by white defiance of discriminatory laws, by numerous highly supportive Quakers, and by low-priced land. Free and runaway blacks found Cass County a haven. Their good fortune attracted the attention of southern slaveholders. In 1847 and 1849, planters from Bourbon and Boone Counties in northern Kentucky led raids into Cass County to recapture runaway slaves. They were &quot; surrounded by crowds of angry farmers armed with clubs, scythes, and other farm implements &quot;, resisting their attempt. { McGinnis, Carol (2005). Michigan Genealogy: Sources &amp; Resources (2nd ed.), pp. 199-200. Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc. ISBN 0-8063-1755-8. } The raids failed of their objective but strengthened Southern demands for passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which was a step on the way to the Civil War. { Benjamin C. Wilson, &quot; Kentucky Kidnappers, Fugitives, and Abolitionists in Antebellum Cass County Michigan, &quot; Michigan History, July 1976, Vol. 60#4 pp. 339-358. } Cass County became known early on for the anti-slavery attitudes of its population. Pennsylvania Quaker s made a settlement in Penn Township in 1829, which later became a prominent station on the Underground Railroad. { Fuller (1916), p. 302. } One established Underground Railroad route ran from Niles through Cassopolis, Schoolcraft, Climax, and Battle Creek, and thence along the old Territorial Road.
