Its de jure capital is Yamoussoukro and the biggest city is the port city of Abidjan. The country is divided into 19 regions and 81 departments. It is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, African Union, La Francophonie, Latin Union, Economic Community of West African States and South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone. The official language is French, although many of the local languages are widely used, including Baoulé, Dioula, Dan, Anyin and Cebaara Senufo. The main religions are Islam, Christianity (primarily Roman Catholic ) and various indigenous religion s. Through production of coffee and cocoa, the country was an economic powerhouse during the 1960s and 1970s in West Africa. However, Côte d&apos;Ivoire went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, leading to the country&apos;s period of political and social turmoil. The 21st century Ivoirian economy is largely market-based and relies heavily on agriculture, with smallholder cash crop production being dominant. [ Etymology ] The region, and then the country, was originally known in English as &quot; Ivory Coast &quot;. In October 1985, the government officially asked that the name of the country be changed to [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] in all languages. [ Jessup 1998 351 ] Despite the Ivorian government&apos;s request, the English translation &quot; Ivory Coast &quot; (sometimes &quot; the Ivory Coast &quot; ) is still frequently used in English. The BBC usually uses &quot; Ivory Coast &quot; both in news reports and on its page about the country.

However, the presence of newly found weapon and tool fragments (specifically, polished axes cut through shale and remnants of cooking and fishing) has been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the Upper Paleolithic period (15,000 to 10,000 BC), [ fr Guédé ] [ fr François Yiodé ] [ fr Contribution à l&apos;étude du paléolithique de la Côte d&apos;Ivoire : État des connaissances ] { 1995 } [ fr Journal des Africanistes ] { 65 } { 2 } { 79–91 } { 0399-0346 } { 10.3406/jafr.1995.2432 } {. } or at the minimum, the Neolithic period. [ Rougerie 1978 246 ] {. } The earliest known inhabitants of [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] have left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants, who migrated south into the area before the 16th century. Such groups included the Ehotilé ( Aboisso ), Kotrowou ( Fresco ), Zéhiri ( Grand Lahou ), Ega and Diès ( Divo ). [ Kipré 1992 15–16 ] {. } [ Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods ] The first recorded history is found in the chronicles of North African ( Berber ) traders, who, from early Roman times, conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt, slaves, gold, and other goods. The southern terminals of the trans-Saharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rain forest. The more important terminals— Djenné, Gao, and Timbuctu —grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed. By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces, these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states. The Sudanic empires also became centres of Islamic education. Islam had been introduced in the western Sudan (today&apos;s Mali) by Muslim Berber traders from North Africa; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. From the eleventh century, by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam, it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Côte d&apos;Ivoire. The Ghana empire, the earliest of the Sudanic empires, flourished in present-day eastern Mauritania from the fourth to the thirteenth century. At the peak of its power in the eleventh century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuctu. After the decline of Ghana, the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state, which reached its apogee in the early part of the fourteenth century. The territory of the Mali Empire in Côte d&apos;Ivoire was limited to the north-west corner around Odienné. Its slow decline starting at the end of the fourteenth century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states, one of which, Songhai, flourished as an empire between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. Songhai was also weakened by internal discord, which led to factional warfare. This discord spurred most of the migrations of peoples southward toward the forest belt. The dense rain forest, covering the southern half of the country, created barriers to the large-scale political organizations that had arisen in the north. Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages; their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long-distance traders. Villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting. [ Pre-European era ] Pre-Colonial kingdoms. Five important states flourished in Côte d&apos;Ivoire in the pre-European era. The Muslim Kong Empire was established by the Juula in the early eighteenth century in the north-central region inhabited by the Sénoufo, who had fled Islamization under the Mali Empire. Although Kong became a prosperous center of agriculture, trade, and crafts, ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom. The city of Kong was destroyed in 1895 by Samori Ture. The Abron kingdom of Gyaaman was established in the seventeenth century by an Akan group, the Abron, who had fled the developing Ashanti confederation of Asanteman in what is present-day Ghana. From their settlement south of Bondoukou, the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the Dyula people in Bondoukou, who were recent émigrés from the market city of Begho. Bondoukou developed into a major centre of commerce and Islam. The kingdom&apos;s Quran ic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. In the mid-seventeenth century in east-central Côte d&apos;Ivoire, other Akan groups&apos; fleeing the Asante established a Baoulé kingdom at Sakasso and two Agni kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi. The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, developed a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers. It finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted French subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Côte d&apos;Ivoire&apos;s independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi attempted to break away from Côte d&apos;Ivoire and form an independent kingdom. Michael Jackson visited Krinjabo, the capital of Sanwi, in 1992 and met with the king. { Jet Magazine, 13 February 1995 } The current king of Sanwi is Nana Amon Ndoufou V (since 2002). [ Establishment of French rule ] Compared to neighbouring Ghana, Côte d&apos;Ivoire suffered little from the slave trade, as European slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast with better harbours.The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the Portuguese and took place in 1482. The first West African French settlement, Saint Louis, was founded in the mid-seventeenth century in Senegal while, at about the same time, the Dutch ceded to the French a settlement at Goree Island off Dakar. A French mission was established in 1637 Assinie near the border with the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Assinie&apos;s survival was precarious, however. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that the French were firmly established in Côte d&apos;Ivoire. In 1843–1844, French admiral Bouët-Willaumez signed treaties with the kings of the Grand Bassam and Assinie regions, placing their territories under a French protectorate. French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. Pacification was not accomplished until 1915. Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the Senegal and the Niger. Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-nineteenth century but moved slowly, based more on individual initiative than on government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African rulers that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres. { Louis-Gustave Binger of French West Africa in 1892 treaty signing with } { Famienkro leaders, in present day N&apos;zi-Comoé Region, Côte d&apos;Ivoire. } The first posts in Côte d&apos;Ivoire included one at Assinie and another at Grand Bassam, which became the colony&apos;s first capital. The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts, and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or coutume s paid annually to the local rulers for the use of the land. The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French, because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade. France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast. The French built naval bases to keep out non-French traders and began a systematic conquest of the interior. (They accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against Mandinka forces, mostly from Gambia. Guerrilla warfare by the Baoulé and other eastern groups continued until 1917). [ July 2008 ] The defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by Germany of the French province of Alsace Lorraine caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its French West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand Bassam in Côte d&apos;Ivoire was left in the care of a shipper from Marseille, Arthur Verdier, who in 1878 was named Resident of the Establishment of Côte d&apos;Ivoire. [ http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bci0014%29 Library of Congress Country Studies Library of Congress 11 April 2009 November 1988 ] In 1886, to support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior. In 1887 Lieutenant Louis Gustave Binger began a two-year journey that traversed parts of Côte d&apos;Ivoire&apos;s interior. By the end of the journey, he had concluded four treaties establishing French protectorates in Côte d&apos;Ivoire. Also in 1887, Verdier&apos;s agent, Marcel Treich-Laplène, negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Côte d&apos;Ivoire. [ French colonial era ] By the end of the 1880s, France had established what passed for control over the coastal regions of Côte d&apos;Ivoire, and in 1889 Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area. That same year, France named Treich-Laplène titular governor of the territory. In 1893 Côte d&apos;Ivoire was made a French colony, and then Captain Binger was appointed governor. Agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the French government to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day Burkina Faso) and French Sudan (present-day Mali) to Côte d&apos;Ivoire for economic and administrative reasons. France&apos;s main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, the French and British were largely bureaucrats. [ July 2008 ] As a result, French citizens owned one third of the cocoa, coffee and banana plantation s and adopted a forced-labour system. Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts. The African population resisted French penetration and settlement. Among those offering greatest resistance was Samori Ture, who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the Wassoulou Empire, which extended over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d&apos;Ivoire. Samori Ture&apos;s large, well-equipped army, which could manufacture and repair its own firearm s, attracted strong support throughout the region. The French responded to Samori Ture&apos;s expansion of regional control with military pressure. French campaigns against Samori Ture, which were met with fierce resistance, intensified in the mid-1890s until he was captured in 1898. France&apos;s imposition of a head tax in 1900 to support the colony in a public works program, provoked a number of revolts. Ivoirians viewed the tax as a violation of the terms of the protectorate treaties, because they thought that France was demanding the equivalent of a coutume from the local kings, rather than the reverse. Much of the population, especially in the interior, considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission. [ http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bci0016%29 Library of Congress Country Studies Library of Congress 11 April 2009 November 1988 ] From 1904 to 1958, Côte d&apos;Ivoire was a constituent unit of the Federation of French West Africa. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the Third Republic. Until the period following World War II, governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris. France&apos;s policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of &quot; association &quot;, meaning that all Africans in Côte d&apos;Ivoire were officially French &quot; subjects &quot;, but without rights to representation in Africa or France. French colonial policy incorporated concepts of assimilation and association. Based on an assumption of the superiority of French culture over all others, in practice the assimilation policy meant extension of the French language, institutions, laws, and customs in the colonies. The policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the French in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized. Under this policy, the Africans in Côte d&apos;Ivoire were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests. An indigenous elite trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between the French and the Africans. Assimilation was practiced in Côte d&apos;Ivoire to the extent that after 1930, a small number of Westernized Ivoirians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship. Most Ivoirians, however, were classified as French subjects and were governed under the principle of association. [ http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bci0018%29 Library of Congress Country Studies Library of Congress 11 April 2009 November 1988 ] As subjects of France, they had no political rights. They were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indigénat, a separate system of law. [ http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bci0019%29 Library of Congress Country Studies Library of Congress 11 April 2009 November 1988 ] In World War II, the Vichy regime remained in control until 1943, when members of Gen. Charles de Gaulle &apos;s provisional government assumed control of all French West Africa. The Brazzaville Conference of 1944, the first Constituent Assembly of the Fourth Republic in 1946, and France&apos;s gratitude for African loyalty during World War II led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946. French citizenship was granted to all African &quot; subjects, &quot; the right to organize politically was recognized, and various forms of forced labour were abolished. Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Côte d&apos;Ivoire, using a system of direct, centralized administration that left little room for Ivoirian participation in policy making. Whereas British colonial administration adopted divide-and-rule policies elsewhere, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite, the French were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from any anti-French sentiment. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivoirians believed that they would achieve equality with their French peers through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France. But, after the assimilation doctrine was implemented entirely through the postwar reforms, Ivoirian leaders realized that even assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivoirians, and that discrimination and political inequality would end only with independence. [ http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bci0017%29 Library of Congress Country Studies Library of Congress 11 April 2009 November 1988 ] [ Independence ] The son of a [ fr Baoulé ] chief, [ fr Félix Houphouët-Boigny ], was to become [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] &apos;s father of independence. In 1944 he formed the country&apos;s first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. [ fr Houphouët-Boigny ] soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris. A year later the French abolished forced labour. [ fr Houphouët-Boigny ] established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that the country would benefit from it, which it did for many years. France appointed him as the first African to become a minister in a European government. A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act ( Loi Cadre ), which transferred a number of powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French West Africa and also removed remaining voting inequalities. In 1958, [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] became an autonomous member of the French Community (which replaced the French Union ). At the time of [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] &apos;s independence (1960), the country was easily French West Africa &apos;s most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region&apos;s total exports. When [ fr Houphouët-Boigny ] became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production. This was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ] into third place in world output (behind Brazil and Colombia). By 1979, the country was the world&apos;s leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa&apos;s leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil. French technicians contributed to the &apos;Ivoirian miracle&apos;. In other African nations, the people drove out the Europeans following independence; but in [ fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire ], they poured in. The French community grew from only 30,000 prior to independence to 60,000 in 1980, most of them teachers, managers and advisors. { Ivory Coast  – The Economy, U.S. Library of Congress } For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10%—the highest of Africa&apos;s non-oil-exporting countries. [ Houphouët-Boigny administration ] { First Ivorian Civil War } Houphouët-Boigny&apos;s one-party rule was not amenable to political competition. Laurent Gbagbo, who would be the president of Côte d&apos;Ivoire in 2000, had to flee as he incurred the ire of Houphouët-Boigny when Gbagbo founded the Front Populair Ivoirien. { McGovern, Mike, Making War in Côte d&apos;Ivoire, The University of Chicago Press, 2011, p. 16 } Houphouët-Boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population who continually elected him. He was also criticized for his emphasis on developing large scale projects. Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village, Yamoussoukro, into the new capital that it became, were wasted; others support his vision to develop a centre for peace, education and religion in the heart of the country. But in the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivoirian economy. Due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices, the country&apos;s external debt increased threefold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan. [ August 2010 ] In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting institutional corruption. The unrest forced the government to support multi-party democracy. Houphouët-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993. He favoured [ fr Henri Konan Bédié ] as his successor. [ &lt; template type= &quot; lang &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; fr &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Bédié &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; administration ] In October 1995, [ fr Bédié ] overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt. Election results of 2002 in fr Côte d&apos;Ivoire Unlike [ fr Houphouët-Boigny ], who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, [ fr Bedié ] emphasized the concept of &quot; Ivority &quot; ( [ Ivoirité ] ) to exclude his rival Alassane Ouattara, who had two northern Ivorian parents, from running for future presidential election. As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivoirian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivoirian nationality, and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained which will result in two civil wars in the following decades. [ 1999 coup ] Similarly, [ fr Bédié ] excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General [ fr Robert Guéï ] in power. [ fr Bédié ] fled into exile in France. The new leadership reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for austerity and openly campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society. [ Gbagbo administration ] A presidential election was held in October 2000 in which Laurent Gbagbo vied with [ fr Guéï ], but it was peaceful. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths, [ fr Guéï ] was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo. Alassane Ouattara was disqualified by the country&apos;s Supreme Court, due to his alleged [ fr Burkinabé ] nationality. The existing and later reformed constitution [under [ fr Guéï ] ] did not allow non-citizens to run for presidency. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country&apos;s north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro. [ Ivorian Civil War ] [ First Ivorian Civil War ] In the early hours of 19 September 2002, while the President was in Italy, there was an armed uprising. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities. The battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning, but by lunchtime the government forces had secured the main city, Abidjan. They had lost control of the north of the country, and the rebel forces made their strong-hold in the northern city of Bouake. The rebels threatened to move on Abidjan again and France deployed troops from its base in the country to stop any rebel advance. The French said they were protecting their own citizens from danger, but their deployment also aided the government forces. It was not established as a fact that the French were helping either side but each side accused them of being on the opposite side. It is disputed as to whether the French actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term. What exactly happened that night is disputed. The government claimed that former president [ fr Robert Guéï ] had led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and fifteen others had been murdered at his home and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the French embassy; his home had burned down. President Gbagbo cut short his trip to Italy and on his return stated, in a television address, that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived. Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands, attacking the residents. { Child soldier in the Ivory Coast. &quot; (drawing by } { Gilbert G. Groud ) } An early ceasefire with the rebels, which had the backing of much of the northern populace, proved short-lived, and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, [ http://www.kepi.cncplusplus.com/Ivory_Coast/Ivory_Coast.htm Ivory Coast  – Heart of Darkness Kepi.cncplusplus.com 20 June 2010 ] and militias, including warlords and fighters from Liberia and Sierra Leone, took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west. [ 2002 unity government ] In January 2003, Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a &quot; government of national unity &quot;. Curfews were lifted and French troops patrolled the western border of the country. The unity government was unstable and the central problems remained with neither side achieving its goals. In March 2004, 120 people were killed in an opposition rally, and subsequent mob violence led to foreign nationals being evacuated. A later report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a Zone of Confidence, relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate. Early in November 2004, after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed following the rebels&apos; refusal to disarm, Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels. During one of these airstrikes in Bouaké, on 6 November 2004, French soldiers were hit and nine were killed; the Ivorian government has said it was a mistake, but the French have claimed it was deliberate. They responded by destroying most Ivoirian military aircraft (2 Su-25 planes and 5 helicopters), and violent retaliatory riots against the French broke out in Abidjan. { &quot; France&apos;s &apos;Little Iraq&apos; &quot;. CBS News. 15 November 2004. } Gbagbo&apos;s original mandate as president expired on 30 October 2005, but due to the lack of disarmament it was deemed impossible to hold an election, and therefore his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year, according to a plan worked out by the African Union; this plan was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. { &quot; UN endorses plan to leave president in office beyond mandate &quot;, IRIN, 14 October 2005. } With the late October deadline approaching in 2006, it was regarded as very unlikely that the election would be held by that point, and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo. { Joe Bavier, &quot; Ivory Coast Opposition, Rebels Say No to Term Extension for President &quot;, VOA News, 18 August 2006. } The UN Security Council endorsed another one-year extension of Gbagbo&apos;s term on 1 November 2006; however, the resolution provided for the strengthening of Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny &apos;s powers. Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied. { &quot; Partial rejection of UN peace plan &quot;, IRIN, 2 November 2006. } A peace accord between the government and the rebels, or New Forces, was signed on 4 March 2007, and subsequently Guillaume Soro, leader of the New Forces, became prime minister. These events have been seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo&apos;s position. { &quot; New Ivory Coast govt &apos;a boost for Gbagbo&apos; &quot; } [ April 2011 ] {, AFP (IOL), 12 April 2007. } [ 2010 election ] [ Ivorian presidential election, 2010 ] The presidential elections that should have been organized in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results announced by the Electoral Commission showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of his rival, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara. The ruling FPI contested the results before the Constitutional Council, charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the Forces Nouvelles de Côte d&apos;Ivoire (FNCI). These charges were contradicted by international observers. The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consists of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote (instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission). After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara, recognized as the winner by most countries and the United Nations, organized an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees have fled the country. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12079552 26 December 2010 BBC News – Thousands flee Ivory Coast for Liberia amid poll crisis 26 December 2010 ] The African Union sent Thabo Mbeki, former President of South Africa, to mediate the conflict. The United Nations Security Council adopted a common resolution recognising Alassane Ouattara as winner of the elections, based on the position of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

After months of unsuccessful negotiations and sporadic violence, the crisis entered a critical stage as Ouattara&apos;s forces seized control of most of the country, with Gbagbo entrenched in Abidjan, the country&apos;s largest city. International organizations reported numerous instances of human rights violations by both sides. In the city of Duékoué, hundreds of people were estimated to have been killed, predominantly by advancing pro-Ouattara militias. In nearby Blolequin, dozens of people were killed, reportedly by retreating Liberian mercenaries who had been hired by pro-Gbagbo forces.

Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan, although some (including the United Kingdom) have closed their missions because of the continuing violence and attacks on Europeans. The Ivoirian population continues to suffer because of an ongoing civil war (See the History section above). International human rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive non-combatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child slavery among workers in cocoa production. Although most of the fighting ended by late 2004, the country remained split in two, with the north controlled by the New Forces (FN). A new presidential election was expected to be held in October 2005, and an agreement was reached among the rival parties in March 2007 to proceed with this, but it continued to be postponed until November 2010 due to delays in its preparation. Elections were finally held in 2010. The first round of elections were held peacefully, and widely hailed as free and fair.
