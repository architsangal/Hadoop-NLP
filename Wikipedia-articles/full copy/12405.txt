The original person to voice Gumby was Dick Beals in the 1950&apos;s.

Gumby has been the subject of a 233-episode series of American television as well as a feature-length film and other media. [ Even now, Gumby has that special dimension The Los Angeles Times July 9, 2006 Lloyd Robert http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/09/entertainment/ca-gumby9 November 7, 2010 ] Since the original series&apos; run, he has become well known as an example of stop motion clay animation and an influential cultural icon, spawning many tributes and parodies, including a video game and toys. [ Characters ] Gumby&apos;s principal sidekick is Pokey, a talking orange pony voiced by Art Clokey (and his nemeses are the Blockheads, a pair of humanoid, red-colored figures with block-shaped heads, who wreak mischief and havoc at all times. The Blockheads were inspired by the Katzenjammer Kids, who were always getting into scrapes and causing discomfort to others.

[ http://gumby.com/memorylane/histpricgoo.htm Prickle and Goo Gumby.com July 27, 2011 ] Also featured are Goo (voiced by Norma MacMillan and later Gloria Clokey), a flying blue mermaid who spits blue goo balls and can change shape at will; Gumby&apos;s mother Gumba (Nancy Wible and Ginny Tyler) and father Gumbo (Art Clokey). The later syndicated series in 1988 added Gumby&apos;s sister Minga (Holly Harman) and mastodon friend Denali (also voiced by Art Clokey). [ Origins ] Gumby was created by Art Clokey in the early 1950s after finishing film school at University of Southern California. { Felch, Jason (January 9, 2010). &quot; Art Clokey dies at 88; creator of Gumby &quot;. The Los Angeles Times. http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/09/local/la-me-art-clokey9-2010jan09. Retrieved November 7, 2010. } Clokey&apos;s first animated film was a 1953 three-minute short called Gumbasia, a surreal montage of moving and expanding lumps of clay set to music in a parody of Disney&apos;s Fantasia. [ http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/trulyca/shorts/episode.jsp?essid%3D14527 Gumbasia KQED July 27, 2011 ] Gumbasia was created in a style Vorkapich taught called Kinesthetic Film Principles. Described as &quot; massaging of the eye cells &quot;, this technique of camera movements and editing was responsible for much of the Gumby look and feel. Clokey and his wife, Ruth ( née Parkander), invented Gumby in the early 1950s at their Covina home shortly after Art finished film school at USC. In 1955 Clokey showed Gumbasia to movie producer Sam Engel, who encouraged him to develop his technique by adding figures. Of the three pilot episodes of Gumby, the first was done by Clokey on his own, and the next two were done for NBC and shown on The Howdy Doody Show to test audience reaction. The second 15-minute pilot, &quot; Gumby Goes to the Moon &quot;, was initially rejected by NBC executive Thomas Warren Sarnoff. The third Gumby episode, &quot; Robot Rumpus &quot;, made a successful debut on the Howdy Doody Show in August 1956. Gumby was an NBC series (a Howdy Doody spin-off) during 1957.

Gumby was green because it was Clokey&apos;s favorite color. Gumby&apos;s legs and feet were made wide for pragmatic reasons: they ensured the clay character would stand up during stop-motion filming. The famous slanted shape of Gumby&apos;s head was based on the hair style of Clokey&apos;s father Charles Farrington in an old photograph. [ A. Schneider http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/gumby/index.html Gumby, a segment of NPR&apos;s &quot; Present at the Creation &quot; series NPR March 25, 2002 July 27, 2011 ] Female performers (among them Ginny Tyler and Nancy Wible) supplied Gumby&apos;s voice during the initial episodes. New episodes were added from 1961 to 1963, at which time Dallas McKennon became the voice of Gumby. [ May 2012 ] Production continued through 1966–1968, [ May 2012 ] by which time Norma MacMillan voiced Gumby. [ May 2012 ] [ Lorimar-Telepictures years ] [ section, except for one footnote, May 2012 ] { Grub Grabber Gumby &quot;. } By the 1980s, the original Gumby shorts had enjoyed a revival, both on television and home video. [ Cartoon Cassettes To Animate The Holidays The Los Angeles Times December 17, 1986 Solomon Charles http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-17/entertainment/ca-3233_1_animated-features November 7, 2010 ] This led to a new incarnation of the series for television syndication by Lorimar-Telepictures in 1988 that included new characters, such as Gumby&apos;s little sister Minga and a mastodon named Denali. Dallas McKennon returned as the voice of Gumby in new adventures that would take Gumby and his pals beyond their toyland-type setting and establish themselves as a rock band. In addition to the new episodes, the classic 1950s and 1960s shorts were re-run as part of the series, but with newly recorded soundtracks, with the voices re-recorded and the original music replaced by Jerry Gerber&apos;s score from the 1988 series. (Clokey&apos;s rights to use the original Capitol Records production tracks could not be renewed at the time, due to legal issues.) Art Clokey reportedly [ May 2012 ] gave many movie industry talents their first break in the business. A number of the clay animators who worked on the new series went on to work for Pixar, Disney and other studios. [ Movie and beyond ] Screenshot of the video game, &apos;&apos;Gumby vs. the Astrobots&apos;&apos; Beginning in 1982, Eddie Murphy began a parody of Gumby on Saturday Night Live. According to Murphy’s parody, when the television cameras were turned off, the sweet Gumby reverted to his true self: a cigar chomping, irascible celebrity who was highly demanding of the production executives. Whenever the executives refused to give into his demands, Gumby would assert his star status by saying “I’m Gumby, Dammit.” In 1987, the character appeared in The Puppetoon Movie. In 1995, Clokey&apos;s production company produced an independently released theatrical film, Gumby: The Movie (aka Gumby 1), marking the clay character&apos;s first feature-length adventure. [ For Feat of Clay, He&apos;s Left a Lasting Impression The Los Angeles Times November 27, 1993 Michael Quintanilla http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-27/local/me-61520_1_gumby-movie November 7, 2010 ] In it, the villainous Blockheads replace Gumby and his band with robots and kidnap their dog, Lowbelly. The movie featured in-joke homages to such sci-fi classics as Star Wars, The Terminator, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Starting in 1992, TV channels like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network aired re-runs of Gumby episodes. The original cartoon, &quot; Robot Rumpus &quot;, was featured on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. The Library of Congress had Gumby as a spokescharacter from 1994 to 1995, due to a common sequence in his shows where Gumby walks into a book, and then experiences the world inside the book as a tangible place. By the end of the decade, Gumby and Pokey had appeared in commercials for Cheerios cereal, most notably Frosted Cheerios. Although no new animated Gumby material is planned for the foreseeable future, [ January 2010 ] most of the episodes (with a few exceptions) of the two series are available on home video and DVD. In August 2005, the first video game featuring Gumby, Gumby vs. the Astrobots, was released by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. In it, Gumby must rescue Pokey, Prickle, and Goo after they are captured by the Blockheads and their cohorts, the Astrobots. The Gumby images and toys are registered trademarks of Prema Toy Company. Premavision owns the distribution rights to the Gumby cartoons (having been reverted from previous distributor Warner Bros. Television ), and has licensed the rights to Classic Media. On March 16, 2007, YouTube announced that all Gumby episodes would appear in their full-length form on its site, digitally remastered and with their original soundtracks. This deal also extended to other video sites, including AOL.
