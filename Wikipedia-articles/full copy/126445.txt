The population was 1,654 at the 2010 census. The town is also known as Schroon Lake, which is actually a centrally located lake, and the name of a hamlet on the lake. The Town of Schroon is in the southern part of Essex County and is north of Albany. The Town of Schroon contains two lakes: nine-mile (14  km) long Schroon Lake, and five-mile (8  km) long Paradox Lake. The two lakes are connected by the Schroon River. [ Local attractions ] Schroon Lake [ 43 46 49 N 73 46 40 W ], in the towns of Schroon and Horicon, is a year-round tourist destination, with boating, swimming and fishing in the summer and snowmobiling, snowshoeing and ice fishing in the winter; hiking and hunting are popular in the fall and spring. Each September, hundreds of runners compete in the Adirondack Marathon, which finishes in downtown Schroon Lake. The roads around the lake constitute an almost perfect 26 mile distance. Schroon&apos;s main street is US-9, which offers restaurants, antique and collectible shops, a movie theater and churches. The Town of Schroon maintains public docks in the village area, which makes the shops and restaurants accessible to boaters. Schroon has two free municipal boat launches. New York State also has public campsites on Schroon Lake. Paradox Lake also has a New York State campground on its shores. Schroon Lake serves as summer home to the Seagle Music Colony. It is also home to Schroon-North Hudson Historical Museum, Natural Stone Bridge &amp; Caves, and a municipal golf course. Schroon Lake is the home of the main headquarters of the Word of Life Fellowship. Word of Life maintains a conference center, summer youth camps, a Bible Institute and place of worship at its properties in Schroon Lake. The Town of Schroon is the home of Camp Southwoods, a traditional, co-ed, resident camp, although the camp is physically located on nearby Paradox Lake. [ History ] The town was first settled around 1800, north of the current Schroon Lake hamlet. However, there is a claim that the town was occupied during the Colonial Period as a French colony. The origination of the name &quot; Schroon &quot; is not precisely known: some believe it to be derived from a Native American word for large lake. The Town of Schroon was formed in 1804 from part of the Town of Crown Point. The town was partitioned to form the newer Town of Minerva in 1817. In 1840, part of Schroon was returned to Crown Point. As with other towns of Essex County, the early economy was heavily involved in lumber production. Prior to the construction of the Northway ( Interstate 87 ), US Route 9 was the major north-south highway between Albany and Montreal, which made Schroon Lake a convenient stopping off point for travelers to purchase gas, lodging, and meals. Schroon Lake was also the former home to the world class Scaroon Manor resort which closed in 1962. The Scaroon Manor was the site for the 1957 Warner Brothers movie &quot; Marjorie Morningstar &quot; which starred Gene Kelly, Natalie Wood. Carolyn Jones and Ed Wynn. Also featured in the film was Camp Red Wing (though not mentioned by name) on the east side of the Lake, from which Wood and Jones depart by canoe at night for their escape to the musical South Winds (Scaroon Manor). Open to the public for many years, the old Scaroon Manor site is now owned by the state, and access is limited to those who pay for a day pass. The &quot; Scaroons &quot; is/are mentioned twice in The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper, as a place seen by Hawkeye ( Natty Bumppo ), Chingachgook and Uncas after they had departed Horicon (the name used by Cooper for Lake George) while traveling northward chasing Magua and his two captives, Cora and Alice Munro. It is unclear from the context in the book whether Cooper is referring to the lake or a chain of mountains, the latter being a more likely interpretation.
