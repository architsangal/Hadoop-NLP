{ :This article discusses the &quot; Maiden, Mother, Crone &quot; goddess triad of certain forms of Neopaganism. See } { triple goddesses for other uses. } The Triple Goddess is the subject of much of the writing of Robert Graves, and has been adopted by many neopagan s (notably Wiccans) as one of their primary deities. The term triple goddess is infrequently used outside of Neopaganism to instead refer to historical goddess triads and single goddesses of three forms or aspects. In common Neopagan usage the three female figures are frequently described as the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone, each of which symbolises both a separate stage in the female life cycle and a phase of the moon, and often rules one of the realms of earth, underworld, and the heavens. These may or may not be perceived as aspects of a greater single divinity. The feminine part of Wicca &apos;s duotheistic theological system is sometimes portrayed as a Triple Goddess, her masculine counterpart being the Horned God. Many other neopagan belief systems besides Wicca follow Graves in his use of the figure of the Triple Goddess, and it continues to be an influence on feminism, literature, Jungian psychology and literary criticism. [ Origins ] The relationship between the neopagan Triple Goddess and ancient religion is disputed. Ronald Hutton, a scholar of neopaganism, argues that the concept of the triple moon goddess as Maiden, Mother, and Crone, each facet corresponding to a phase of the moon, is a modern creation of Robert Graves, drawing on the work of 19th and 20th century scholars such as especially Jane Harrison; and also Margaret Murray, James Frazer, the other members of the &quot; myth and ritual &quot; school or Cambridge Ritualists, and the occultist and writer Aleister Crowley. { Triumph of the Moon, p. 41. } The Triple Goddess was here distinguished by Hutton from the prehistoric Great Mother Goddess, as described by Marija Gimbutas and others, whose worship in ancient times he regarded as neither proven nor disproven { Triumph of the Moon, p. 355-357 } Nor did Hutton dispute that in ancient pagan worship &quot; partnerships of three divine women &quot; occurred; rather he proposes that Jane Harrison looked to such partnerships to help explain how ancient goddesses could be both virgin and mother (the third person of the triad being as yet unnamed). Here she was according to Hutton &quot; extending &quot; the ideas of the prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans who in excavating Knossos in Crete had come to the view that prehistoric Cretans had worshipped a single mighty goddess at once virgin and mother. In Hutton&apos;s view Evans&apos; opinion owed an &quot; unmistakable debt &quot; to the Christian belief in the Virgin Mary. { Triumph of the Moon, p.36-37 } The twentieth century poet and mythographer Robert Graves claimed a historical basis for the triple-goddess, and an ongoing tradition of her worship among poets. Although Graves&apos;s work is widely discounted by academics as pseudohistory (see The White Goddess#Criticism and The Greek Myths#Reception ), it continues to have a lasting influence on many areas of Neopaganism. [ Robert Graves ] According to Ronald Hutton, the concept of a Triple Goddess with Maiden, Mother and Crone aspects and lunar symbology was Robert Graves &apos;s contribution to modern paganism. { &apos;&apos;The Myth and Ritual School: J.G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists&apos;&apos;. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-93963-1, ISBN 978-0-415-93963-8. Hutton, Ronald (1997). &quot; The Neolithic Great Goddess: A Study in Modern Tradition &quot; from Antiquity, March 1997. } According to Hutton, Graves, in his The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth (1948), took Harrison&apos;s idea of goddess-worshipping matriarchal early Europe { Hutton, Ronald (1997). &quot; The Neolithic Great Goddess: A Study in Modern Tradition &quot; from Antiquity, March 1997. p.3 (online copy). } [ Greer John Michael The New Encyclopedia of the Occult Llewellyn 2003 280 978-1-56718-336-8 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DxAmMNnJlfnoC%26amp%3Blpg%3DPP280%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA280#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 2009-10-08 ] and the imagery of three aspects, and related these to the Triple Goddess. { Miranda Seymour, Robert Graves: life on the edge, p. 307 } Graves wrote extensively on the subject of the Triple Goddess who he saw as the Muse of all true poetry in both ancient and modern literature. { The White Goddess Chapter One &quot; Poets and Gleemen &quot; } He thought that her ancient worship underlay much of classical Greek myth although reflected there in a more or less distorted or incomplete form. As an example of an unusually complete survival of the &quot; ancient triad &quot; he cites from the classical source Pausanias the worship of Hera in three persons as girl, wife, and widow. { The White Goddess, Amended and Enlarged Edition, 1961, Chapter 21, &quot; The Waters of Styx &quot; page 368, Also &quot; The Greek Myths &quot; in several places. } Other examples he gives include the goddess triad Moira Ilythia and Callone ( &quot; Death, Birth and Beauty &quot; ) from Plato &apos;s Symposium; { White Goddess,Amended and Enlarged Edition, 1961, Foreword, page 11 } the triple goddess Hecate; the story of the rape of Kore, (the triad here Graves said to be Kore, Persephone and Hecate with Demeter the general name of the goddess); alongside a large number of other configurations. { The Greek Myths, single edition, 1992, Penguin } A figure he used from outside of Greek myth was of the Akan Triple Moon Goddess Ngame, who Graves said was still worshipped in 1960. { White Goddess, Chapter 27, Postcript 1960, } Graves cited for example Pausanias who recorded the ancient worship of Hera Pais (Girl Hera ), Hera Teleia (Adult Hera), and Hera Khera (Widow Hera, though Khera can also mean separated or divorced ) at a single sanctuary reputedly built by Temenus, son of Pelasgus, in Stymphalos { Pausanias, Guide to Greece 8.22.2 }. The Roman goddess Diana Nemorensis was a triple goddess, ruling the sky the earth and the underworld, associated especially with the moon. Robert Graves cited a reference to her by the Tudor poet Skelton (following Ovid &apos;s Metamorphoses { University of Virginia&apos;s &quot; Ovid Illustrated &quot; site, http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/ovidillust.html, the lines from Skelton being explicitly sourced from Ovid in a note at http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/trans/MetindexBCD.htm, retrieved 18 April 2011. } ) as an example of the triple goddess&apos;s continued relevance to poets (see below). James Frazer&apos;s seminal Golden Bough centres around the cult of Diana Nemorensis. Graves states that his Triple Goddess is the Great Goddess &quot; in her poetic or incantatory character &quot;, and that the goddess in her ancient form took the gods of the waxing and waning year successively as her lovers. { Harvey, Graham. Introduction to &quot; The Triple Muse &quot;, p. 129, in Clifton, Chas, and Harvey, Graham (eds.) (2004). The Paganism Reader. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-30352-4, ISBN 978-0-415-30352-1. } Graves believed that the Triple Goddess was an aboriginal deity also of Britain, and that traces of her worship survived in early modern British witchcraft and in various modern British cultural attitudes such as what Graves believed to be a preference for a female sovereign. { Graves, Robert. &quot; The Triple Muse &quot;, p.148, in Clifton, Chas, and Harvey, Graham (eds.) (2004). The Paganism Reader. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-30352-4, ISBN 978-0-415-30352-1. } Graves regarded &quot; true poetry &quot; as inspired by the Triple Goddess, as an example of her continuing influence in English poetry he instances the &quot; Garland of Laurell &quot; by the English poet, John Skelton (c.1460-1529) — Diana in the leavës green, Luna that so bright doth sheen, Persephone in Hell. — as evoking his Triple Goddess in her three realms of earth, sky and underworld. { Graves, Robert (1948). The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth. p.377. } In the anthology The Greek Myths (1955), Graves systematically applied his convictions enshrined in The White Goddess to Greek mythology, exposing a large number of readers to his various theories concerning goddess worship in ancient Greece. { Von Hendy, Andrew (2002). &apos;&apos;The Modern Construction of Myth&apos;&apos;, 2nd edition. Indiana University Press. p.354. ISBN 0-253-33996-0, ISBN 978-0-253-33996-6. } Graves posited that Greece had been settled by a matriarchal goddess worshipping people before being invaded by successive waves of patriarchal Indo-European speakers from the north. Much of Greek myth in his view recorded the consequent religious political and social accommodations until the final triumph of patriarchy. Graves did not invent this picture but drew from nineteenth and early twentieth century scholarship. This account has not been disproved but alternative explanations have emerged and is not accepted as a consensus view. { Hutton, Ronald (1997). &quot; The Neolithic Great Goddess: A Study in Modern Tradition &quot; from Antiquity, March 1997. p.7 (online). See also relevant wikipedia articles, } { Dorian invasion, } { Mycanean Age } { Greek Dark Ages } The twentieth century archeologist Marija Gimbutas (see below) also argued for a triple goddess-worshipping European neolithic modified and eventually overwhelmed by waves of partiarchal invaders although she saw this neolithic civilization as egalitarian and &quot; matristic &quot; rather than &quot; matriarchal &quot; in the sense of gynocratic. { &quot; Civilization of the Goddess &quot; Marija Gimbutas } In the 1949 novel Seven Days in New Crete, Graves extrapolated this theory into an imagined future society where the worship of the Triple Goddess under the three aspects of the maiden archer Nimuë, the goddess of motherhood and sexuality Mari, and the hag-goddess of wisdom Ana is the main form of religion. [ Jane Ellen Harrison ] [ October 2009 ] In her discussion of James Mellaart &apos;s theories regarding Çatalhöyük, Lynn Meskell says it is probable that the Triple Goddess originated { Meskell, Lynn (1999). &quot; Feminism, Paganism, Pluralism &quot;, p.87, in Gazin-Schwartz, Amy, and Holtorf, Cornelius (eds.) (1999). Archaeology and Folklore. Routledge. &quot; It seems clear that the initial recording of Çatalhöyük [1961-1965] was largely influenced by decidedly Greek notions of ritual and magic, especially that of the Triple Goddess — maiden, mother, and crone. These ideas were common to many at that time, but probably originated with Jane Ellen Harrison, Classical archaeologist and member of the famous Cambridge Ritualists (Harrison 1903). &quot; ISBN 0-415-20144-6, ISBN 978-0-415-20144-5.

She argued that the original single one, representing the earth, had likewise been honoured in three roles.

[S]he declared that all male deities had originally been subordinate to the goddess as her lovers and her sons. &quot; ISBN 0-19-285449-6, ISBN 978-0-19-285449-0. } with the work of Jane Ellen Harrison. { Harrison, Jane Ellen (1903). &apos;&apos;Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion&apos;&apos;.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. } Harrison asserts the existence of female trinities, discusses the Horae as chronological symbols representing the phases of the Moon and goes on to equate the Horae with the Seasons, the Graces and the Fates. { Harrison, Jane Ellen (1912). Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp.189-192: &quot; The three } { Horae are the three phases of the Moon, the Moon waxing, full, and waning.... [T]he Moon is the true mother of the triple Horae, who are themselves } { Moirai, and the Moirai, as Orpheus tells us, are but the three moirai or divisions (μέρη) of the Moon herself, the three divisions of the old year. And these three Moirai or Horae are also } { Charites. &quot; } and the three seasons of the ancient Greek year, { Harrison, Jane Ellen (1903). Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.288. } and notes that &quot; [T]he matriarchal goddess may well have reflected the three stages of a woman&apos;s life. &quot; { Harrison, Jane Ellen (1903). Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.317. } Ronald Hutton writes: [Harrison&apos;s] work, both celebrated and controversial, posited the previous existence of a peaceful and intensely creative woman-centred civilization, in which humans, living in harmony with nature and their own emotions, worshipped a single female deity. The deity was regarded as representing the earth, and as having three aspects, of which the first two were Maiden and Mother; she did not name the third.... Following her work, the idea of a matristic early Europe which had venerated such a deity was developed in books by amateur scholars such as Robert Briffault&apos;s The Mothers (1927) and Robert Graves&apos;s The White Goddess (1946). John Michael Greer writes: Harrison proclaimed that Europe itself had been the location of an idyllic, goddess-worshipping, matriarchal civilization just before the beginning of recorded history, and spoke bitterly of the disastrous consequences of the Indo-European invasion that destroyed it. In the hands of later writers such as Robert Graves, Jacquetta Hawkes, and Marija Gimbutas, this &apos;lost civilisation of the goddess&apos; came to play the same sort of role in many modern Pagan communities as Atlantis and Lemuria did in Theosophy. The &quot; myth and ritual &quot; school or Cambridge Ritualists, of which Harrison was a key figure, while controversial in its day, is now considered passé in intellectual and academic terms. According to Robert Ackerman, &quot; [T]he reason the Ritualists have fallen into disfavor... is not that their assertions have been controverted by new information.... Ritualism has been swept away not by an access of new facts but of new theories. &quot; { Ackerman, Robert (2002). &apos;&apos;The Myth and Ritual School: J.G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists&apos;&apos;. Routledge. p.188. ISBN 0-415-93963-1, ISBN 978-0-415-93963-8. } Ronald Hutton wrote on the decline the &quot; Great Goddess &quot; theory specifically : &quot; The effect upon professional prehistorians was to make most return, quietly and without controversy, to that careful agnosticism as to the nature of ancient religion which most had preserved until the 1940s. There had been no absolute disproof of the veneration of a Great Goddess, only a demonstration that the evidence concerned admitted of alternative explanations. &quot; { Hutton, Ronald (1997). &quot; The Neolithic Great Goddess: A Study in Modern Tradition &quot; from Antiquity, March 1997. p.7 (online). } [ Marija Gimbutas ] Scholar Marija Gimbutas &apos;s theories relating to goddess-centered culture among pre- Indo-European &quot; Old Europe &quot; (6500-3500 BCE) { Gimbutas, Marija (1974).

Gimbutas interpreted iconography from neolithic and earlier periods of European history evidence of worship of a triple goddess represented by: &quot; stiff nudes &quot;, birds of prey or poisonous snakes interpreted as &quot; death &quot; mother-figures interpreted as symbols of &quot; birth and fertility &quot; moths, butterflies or bees, or alternatively a symbols such as a frog, hedgehog or bulls head which she interpreted as being the uterus or fetus, as being symbols of &quot; regeneration &quot; Gimbutas, Marija (1991).

The first and third aspects of the goddess, according to Gimbutas, were frequently conflated to make a goddess of death-and-regeneration represented in folklore by such figures as Baba Yaga. Gimbutas regarded the Eleusinian Mysteries as a survival into classical antiquity of this ancient goddess worship, { Gimbutas, Marija (1991).

In their view, sexuality, pregnancy, breastfeeding — and other female reproductive processes — are ways that women may embody the Goddess, making the physical body sacred. { Pike, Sarah M.

The Mother represents ripeness, fertility, sexuality, fulfillment, stability, power and life represented by the full moon. The Crone represents wisdom, repose, death, and endings represented by the waning moon. Helen Berger writes that &quot; according to believers, this echoing of women&apos;s life stages allowed women to identify with deity in a way that had not been possible since the advent of patriarchal religions. &quot; { Berger, Helen A.

They give the example of Diana only becoming three (Daughter, Wife, Mother) through her relationship to Zeus, the male deity. They go on to state that different cultures and groups associate different numbers and cosmological bodies with gender. { Jung, C. G., and Kerényi, C. (1949).

Pantheon Books. p.167. } Karl Kerenyi, wrote in 1952 that several Greek goddesses were triple moon goddesses of the Maiden Mother Crone type, including Hera and others. { For example Kerenyi writes in &quot; Athene: Virgin and Mother in Greek Religion &quot;, 1978, translated from German by Murray Stein (German text 1952) Spring Publications, Zurich, : &quot; With Hera the correspondences of the mythological and and cosmic transformation extended to all three phases in which the Greeks saw the moon: she corresponded to the waxing moon as maiden, to the full moon as fulfilled wife, to the waning moon as abandoned withdrawing women &quot; (page 58) He goes on to say that trios of sister goddess in Greek myth refer to the lunar cycle; in the book in question he treats Athene also as a triple moon goddess, noting the statement by Aristotle that Athene was the Moon but not &quot; only &quot; the Moon. } In discussing examples of his Great Mother archetype, Neumann mentions the Fates as &quot; the threefold form of the Great Mother &quot;, { Neumann, Erich (1955). The Great Mother: an Analysis of the Archetype. Pantheon Books. p.226. } details that &quot; the reason for their appearance in threes or nines, or more seldom in twelves, is to be sought in the threefold articulation underlying all created things; but here it refers most particularly to the three temporal stages of all growth (beginning-middle-end, birth-life-death, past-present-future). &quot; { Neumann, Erich (1955). The Great Mother: an Analysis of the Archetype. Pantheon Books. p.230. } Andrew Von Hendy claims that Neumann&apos;s theories are based on circular reasoning, whereby a Eurocentric view of world mythology is used as evidence for a universal model of individual psychological development which mirrors a sociocultural evolution ary model derived from European mythology. { Von Hendy, Andrew (2002). &apos;&apos;The Modern Construction of Myth&apos;&apos;, 2nd edition. Indiana University Press. pp.186-187. ISBN 0-253-33996-0, ISBN 978-0-253-33996-6. } Valerie H. Mantecon follows Annis V. Pratt that the Triple Goddess of Maiden, Mother and Crone is a male invention that both arises from and biases an androcentric view of femininity, and as such the symbolism is often devoid of real meaning or use in depth-psychology for women. { Pratt, Annis V. (1985). &quot; Spinning Among Fields: Jung, Frye, Levi-Strauss and Feminist Archetypal Theory &quot;, in Estella Lauter, Carol Schreier Rupprecht (eds.) (1985). Feminist Archetypal Theory: Interdisciplinary Re-Visions of Jungian Thought. University of Tennessee Press. ISBN 0-7837-9508-4, ISBN 978-0-7837-9508-9. } Mantecon suggests that a feminist re-visioning of the Crone symbolism away from its usual associations with &quot; death &quot; and towards &quot; wisdom &quot; can be useful in women transitioning to the menopausal phase of life and that the sense of history that comes from working with mythological symbols adds a sense of meaning to the experience. { Mantecon, Valerie H. (1993). &quot; Where Are the Archetypes? Searching for Symbols of Women&apos;s Midlife Passage &quot;, pp.83-87, in Nancy D. Davis, Ellen Cole, Esther D. Rothblum (eds.)

ISBN 1-56024-435-6, ISBN 978-1-56024-435-6. } [ Goddess Feminism and social critique ] The figure of the Triple Goddess is used by goddess feminists to critique societies&apos; roles and treatment of women. Literary critic Jeanne Roberts sees a rejection of the &quot; Crone &quot; figure by Christians in the Middle Ages as a root cause of the alleged persecuting of witches. { Roberts, Jeanne Addison (1994). The Shakespearean Wild: Geography, Genus, and Gender. University of Nebraska Press. passim. ISBN 0-8032-8950-2, ISBN 978-0-8032-8950-5. } Fantasy and science-fiction author Ursula Le Guin comments that the lack of acceptance of change for women (exemplified by the youth and beauty myth ) in contemporary society has led to an erasure of the Triple Goddess, into a single, Marilyn Monroe -faced goddess. { LeGuin, Ursula Kroeber. &quot; The Space Crone &quot;, in Ruth Formanek (ed.) (1990). The Meanings of Menopause: Historical, Medical, and Clinical Perspectives. Routledge. ISBN 0-88163-080-2, ISBN 978-0-88163-080-0. } According to Goddess Feminist Barbara G. Walker various supernatural female triads like the Gallo / Germano - Roman Matres and Matrones (frequently depicted in trios), { Walker, Barbara G. (1983). &apos;&apos;The Woman’s Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets&apos;&apos;. HarperCollins. p.619: &quot; Matres meant the Celtic Triple Goddess, or Three Fates. &quot; ISBN 0-06-250925-X, ISBN 978-0-06-250925-3. } the Greco-Roman Erinyes or Furies, or the Morrígan to whome she applies the Maiden Mother Crone model. { Barbara Walker says the &quot; triple Morrigan &quot; is &quot; the Irish trinity of Fates, &quot; composed of the virgin } { Ana, the mother } { Badb, and the crone } { Macha. — Walker, Barbara G.

ISBN 0-06-250925-X, ISBN 978-0-06-250925-3. } [ Fiction, film and literary criticism ] Author Margaret Atwood recalls reading Graves&apos;s The White Goddess at the age of 19. Atwood describes Graves&apos; concept of the Triple Goddess as employing violent and misandric imagery, and says the restrictive role this model places on creative women. Atwood says that it put her off from being a writer. { Atwood, Margaret (2002). &apos;&apos;Negotiating with the Dead: A Writer on Writing‎&apos;&apos;. Cambridge University Press. p.85. ISBN 0-521-66260-5, ISBN 978-0-521-66260-4. } Atwood&apos;s work has been noted as containing Triple Goddess motifs who sometimes appear failed and parodic. { Reingard M. Nischik (2000). Margaret Atwood: Works and Impact. Boydell &amp; Brewer. ISBN 1-57113-139-6, ISBN 978-1-57113-139-3. } Atwood&apos;s Lady Oracle has been cited as a deliberate parody of the Triple Goddess, which subverts the figure and ultimately liberates the lead female character from the oppressive model of feminine creativity that Graves constructed. { Bouson, J. Brooks (1993). Brutal Choreographies: Oppositional Strategies and Narrative Design in the Novels of Margaret Atwood. University of Massachusetts Press. ISBN 0-87023-845-0, ISBN 978-0-87023-845-1. } Literary critic Andrew D. Radford, discussing the symbolism of Thomas Hardy &apos;s 1891 novel Tess of the d&apos;Urbervilles, in terms of Myth sees the Maiden and Mother as two phases of the female lifecycle through which Tess passes, whilst the Crone phase, Tess adopts as a disguise which prepares her for harrowing experiences. { Radford, Andrew D.

ISBN 90-420-2235-3, ISBN 978-90-420-2235-5. p.127-128. } The concept of the triple goddess has been applied to a feminist reading of Shakespeare. { Roberts, Jeanne Addison. &quot; Shades of the Triple Hecate &quot;, Proceedings of the PMR Conference 12–13 (1987–88) 47–66, abstracted in John Lewis Walker, &apos;&apos;Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition&apos;&apos;, p. 248; revisited by the author in The Shakespearean Wild: Geography, Genus, and Gender (University of Nebraska Press, 1994), passim, but especially pp.142–143, 169ff.

(Review of) &apos;&apos;The Shakespearean Wild&apos;&apos; in Shakespeare Quarterly, vol.44 no.1 (Spring 1993), pp.96-100. } Thomas DeQuincey developed a female trinity, Our Lady of Tears, the Lady of Sighs and Our Lady of Darkness, in Suspiria De Profundis, which has been likened to Graves&apos;s Triple Goddess but stamped with DeQuincey&apos;s own melancholy sensibility. { Andriano, Joseph (1993). &apos;&apos;Our Ladies of Darkness: Feminine Daemonology in Male Gothic Fiction&apos;&apos;. Penn State Press. p.96. ISBN 0-271-00870-9, ISBN 978-0-271-00870-7. } The triple goddess is referenced in Marion Zimmer Bradley&apos;s book &quot; The Mists of Avalon. &quot; According to scholar Juliette Wood, modern fantasy fiction plays a large part in the conceptual landscape of the neo-pagan world. [ Wood Juliette The Concept of the Goddess Sandra Billington, Miranda Green (eds.)

ISBN 1-56097-748-5, ISBN 978-1-56097-748-3. } In Alan Garner &apos;s The Owl Service, based on the fourth branch of the Mabinogion and influenced by Robert Graves, clearly delineates the character of the Triple Goddess. Garner goes further, in his other novels making every female character intentionally represent an aspect of the Triple Goddess. { White, Donna R. (1998). &apos;&apos;A Century of Welsh Myth in Children&apos;s Literature&apos;&apos;. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.75. ISBN 0-313-30570-6, ISBN 978-0-313-30570-2. } In George R.R. Martin&apos;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, the Maid, the Mother, and the Crone are three aspects of the septune deity in the Faith of the Seven. The figure of the Triple Goddess has also been used in film criticism. Norman Holland has used Jungian criticism to explore the female characters in Alfred Hitchcock &apos;s film Vertigo using Graves&apos;s Triple Goddess motif as a reference. { Holland, Norman Norwood (2006). &apos;&apos;Meeting Movies&apos;&apos;. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p.43. ISBN 0-8386-4099-0, ISBN 978-0-8386-4099-9. } Roz Kaveney sees the main characters in James Cameron &apos;s movie Aliens as reflecting aspects of the triple goddess: The Alien Queen (Crone), Ripley (Mother) and Newt (Maiden). { Kaveney, Roz (2005). &apos;&apos;From Alien to The Matrix&apos;&apos;. I.B.Tauris. p.151. ISBN 1-85043-806-4, ISBN 978-1-85043-806-9. } One of the most popular songs performed by the American heavy metal band The Sword is, &quot; Maiden, Mother &amp; Crone &quot;, with lyrics describing an encounter with the Triple Goddess. It was featured on their album Gods of the Earth. The official video prominently features the three aspects of the goddess and a waxing, full, and waning moon. { http://radioexile.com/2010/08/21/video-hook-up-the-sword-maiden-mother-crone/ } A book written by Michael J Scott called The Alchemyst features a character known as Hekate. She is personified as a woman who changes age through the cycle of the day, starting in the morning as a girl, then aging to an adult woman, and finally becoming an old woman as the day draws to a close before dying and being reborn at the beginning of the next day. Each day she would start the cycle anew. In the Discworld series by Terry Prachett, the three Lancre witches often refer to the members of their covenant as &quot; The Maiden, the Mother, and... the Other One &quot;.
