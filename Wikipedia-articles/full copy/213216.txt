In addition to mobile and &quot; stabile &quot; sculpture, Alexander Calder also created paintings, lithographs, toys, tapestry, jewelry and household objects. [ Childhood ] Alexander &quot; Sandy &quot; Calder was born in Lawnton, Pennsylvania, on July 22, 1898. His father, Alexander Stirling Calder, was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in Philadelphia. Calder’s grandfather, sculptor Alexander Milne Calder, was born in Scotland and immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868. He is best known for the colossal statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia&apos;s City Hall tower. Calder’s mother, Nanette Lederer Calder, was a professional portrait painter who studied at the Académie Julian and the Sorbonne in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She then moved to Philadelphia where she met Alexander Stirling Calder while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Calder’s parents were married on February 22,1895. Calder&apos;s sister, Margaret &quot; Peggy &quot; Calder, was born in 1896. Her married name was Margaret Calder Hayes, and she was instrumental in the development of the UC Berkeley Art Museum. { Hayes, Margaret Calder, Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir. Middlebury, VT: Paul S Eriksson, 1977. } In 1902, Calder posed nude for his father’s sculpture The Man Cub, which is now located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. That year, he completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant. { Calder 1966, p. 13. } Three years later, Stirling Calder contracted tuberculosis and Calder’s parents moved to a ranch in Oracle, Arizona, leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year. { Calder 1966, p. 15. } The children were reunited with their parents in late March 1906 and stayed at the ranch in Arizona until fall of the same year. [ http://www.calder.org/ Calder Foundation Calder.org July 21, 2011 ] After Arizona, the Calder family moved to Pasadena, California. The windowed cellar of the family home became Calder&apos;s first studio and he received his first set of tools. He used scraps of copper wire that he found in the streets to make jewelry and beads for his sister’s dolls. On January 1, 1907, Calder’s mother took him to the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, where he observed a four-horse-chariot race. This style of event later became the finale of Calder’s wire circus shows. { Calder 1966, pp. 21–22. } In 1909, when Calder was in the fourth grade, he sculpted a dog and a duck out of sheet brass as Christmas gifts for his parents. The sculptures were three dimensional and the duck was kinetic because it rocked when gently tapped. These sculptures are frequently cited as early examples of Calder’s skill. { Hayes, Margaret Calder, Three Alexander Calders: A Family Memoir. Middlebury, VT: Paul S Eriksson, 1977, p. 41. } In 1910, the Calder family moved back to Philadelphia, where Alexander briefly attended the Germantown Academy, and then moved to Croton-on-Hudson in New York State. { Calder 1966, pp. 28–29. } In Croton, during his early high school years, Calder was befriended by painter Everett Shinn with whom he built a gravity powered system of mechanical trains. Calder described it, &quot; We ran the train on wooden rails held by spikes; a chunk of iron racing down the incline speeded the cars. We even lit up some cars with candle lights &quot;. { Calder 1966, p. 31 } After Croton, the Calders moved to Spuyten Duyvil to be closer to the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City, where Stirling Calder rented a studio. While living in Spuyten Duyvil, Calder attended Yonkers High. In 1912, Stirling Calder was appointed acting chief of the Department of Sculpture of the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. { http://calder.org/chronology/period/1898-1930/10 } He began work on sculptures for the exposition that was held in 1915. During Alexander Calder’s high school years between 1912 and 1915, the Calder family moved back and forth between New York and California. In each new location, Calder’s parents reserved cellar space as a studio for their son. Toward the end of this period, Calder stayed with friends in California while his parents moved back to New York, so that he could graduate from Lowell High School in San Francisco. Calder graduated in the class of 1915. [ Life and career ] In the summer of 1916, Calder spent five weeks training at the Plattsburg Civilian Military Training Camp. In 1918, he joined the Student’s Army Training Corps, Naval Section, at Stevens and was made guide of the battalion. [ http://www.calder.org/life/page/biography.html Calder Biography Calder Foundation July 31, 2011 ] In 1919, Calder decided to study mechanical engineering, and enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and excelled in mathematics. I learned to talk out of the side of my mouth and have never been quite able to correct it since. Calder 1966, p. 47. Calder received a degree from Stevens in 1919. For the next several years, he held a variety of engineering jobs, including working as a hydraulic engineer and a draughtsman for the New York Edison Company. In June 1922, Calder found work as a mechanic on the passenger ship H. F. Alexander. While the ship sailed from San Francisco to New York City, Calder worked on deck off the Guatemalan Coast and witnessed both the sun rising and the moon setting on opposite horizons. He described in his autobiography, &quot; It was early one morning on a calm sea, off Guatemala, when over my couch—a coil of rope—I saw the beginning of a fiery red sunrise on one side and the moon looking like a silver coin on the other. &quot; { Calder 1966, pp. 54–55. } The H.F. Alexander docked in San Francisco and Calder traveled up to Aberdeen, Washington, where his sister lived with her husband, Kenneth Hayes. Calder took a job as a timekeeper at a logging camp. The mountain scenery inspired him to write home to request paints and brushes. Shortly after this, Calder decided to move back to New York to pursue a career as an artist. { signature work by Calder - } { Montreal Museum of Fine Arts } Calder moved to New York and enrolled at the Art Students&apos; League, studying briefly with Thomas Hart Benton, George Luks, Kenneth Hayes Miller, and John Sloan. { Calder Guggenheim Collection. } While a student, he worked for the National Police Gazette where, in 1925, one of his assignments was sketching the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. Calder became fascinated with the circus, a theme that would reappear in his later work. In 1926, Calder moved to Paris where he established a studio at 22 rue Daguerre in the Montparnasse Quarter. In June 1929, while traveling by boat from Paris to New York, Calder met his future wife, Louisa James, grandniece of author Henry James and philosopher William James. They married in 1931. While in Paris, Calder met and became friends with a number of avant-garde artists, including Joan Miró, Jean Arp, and Marcel Duchamp. Calder and Louisa returned to America in 1933 to settle in a farmhouse they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut, where they raised a family (first daughter, Sandra born 1935, second daughter, Mary, in 1939). In 1955 Alexander and Louisa Calder travelled around in India for three months, where Calder produced nine sculptures as well as some jewellery. { Calder in India, 31 May – 3 August 2012 Ordovas, London. } In 1962, Calder settled into his new workshop Carroi, which was of a futuristic design and overlooked the valley of the Lower Chevrière to Saché in Indre-et-Loire (France). He did not hesitate to offer his gouache s and small mobiles to his friends in the country, he even donated to the town a stabile trônant, which since 1974 is situated front of the church: an anti-sculpture free from gravity. Throughout his artistic career, Calder named many of his works in French, regardless of where they were destined for eventual display. In 1966, Calder published his Autobiography with Pictures with the help of his son-in-law, Jean Davidson. Calder died unexpectedly on November 11, 1976, shortly after opening a major retrospective show at the Whitney Museum in New York. [ Artistic work ] [ Cirque Calder and toys ] In 1926, at the suggestion of a Serbia n toy merchant in Paris, Calder began to make toys. At the urging of fellow sculptor Jose de Creeft, he submitted them to the Salon des Humoristes. Later that fall, Calder began to create his Cirque Calder, a miniature circus fashioned from wire, string, rubber, cloth, and other found objects. Designed to fit into suitcases (it eventually grew to fill five), the circus was portable, and allowed Calder to hold performances on both sides of the Atlantic. He gave improvised shows, recreating the performance of a real circus. Soon, his Cirque Calder { http://ubu.artmob.ca/video/Calder-Alexander_Le-cirque.avi } (usually on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at present) became popular with the Parisian avant-garde. In 1927, Calder returned to the United States. He designed several kinetic wooden push and pull toys for children, which were mass-produced by the Gould Manufacturing Company, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. His originals, as well as playable replicas, are on display in the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Throughout the 1930s, Calder continued to give Cirque Calder performances, but he also worked with choreographer Martha Graham, designing stage sets for her ballets and created a moving stage construction to accompany Eric Satie &apos;s Socrate in 1936. [ Sculpture ] The Cirque Calder can be seen as the start of Calder&apos;s interest in both wire sculpture and kinetic art. He maintained a sharp eye with respect to the engineering balance of the sculptures and utilized these to develop the kinetic sculptures Marcel Duchamp would ultimately dub as &quot; mobiles, &quot; a French pun meaning both &quot; mobile &quot; and &quot; motive. &quot; He designed some of the characters in the circus to perform suspended from a thread. In 1929, Calder had his first solo show of wire sculpture, in Paris at Galerie Billiet. The painter Jules Pascin, a friend of Calder&apos;s from the cafes of Montparnasse, wrote the preface to the catalog. A visit to Piet Mondrian &apos;s studio in 1930 &quot; shocked &quot; him into embracing abstract art. [ Alexander Calder: The Great Discovery http://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/index.php?id%3D037076 Gemeentemuseum den Haag Gemeentemuseum den Haag 2012-04-08 ] It was the mixture of his experiments to develop purely abstract sculpture following his visit with Mondrian that led to his first truly kinetic sculptures, manipulated by means of cranks and pulleys, that would become his signature artworks. Calder’s kinetic sculptures are regarded as being amongst the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of motion and change as aesthetic factors. { Alexander Calder Fondation Beyeler, Riehen. } By the end of 1931, he moved on to more delicate sculptures which derived their motion from the air currents in the room, using cutout shapes reminiscent of natural forms (birds, fish, falling leaves). { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Ghost&apos;&apos; (1964) Philadelphia Museum of Art. } Dating from 1932, Calder’s first hanging sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by the wind were christened “mobiles” by Marcel Duchamp. { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Romulus and Remus&apos;&apos; (1928) Guggenheim Collection. } They were followed from 1934 by pieces which were set in motion by air currents. { Alexander Calder Tate Collection. } At the same time, Calder was also experimenting with self-supporting, static, abstract sculptures, dubbed &quot; stabiles &quot; by Jean Arp in 1932 to differentiate them from mobiles. In 1935-1936 he produced a number of works made largely of carved wood. During World War II, Calder attempted to join the Marines as a camofleur, but was rejected. Instead, he continued to sculpt, but a scarcity of metal led to him again producing work in carved wood. Calder set about creating new works such as Seven Horizontal Discs (1946), which he was able to dismantle and send by mail despite the stringent size restrictions imposed by the postal service at the time. { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Seven Horizontal Discs &apos;&apos; (1946) } { Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 8 November 2011, New York. } Once the war was over, Calder began to cut shapes from sheet metal into evocative forms and would hand-paint them in his characteristically pure hues of black, red, blue, and white. { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Untitled&apos;&apos; (1948) } { Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 10 November 2010, New York. } Calder created a small group of works from around this period with a hanging base-plate, for example Lily of Force (1945), Baby Flat Top (1946), and Red is Dominant (1947). Largely comprising a range of hanging and standing Mobiles, his 1946 show at the Galerie Louis Carré in Paris made a huge impact, as did the essays for the catalogue which was especially written, at the artist&apos;s invitation, by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and curator James Johnson Sweeney. { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Lily of Force&apos;&apos; (1945) } { Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 8 May 2012, New York. } In 1951, Calder devised a new kind of mobile/stabile combination, related structurally to his constellations. These &quot; towers, &quot; affixed to the wall with a nail, consist of wire struts and beams that jut out from the wall, with moving objects suspended from their armatures. { Calder. Gravity and Grace, March 18, 2003 - October 07, 2003 } { Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. } After 1965, an intermediate maquette, usually about one-fifth the final size, was often fabricated to test the wind resistance and to refine the structure. { Alexander Calder National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. } [ Monumental works ] { Expo 67, on } { Saint Helen&apos;s Island } { Parc Jean-Drapeau, } { Montréal, Quebec } In the 1930s, the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts gave Calder his first public commission, a pair of mobiles designed for the Museum&apos;s new theater. { Alexander Calder: An Artist at Play Berkshire Museum, Pittsfield. } In the 1950s, Calder increasingly concentrated his efforts on producing monumental sculptures (his self-described period of &quot; agrandissements &quot; ) { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Le Rouge de Saché&apos;&apos; (1954) } { Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 8 May 2012, New York. }. Notable examples are.125 for JFK Airport in 1957, La Spirale for UNESCO in Paris 1958 and Man (L&apos;Homme), commissioned for Expo 67 in Montreal, Canada. Calder&apos;s largest sculpture until that time, 20.5  meters high, was El Sol Rojo, constructed outside the Aztec Stadium for the 1968 Summer Olympics &quot; Cultural Olympiad &quot; events in Mexico City. Calder made his first outdoor works in his Roxbury, Connecticut studio, using the same techniques and materials as his smaller works. Exhibited outside, Calder&apos;s initial standing mobiles moved elegantly in the breeze, bobbing and swirling in natural, spontaneous rhythms. In fact, the first few outdoor works were too delicate for strong winds, which forced Calder to rethink his fabrication process. In 1936, he responded to the problem, changing his working methods. He began to create smaller scale maquette s that he then enlarged to monumental size. The small metal maquette, the first step in the production of a monumental sculpture, was already for Calder a sculpture in its own right. The larger works were made under his direction, using the classic enlargement techniques used in different ways by traditional sculptors, including his father and grandfather. Calder began to draw his designs on brown craft paper, which he enlarged using a grid. His large-scale works were created according to his exact specifications, while also allowing him the liberty to adjust or correct a shape or line if necessary. { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Red Curlicue &apos;&apos; (1973) } { Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 10 November 2010, New York. } { Grand Rapids, Michigan } He made most of his monumental stabiles and mobiles during this time [ May 2012 ] at Etablissements Biémont in Tours, France. Calder would create a model of his work, the research department (headed by M. Porcheron, with Alain Roy, François Lopez, Michel Juigner...) would scale it up to final size, and then experienced boilermakers would complete the actual metalwork — all under Calder&apos;s watchful eye. Stabiles were made in carbon steel sheet metal, then painted in black or in primary color s. Some lightweight mobiles were made of aluminum or duralumin alloy. An exception was Man (L&apos;homme), stainless steel 24  meters tall, which was commissioned by International Nickel Company of Canada (Inco). In June 1969, Calder attended the dedication of his monumental stabile La Grande Vitesse in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This sculpture is notable for being the first public work of art in the United States to be funded with federal monies; acquired with funds granted from the then new National Endowment for the Arts under its “Art for Public Places” program. Calder created a sculpture called WTC Stabile (also known as Bent Propeller), which in 1971 was installed at the entrance of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower in New York City. When Battery Park City opened, the sculpture was moved to Vesey and Church Streets.

[ http://www.mcachicago.org/information/history.php?page%3Dihist History of the MCA Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago August 7, 2011 ] [ Painting and printmaking ] { BMW 3.0 CSL painted by Calder } In addition to sculptures, Calder painted throughout his career, beginning in the early 1920s. He picked up his study of printmaking after moving to Paris in 1926, and continued to produce illustrations for books and journals. { Alexander Calder: Printmaker, October 30, 2009 - January 31, 2010 Bruce Museum, Greenwich, CT. } His many projects from this period include pen-and-ink line drawings of animals for a 1931 publication of Aesop ’s fables. As Calder’s sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the mid-1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints from 1967 and 1969 protesting the Vietnam War. { Bejamin Genocchio (December 18, 2009) Beyond the Mobiles } { New York Times. } As Calder’s professional reputation erupted in the late 1940s and 1950s, so did his production of prints. Masses of lithographs based on his gouache paintings hit the market, and deluxe editions of plays, poems, and short stories illustrated with fine art prints by Calder became available for sale. By 1973, Braniff International Airways commissioned him to paint a full-size DC-8-62 as a &quot; flying canvas. &quot; In 1975, Calder completed a second airplane, this time a Boeing 727–291, as a tribute to the US Bicentennial. In 1975, he was commissioned to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL which would come to be the first vehicle in the BMW Art Car Project. He had been working on a third airplane, entitled Salute to Mexico, when he died. [ Jewelry ] Calder created 1,800 pieces of jewelry over the course of his career, many of them as gifts for friends and relatives. Several pieces reflect Calder&apos;s fascination with art from Africa and other continents. { Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan (December 11, 2008), The Intimate Side of Alexander Calder } { Wall Street Journal. } They were mostly made of brass and steel, with bits of ceramic, wood and glass. Calder rarely used solder; when he needed to join strips of metal, he linked them with loops, bound them with snippets of wire or fashioned rivets. { Karen Rosenberg (December 11, 2008), Calder’s Precious Metals: Who Needs Diamonds? } { New York Times. } Calder created his first pieces in 1906 at the age of eight for his sister&apos;s dolls using scraps of metal he found in the street. { Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan (December 11, 2008), The Intimate Side of Alexander Calder } { Wall Street Journal. } For his lifelong friend Joan Miró, he set a shard of a broken porcelain vessel in a brass ring. Peggy Guggenheim received enormous silver mobile earrings and later commissioned a hammered silver headboard that shimmered with dangling fish. { Carol Kino (December 2, 2007), Precious Metals } { New York Times. } In 1942, Guggenheim wore one Calder earring and one by Yves Tanguy to the opening of her New York gallery, The Art of This Century, to demonstrate her equal loyalty to Surrealist and abstract art, examples of which she displayed in separate galleries. { Roberta Smith (May 13, 2010), Shedding New Light on Old Friends } { New York Times. } Others who were presented with Calder&apos;s pieces were the artist&apos;s close friend, Georgia O&apos;Keeffe; Alexina Duchamp, wife of Marcel Duchamp; Jeanne Rucar, wife of the filmmaker Luis Buñuel; and Bella Rosenfeld, wife of Marc Chagall. { Calder Jewelry The San Diego Museum of Art, San Diego. } [ Exhibitions ] Calder room at National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Calder&apos;s first solo exhibition came in 1927, at the Gallery of Jacques Seligmann in Paris. { Alexander Calder L &amp; M Arts, New York/Los Angeles. } In 1928, his first solo show in a US commercial gallery was at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. In 1933, he exhibited with the Abstraction-Création group in Paris. In 1935, he had his first solo museum exhibition in the United States at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago. In New York, he was championed from the early 1930s by the Museum of Modern Art, and was one of three Americans to be included in Alfred H. Barr Jr. &apos;s 1936 exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art. { Roberta Smith (March 27, 1998) All Calder, High and Low } { New York Times. } Calder&apos;s first retrospective was held in 1938 at George Walter Vincent Smith Gallery in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1943, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a well-received Calder retrospective, curated by James Johnson Sweeney and Marcel Duchamp; the show had to be extended due to the sheer number of visitors. { Alexander Calder, &apos;&apos;Seven Horizontal Discs&apos;&apos; (1946) } { Christie&apos;s Post-War and Contemporary Evening Sale, 8 November 2011, New York. } Calder was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. His mobile, International Mobile was the centerpiece of the exhibition. Calder also participated in documenta s I (1955), II (1959), III (1964). Since Calder&apos;s death, his work has now been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions, including Alexander Calder, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark, 1995 (traveled to: Moderna Museet, Stockholm; Musée d&apos;art moderne, Paris, in 1996); Alexander Calder: 1898-1976, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1998 (traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ); Calder: Gravity and Grace, Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, 2003 (traveled to Reina Sofia, Madrid); The Surreal Calder, Menil Collection, Houston, 2005-2006 (traveled to San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Minneapolis Institute of Arts ); Calder Jewelry, Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, 2008 (traveled to Philadelphia Museum of Art; Metropolitan Museum, New York; Irish Museum of Modern Art; San Diego Museum of Art; Grand Rapids Art Museum); Alexander Calder: The Paris Years, 1926-1933, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 2008 (traveled to the Centre Pompidou, Paris; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto); Calder, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Rome, 2009–2010; and Alexander Calder: A Balancing Act, Seattle Art Museum, 2009–2010. { Alexander Calder, February 8 - March 26, 2011 } { Gagosian Gallery, London. } From February 11 through May 28, 2012 the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague has an exhibition about Calder, including his relationship with Piet Mondrian. [ Collections ] Calder&apos;s work is in many permanent collections across the world. The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, has the largest body of work by Alexander Calder in any museum. { Alexander Calder: The Paris Years, 1926–1933, October 16, 2008 – February 15, 2009 Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. } Other important museum collections include the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. { Alexander Calder, February 8 - March 26, 2011   } { Gagosian Gallery, London. } The Philadelphia Museum of Art offers a view of works by three generations of Alexander Calders.

[ Recognition ] In 1952, Calder represented the United States at the Venice Biennale and was awarded the main prize for sculpture. He also won the First Prize for Sculpture at the 1958 Pittsburgh International. [ Art market ] In the late 1930s and early 1940s, even as Calder’s international acclaim was growing, his works were still not highly sought after, and when they sold, it was often for relatively little money. A copy of a Pierre Matisse sales ledger in the foundation’s files shows that only a few pieces in the 1941 show found buyers, one of whom, Solomon R. Guggenheim, paid all of $233.34 — or about $3,500 in today’s money — for a work. (The Museum of Modern Art had bought its first Calder in 1934 for $60, after talking Calder down from $100.) { Randy Kennedy (October 18, 2011), A Year in the Work of Calder } { New York Times. } In 2010, his metal mobile Untitled (Autumn Leaves), sold at Sotheby’s New York for $3.7 million. Another mobile, titled Red Curlicue (1973), brought $6.35 million at Christie&apos;s later that year. { Souren Melikian (November 11, 2010), At Christie&apos;s, Mockery Brings in Millions } { New York Times. } Also at Christie&apos;s, a standing mobile called Lily of Force (1945), which was estimated to sell for $8 million to $12 million, was bought for $18.5 million in 2012. { Carol Vogel (May 8, 2012), Record Sales for a Rothko and Other Art at Christie’s } { New York Times. } Galerie Maeght in Paris became Calder&apos;s exclusive Parisian dealer in 1950. His association with Galerie Maeght lasted twenty-six years, until his death. After his New York dealer Curt Valentin died unexpectedly in 1954, Calder selected the Perls Gallery in New York as his new American dealer, and this alliance also lasted until the end of his life. { Alexander Calder - Biography Calder Foundation. } [ Legacy ] { Olympic Sculpture Park, } { Seattle, Washington } Two months after his death, Calder was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&apos; highest civilian honor, by President Gerald Ford. However, representatives of the Calder family boycotted the January 10, 1977 ceremony &quot; to make a statement favoring amnesty for Vietnam War draft resisters. &quot; In 1987, the Calder Foundation was founded by Calder&apos;s family. The Foundation &quot; runs its own programs, collaborates on exhibitions and publications, and gives advice on matters such as the history, assembly, and restoration of works by Calder. &quot; [ http://calder.org/foundation/page/trustees.html Calder Foundation website: Trustees page Calder.org July 21, 2011 ] The foundation has large holdings, with some works owned by family members and others by foundation supporters.

The committee includes dealers, scholars, museum curators and members of the Calder family. { Daniel Grant (September 29, 1996), The tricky art of authentication } { Baltimore Sun. } After having worked mainly on cataloging Calder’s works, the Calder Foundation is now focusing on organizing global exhibitions for the artist. { Jacob Hale Russell (July 29, 2006), Look Who’s Selling --- Once-quiet artists’ foundations are becoming power players, } { The Wall Street Journal. } After similar ideas were developed for New York in 1998, plans for a museum devoted to Calder in Philadelphia were announced in 2000. The proposed 35,000-square-foot Calder museum, designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, was to be located on a two-acre lot.

Out of different masses, tight, heavy, middling—indicated by variations of size or color—directional line—vectors which represent speeds, velocities, accelerations, forces, etc....—these directions making between them meaningful angles, and senses, together defining one big conclusion or many. Spaces, volumes, suggested by the smallest means in contrast to their mass, or even including them, juxtaposed, pierced by vectors, crossed by speeds. Nothing at all of this is fixed. Each element able to move, to stir, to oscillate, to come and go in its relationships with the other elements in its universe. It must not be just a fleeting moment but a physical bond between the varying events in life. Not extractions, But abstractions Abstractions that are like nothing in life except in their manner of reacting. &quot; { Alexander Calder, &quot; Comment réaliser l&apos;art? &quot; from Abstraction-Création, Art Non Figuratif, no. 1, 1932 } – From Abstraction-Création, Art Non Figuratif, no. 1, 1932.
