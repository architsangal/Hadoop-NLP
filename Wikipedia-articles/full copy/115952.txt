The population was 17,494 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland – South Portland – Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. [ History ] Originally known as Saccarappa after Saccarappa Falls on the Presumpscot River, it was a part of Falmouth (now Portland ) until February 14, 1814, when it was set off and incorporated as Stroudwater. It soon changed its name to Westbrook after Colonel Thomas Westbrook, a commander during Father Rale&apos;s War and King&apos;s mast agent who was an early settler and mill operator.

In 1829, a sawmill was built at the former which made the mill town noted for its lumber. Other industries followed, manufacturing grain bags, machinery and water wheel s, carriage and harness, boot s, shoes and moccasin s, tinware, leather board, bricks, wooden boxes, box shook, meal and flour. The Portland Manufacturing Company built a cotton textile mill at Saccarappa Falls for making &quot; sheetings, stripes and ducks. &quot; A paper mill was built at Cumberland Mills, once an Indian planting ground known as Ammoncongin. By 1859, it produced 1,000 tons of paper annually. In 1867, the factory&apos;s name would change to the S. D. Warren Paper Mill. [ Coolidge Austin J. John B.

D. Warren Paper Mill, was once the city&apos;s largest employer and taxpayer, employing over 3,000 people and representing over 50% of the city&apos;s tax base.
