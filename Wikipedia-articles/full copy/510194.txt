[ December 2010 ] [ December 2007 ] A63(T) trunk road A trunk road, trunk highway, or strategic road is a major road —usually connecting two or more cities, port s, airport s, and other places —which is the recommended route for long-distance and freight traffic. Many trunk roads have segregated lanes in a dual carriageway, or are of motorway standard. [ United Kingdom ] In the United Kingdom, Trunk Roads were first defined for Great Britain in the Trunk Roads Act 1936. Thirty major road s were classed as Trunk Roads and the Minister of Transport took direct control of them and the bridges across them. This development did not extend to Northern Ireland, which has always had a separate system of highway and road traffic law. At that time, [ 4500 mi km ] of British road were classified as Trunk Roads. Additional roads have been &apos;trunked&apos;, notably in the Trunk Roads Act 1946. Others, like virtually all British motorway s, have entered the system as a result of new construction. As of 2004, Great Britain has 7,845 miles (12,625  km) of Trunk Roads, of which 2,161 miles (3,478  km) are motorways. Trunk roads in England are managed by the Highways Agency. Scotland has had responsibility for its own trunk roads since 1955; these are currently managed by Transport Scotland. Wales has had responsibility for its trunk roads since 1965. Mileage [ 4,814 mi ] [ 1,982 miles ] [ 1,048 miles ]... of trunk roads, inclusive of motorways. The Highways Agency also have a full network map of trunk roads and motorways in England. Most interurban trunk roads are &quot; primary routes &quot;, the category of roads recommended for long distance and freight transport. Not all primary routes are trunk roads, the difference being that maintenance of trunk roads is paid for by national government bodies rather than the local councils in whose area they lie. Primary routes are identified by their direction signs, which feature white text on a green background with route numbers in yellow. Trunk roads, like other &apos;A&apos; roads, can be either single- or dual-carriageway. Historically trunk roads were listed on maps with a &quot; T &quot; in brackets after their number to distinguish them from non-trunk parts of the same road, however this suffix is no longer included on current Ordnance Survey maps which simply distinguish between primary and non-primary &apos;A&apos; roads. A trunk road which has been upgraded to motorway standard may retain its original &quot; A &quot; number but with an &quot; M &quot; in brackets to denote that motorway regulations apply on it. Long distance examples of this are the A1(M) in England, and the A74(M) in Scotland. [ De-trunking: United Kingdom ] It is possible for roads to become &apos;de-trunked&apos; to non-trunk roads (county &apos;A&apos; roads in the UK), for example when superseded by a motorway following a similar route. When a road is &apos;detrunked&apos; signposts are often replaced, making the route of the original road harder to follow. In some places however, the road number will change and will usually be signposted in the style &quot; B000, was A00 &quot;, although repeated changes can lead to such oddities as &quot; A5183, was A5 &quot; (between St Albans and Redbourn ). In England the government has de-trunked much of the trunk road network since the late 1990s, transferring responsibility to local councils to allow the Highways Agency to concentrate on a selection of core trunk routes, mostly dual carriageways and motorways. [ Ireland ] In Ireland major roads were previously classified under an old system as Trunk Roads, and had route numbers prefixed by &quot; T &quot;. Connecting roads were classified as Link Roads, and had route numbers prefixed by &quot; L &quot;. Many of these roads had their origins in historic routes, including turnpike road s. Although a number of old road signs using these route designations may still be encountered, Ireland has long since adopted a newer classification scheme of National Primary and National Secondary routes ( &quot; N &quot; roads), Regional road s ( &quot; R &quot; roads), and Local roads ( &quot; L &quot; -prefixed roads). Local roads were previously not signposted, although they are now signposted in many areas of the country. The current &quot; L &quot; -prefixed Local roads are not connected with the previous &quot; L &quot; -prefixed Link Road classification. [ De-trunking:Ireland ] Some former Trunk Roads, or sections of former Trunk Roads, became non-trunk Regional roads under the new road numbering system introduced in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, sections of some National Primary routes which have been bypassed by motorways or other road improvement schemes have been downgraded to Regional road status. [ United States ] Though the term trunk road is not commonly used in American English, the U.S. highway and Interstate highway systems can be considered American trunk highways. However, individual states are responsible for actual highway construction and maintenance, even though the federal government helps fund these activities as long as the states enact certain laws and enforce them. (Such laws have included the raising of the minimum drinking age and the lowering of speed limits.) Each state maintains all of its roads and tries to integrate them into a system appropriate for that state. Notably, the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin designate their highways as &quot; state trunklines &quot; and &quot; state trunk highways, &quot; respectively. { Numbered highways in the United States } [ China ] China has begun development of the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), which will create many east-west and north-south highways, plus seven radials heading out of the capital, Beijing. [ France ] [ Route nationale (France) ] [ Poland ] [ National roads in Poland ] [ Sweden ] The most important roads in Sweden are labelled national trunk road. In 1992, the parliament decided upon which roads were to become national trunk roads. They are considered recommended main roads for long-distance traffic. National trunk roads are planned nationally, as opposed to other roads who are planned locally. They also have a special, slightly larger budget. However, they aren&apos;t signed in any special way. Therefore drivers will not notice any difference in signage, numbering, road standard or map marking from other national roads. Some national roads are only considered trunk for part of their length. National road 73 and National road 75 are both built to motorway standard, have high traffic but are not considered trunk. European route s are always trunk everywhere in Sweden, and are more visible with special numbering.
