Other Acid Jazz artists such as &apos;Moses Mayes&apos; and Groove Collective are popular comparisons. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as pop, rock and electronica. Their best known track is &quot; Virtual Insanity &quot;, which won four awards at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. Jamiroquai have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1998.

[ http://music.yahoo.com/ar-252859-bio--Jamiroquai Jamiroquai Biography on Yahoo! Music 2007-10-04 Greg Prato Yahoo! Inc. ] The original band was Jay Kay ( vocals ), Toby Smith ( keyboard ), Stuart Zender ( bass ), Nick Van Gelder ( drums ) and Wallis Buchanan ( didgeridoo ). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and production of the first album. The lineup of the band has changed several times, and the longest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter Jason &quot; Jay &quot; Kay and drummer Derrick McKenzie (since 1994). Kay was the impetus behind the formation of Jamiroquai, deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer of the Brand New Heavies. Despite his self-professed attempts to treat Jamiroquai as a band, Kay has always been at the forefront of how the group is marketed, and has therefore always had the lion&apos;s share of media attention. [ Sony Music ] Jamiroquai&apos;s first single, &quot; When You Gonna Learn &quot;, was released in 1992 on the Acid Jazz label. Following its success, Kay signed an eight-album record deal with Sony Music Entertainment. The first Sony album, Emergency on Planet Earth was released in 1993. It was followed in 1994 by The Return of the Space Cowboy. The single &quot; Space Cowboy &quot; gained notice on the charts and in club rotation. While Jamiroquai was growing in popularity in the UK, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, they remained relatively unknown to U.S and other international audiences. The band&apos;s American breakthrough came with the third album, Travelling Without Moving in 1996, which yielded two big hits, &quot; Virtual Insanity &quot; and &quot; Cosmic Girl &quot;. The success of &quot; Virtual Insanity &quot; was due in part to its Jonathan Glazer -directed video, which featured Kay&apos;s dance moves and some physics-defying images. At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, the creative music video for &quot; Virtual Insanity &quot; won four awards; Best Video, Best Special Effects, Best Cinematography, and Breakthrough Video, and the band performed the song at the ceremony. { 1997 MTV Video Music Awards MTV.com. Retrieved 5 December 2011 } In 1998, Jamiroquai released &quot; Deeper Underground &quot;, the first single from their fourth studio album, Synkronized, which also appeared in the soundtrack for the 1998 movie Godzilla. The acid jazz flavours and ethnic influences of the first three albums continued with the release of Synkronized, and Jay Kay&apos;s interest in funk and disco music were shifting the band&apos;s directions towards such. By their fifth album, A Funk Odyssey (2001), they had evolved so drastically, that some critics and listeners would remark they lost the &apos;Jamiroquai sound&apos;. With the departure of more and more original band members, including Wallis Buchanan and his didgeridoo, Jamiroquai had become a very different band than that of 1992. In spite of the changes, the fifth album&apos;s first single, &quot; Little L &quot;, reached #1 in many charts worldwide. In 2003 Jamiroquai compiled and mixed a DJ mix album for the Late Night Tales series for Azuli Records. The track selection shows some of the band&apos;s funk, soul and disco influences, including tracks from The Pointer Sisters, The Commodores, Johnny &quot; Hammond &quot; Smith and Johnny &quot; Guitar &quot; Watson. Their sixth album, titled Dynamite was released on 20 June 2005. It reached #3 on the UK charts. The first single, &quot; Feels Just Like It Should &quot; was released early in June, the second, &quot; Seven Days in Sunny June &quot; released on 15 August 2005, followed by the third, &quot; (Don&apos;t) Give Hate A Chance &quot; on 7 November 2005. Jamiroquai released a greatest hits collection, High Times: Singles 1992-2006 in November 2006. The release of this album marked the end of Kay’s eight-album contract with Sony. The album reached the number 1 spot in the UK album chart after its first week of release. The album featured two new tracks, &quot; Runaway &quot; and &quot; Radio &quot;. On 18 September 2006, &quot; Runaway &quot; was given its first play by UK radio stations. It was released as a single on 30 October 2006. Kay remarked that compilation was released purely out of contractual obligation: &quot; 2006, they&apos;re out of the picture. &quot; [ http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/mad-hatter/2005/11/24/1132703291988.html Mad hatter 2005-11-25 2005-11-29 The Sydney Morning Herald ] Jamiroquai have had 13 nominations for The Brit Awards, and have yet to win one.

[ Buffalo Man ] Buffalo Man is the name of the silhouette character featured on most of the covers of Jamiroquai&apos;s releases. It was created by Jay Kay between 1992 and 1993. The original Buffalo Man slightly modified since 1997. [ Origins ] Buffalo Man was created sometime prior to the release of their 1992 single When You Gonna Learn. Allegedly it was originally sketched by the band&apos;s primary songwriter and front-man Jason Kay, as Buffalo Man is seemingly a self portrait silhouette of Jason wearing a buffalo hat. The mark has been used on almost every commercial (and sometimes non-commercial) release of the band&apos;s output in some form or another; usually the unique symbol is pictured unaltered, but there have been times where it is shown in a stylised manner to suit the artwork or song. { (Don&apos;t) Give Hate a Chance music video. } [ Notable variations ] Over the years, Buffalo Man has seen some temporary changes or interesting thematic uses: &quot; Half the Man &quot;, The Return of the Space Cowboy For the single &quot; Half The Man &quot;, Buffalo Man is on the cover as a keyring with a heart in the clasp representing the fact it is a love song and the keyring itself is split down the middle in two halves to represent the song title. Buffalo Man also has a silver heart. &quot; Space Cowboy &quot;, The Return of the Space Cowboy For the single &quot; Space Cowboy &quot;, Buffalo Man is present on the cover as a shaped cigarette paper for a half-complete cannabis joint, in reference to the song&apos;s praise of the drug. &quot; Virtual Insanity &quot;, Travelling Without Moving For the single of &quot; Virtual Insanity &quot;, Buffalo Man appears in the place of the Ferrari horse in an homage to Jason&apos;s love of sports cars. For the album cover to Travelling Without Moving, the artwork is similar, but takes on an embossed effect and is seen on a metal grille. &quot; Cosmic Girl &quot;, &quot; Everyday &quot; For these two releases, Buffalo Man is pictured with a star over his heart and two intersecting orbital rings. Synkronized While the design remained fundamentally unaltered, Buffalo Man has been turned into a laser-cut mirror and photographed from interesting angles by Midori Tsukagoshi. On some editions, for the disc itself, no ink has been used on the character, but the same stone background found on the front cover has been used for the rest of the disc, thus allowing the consumer to recreate the photographed effect. A Funk Odyssey For this album, the Buffalo Man was notably absent from the cover; instead, the laser lights formed an outline of the Buffalo Man logo, which could be seen much more clearly in the album&apos;s liner notes. DynamiteThe US release and the double-disc Australian Tour Edition featured a gold Buffalo Man. Other releases saw a picture of Jay Kay instead. Rock Dust Light Star The letter &quot; i &quot; in the title is replaced with the Buffalo Man, making the first appearance in a Jamiroquai album cover since 1999&apos;s Synkronized (not counting the alternative artwork for Dynamite). [ Text logo ] The regular text logo. { Just like the Buffalo Man, the Jamiroquai text logo has also had several variations depending on the theme. The oldest version of the logo is the one seen on the } { Acid Jazz Records release of } { When You Gonna Learn. In comparison to the current text logo one can see that the old Acid Jazz Records version of the logo was more angular at points, together with the letters being much thinner. Several variations of the current logo also exist. Releases of &quot; } { Cosmic Girl &quot; and the promo CD of &quot; Everyday &quot; had replaced the dots above the &apos;i&apos; letters with stars. Other slight, temporary variations include a slight vertical stretch of the typeface, as seen on the cover art of } { A Funk Odyssey and } { Rock Dust Light Star. } [ Tours ] [ Jamiroquai&apos;s concert tours ] [ Band members ] [ Current ] Derrick McKenzie – drums (1994–present) James Russell – saxophone &amp; flute (2010–present) Jay Kay – lead vocals (1992–present) Jim Corry – saxophone (2010–present) Malcolm Strachan – trumpet (2010–present) Matt Johnson – keyboards (2002–present) Paul Turner – bass (2005–present) Rob Harris – guitar (2000–present) Sola Akingbola – percussion (1994–present) [ Former ] Adrian Revell – saxophone &amp; flute (1995–1997) DJ D-Zire – wheels of steel (1993–2001) Gavin Dodds – guitar (1993–1994) Martin Shaw – trumpet &amp; flugelhorn (1995–2000) Maurizio Ravalico – percussion (1993–1994) Mike Smith – saxophone (1993–1994, 1999–2000) Nick Fyffe – bass (1999–2003) Nick Tydman – bass (1992) Nick Van Gelder – drums (1992–1993) Simon Bartholomew – guitar (1992) Simon Carter – keyboards (1999–2002) Simon Katz – guitar (1995–2000) Stuart Zender – bass (1992–1998) Toby Smith – keyboards (1992–2002) Wallis Buchanan – didgeridoo (1992–1999) Winston Rollins – trombone &amp; trumpet (1994–1997) [ Discography ] [ Jamiroquai discography ] Studio albums 1993 Emergency on Planet Earth 1994 The Return of the Space Cowboy 1996 Travelling Without Moving 1999 Synkronized 2001 A Funk Odyssey 2005 Dynamite 2010 Rock Dust Light Star [ See also ] List of number-one dance hits (United States) List of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Dance chart [ Notes ] [ 2 ] [ External links ] Official website An article on the history of the Buffalo Man logo at Funkin.com Cool Lounge Tribute Meeting with Jamiroquai on July 21, 2010 in Nîmes List of all Band Members (1992-2011) at Jamirodreams.de Jamiroquai Concert in Istanbul - 2011 Category:Acid jazz ensembles Category:English electronic music groups Category:Nu-disco musicians Category:English soul singers Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:Musical groups from London an:Jamiroquai bg:Джъмиръкуай ca:Jamiroquai cs:Jamiroquai da:Jamiroquai de:Jamiroquai et:Jamiroquai es:Jamiroquai eo:Jamiroquai eu:Jamiroquai fa:جمیروکوای fr:Jamiroquai ko:자미로콰이 hr:Jamiroquai id:Jamiroquai it:Jamiroquai he:ג&apos;מירוקוואי ka:Jamiroquai lt:Jamiroquai hu:Jamiroquai nl:Jamiroquai ja:ジャミロクワイ no:Jamiroquai pl:Jamiroquai pt:Jamiroquai ro:Jamiroquai ru:Jamiroquai sq:Jamiroquai simple:Jamiroquai sr:Džamirokvaj fi:Jamiroquai sv:Jamiroquai th:จามิโรไคว์ uk:Jamiroquai zh:傑米羅奎爾
