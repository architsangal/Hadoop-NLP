It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release The Unforgettable Fire, U2 aimed for a harder-hitting sound on The Joshua Tree within the limitation of strict song structures. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music and depicts the band&apos;s love-hate relationship with the United States, with socially and politically conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery. Inspired by American tour experiences, literature, and politics, U2 chose America as a theme for the record. Recording began in January 1986 in Ireland, and to foster a relaxed, creative atmosphere, the group recorded in two houses, in addition to two professional studios. Several events during the sessions helped shape the conscious tone of the album, including the band&apos;s participation in A Conspiracy of Hope tour, the death of roadie Greg Carroll, and lead vocalist Bono &apos;s travels to Central America. Recording was completed in November and additional production continued into January 1987. Throughout the sessions, U2 sought a &quot; cinematic &quot; quality for the record that would evoke a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of America. They represented this in the sleeve photography depicting them in American desert landscapes. The album received critical acclaim, topped the charts in over 20 countries, and sold in record-breaking numbers. According to Rolling Stone, the album increased the band&apos;s stature &quot; from heroes to superstars &quot;. It produced the hit singles &quot; With or Without You &quot;, &quot; I Still Haven&apos;t Found What I&apos;m Looking For &quot;, and &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot;. The album won Grammy Award s for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1988. The group supported the record with the successful Joshua Tree Tour. Frequently cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history, The Joshua Tree is one of the world&apos;s all-time best-selling albums, with over 25  million copies sold. In 2007, U2 released a 20th anniversary remaster ed edition of the record. [ 2 ] [ Background ] Before The Joshua Tree, U2 had released four studio albums and were an internationally successful band, particularly as a live act having toured every year in the 1980s. The group&apos;s stature and the public&apos;s anticipation for a new album grew following their 1984 record The Unforgettable Fire, their subsequent tour, and their participation in Live Aid in 1985. U2 began writing new material in mid-1985 following the Unforgettable Fire Tour. Band manager Paul McGuinness recounted that The Joshua Tree originated from the band&apos;s &quot; great romance &quot; with the United States, as the group had toured the country for up to five months per year in the first half of the 1980s. In the lead up to the album sessions, lead vocalist Bono had been reading the works of American writers such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O&apos;Connor, and Raymond Carver so as to understand, in the words of Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, &quot; those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream &quot;. { Stokes (2005), p. 76 } Following a 1985 humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife Ali, Bono said, &quot; Spending time in Africa and seeing people in the pits of poverty, I still saw a very strong spirit in the people, a richness of spirit I didn&apos;t see when I came home... I saw the spoiled child of the Western world. I started thinking, &apos;They may have a physical desert, but we&apos;ve got other kinds of deserts.&apos; And that&apos;s what attracted me to the desert as a symbol of some sort. &quot; In 1985, Bono participated in Steven Van Zandt &apos;s anti- apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. When Richards and Jagger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre, as most of U2&apos;s musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. Bono realised that U2 &quot; had no tradition &quot;, and he felt as if they &quot; were from outer space &quot;. This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song &quot; Silver and Gold &quot;, which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood. { McCormick (2006), p. 169 } Until that time, U2 had been antipathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with The Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they felt a sense of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged U2 to look back to rock&apos;s roots and focused Bono on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. { McCormick (2006), p. 179; Graham (2004), p. 27 } [ The Joshua Tree Propaganda 1987-01 5 ] He explained, &quot; I used to think that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt the time had come to write words that meant something, out of my experience. &quot; [ http://www.hotpress.com/archive/551797.html The World About Us Hot Press Niall Stokes Niall Stokes Graham, Bill 1987-03-26 2011-04-27 2011-11-02 http://www.webcitation.org/62tp5rJIk ] Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music, { Graham (2004), pp. 28–29; McGee (2008), p. 91 } while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track &quot; In a Lifetime &quot;. The band wanted to build on the textures of The Unforgettable Fire, but in contrast to that record&apos;s often out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitations of stricter song structures. [ DeCurtis Anthony Anthony DeCurtis U2 Releases The Joshua Tree Rolling Stone 1987-03-26 496 ] The group referred to this approach as working within the &quot; primary colours &quot; of rock music—guitar, bass, and drums. [ Cactus World View NME Adrian Thrills 1987-03-14 ] Guitarist The Edge was more interested in the European atmospherics of The Unforgettable Fire and was initially reluctant to follow the lead of Bono, who, inspired by Dylan&apos;s instruction to &quot; go back &quot;, sought a more American, bluesy sound. { McGee (2008), p. 93 } Despite not having a consensus on musical direction, the group members agreed that they felt disconnected from the dominant synthpop and New Wave music of the time, and they wanted to continue making music that contrasted with these genres. [ King, Philip, and Nuala O&apos;Connor (directors) Classic Albums : U2 - The Joshua Tree Television documentary Isis Productions 1999 ] In late 1985, U2 moved to drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. &apos;s newly purchased home to work on material written during The Unforgettable Fire Tour. This included demos that would evolve into &quot; With or Without You &quot;, &quot; Red Hill Mining Town &quot;, &quot; Trip Through Your Wires &quot;, and a song called &quot; Womanfish &quot;. The Edge recalled it as a difficult period with a sense of &quot; going nowhere &quot;, although Bono was set on America as a theme for the album. { McCormick (2006), p. 172 } [ Recording and production ] { Brian Eno and } { Daniel Lanois produced the album, their second time working with U2. } { alt=Headshots of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. } Based on their success with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois on The Unforgettable Fire, U2 wanted the duo to produce their new album. [ http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4269254.html The Secret History of &apos;The Joshua Tree&apos; Hot Press Colm O&apos;Hare 2007-11-21 2011-04-27 http://www.webcitation.org/62tpK3dK8 2011-11-02 ] Mullen was excited about working with them again, as he felt the pair, Lanois in particular, were the band&apos;s first producers who &quot; really [took] an interest in the rhythm section &quot;. Mark &quot; Flood &quot; Ellis was engineer for the sessions, marking the first time he worked with U2. The band was impressed by his work with Nick Cave, and Bono&apos;s friend Gavin Friday recommended Flood based on their work experiences together when Friday was a member of the Virgin Prunes. The band asked Flood for a sound that was &quot; very open... ambient... with a real sense of space of the environment you were in &quot;, which he thought was a very unusual request at that time. Intending to release an album in late 1986, U2 set up a studio in January of that year in Danesmoate House, a Georgian house in Rathfarnham in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains. Their plan was to find inspiration from the recording space and use it to musically create atmosphere, much like they did with Slane Castle for The Unforgettable Fire sessions in 1984. A makeshift control room with tape machines, a mixing desk, and other outboard equipment was set up in the dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed &quot; non-studio &quot; atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the &quot; lyric room &quot; and the recording space was called the &quot; band room &quot;. The band found the house to have a very creative atmosphere. The large drawing room, with tall ceiling and wooden floors, created an &quot; ear-splitting &quot; drum sound that, while difficult to work with, produced takes that ended up on the finished album. { McCormick (2006), p. 178 } Lanois said that it &quot; was loud, but it was really good loud, real dense, very musical. In my opinion it was the most rock and roll room of the lot. &quot; He thought the room sounded better than Slane Castle, and he was particularly impressed with the room&apos;s &quot; low mid-range... where the music lives &quot;, a property that he believes was a major factor in the success of The Joshua Tree. [ &quot; We had experimented a lot in the making of [ The Unforgettable Fire ]. We had done quite revolutionary things... So we felt, going into The Joshua Tree, that maybe options were not a good thing, that limitations might be positive. And so we decided to work within the limitations of the song as a starting point. We thought: let&apos;s actually write songs. We wanted the record to be less vague, open-ended, atmospheric and impressionistic. To make it more straightforward, focused and concise. &quot; 27% left padding:8px; ] U2 began with their usual method of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono&apos;s lyric book, and recording jam session s. One aspect of their recording methods, however, changed after The Unforgettable Fire sessions; rather than recording each instrument separately and layering them into the mix, U2 recorded all but two of the songs &quot; live &quot;. U2&apos;s songwriting methods were also developing; not all material was being worked out in band sessions, rather Bono and The Edge often brought basic song ideas to the rest of the group. { Graham (1996), p. 28 } Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer for a week or two, followed by the other. Eno and Lanois encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of The Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band&apos;s musical vocabulary improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team. One of the first songs worked on was &quot; Heartland &quot;, which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band&apos;s 1988 album Rattle and Hum. Supplementary recording sessions at STS Studios in Dublin with producer Paul Barrett saw the development of &quot; With or Without You &quot; and the genesis of &quot; Bullet the Blue Sky &quot;. The arrangements for &quot; With or Without You &quot; and &quot; I Still Haven&apos;t Found What I&apos;m Looking For &quot; were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. U2 interrupted the sessions to join Amnesty International &apos;s A Conspiracy of Hope Tour in June 1986. Rather than distract the band, the tour added extra intensity and power to their new music and provided extra focus on what they wanted to say. { McCormick (2006), p. 174 } For bassist Adam Clayton, the tour validated the &quot; rawness of content &quot; and their attempts to capture the &quot; bleakness and greed of America under Ronald Reagan &quot;. In July, Bono travelled with his wife Ali to Nicaragua and El Salvador and saw firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention, experiences which formed the basis of the lyrics for &quot; Bullet the Blue Sky &quot; and &quot; Mothers of the Disappeared &quot;. [ How the West Was Won Uncut Stephen Dalton 2003-09-08 ] The group experienced a tragedy later that month when Bono&apos;s personal assistant and roadie Greg Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. The 26-year-old&apos;s death overwhelmed the U2 organisation, and the band travelled to his native New Zealand to attend his traditional Māori funeral. { Windmill Lane Studios (pictured in 2008). } { alt=A three-storey stone-faced building. The first level is decorated with colorful graffiti. } On 1 August 1986, U2 regrouped at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin to resume work on the album. Writing and recording continued for the rest of the year, with the band also using Danesmoate House and The Edge&apos;s newly bought home, Melbeach. &quot; Mothers of the Disappeared &quot; and &quot; Bullet the Blue Sky &quot; were among the songs that evolved at Melbeach. Lanois said &quot; the bulk of the record was done at The Edge&apos;s house, even though the Danesmoate sessions were the backbone of the tonality of the record—we got a lot of the drums done in there. &quot; In August, Robbie Robertson, the former guitarist and primary songwriter for The Band, visited Dublin to complete an album that Lanois was producing. Robertson recorded two tracks with U2 that appear on his self-titled solo album. A creative spurt in October resulted in new song ideas. However, they were shelved at Eno&apos;s suggestion lest the band miss their deadline for completing the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois&apos; words, take &quot; snapshots along the way... because sometimes you go too far &quot;. The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to &quot; sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion &quot;. The final weeks were a frantic rush to finish, with the band and production crew all suffering from exhaustion. Lanois and Pat McCarthy mixed songs at Melbeach on an AMEK 2500 mixing desk where, without console automation, they needed three people to operate the console. Eno and Flood had minimal involvement with the final mixes. In late December, U2 hired Steve Lillywhite, producer of their first three albums, to remix the potential singles. His job was to make the songs more appealing to commercial radio, and his eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois. Lillywhite&apos;s remixing was done on an SLL desk and extended into the new year. Following the completion of the album proper, U2 returned to the studio in January 1987 to complete the new material they shelved in October. These tracks, which included &quot; Walk to the Water &quot;, &quot; Luminous Times (Hold on to Love) &quot;, and &quot; Spanish Eyes &quot;, were completed as B-sides for the planned singles. { McGee (2008), p. 99 } The song &quot; Sweetest Thing &quot; was left off the album and released as a B-side, as the band felt it was incomplete and did not fit with the other songs. { Stokes (2005), pp. 192–193 } They later expressed regret that it had not been completed for The Joshua Tree. The track was re-recorded as a single for the group&apos;s 1998 compilation The Best of 1980–1990. { Graham (2004), p. 77 } The band considered releasing The Joshua Tree as a double-album that would have included the B-sides. Bono was the most vocal proponent of the idea, whereas The Edge argued for the 11-track version that was ultimately released. { Stokes (1989) } U2 agreed that one track, &quot; Birdland &quot;, was too strong for a B-side and they held it for a future album release. In 2007, a re-recorded version of the song, retitled &quot; Wave of Sorrow (Birdland) &quot;, was included with the 20th anniversary edition of the album.

Although he was &quot; very rarely pleased &quot; with their finished albums to that point, he thought the new record was their most complete since their first.

U2runningtostandstill.ogg &quot; Running to Stand Still &quot; &quot; Running to Stand Still &quot; combines American folk influences with lyrics about a heroin-addicted Irish couple. ] U2 is credited with composing all of The Joshua Tree s music. The group&apos;s sound on the album draws from American and Irish roots music more than previous albums, following the counsel and influence of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards. &quot; I Still Haven&apos;t Found What I&apos;m Looking For &quot; has strong gospel influences, with Bono singing of spiritual doubt in an upper register and Eno, Lanois, and The Edge providing choir-like backing vocals. The slow piano-based ballad &quot; Running to Stand Still &quot; exhibits traits of folk music and acoustic blues in the track&apos;s slide acoustic guitar and harmonica. &quot; Trip Through Your Wires &quot;, another song on which Bono plays harmonica, was described by Niall Stokes as a &quot; bluesy romp &quot;. { Stokes (2005), p. 74 } The Edge&apos;s guitar playing on The Joshua Tree demonstrates what came to be his trademark sound. His minimalist style sharply contrasted with the emphasis on virtuosity and speed during the heavy metal era of the 1980s. The Edge views musical notes as &quot; expensive &quot;, preferring to play as few of them as possible and instead focus on simpler parts that serve the moods of the songs. { Gulla (2009), p. 64 } Much of this was achieved with a delay effect, contributing to a chiming, echo-laden sound. { Flanagan (1996), pp. 44–45 } For example, the riff in the introduction of the opening track &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; is a repeated six-note arpeggio, with delay used to repeat notes. The riffs to &quot; I Still Haven&apos;t Found What I&apos;m Looking For &quot; and &quot; With or Without You &quot; also prominently use delay, with Bono likening the guitar hook from the former track to &quot; chrome bells &quot;. { McCormick (2006), pp. 181–182 } The Edge continued using ambient guitar playing techniques that he began with on The Unforgettable Fire; on &quot; With or Without You &quot;, he used a prototype of the Infinite Guitar to add layers of sustain ed notes, an approach he first took on his 1986 solo album, the &apos;&apos;Captive&apos;&apos; soundtrack. { McCormick (2006), pp. 179, 181 } On other songs, his guitar playing is more aggressive; &quot; Exit &quot; was described by Colin Hogg as a &quot; decidedly scary... guitar-driven barrage &quot;, while Andrew Mueller said the guitar sounds from &quot; Bullet the Blue Sky &quot; evoke fighter planes.

[ U2 Legends VH1 1 6 1998-12-11 ] Bono also contributed to songwriting on guitar; the Spanish guitar melody in &quot; Mothers of the Disappeared &quot; originated from a song that he composed in Ethiopia to teach children about basic hygiene. { McCormick (2006), p. 184 } Much like on past records, Bono exhibits an expressive, open-throated vocal delivery, { Fast (2000), pp. 33–53 } which many critics labelled as &quot; passionate &quot;. { Rooksby (2001), pp. 122–123 } Spin found that the group&apos;s exploration of roots music resulted in Bono&apos;s style expanding, saying he &quot; commands the full whisper-to-shout range of blues mannerisms &quot;. Bono attributes this maturation to &quot; loosening up &quot; and &quot; discover[ing] other voices &quot;, and to employing more restraint in his singing. His vocals became, in the words of Thom Duffy, more &quot; dynamic &quot; than they had been on previous records. On &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot;, his voice varies greatly in its timbre (as writer Mark Butler describes, &quot; he sighs; he moans; he grunts; he exhales audibly; he allows his voice to crack &quot; ) and its timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the sung notes from the beat.

Sporadic weedy plants are growing in the dirt, and a mountain range is visible in the background. Bono is credited as the album&apos;s sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band&apos;s deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. { McCormick (2006), p. 186 } Bono said, &quot; I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America &quot;, { McCormick (2006), pp. 177–178 } hence the album&apos;s working title, The Two Americas. The band wanted music with a sense of location and a &quot; cinematic &quot; quality, and the album consequently drew on imagery created by American writers whose works the band read. { Graham (2004) pp. 27–30 } Having toured the United States extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country&apos;s geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record.

One track that chiefly represents these themes is &quot; In God&apos;s Country &quot;, which critics interpreted as addressing America&apos;s role as the &quot; promised land &quot;. [ U2 Touches N.J. Hearts: Band Plays Music with a Message The Bergen Record Barbara Jaeger 1987-05-12 B01 ] Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: &quot; The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it&apos;s some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it&apos;s also a very positive image, because you can actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is. &quot; { Stokes (2005), p. 72 } [ &quot; I love being there, I love America, I love the feeling of the wide open spaces, I love the deserts, I love the mountain ranges, I even love the cities. So having fallen in love with America over the years that we&apos;ve been there on tour, I then had to &apos;deal with&apos; America and the way it was affecting me, because America&apos;s having such an effect on the world at the moment. On this record I had to deal with it on a political level for the first time, if in a subtle way. &quot; 27% left padding:8px; ] Political and social concerns were the basis for several tracks. Bono wrote the lyrics to &quot; Bullet the Blue Sky &quot; after visiting El Salvador and witnessing how US military intervention in the country&apos;s civil war hurt the local people. This trip also inspired &quot; Mothers of the Disappeared &quot;, after Bono met members of COMADRES —the Mothers of the Disappeared—a group of women whose children were killed or &quot; disappeared &quot; during the Salvadoran Civil War at the hands of the local government. The 1984 UK mining strike inspired the lyrics to &quot; Red Hill Mining Town &quot;, which Bono wrote from the perspective of a couple affected by the strike. The story of a heroin -addicted couple was the basis for &quot; Running to Stand Still &quot;, which Bono set in Dublin&apos;s Ballymun Flats. For &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot;, he wrote the lyrics in response to the idea that, in Belfast, a person&apos;s religion and income can be deduced based on the street they live on. &quot; Exit &quot; portrays a psychotic killer, although Clayton suggests the line &quot; He saw the hands that build could also pull down &quot; is also a jab at the US government&apos;s conflicting roles in international relations. [ Adam Clayton The Joshua Tree 2007 20th anniversary edition box set U2 ] Bono described 1986 as &quot; an incredibly bad year &quot; for him, which was reflected in the lyrics. His marriage was under strain, in part due to the album&apos;s long gestation period, the band were criticised by the Irish media for their involvement in the Self Aid event, and his personal assistant Greg Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. [ U2 Give Themselves Away Musician Niall Stokes Niall Stokes Graham, Bill 1987-05-01 ] Bono said, &quot; That&apos;s why the desert attracted me as an image. That year was really a desert for us. &quot; &quot; With or Without You &quot; was written while he was struggling to reconcile his wanderlust as a musician with his domestic responsibilities. &quot; One Tree Hill &quot;, named after a volcanic peak in Carroll&apos;s native New Zealand, describes how Bono felt at Carroll&apos;s funeral. { McGee (2008), p. 97 } The album is dedicated to his memory. The group&apos;s religious faith was a source of inspiration for many lyrics. On &quot; I Still Haven&apos;t Found What I&apos;m Looking For &quot;, Bono affirms this faith but sings of spiritual doubt ( &quot; I believe in Kingdom Come &quot;... &quot; But I still haven&apos;t found what I&apos;m looking for &quot; ). { Stokes (2005), p. 65 } Some critics surmised that the place Bono is referring to on &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; is Heaven. { Stockman (2005), pp. 68–69 } These two songs were singled out by some critics as demonstrating that the band was on a &quot; spiritual quest &quot;.

The initial concept for the sleeve was to represent where the desert met civilisation, and accordingly, one of the provisional titles for the album was The Desert Songs. [ Anton Corbijn The Joshua Tree 2007 20th anniversary edition box set U2 ] They asked their photographer Anton Corbijn to search for locations in the United States that would capture this. { McCormick (2006), p. 185 } From 14–16 December 1986, the band travelled with Corbijn and Averill on a bus around the Mojave Desert in California for a three-day photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape, beginning at the ghost town of Bodie before moving to locations such as Zabriskie Point and other sites in Death Valley. { McGee (2008), p. 98 } For the shoot, Corbijn rented a panoramic camera to capture more of the desert landscapes, but having no prior experience with the camera, he was unfamiliar with how to focus it. This led to him focusing on the background and leaving the band slightly out of focus. Corbijn said, &quot; Fortunately there was a lot of light. &quot; He later recounted that the main idea of the shoot was to juxtapose &quot; man and environment, the Irish in America &quot;.

Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant&apos;s etymology; early settlers, according to Mormon legend, named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree&apos;s stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That day, while driving on Route 190, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert, unusual since the plant is usually found in groups. Corbijn had been hoping to find a single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something The Edge called &quot; fairly spontaneous &quot;. Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather. Bono explained, &quot; it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That&apos;s one of the reasons we look so grim. &quot; { Kaiser (2005), p. 28 } The final day of shooting was spent in snow-covered ghost towns. [ &quot; I&apos;m proud of the pictures, I&apos;m happy to be part of them. But I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously.

Ultimately, separate photographs were used for each side of the sleeve; an image of the group at Zabriskie Point was placed on the front, while an image of them with the tree appears on the reverse side.
