Philosophically it involves a person perceiving their neighbor as also &quot; an I &quot; or &quot; self. &quot; Sociologically, this principle is applicable between individuals, between groups, and between individuals and groups. (For example, a person living by this rule treats all people with consideration, not just members of his or her in-group.) Religion is an integral part of the history of this concept.

[ Ethics: A Very Short Introduction Blackburn Simon Simon Blackburn 2001 Oxford University Press Oxford 978-0-19-280442-6 101 ] The &quot; Golden Rule &quot; has been attributed to Jesus of Nazareth : &quot; Therefore all things whatsoever would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them &quot; ( Matthew 7:12, see also Luke 6:31 ). The common English phrasing is &quot; Do unto others as you would have them do unto you &quot;. A similar form appeared in a Catholic catechism around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583). [ Vaux Laurence A Catechisme / or / Christian Doctrine The Chetham Society 1583, Reprinted by The Chetham Society in 1885 Manchester, England 48 (located in the text just beforethe title, &quot; Of the Five Commandments of the Church. &quot; Scroll up slightly to see a section saying: &quot; The sum of the ten Commandments does consist in the love towards god, and our neighbor (Ephe. 4., Matt. 7.).

They forbid idolatry, apostasy, heresy, superstition, perjury, blasphemy, and move us to the pure and true worshipping of God in heart, word and deed. In the Second table be seven Commandments, which command us to give reverence and honor to every man in his degree, to profit all, and hurt none: to do unto others, as we would be done to ourselves. &quot; ) http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/vaux.htm#48 ] The Golden Rule also has roots in the two old testament edicts, found in [ Bible King James Leviticus 19 18 ] ( &quot; Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself &quot;; see also Great Commandment ) and [ Bible King James Leviticus 19 34 ] ( &quot; But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God &quot; ). The Old Testament Deuterocanonical books of Tobit and Sirach, accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Non-Chalcedonian Churches, also express a negative form of the golden rule: [ &quot; Do to no one what you yourself dislike. &quot; Tobit 4:15 ] [ &quot; Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do, and keep in mind your own dislikes. &quot; Sirach 31:15 ] At the time of Hillel, an elder contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, the negative form of the golden rule already must have been proverbial, perhaps because of Tobit 4:15. When asked to sum up the entire Torah concisely, he answered: [ &quot; That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn. &quot; Talmud, Shabbat31a ] Two passages in the New Testament quote Jesus of Nazareth espousing the golden rule: [ Bible King James Matthew 7 12 Luke 6:31 ] [ 12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. ] [ Bible King James Luke 6 31 ] [ 31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. ] A similar passage, a parallel to the Great Commandment, is [ Bible New International Readers Version Luke 10 25 -28 ] [ 25 And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to receive eternal life?” 26 What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you understand it?” 27 He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.’(Deuteronomy 6:5) And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ ” 28 “You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do that, and you will live.”. ] The passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, &quot; Who is my neighbor? &quot;, by telling the parable of the Good Samaritan, indicating that &quot; your neighbour &quot; is anyone in need. { John Wesley&apos;s Explanatory Notes on Luke 10 } Jesus&apos; teaching, however, goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasises the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another. Taken as a rule of judgement, both formulations of the golden rule, the negative and positive, are equally applicable. { Moore: Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era; Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1927–1930; Vol.2, p.87, Vol.3, p.180. } In one passage of the New Testament Saint Paul refers to the golden rule: [ Bible King James Galatians 5 14 Galatians 5:14 ] [ 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. ] [ Confucianism ] [ Confucianism ] [ zh 己所不欲，勿施於人。 ] &quot; What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others. &quot; [ zh 子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎”？子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。” ] [ http://ctext.org/analects/wei-ling-gong Confucianism, The Analects, Section 15: Wei Ling Gong, (see number 24) Chinese Text Project Chinese Text Project 29 December 2011 ] -- Confucius, Analects XV.24, tr.

Empathy is at the root of kindness, compassion, understanding and respect  – qualities that we all appreciate being shown, whoever we are, whatever we think and wherever we come from. And although it isn’t possible to know what it really feels like to be a different person or live in different circumstances and have different life experiences, it isn’t difficult for most of us to imagine what would cause us suffering and to try to avoid causing suffering to others. For this reason many people find the Golden Rule’s corollary  – “do not treat people in a way you would not wish to be treated yourself”  – more pragmatic. ] According to Greg M. Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, &quot; &amp; thinsp;&apos;do unto others&apos;  ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely.

At the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively: [ Bible Jewish Publication Society 1917 Leviticus 19 34 ] Some deputized the excluding opinion: &quot; neighbor &quot; only refers to Jews and proselytes. Others summed up Samaritans as the proselytes (= &apos;strangers who resides with you&apos;) (Rabbi Akiba, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3,1; 27a). The Sage Hillel formulated a negative form of the golden rule. When asked to sum up the entire Torah concisely, he answered: [ Gensler Harry J.

Bornstein, and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of human rights, in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others. { Defined another way, it &quot; refers to the balance in an interactive system such that each party has both rights and duties, and the subordinate norm of complementarity states that one&apos;s rights are the other&apos;s obligation. &quot; } [ Bornstein Marc H. Handbook of Parenting Lawrence Erlbaum Associates 2002 5 978-0-8058-3782-7 ] { See also: } [ Paden William E. Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion Beacon Press 2003 131–132 978-0-8070-7705-4 ] However Leo Damrosch argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to &quot; rights &quot; per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human &quot; rights &quot; is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced Thomas Jefferson, who then incorporated Rousseau&apos;s reference to &quot; inalienable rights &quot; into the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts. [ Damrosch Leo Jean Jacques Russeau: Restless Genius Houghton Mifflin Company 2007 978-0-618-44696-4 ] [ Psychology ] If the negative/prohibitive form of the Golden Rule (the Silver Rule ) would stand alone, it would simply serve as a prohibition against wrong action. But the Golden Rule in general actually serves as a motivation toward proactive action. As Dr. Frank Crane put it, &quot; The Golden Rule is of no use to you whatsoever unless you realize that it&apos;s your move! &quot; { http://www.quakeranne.com/peace.html, and Robert D. Ramsey, School Leadership From A to Z: Practical Lessons from Successful Schools and Businesses, Corwin Press, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 2003. (ISBN 978-0761938330) p. 45. } [ Criticisms and responses to criticisms ] Many people have criticized the golden rule; George Bernard Shaw once said that &quot; the golden rule is that there are no golden rules &quot;. Shaw suggested an alternative rule: &quot; Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same &quot; (Maxims for Revolutionists; 1903). Karl Popper wrote: &quot; The golden rule is a good standard which is further improved by doing unto others, wherever reasonable, as they want to be done by &quot; ( The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 2). This concept has recently been called &quot; The Platinum Rule &quot; { The Busybody: The Platinum Rule } Philosophers, such as Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Bertrand Russell [ June 2009 ], have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. { Only a Game: The Golden Rule } The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding. [ Differences in values or interests ] Shaw&apos;s comment about differing tastes suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. For example, it has been said that a sadist is just a masochist who follows the golden rule. Another often used example of this inconsistency is that of the man walking into a bar looking for a fight. { How would you feel, if a million Soviet troops stormed your Reich Capital? } [ Differences in situations ] Immanuel Kant famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others. { Kant, Immanuel Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, footnote 13. Cambridge University Press (April 28, 1998). ISBN 978-0-521-62695-8 } Kant&apos;s Categorical Imperative, introduced in Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, is often confused with the Golden Rule. [ Responses to criticisms ] Walter Terence Stace, in The Concept of Morals (1937), wrote: [ Stace Walter T. The Concept of Morals The MacMillan Company; and also reprinted by Peter Smith Publisher Inc, January 1990 1937, Reprinted 1975 by permission of MacMillan Publishing Co. Inc., Also reprinted January 1990 by Peter Smith Publisher Inc New York 136 (ch. 6) 0-8446-2990-1 ] Marcus George Singer observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1)  that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2)  that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to. { M. G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p270 } Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second. In his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others&apos; ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting. { Wattles, p6 } An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail. { Jouni Reinikainen, &quot; The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability. &quot; Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155–168, 2005. } It is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore our race or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. The platinum rule, and perhaps other variants, might also be self-correcting in this same manner.
