Roughly triangular in shape, it is bordered mostly by India and Sri Lanka to the west, Bangladesh to the north, and Burma (Myanmar) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the east. The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of 2,172,000  km². A number of large rivers – the Padma (a distributary of the Ganges ), Meghna (a distributary of the Brahmaputra ), Jamuna (a branch of the Brahmaputra), Ayeyarwady, Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna and Kaveri – flow into the Bay of Bengal. Among the important ports are Cuddalore, Ennore, Chennai, Karaikal, Pondicherry, Tuticorin, Kakinada, Machilipatnam, Vishakhapatnam, Gangavaram, Krishnapatnam, Paradip, Kolkata, Mongla, Chittagong and Yangon. [ Extent ] { Cox&apos;s Bazar sea beach in } { Bangladesh. } The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Bay of Bengal as follows: [ http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition 1953 International Hydrographic Organization 7 February 2010 ] On the East. A line running from Cape Negrais (16°03&apos;N) in Burma through the larger islands of the Andaman group, in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie to the Eastward of the line and are excluded from the Bay of Bengal, as far as a point in Little Andaman Island in latitude 10°48&apos;N, longitude 92°24&apos;E and thence along the Southwest limit of the Burma Sea [A line running from Oedjong Raja ( [ 5 32 N 95 12 E inline ] ) in Sumatra to Poeloe Bras (Breuëh) and on through the Western Islands of the Nicobar Group to Sandy Point in Little Andaman Island, in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the Burma Sea]. &lt; p &gt; On the South. Adam&apos;s Bridge (between India and Ceylon [ Sri Lanka ] ) and from the Southern extreme of Dondra Head (South point of Ceylon) to the North point of Poeloe Bras ( [ 5 44 N 95 04 E inline ] ). [ Etymology ] { Gopalpur. } The Bay of Bengal appears as Sinus Gangeticus or Gangeticus Sinus, meaning &quot; Gulf of the Ganges &quot;, in ancient maps. { 1794, Orbis Veteribus Notus by Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d&apos;Anville } In the 10th century the explosion of Indianized kingdom s, led by the Chola Empire, resulted in the Bay of Bengal being known as the Chola Lake.It later came to be known as Bay of Bengal in after the region of Bengal. { Map of the Bay of Bengal URL accessed January 22, 2007 } [ Rivers ] Many major rivers of the Indian subcontinent flow west to east through Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal: in the north, the Padma River (or Ganges), Meghna River and Brahmaputra River rivers, and in the south Mahanadi River through the Mahanadi River Delta, Godavari River, Krishna river, Irrawaddy and Kaveri River (sometimes written as Cauvery) rivers. The shortest classified river which drains into the Bay of Bengal is Cooum River at [ 64 km mi on ]. Brahmaputra is the 28th longest River in the World [ 2948 km mi on ], and it discharges into the &apos;Bay of Bengal&apos; and travels mainly through China, Assam and Bangladesh. The Sundarbans mangrove forest is formed at the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. The Ayeyarwady River of Myanmar also flows into the bay and once had thick mangrove forest of its own. [ Sea ports ] { Vizag seaport in India is a major port } Some of the biggest ports in the world — Chittagong in Bangladesh and Chennai in India— are in the bay. Mongla, Kolkata and Yangon, the largest city and former capital of Burma, are also important ports on the bay.Other Indian ports on the bay include: Kakinada, Pondicherry and Vishakhapatnam. [ Islands ] The islands in the bay are very numerous, including the Andaman Islands, Nicobar and Mergui groups of India. The group of islands, Cheduba and others, in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active. Great Andaman is the main archipelago or island group of the Andaman Islands, whereas Ritchie&apos;s Archipelago consists of smaller islands. Only 37 of the 572 islands and islets of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are inhabited, or 6.5%. { The long stretch of sand glistening like silver dust URL accessed January 23, 2007 } [ Beaches ] { Cox&apos;s Bazar, the longest stretch of beach in the world. } [ http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/the-worlds-longest-beach/2007/01/31/1169919381993.html The Sydney Morning Herald World&apos;s longest beach hidden in Bangladesh January 31, 2007 ] [ 150 Kuakata beach in Bangaldesh, one of the sea beaches of Bay of Bengal where from same location both sunrise and sunset at sea can be observed.

Underneath the Bay of Bengal is the Indian Plate which is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate and is slowly moving north east. This plate meets the Burma Microplate at the Sunda Trench. The Nicobar Islands, and the Andaman Islands are part of the Burma Microplate. The India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate at the Sunda Trench or Java Trench. Here, the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in Myanmar, and a volcanic arc called the Sunda Arc. Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and Asian Tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a huge Tsunami. { Tsunami URL access January 21, 2007 } [ Marine geology ] A zone 50 m wide extending from the island of Ceylon and the Coromandel coast to the head of the bay, and thence southwards through a strip embracing the Andaman and Nicobar islands, is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom; some 50 m. beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit. Opposite the mouth of the Ganges, however, the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influence. Swatch of No Ground is a 14  km-wide deep sea canyon of the Bay of Bengal.

The remainder of the year, the counterclockwise current is southwestward flowing, and the circulation pattern is called the East Indian Winter Jet.

A specialized branch, Archaeology of shipwrecks studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships. Stoneanchors, amphorae shards, elephant tusks, hippopotamus teeth, ceramic pottery, a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive the test of time for archaeologists to study and place the salvaged findings into a time line of history.
