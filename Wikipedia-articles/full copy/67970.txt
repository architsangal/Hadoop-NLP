It is the oldest extant (living) vascular plant division at around 410 million years old, [ McElwain, Jenny C.; Willis, K. G.; Willis, Kathy; McElwain, J. C. The evolution of plants Oxford University Press Oxford [Oxfordshire] 2002 0-19-850065-3 ] [ 99 ] and includes some of the most &quot; primitive &quot; extant species. These species reproduce by shedding spore s and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. { Eichhorn, Evert, and Raven (2005). Biology of Plants, Seventh Edition. 381-388. } They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphyll s, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in fern s and seed plants. [ Classification ] There are around 1,200 [ Callow, R. S.; Cook, Laurence Martin Genetic and evolutionary diversity: the sport of nature S. Thornes Cheltenham 1999 0-7487-4336-7 8 ] living (extant) species of Lycopodiophyta which are generally divided into three orders ( Lycopodiales, Isoetales, and Selaginellales ); in addition there are extinct groups. There is some variation in how the extant orders are grouped into classes: they may be put into a single class; they may be put into two classes, with the Isoetales and Selaginellales combined into one class; [ Yatsentyuk S.P. Valiejo-Roman K.M. Samigullin T.H.

The following phylogram shows a likely relationship between Lycopodiophyta orders.

In fact, most known genera are extinct. The Silurian species Baragwanathia longifolia represents the earliest identifable Lycopodiophyta, while some Cooksonia seem to be related. Fossils ascribed to the Lycopodiophyta first appear in the Silurian period, along with a number of other vascular plants. Phylogenetic analysis places them at the base of the vascular plants; they are distinguished by their microphyll s and by transverse dehiscence of their sporangia (as contrasted with longitudinal in other vascular plants). Sporangia of living species are borne on the upper surfaces of microphylls (called sporophyll s ). In some groups, these sporophylls are clustered into strobili. During the Carboniferous Period, tree-like Lycopodiophyta (such as Lepidodendron ) formed huge forests that dominated the landscape. The complex ecology of these tropical rainforests collapsed during the mid Pennsylvanian due to a change in climate.

Their remains formed many fossil coal deposits. In Fossil Park, Glasgow, Scotland, fossilized Lycopodiophyta trees can be found in sandstone. The trees are marked with diamond-shaped scars where they once had leaves. [ Characteristics ] Club-mosses are homosporous, but spike-mosses and quillworts are heterosporous, with female spores larger than the male, and gametophytes forming entirely within the spore walls. The spores of Lycopodiophyta are highly flammable and so have been used in fireworks. { Cobb, B (1956) A Field Guide to Ferns and their related families: Northeastern and Central North America with a section on species also found in the British Isles and Western Europe (Peterson Field Guides), 215 } Currently, huperzine, a chemical isolated from a Chinese clubmoss, is under investigation as a possible treatment for Alzheimer&apos;s disease.
