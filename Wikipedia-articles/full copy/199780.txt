[ the book written by Tocqueville the actual system of government of the United States Politics of the United States ] [ Democracy in America 220px Title page, Democracy in Americaby Alexis de Tocqueville, printed at New York, 1838. De la démocratie en Amérique Alexis de Tocqueville Saunders and Otley (London), Now in public domain 1835-1840 ] De la démocratie en Amérique (published in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the second in 1840) is a classic French text by Alexis de Tocqueville. Its title translates as On Democraty in America, but English translations are usually entitled simply Democracy in America. In the book, Tocqueville examines the democratic revolution that he believed had been occurring over the past seven hundred years. In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont were sent by the French government to study the American prison system. In his later letters, Tocqueville indicates, however, that he and Beaumont used their official business as a pretext to study American society instead. [ Johri Vikram &apos;Alexis de Tocqueville&apos;: the first French critic of the US http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0410/p15s01-bogn.html The Christian Science Monitor 22 April 2011 ] They arrived in New York City in May of that year and spent nine months traveling the United States, studying the prisons, and collecting information on American society, including its religious, political, and economic character. The two also briefly visited Canada, spending a few days in the summer of 1831 in what was then Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec ) and Upper Canada (modern-day Ontario ). After they returned to France in February 1832, Tocqueville and Beaumont submitted their report, Du système pénitentiaire aux États-Unis et de son application en France, in 1833. When the first edition was published, Beaumont, sympathetic to social justice, was working on another book, Marie, ou, L&apos;esclavage aux Etats-Unis (two volumes, 1835), a social critique and novel describing the separation of races in a moral society and the conditions of slaves in America. Before finishing Democracy in America, Tocqueville believed that Beaumont&apos;s study of America would prove more comprehensive and penetrating. [ Tocqueville Alexis de Democracy in America 2000 The University of Chicago Press Chicago 0-226-80532-8 13 ] [ Purpose of Democracy in America ] Tocqueville begins his book by describing the change in social conditions taking place. He observed that over the previous seven hundred years the social and economic conditions of men had become more equal. The aristocracy, Tocqueville believed, was gradually disappearing as the modern world experienced the beneficial effects of equality. Tocqueville traced the development of equality to a number of factors, such as granting all men permission to enter the clergy, widespread economic opportunity resulting from the growth of trade and commerce, the royal sale of titles of nobility as a monarchical fundraising tool, and the abolition of primogeniture. Tocqueville described this revolution as a &quot; providential fact &quot; [ Tocqueville Alexis de Democracy in America 2000 University of Chicago Press Chicago 0-226-80532-8 ] of an &quot; irresistible revolution, &quot; leading some to criticize the determinism found in the book. However, based on Tocqueville&apos;s correspondences with friends and colleagues, Marvin Zetterbaum, Professor Emeritus at University of California Davis, concludes that the Frenchman never accepted democracy as determined or inevitable. He did, however, consider equality more just and therefore found himself among its partisans. [ Zetterbaum Marvin Tocqueville and the problem of democracy 1967 Stanford University Press Stanford ] Given the social state that was emerging, Tocqueville believed that a &quot; new political science &quot; would be needed. According to him, it would: [I]nstruct democracy, if possible to reanimate its beliefs, to purify its mores, to regulate its movements, to substitute little by little the science of affairs for its inexperience, and knowledge of its true instincts for its blind instincts; to adapt its government to time and place; to modify it according to circumstances and men: such is the first duty imposed on those who direct society in our day. [ Tocqueville Alexis de Democracy in America 2000 University of Chicago Press Chicago 0-226-80532-8 7 ] The remainder of the book can be interpreted as an attempt to accomplish this goal thereby giving advice to those people who would experience this change in social states. [ Main themes ] [ section September 2011 ] [ The Puritan Founding ] Tocqueville begins his study of America by explaining the contribution of the Puritans. According to him, the Puritans established America&apos;s democratic social state of equality. They arrived equals in education and were all middle class. In addition, Tocqueville observes that they contributed a synthesis of religion and political liberty in America that was uncommon in Europe, particularly in France. He calls the Puritan Founding the &quot; seed &quot; of his entire work. [ The Federal Constitution ] Tocqueville believed that the Puritans established the principle of sovereignty of the people in the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The American Revolution then popularized this principle, followed by the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which developed institutions to manage popular will. While Tocqueville speaks highly of the America&apos;s Constitution, he believes that the mores, or &quot; habits of mind &quot; of the American people play a more prominent role in the protection of freedom. Township democracy Mores, Laws, and Circumstances Tyranny of the Majority Religion and beliefs The Family Individualism Associations Self-Interest Rightly Understood Materialism [ Situation of women ] Tocqueville was one of the first social critics to examine the situation of American women and to identify the concept of Separate Spheres.

He writes: &quot; In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways that are always different. &quot; [ Tocqueville Alexis de Alexis de Tocqueville Democracy in America 1840 Saunders and Otley London Chapter XII: How the Americans understand the Equality of the sexes http://books.google.com/books?id%3D0EPSjMel_-kC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA101 101 ] He argues that the collapse of aristocracy lessened the patriarchal rule in the family, such that unmarried women had a higher degree of independence. Married women, by contrast, lost all independence &quot; in the bonds of matrimony &quot; as &quot; in America paternal discipline is very relaxed and the conjugal tie very strict &quot;.

It was immediately popular in both Europe and the United States, while also having a profound impact on the French population. By the twentieth century, it had become a classic work of political science, social science, and history. It is a commonly assigned reading for undergraduate s of American universities majoring in the political or social sciences, and part of the introductory political theory syllabus at Cambridge, Oxford and other institutions. In the introduction to his translation of the book, Harvey C. Mansfield calls it &quot; at once the best book ever written on democracy and the best book ever written on America. [ Tocqueville Alexis de Democracy in America 2000 The University of Chicago Press Chicago 0-226-80532-8 ] Tocqueville&apos;s work is often acclaimed for making a number of astute predictions. He anticipates the potential acrimony over the abolition of slavery that would tear apart the United States and lead to the American Civil War as well as the eventual superpower rivalry between the United States and Russia, which exploded after World War II and spawned the Cold War. Noting the rise of the industrial sector in the American economy, Tocqueville, some scholars have argued, also correctly predicted that an industrial aristocracy would rise from the ownership of labor. He warned that &apos;...friends of democracy must keep an anxious eye peeled in this direction at all times&apos;, observing that the route of industry was the gate by which a new found wealthy class might potentially dominate. (However, Tocqueville believed that an industrial aristocracy would differ from the formal aristocracy of the past.) What&apos;s more, he foresaw the alienation and isolation that many have come to experience in modern life. On the other hand, Tocqueville proved shortsighted in noting that a democracy&apos;s equality of conditions stifles literary development. In spending several chapters lamenting the state of the arts in America he fails to envision the literary Renaissance that would shortly arrive in the form of such major writers as Edgar Allan Poe, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman. And in dismissing the country&apos;s interest in science as limited to pedestrian applications for streamlining the production of material goods he failed to imagine America&apos;s burgeoning appetite for pure scientific research and discovery. According to Tocqueville, democracy had some unfavorable consequences: the tyranny of the majority over thought, a preoccupation with material goods, and isolated individuals. Democracy in America predicted the violence of party spirit and the judgment of the wise subordinated to the prejudices of the ignorant.
