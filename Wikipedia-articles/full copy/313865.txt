[ Sultana (disambiguation) ] { Helena, Arkansas, on or about April 26, 1865. } &apos;&apos;Sultana&apos;&apos; on fire, from &apos;&apos;Harpers Weekly&apos;&apos;. SS Sultana was a Mississippi River steamboat paddlewheeler that exploded on April 27, 1865 in the greatest maritime disaster in United States history. An estimated 1,600 of Sultana&apos;s 2,400 passengers were killed when three of the ship&apos;s four boilers exploded and Sultana sank near Memphis, Tennessee. [ Berryman H.E. Potter J.O. Oliver S. 1988 The ill-fated passenger steamer Sultana: an inland maritime mass disaster of unparalleled magnitude Journal of Forensic Sciences 33 3 842–850 Berryman et al., 1988 ] This disaster was overshadowed in the press by other recent events. John Wilkes Booth, President Lincoln&apos;s assassin, was killed the day before. During the previous week, the American Civil War ended. The wooden steamship was constructed in 1863 by the John Litherbury Shipyard in Cincinnati, and intended for the lower Mississippi cotton trade. Registering 1,719 tons, { Berry (1892), p. 7 } the steamer normally carried a crew of 85. For two years, the Sultana ran a regular route between St. Louis and New Orleans, frequently commissioned to carry troops. [ The tragedy ] SS &apos;&apos;Sultana&apos;&apos; Memorial at the Mount Olive Baptist Church Cemetery in Knoxville, Tennessee in 2010. Under the command of Captain J. C. Mason of St. Louis, Sultana left New Orleans on April 21, 1865, with 75 to 100 cabin passengers, deck passengers, and numerous head of livestock bound for market in St. Louis. At Vicksburg, Mississippi, the steamship stopped for a series of hasty repairs to the boilers and to take on more passengers. Rather than have a bad boiler replaced, a small patch repair was made to reinforce a leaking area. A section of bulged boiler plate was removed, and a patch of lesser thickness than the parent plate was riveted in its place. [ Bennett Robert Frank, CDR USCG A Case of Calculated Mischief Proc. United States Naval Institute March 1976 77–83 Bennett, 1976 ] This repair took about one day, whereas a complete replacement of the boiler would have taken about three days. [ April 2011 ] During Sultana&apos;s time in port, men tried to muscle, bribe, and threaten their way on board, until the ship was bursting at the seams with soldiers. More than two thousand men crowded aboard. [ April 2011 ] Historic marker of the Sultana disaster in Marion, AR Most of the new passengers were Union soldiers, chiefly from Ohio and just released from Confederate prison camps such as Cahawba and Andersonville. [ April 2011 ] The US government had contracted with Sultana to transport these former prisoners of war back to their homes. [ April 2011 ] With a legal capacity of only 376, Sultana was severely overcrowded. [ April 2011 ] Many of the passengers had been weakened by their incarceration and associated illnesses. [ April 2011 ] Passengers were packed into every available berth, and the overflow was so severe that the decks were completely packed. [ April 2011 ] The cause of the explosion was a leaky and poorly repaired steam boiler. There was reason to believe allowable working steam pressure was exceeded in an attempt to overcome the spring river current. The boiler (or boilers) gave way when the steamer was [ 7 to 9 mi ] north of Memphis at 2:00 AM. [ http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/05/0501_river5.html Remembering Sultana Stephen Ambrose National Geographic News May 1, 2001 ] The enormous explosion flung some of the passengers on deck into the water, and destroyed a large section of the ship. Hot coals scattered by the explosion soon turned the remaining superstructure into an inferno, the glare of which was visible as far away as Memphis. [ Harvey Hank, retired staffer for The (Toledo) Blade coverage on Sultana disaster Sunday, October 27, 1996 Section C 3, 6 ] The first boat on the scene was the southbound steamer Bostonia II [ http://www.historynet.com/magazines/american_history/3032116.html?page%3D4%26amp%3Bc%3Dy Jerry O. Potter Sultana: A Tragic Postscipt to the Civil War American History Magazine ] which arrived at about 3:00 AM, an hour after the explosion, and overtook the burning wreck to rescue scores of survivors. The hulk drifted to the west bank of the river, and sank at around dawn near the tiny settlement of Mound City near present day Marion, Arkansas. Other vessels joined the rescue, including the steamer Arkansas, Jenny Lind, Essex, and the Navy sidewheel gunboat USS &apos;&apos;Tyler&apos;&apos;, manned by volunteers. The ship&apos;s regular crew had been discharged days before. Passengers who survived the initial explosion had to risk their lives in the icy spring runoff of the Mississippi or burn with the ship. Many died of drowning or hypothermia. Some survivors were plucked from trees along the Arkansas shore. Bodies of victims continued to be found downriver for months, some as far as Vicksburg. Many bodies were never recovered. Sultana&apos;s officers, including Captain Mason, were among those who perished. About 500 survivors, many with horrible burns, were transported to hospitals in Memphis. Up to 300 of them died later from burns or exposure. Newspaper accounts indicate that the people of Memphis had sympathy for the victims despite the fact that they had recently been enemies. [ April 2011 ] The Chicago Opera Troupe staged a benefit, the crew of Essex raised $1,000, and the mayor took in three survivors. Monuments and historical markers to Sultana and its victims have been erected at Memphis, Tennessee; Muncie, Indiana; Marion, Arkansas; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Cincinnati, Ohio; Knoxville, Tennessee; Hillsdale, Michigan; and Mansfield, Ohio. [ April 2011 ] [ Casualties ] No exact death toll is known. Estimates range from 1,300 to 1,900. The official count by the United States Customs Service was 1,547. Final estimates of survivors were between 700-800. Many of the dead were interred at the Memphis National Cemetery. [ Cause ] The official cause of Sultana disaster was determined to be mismanagement of water levels in the boiler, exacerbated by &quot; careening &quot;. Sultana was severely overcrowded and top heavy. As the steamship made its way north following the twists and turns of the river, Sultana listed severely to one side then the other. Sultana&apos;s four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side, so that if the ship tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. With the fires still going against the empty boiler, this created hot spots. When the ship tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that Sultana &apos;s boilers exploded due to the combined effects of careening, low water level, and a faulty repair to a leaky boiler made a few days earlier. In 1888, a St. Louis resident named William Streetor claimed that his former business partner, Robert Louden, made a deathbed confession of having sabotaged Sultana by a coal torpedo. [ http://www.civilwarstlouis.com/boatburners/index.htm The Sultana Disaster (Coal Torpedo theory) ] Louden was a former Confederate agent and saboteur who operated in and around St. Louis. Louden had the opportunity and motive to attack Sultana. He may have had access to the means. ( Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay, the inventor of the coal torpedo, was a former resident of St. Louis and was involved in similar acts of sabotage against Union shipping interests.) Supporting Louden&apos;s claim are eyewitness reports that a piece of artillery shell was observed in the wreckage. Louden&apos;s claim is controversial, however, and most scholars support the official explanation. [ William A. Tidwell April &apos;65 Kent, Ohio The Kent State University Press 1995 52 Tidwell, 1995 ] [ G.E. Deb Rule The Sultana: A case for sabotage North and South Magazine 5 1 December 2001 ] [ Survivors ] An East Tennessee Sultana survivors&apos; group met annually on April 27 until 1928, when four survivors were left. [ Remnants found ] In 1982, a local archaeological expedition uncovered what was believed to be the wreckage of Sultana. Blackened wooden deck planks and timbers were found about [ 32 ft ] under a soybean field on the Arkansas side, about [ 4 mi ] from Memphis. The Mississippi River has changed course several times since the disaster. The main channel now flows about [ 2 mi ] east of its 1865 position. [ Music ] Jay Farrar of the band Son Volt wrote a song called &quot; Sultana &quot;, paying tribute to &quot; the worst American disaster of the maritime &quot;. Farrar calls the ship &quot; the Titanic of the Mississippi &quot; in the song, which was released on the American Central Dust album.

The Back Porch Majority performed a song entitled &quot; The Great Sultana &quot; on their album Riverboat Days. Southaven, Mississippi born singer/songwriter Cory Branan recorded a song titled &quot; Sultana &quot; about the disaster. Upstate New York singer/songwriter Jeff Stachyra released an album called The Sultana: April 27, 1865 on April 27, 2012.
