Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and his or her will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. { &quot; What do I mean by individualism?I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience. &quot; &apos;&apos;Mini-Manual of Individualism&apos;&apos; by Han Ryner } { &quot; I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. &quot; &quot; Anarchism and the State &quot; in Individual Liberty } Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. From there it expanded through Europe and the United States. Benjamin R. Tucker, a famous 19th century individualist anarchist, held that &quot; if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny. &quot; [ Benjamin R.

Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX. &quot; &quot; Voluntary non-submission.

[ max-stirner Max Stirner David Leopold 2006-08-04 ] Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are: 1. The concentration on the individual and his/her will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others. { &quot; En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, &quot; más allá del bien y del mal &quot; como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción. &quot; &quot; Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923-1938) &quot; } { &quot; Stirner himself, however, has no truck with &quot; higher beings. &quot; Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all &quot; higher beings, &quot; regarding them as a variety of what he calls &quot; spooks, &quot; or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction &quot; Man &quot;, into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, &quot; liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts &apos;Man&apos; to the same extent as any other religion does to God... it sets me beneath Man. &quot; Indeed, he &quot; who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook. &quot; [p. 176 and p.79] Among the many &quot; spooks &quot; Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner&apos;s critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism. &quot; &quot; G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner &quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ ]] } 2. The rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution, seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about today. { &quot; The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc.. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists&apos; use of direct action to create revolutionary situations. &quot; &quot; A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists? &quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ ]] } { &quot; Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar. &quot; La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923-1938) } This is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system. { &quot; The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s... and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War... were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution. The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ( &quot; propaganda by the deed &quot; ) and the anarchist burglars ( &quot; individual reappropriation &quot; ) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt. &quot; THE &quot; ILLEGALISTS &quot; by Doug Imrie } 3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one&apos;s own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended associations of egoists. { Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone &quot; uniones de egoístas &quot;, formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia. &quot; La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923-1938) } &quot; The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would &quot; care best for their welfare if they unite with others. &quot; [p.  309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls &quot; intercourse, &quot; or &quot; union &quot; between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.  25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual&apos;s self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, &quot; intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals. &quot; [p.  218] Its aim is &quot; pleasure &quot; and &quot; self-enjoyment. &quot; Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are: &quot; But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist?... The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man that someone else who loves no one. &quot; [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 23] &quot; What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists? Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized. The egoist form of individualist anarchism, derived from the philosophy of Max Stirner, supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases – taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules. [ Miller David The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought 1987 Blackwell Publishing 11 0631227814 ] To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot; the individuals are its reality &quot; – he supported property by force of might rather than moral right. { &quot; What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as I entitle, that is, empower myself to take… &quot; From } { The Ego and Its Own, quoted in } [ Ossar Michael 1980 Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller State University of New York Press 27 0873953932 ] Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw &quot; associations of egoists &quot; drawn together by respect for each other&apos;s ruthlessness. [ George Woodcock Woodcock George 2004 Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements Broadview Press 20 0140206221 ] For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, american individualist anarchism &quot; stresses the isolation of the individual—his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is &quot; aesthetic &quot; anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the transcendentalism, humanitarianism, and romanticism of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War. &quot; { &apos;&apos;NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism&apos;&apos; by Eunice Minette Schuster } It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account &quot; the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society...the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs. &quot; and so &quot; Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisan al socialism... while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism. &quot; { &quot; G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism? &quot; in &apos;&apos;[[An Anarchist FAQ ]&apos;&apos;] } In European individualist anarchism a different social context helped the rise of European individualist illegalism and as such &quot; The illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run. &quot; { Richard Parry. &apos;&apos;The Bonnot Gang: The Story of the French Illegalists&apos;&apos; } And so a European tendency of individualist anarchism advocated violent individual acts of individual reclamation, propaganda by the deed and criticism of organization. Such individualist anarchist tendencies include French illegalism { The &quot; Illegalists &quot;, by Doug Imrie (published by } { Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed ) } { Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15 } and Italian anti-organizational insurrectionarism. { &quot; Anarchist historian } { George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian } { social anarchist } { Errico Malatesta became involved &quot; in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of } { Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant. &quot; Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th &quot; it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity -- and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy. &quot;. { [[Murray Bookchin ]. } { Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm ] } Another important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted &quot; amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general. &quot; As such Murray Bookchin describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who &quot; expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom (&apos;free love&apos;) and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing. &quot;. { &quot; 2. Individualist Anarchism and Reaction &quot; in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism - An Unbridgeable Chasm } In this way free love currents and other radical lifestyles such as naturism had popularity among individualist anarchists. For Catalan historian Xavier Diez Spanish individualist anarchism &quot; under its iconoclastic, antiintelectual, antitheist run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of nation, it opposed its internationalism. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the military intitution, it opposed its antimilitarism. Against the concept of industrial civilization, it opposed its naturist vision &quot;. { Xavier Diez. L&apos;anarquisme Individualista a Espanya 1923-1938 } In regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to mutualism (Proudhon, Emile Armand, early Benjamin Tucker ), egoist ic disrespect for &quot; ghosts &quot; such as private property and markets (Stirner, John Henry Mackay, Lev Chernyi, later Tucker), and adherents to anarcho-communism ( Albert Libertad, illegalism, Renzo Novatore ). { &quot; revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy.

Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, &quot; the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work. &quot; { Peter Kropotkin, &quot; Anarchism &quot;, &apos;&apos; } { Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910 } { Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to } { Edmund Burke &apos;s } { A Vindication of Natural Society. &quot; Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke&apos;s Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence… &quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 } { Political Justice by William Godwin. } Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated. { &quot; Godwin, William &quot;. (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from } { Encyclopædia Britannica Online. } Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us &quot; of more worth and importance&apos; than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person&apos;s life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good. [ Paul McLaughlin Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism Ashgate Publishing, 2007 119 0754661962 ] Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual&apos;s right to &quot; private judgement &quot; to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual&apos;s judgement. This aspect of Godwin&apos;s philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner. [ Paul McLaughlin Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism Ashgate Publishing, 2007 123 0754661962 ] Godwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in Political Justice that &quot; everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil. &quot; The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual&apos;s ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a minimal state as a present &quot; necessary evil &quot; [ Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners Godwin William William Godwin 1796 G.G. and J. Robinson 2340417 1793 ] that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority (though he believed it to be preferable to dictatorship ). { Political Justice &apos;&apos; } Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as &quot; the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry. &quot; However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. gift economy ). Thus, while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened altruists. This was to be based on utilitarian principles; he said: &quot; Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated. &quot; However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual &quot; private judgement. &quot; He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of anarchist communism. Godwin&apos;s political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the Socialist Standard, organ of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist; { &quot; William Godwin, Shelly and Communism &quot; by ALB, The Socialist Standard } anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the &quot; founder of communist anarchism &quot;; &lt; ref name=rothbard/burke &gt; Rothbard, Murray. &quot; Edmund Burke, Anarchist. &quot; &lt; /ref &gt; and historian Albert Weisbord considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation. [ Weisbord Albert Albert Weisbord The Conquest of Power 2008-08-05 1937 Covici-Friede New York 1019295 Libertarianism http://www.weisbord.org/conquest8.htm ] Some writers see a conflict between Godwin&apos;s advocacy of &quot; private judgement &quot; and utilitarianism, as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but, at the same time, he insists that all things be left to individual choice. Many of Godwin&apos;s views changed over time, as noted by Kropotkin. William Godwin &apos;s influenced &quot; the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798-1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen&apos;s socialism had been predicated on Godwin&apos;s anarchism). &quot; { Peter Sabatini. &quot; Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy &quot; } [ Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ] { Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first self-identified anarchist. } [ Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ] Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an &quot; anarchist. &quot; { &quot; Anarchism &quot;, } { BBC Radio 4 program, } { In Our Time, Thursday December 7, 2006.

History of Economics Review, No.31 Winter 2000. } Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control. { Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20 } Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana, { Dana, Charles A. Proudhon and his &quot; Bank of the People &quot; (1848). } and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon&apos;s works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon&apos;s mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin R. Tucker. { Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot; On Picket Duty &quot;, Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881 –1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Onlinepg. 1 } Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former &quot; possession &quot; and the latter &quot; property. &quot; For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land. Proudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market but without profit, which he called mutualism. It is Proudhon&apos;s philosophy that was explicitly rejected by Joseph Dejacque in the inception of anarchist-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that &quot; it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature. &quot; An individualist rather than anarchist communist, Proudhon said that &quot; communism...is the very denial of society in its foundation... &quot; { Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). ISBN 1-4264-0908-7 pp. 217 } and famously declared that &quot; property is theft ! &quot; in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land. After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter&apos;s support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists, who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon, and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of collectivists like Mikhail Bakunin, while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals. [ Mutualism ] [ Mutualism (economic theory) ] Modern symbol of mutualism Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. { Mutualist.org Introduction } Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration. { Miller, David. 1987. &quot; Mutualism. &quot; The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 } Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying &quot; the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility &quot;. { Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. } Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert. { Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22. Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer). } Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital. { Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 19. Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer). } Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: &quot;... I never meant to... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all. &quot; { Solution of the Social Problem, 1848-49. } { What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government by Pierre Joseph Proudhon &apos;&apos; by } { Pierre Joseph Proudhon } { Insofar } as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support market s and private property in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called &quot; possession. &quot; ) { Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent } Proudhon&apos;s Mutualism supports labor-owned cooperative firms and associations { Hymans, E., Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, pp. 190-1, Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110 &amp; 112 } for &quot; we need not hesitate, for we have no choice... it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers... because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two... castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society &quot; and so &quot; it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism. &quot; { General Idea of the Revolution, Pluto Press, pp. 215-216 and p. 277 } As for capital goods (man-made, non-land, &quot; means of production &quot; ), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property. Mutualists, following Proudhon, originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists. However, &quot; some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term &quot; socialist. &quot; But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the libertarian right. &quot; { A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists? } Mutualists have distinguished themselves from state socialism, and don&apos;t advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon, that &quot; though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few...by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost. &quot; { Tucker, Benjamin, State Socialism and Anarchism, State Socialism and Anarchism } [ Max Stirner ] [ Max Stirner ] { Max Stirner. Portrait by } { Friedrich Engels. } { Johann } Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the nom de plume he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in German &apos;Stirn&apos;), was a German philosopher, who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism, existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner&apos;s main work is The Ego and Its Own, also known as The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum in German, which translates literally as The Only One and his Property). This work was first published in 1844 in Leipzig, and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations. [ Egoism ] [ Egoist anarchism Philosophy of Max Stirner ] Max Stirner &apos;s philosophy, sometimes called &quot; egoism, &quot; is the most extreme [ David Goodway Goodway David Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow Liverpool University Press 2006 99 1846310261 ] form of individualist anarchism. Max Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose &quot; name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism. &quot; In 1844, his The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige and sein Eigentum which may literally be translated as The Unique Individual and His Property) { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177 } was published, which is considered to be &quot; a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism. &quot; Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one&apos;s autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one&apos;s interests. { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190 } He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to &quot; a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling, &quot; saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather &quot; lives themselves out &quot; without regard to &quot; how well or ill humanity may fare thereby. &quot; { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 } Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual&apos;s power to obtain what he desires. { The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176 } He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions —including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society —were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wants to &quot; abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members. &quot; { Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95-96 } Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw Unions of Egoists, non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the state. [ Thomas Paul Karl Marx and the Anarchists Routledge / Kegan Paul London 1985 0710206852 142 ] A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties&apos; support through an act of will.

[ Carlson Andrew Anarchism in Germany Scarecrow Press Metuchen 1972 0810804840 http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/carlson.html Philosophical Egoism: German Antecedents 2008-12-04 ] For Stirner, property simply comes about through might: &quot; Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. &quot; And, &quot; What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing. &quot; He says, &quot; I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property! &quot;. { Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248 } His concept of &quot; egoistic property &quot; not only a lack of moral restraint on how own obtains and uses things, but includes other people as well. { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194 } His embrace of egoism is in stark contrast to Godwin&apos;s altruism. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. This position on property is much different from the native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor { Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. University of Massachusetts Press. 1997. p. 146 } and trade. However, in 1886 Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner&apos;s egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, &quot; with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. &quot; { McElroy, Wendy.

(Oct., 1967). p. 343 } This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcho-feminist Emma Goldman Though Stirner&apos;s philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. &quot; For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management &quot; discusses Stirner and speaks of a &quot; communist egoism, &quot; which is said to be a &quot; synthesis of individualism and collectivism, &quot; and says that &quot; greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society. &quot; { For Ourselves, The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything, 1974. } Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are influenced by Stirner. { see, for example, Christopher Gray, Leaving the Twentieth Century, p. 88. } Anarcho-communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as Anarchism And Other Essays. { Emma Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50. } [ Early American individualist anarchism ] [ Josiah Warren ] [ Josiah Warren ] { Josiah Warren } Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, { Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) What do anarchists want from us?, } { Slate.com } and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published, { William Bailie, Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist — A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20 } an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates. Warren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen&apos;s community at New Harmony, Indiana. Josiah Warren termed the phrase &quot; Cost the limit of price, &quot; with &quot; cost &quot; here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item. { &quot; A watch has a cost and a value. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals… &quot;. Warren, Josiah. Equitable Commerce } Therefore, &quot; [h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce. &quot;. He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental &quot; labor for labor store &quot; called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included &quot; Utopia &quot; and &quot; Modern Times. &quot; Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews &apos; The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren&apos;s own theories. { Charles A.

(Jan., 1945), pp. 53 } Catalan historian Xavier Diez report that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Emile Armand and the intentional communities started by them. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;L&apos;ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923-1938&apos;&apos; pg. 42 } [ Henry David Thoreau ] [ Henry David Thoreau ] { Henry David Thoreau } Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later naturist currents, simple living as a rejection of a materialist lifestyle and self-sufficiency were Thoreau&apos;s goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. &quot; Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan. For George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century. &quot; The essay Civil Disobedience (Resistance to Civil Government) was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War. The essay later influenced Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Martin Buber and Leo Tolstoy through its advocacy of nonviolent resistance. { RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard } It is also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism. The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the non-aggression principle and individual sovereignty.

[ Developments and expansion ] [ Free Love, anarcha-feminism and LGBT issues ] [ Anarchism and issues related to love and sex Anarcha-feminism Queer anarchism ] { Lucifer the Lightbearer &apos;&apos;, an influential American free love journal } { An } important current within individualist anarchism is free love. { The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy } Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual&apos;s self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed women&apos;s rights since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women. The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker { Joanne E. Passet, &quot; Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism, &quot; in: Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, James Philip Danky and Wayne A.

Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love. Later John William Lloyd, a collaborator of Benjamin Tucker ´s periodical Liberty, published in 1931 a sex manual that he called The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love. { http://www.reuniting.info/karezza_method_lloyd &quot; The Karezza Method &quot; } In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. { E. Armand and &quot; la camaraderie amoureuse &quot;. Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy } He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory. In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by individualist feminists Marie Küge, Anna Mahé, Rirette Maitrejean, and Sophia Zaïkovska. { &quot; Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la « Belle Epoque » &quot; } The Brazil ian individualist anarchist Maria Lacerda de Moura lectured on topics such as education, women&apos;s rights, free love, and antimilitarism.

[ Freethought ] [ Freethought ] Freethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism. In the United States &quot; freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to Liberty were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer &quot;. { [[Wendy McElroy ]. &quot; The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America &quot; ] } &quot; Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself &quot;. In Europe a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. &quot; Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist André Lorulot, will have its impacts in Estudios (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics. &quot;. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;El anarquismo individualista en España (1923-1939)&apos;&apos; Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 143 } This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine Ética and Iniciales &quot; there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin&apos;s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul. &quot;. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;El anarquismo individualista en España (1923-1939)&apos;&apos; Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 152 } [ Anarcho-naturism ] [ Naturism anarcho-naturism ] { Walden &apos;&apos; by } { Henry David Thoreau.

Wiley-Blackwell. 2009 } Naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small ecovillage s, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity. Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and avoided, and tried to eliminate, social determinations. { &quot; el individuo es visto en su dimensión biológica -física y psíquica- dejándose la social. &quot; &quot; EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890-1939) &quot; by Josep Maria Rosell } An early influence in this vein was Henry David Thoreau and his famous book Walden { &quot; Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea de que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. &quot; &quot; La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923-1938) &quot; by Xavier Díez } Important promoters of this were Henri Zisly and Emile Gravelle who collaborated in La Nouvelle Humanité followed by Le Naturien, Le Sauvage, L&apos;Ordre Naturel, &amp; La Vie Naturelle. { &quot; 1855 -- France: Emile Gravelle lives, Douai.

Published on Revista &apos;&apos;ADN&apos;&apos;. Winter 2003 } &quot; The linking role played by the ‘Sol y Vida’ group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, ‘Ecléctico’, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First Etica and then Iniciales, which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ‘Iniciales’ He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ‘silvestre del campo’, (wild man in the country). “I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.” &quot;. &quot; The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of Han Ryner ) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ( Federación Anarquista Ibérica ) &quot;. [ Individualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche ] [ Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche#Individualist anarchism ] The thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been influential in individualist anarchism specifically in thinkers such as the French Emile Armand, { &quot; The life of Emile Armand (1872-1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson.

William B.

He syncretized Abolitionism, Free Love, spiritual universalism, (Josiah) Warren, &amp; (Charles) Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy...He was instrumental in founding several “intentional communities,” including the “Brownstone Utopia” on 14th St. in New York, &amp; “ Modern Times ” in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey) — in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for “ Free Love ”) &amp; finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews ( &amp; Victoria Woodhull ) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the 1st International, expelled by Marx for its anarchist, feminist, &amp; spiritualist tendencies. &quot; [ The &quot; Boston Anarchists &quot; ] { Lysander Spooner } { Another } form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States, as advocated by the &quot; Boston anarchists. &quot; By default, American individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that &quot; one man employ another &quot; or that &quot; he direct him, &quot; in his labor but rather demanded that &quot; all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished. &quot; { Madison, Charles A. &quot; Anarchism in the United States. &quot; Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53. } They believed state monopoly capitalism (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly) { Schwartzman, Jack. &quot; Ingalls, Hanson, and Tucker: Nineteenth-Century American Anarchists. &quot; American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Vol. 62, No. 5 (November 2003). p. 325. } prevented labor from being fully rewarded. Voltairine de Cleyre, summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists &quot; are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State. &quot; { de Cleyre, Voltairine.

Joseph Labadie (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist, and poet. In 1883 Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with &quot; the great natural laws...without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes. &quot; However, he supported community cooperation, as he supported community control of water utilities, streets, and railroads. { Martin, James J. (1970). Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827-1908. Colorado Springs: Ralph Myles Publisher. } Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the Haymarket anarchists, he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president, and forged an alliance with Samuel Gompers. On the other hand Dyer Lum was a 19th-century American individualist anarchist labor activist and poet. [ Schuster Eunice Native American Anarchism Breakout Productions City 1999 9781893626218 168 (footnote 22) ] A leading anarcho-syndicalist and a prominent left-wing intellectual of the 1880s, [ Johnpoll Bernard Harvey Klehr Biographical Dictionary of the American Left Greenwood Press Westport 1986 9780313242007 ] he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early anarcha-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre. Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts, and contributed to publications including Mother Earth, Twentieth Century, and, The Alarm (the journal of the International Working People&apos;s Association ) and The Open Court among others. Lum&apos;s political philosophy was a fusion of individualist anarchist economics – &quot; a radicalized form of laissez-faire economics &quot; inspired by the Boston anarchists – with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time. [ http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/04/may-day-thoughts-individualist.html May Day Thoughts: Individualist Anarchism and the Labor Movement Carson Kevin Kevin Carson 2007-08-07 Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism ] Herbert Spencer and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency. He developed a &quot; mutualist &quot; theory of unions and as such was active within the Knights of Labor and later promoted anti-political strategies in the American Federation of Labor. Frustration with abolitionism, spiritualism, and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers, as he came to believe that revolution would inevitably involve a violent struggle between the working class and the employing class. Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, hoping thereby to bring about the end of slavery. Kevin Carson has praised Lum&apos;s fusion of individualist laissez-faire economics with radical labor activism as &quot; creative &quot; and described him as &quot; more significant than any in the Boston group &quot;. [ American egoism ] { Benjamin Tucker } { Some } of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner &apos;s Egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, &quot; the right of might &quot; and &quot; the right of contract. &quot; He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, &quot; In times past...it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off....Man&apos;s only right to land is his might over it. &quot; { Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350 } In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of Liberty in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly. &quot; { Wendy Mcelroy. &quot; Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order &quot; } &quot; Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by Liberty&apos;s presentation of egoism. They included: I published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of Liberty); The Ego and The Egoist, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German Der Eigene, edited by Adolf Brand, and The Eagle and The Serpent, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle &apos;A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology. { McElroy, Wendy. A Reconsideration of Trial by Jury, Forumulations, Winter 1998-1999, Free Nation Foundation } American anarchists who adhered to egoism include Benjamin Tucker, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker and Victor Yarros and E.H. Fulton. John Beverley Robinson wrote an essay called &quot; Egoism &quot; in which he states that &quot; Modern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and Nietzsche, and expounded by Ibsen, Shaw and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual. &quot; { &quot; Egoism &quot; by [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson ]] } Italian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism was brought to the United States { &quot; it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity -- and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy. &quot; [[Murray Bookchin ]. } { Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm ] } by Italian born individualists such as Giuseppe Ciancabilla and others who advocated for violent propaganda by the deed there. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian social anarchist Errico Malatesta became involved &quot; in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant. &quot; { Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } Enrico Arrigoni (pseudonym: Frank Brand) was an Italian American individualist anarchist Lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of Max Stirner. { Enrico Arrigoni at the Daily Bleed&apos;s Anarchist Encyclopedia } { [[Paul Avrich ]. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America] } He took the pseudonym &quot; Brand &quot; from a fictional character in one of Henrik Ibsen ´s plays. In the 1910s he started becoming involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City and there he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal Eresia in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as L&apos; Adunata dei refrattari, Cultura Obrera, Controcorrente and Intessa Libertaria. During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists but was imprisoned and was helped on his release by Emma Goldman. Afterwards Arrigoni became a longtime member of the Libertarian Book Club in New York City. His written works include The totalitarian nightmare (1975), The lunacy of the Superman (1977), Adventures in the country of the monoliths (1981) and Freedom: my dream (1986). [ Anarcho-capitalism ] (Rothbard circa 1955). [ Anarcho-capitalism ] 19th century individualist anarchists espoused the labor theory of value. Some believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th century American individualist anarchists: &quot; Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as anarcho-capitalists. &quot; { Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, } { Blackwell Publishing, 2003, p. 13 } As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neo-classical economics. According to Kevin Carson (himself a mutualist ), &quot; most people who call themselves &quot; individualist anarchists &quot; today are followers of Murray Rothbard&apos;s Austrian economics. &quot; [ Carson Kevin Kevin Carson Studies in Mutualist Political Economy BookSurge Publishing Preface http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html 2007 1419658697 ] Murray Rothbard, a student of Ludwig von Mises, combined the Austrian school economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker. { Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 290 } In the mid-1950s Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that &quot; we are not anarchists...but not archists either...Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist, &quot; concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century). { Rothbard, Murray. Are Libertarians &apos;Anarchists&apos;?. LewRockwell.com. } However, Rothbard later chose the term &quot; anarcho-capitalism &quot; for his philosophy and referred to himself as an anarchist.

Most Agorists consider that property rights are natural right s deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, Agorists are divided on the question of intellectual property rights.

Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist nihilism, antirationalism, neo- primitivism, anti-technologism, neo- Situationist &apos;cultural terrorism&apos;, mysticism, and a &apos;practice&apos; of staging Foucauldian &apos;personal insurrections&apos;. &quot; { Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm by } { Murray Bookchin } Post-left anarchist Bob Black in his long critique of Bookchin&apos;s philosophy called Anarchy after leftism said about post-left anarchy that &quot; It is, unlike Bookchinism, “individualistic” in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual — i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray — is not the measure of the good society, what is? &quot;. { &apos;&apos;Anarchy after Leftism&apos;&apos; by } { Bob Black } { Hakim Bey, contemporary } { egoist &quot; } { lifestyle anarchist &quot; } A strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist Max Stirner.

Feral Faun wrote in 1995 that: In the game of insurgence—a lived guerilla war game—it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them.

An early important individualist anarchist was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of &apos;Anarchie, Journal de l&apos;Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l&apos;idée démocratique&apos; and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States &quot; he at least contacted (Henry David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren. &quot; { Xavier Diez.

Later appeared the journal L&apos;EnDehors created by Zo d&apos;Axa in 1891. { Zo d&apos;Axa } French individualist anarchists exposed a diversity of positions (per example, about violence and non-violence). For example, Emile Armand rejected violence and embraced mutualism while becoming an important propagandist for free love, while Albert Libertad and Zo d&apos;Axa were influential in violentists circles and championed violent propaganda by the deed while adhering to communitarianism or anarcho-communism { &quot; Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l&apos;anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l&apos;individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal &quot; l&apos;Anarchie &quot; dira &quot; Nous ne nous faisions pas d&apos;illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l&apos;individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression. &quot;.

Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with stoicism. Nevertheless French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Naturism and free love contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups. &quot; Along with feverish activity against the social order, (Albert) Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the “ joy of living ” and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society. &quot; { “Machete” #1. &quot; Bonnot and the Evangelists &quot; } Anarchist naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist &quot; partisan of the milieux libres, publisher of &quot; Flambeau &quot; ( &quot; an enemy of authority &quot; ) in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several. { http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm &quot; 1926 -- France: Georges Butaud (1868-1926) dies, in Ermont. &quot; } &quot; In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of &quot; unions of egoists &quot; with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in symphathy within some, and a strong rejection within others. &quot; { &quot; La insumisión voluntaria.

The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Emile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. &quot; } Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of &quot; might &quot; rather than &quot; right &quot;; for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal, although some committed crimes as a form of propaganda of the deed. The illegalists embraced direct action and propaganda of the deed. { http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm } Influenced by theorist Max Stirner&apos;s egoism as well as Proudhon (his view that Property is theft! ), Clément Duval and Marius Jacob proposed the theory of la reprise individuelle (Eng: individual reclamation ) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system., Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which Ravachol, Émile Henry, Auguste Vaillant, and Caserio committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism, { &quot; Pre-WWI France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle. &quot; &quot; Illegalism &quot; by Rob los Ricos } in what is known as propaganda of the deed. France&apos;s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism. [ Italy ] { Renzo Novatore } { In } Italy individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards illegalism and violent propaganda by the deed similar to French individualist anarchism but perhaps more extreme { &quot; anarco-individualismo &quot; in italian anarchopedia } { &quot; At this point, encouraged by the disillusionment that followed the breakdown of the general strike, the terrorist individualists who had always -- despite Malatesta&apos;s influence -- survived as a small minority among Italian anarchists, intervened frightfully and tragically. &quot; } { George Woodcock.

At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant. &quot; } { George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } In this respect we can consider notorious magnicides carried out or attempted by individualists Giovanni Passannante, Sante Caserio, Michele Angiolillo, Luigi Luccheni, Gaetano Bresci who murdered king Umberto I. Caserio lived in France and coexisted within French illegalism and later assassinated French president Sadi Carnot. The theoretical seeds of current Insurrectionary anarchism were already laid out at the end of 19th century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview. { &quot; Essa trova soprattutto in America del Nord un notevole seguito per opera del Galleani che esprime una sintesi fra l&apos;istanza puramente individualista di stampo anglosassone e americano (ben espressa negli scritti di Tucker) e quella profondamente socialista del movimento anarchico di lingua italiana. Questa commistione di elementi individualisti e comunisti - che caratterizza bene la corrente antiorganizzatrice - rappresenta lo sforzo di quanti avvertirono in modo estremamente sensibile l&apos;invadente burocratismo che pervadeva il movimento operaio e socialista. &quot; &quot; anarchismo insurrezionale &quot; in italian anarchopedia } During the rise of fascism this thought also motivated Gino Lucetti, Michele Schirru and Angelo Sbardellotto in attempting the assassination of Benito Mussolini. During the early 20th century, the intellectual work of individualist anarchist Renzo Novatore came to importance; he was influenced by Stirner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georges Palante, Oscar Wilde, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Baudelaire. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in futurism avant-garde currents. In his thought, he adhered to Stirnerist disrespect for private property, only recognizing property of one&apos;s own spirit. &quot; Novatore non era contrario all&apos;abolizione della proprietà privata, poichè riteneva che l&apos;unica proprietà inviolabile fosse solo quella spirituale ed etica. Il suo pensiero è esplicitato in &quot; Verso il nulla creatore &quot; : { Bisogna che tutto ciò che si chiama &quot; proprietà materiale &quot;, &quot; proprietà privata &quot;, &quot; proprietà esteriore &quot; diventi per gli individui ciò che è il sole, la luce, il cielo, il mare, le stelle. E ciò avverrà!Avverrà perchè noi - gli iconoclasti - la violenteremo!Solo la ricchezza etica espirituale è invulnerabile. E&apos; vera proprietà dell&apos;individuo. Il resto no! Il resto è vulnerabile! E tutto ciò che è vulnerabile sarà vulnerato. &quot; &quot; Renzo Novatore &quot; in italian anarchopedia } Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal Iconoclasta! alongside the young stirner ist illegalist Bruno Filippi { &apos;&apos;The rebel&apos;s dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi&apos;&apos; } The individualist philosopher and poet Renzo Novatore belonged to the leftist section of the avant-garde movement of Futurism { Novatore: una biografia } alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as Dante Carnesecchi, Leda Rafanelli, Auro d&apos;Arcola, and Giovanni Governato. Also there was Pietro Bruzzi who published the journal L&apos;Individualista in the 1920s alongside Ugo Fedeli and Francesco Ghezzi but who fell to fascist forces later. { &quot; L’Indivi-dualista &quot; � } { &quot; Pietro Bruzzi &quot; at italian anarchopedia } Pietro Bruzzi also collaborated with the Italian American individualist anarchist publication Eresia of New York City edited by Enrico Arrigoni. In Italy in 1945, during the Founding Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation, there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria { http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Storia_del_movimento_libertario_in_Italia &quot; Storia del movimento libertario in Italia &quot; in anarchopedia in Italian } who was an important anarchist of the time. { http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/73n6nh Cesare Zaccaria (19 August 1897-October 1961)Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey } Later, during the IX Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation in Carrara in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica. In the seventies, it was mostly composed of &quot; veteran individualist anarchists with an of pacifism orientation, naturism, etc,... &quot;. { &quot; Los anarco-individualistas, G.I.A...Una escisión de la FAI producida en el IX Congreso (Carrara, 1965) se pr odujo cuando un sector de anarquistas de tendencia humanista rechazan la interpretación que ellos juzgan disciplinaria del &apos;&apos;pacto asociativo &quot; clásico, y crean los GIA (Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica).

At the turn of the century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Mariano Gallardo, and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen, Estudios and Nosotros. The most influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Emile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, the spread of Esperanto and anationalism had importance just as naturism and free love currents. Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish invidualist press. Armand&apos;s concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual. Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Gimenez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation. { Xavier Diez. El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923-1938.

He also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist maganize Al Margen: Publicación quincenal individualista. { &quot; Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada... &quot; La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923-1938) por Xavier Diez } In his youth he engaged in illegalist activities. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;L&apos;ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923-1938&apos;&apos; } His thought was deeply influenced by Max Stirner, of which he was the main popularizer in Spain through his own writings. He published and wrote the preface to the fourth edition in Spanish of The Ego and Its Own from 1900. He proposed the creation of a Union of Egoists, to be a Federation of Individualist Anarchists in Spain, but did not succeed. { &quot; A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas &quot; &quot; La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923-1938) por Xavier Diez } In 1956 he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Emile Armand { &quot; Stirner &quot; por Miguel Gimenez Igualada } Afterwards he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico. Federico Urales was an important individualist anarchist who edited La Revista Blanca. The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism, which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy, and thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead he favored small groups based on ideological alignement. He supported and participated in the establishment of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) in 1927. In 1956, on exile escaping from Franco´s dictatorship Miguel Giménez Igualada published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Emile Armand On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds Anarchism in 1968, during his exile in Mexico from Franco&apos;s dictatorship in Spain. { &apos;&apos;Anarquismo&apos;&apos; by Miguel Gimenez Igualada } He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945. { Miguel Gimenez Igualada. &apos;&apos;Anarquismo&apos;&apos; } In 2000, in Spain Ateneo Libertario Ricardo Mella, Ateneo libertario Al Margen, Ateneu Enciclopèdic Popular, Ateneo Libertario de Sant Boi, Ateneu Llibertari Poble Sec y Fundació D&apos;Estudis Llibertaris i Anarcosindicalistes republished Emile Armand&apos;s writings on Free Love and individualist anarchism in a compilation titled Individualist anarchism and Amorous camaraderie. { &apos;&apos;Individualismo anarquista y camaradería amorosa&apos;&apos; by [[Emile Armand ]] } Recently Catalan historian Xavier Diez has dedicated extensive research on Spanish individualist anarchism as can be seen in his books El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923-1938 { &apos;&apos;El anarquismo individualista en España.&apos;&apos; by Xavier Diez } and Utopia sexual a la premsa anarquista de Catalunya.

He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, Die Anarchisten and Der Freiheitsucher, contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker. { &quot; New England Anarchism in Germany &quot; by Thomas A. Riley } McKay is also known as an important European early activist for Gay rights. Using the pseudonym Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for pederastic emancipation, titled Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe (Books of the Nameless Love). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the Fenny Skaller, a story of a pederast. { thamyris 02 } Under the same pseudonym he also published fiction, such as Holland (1924) and a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, Der Puppenjunge (The Hustler) (1926). { Der Eigene &apos;&apos; } { stirner ist pioneer Gay activist publication } Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, stirner ist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. Brand published a German homosexual periodical, Der Eigene in 1896.

Der Eigene concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have had an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, John Henry Mackay (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus and Sascha Schneider.

It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for Salomo Friedlaender ).

Tucker, in fact, published an American edition. From its early championing of Walt Whitman&apos;s Leaves of Grass to a series of short stories by Francis du Bosque in its last issues, Liberty was a vehicle of controversial, avant-garde literature. &quot; &quot; Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order &quot; by Wendy McElroy } In his important essay The Soul of Man under Socialism from 1891 he defended socialism as the way to guarantee individualism and so he saw that &quot; With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all. &quot; { &quot; [[The Soul of Man under Socialism ] &quot; by } { Oscar Wilde ] } For anarchist historian George Woodcock &quot; Wilde&apos;s aim in The Soul of Man under Socialism is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as aesthete. &quot; { George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962. (pg. 447) } Woodocock finds that &quot; The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde The Soul of Man under Socialism &quot; and finds that it is influenced mainly by the thought of William Godwin. In the late 19th century in the United Kingdom, there existed individualist anarchists such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Joseph Hiam Levy, Joseph Greevz Fisher, John Badcock, Jr., Albert Tarn, and Henry Seymour { &quot; The English Individualists As They Appear In Liberty &quot; by Carl Watner } who were close to the United States group around Benjamin Tucker ´s magazine Liberty.

He writes: Max Stirner&apos;s impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner&apos;s political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. Andrew Koch, for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth. { &quot; War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze&apos;s Anarchism &quot; by [[Saul Newman ]] } Newman has published several essays on Stirner. &quot; War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze&apos;s Anarchism &quot; and &quot; Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner &quot; { &quot; Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner &quot; by Saul Newman } discusses what he sees are similarities between Stirner&apos;s thought and that of Gilles Deleuze.

[ Paul Avrich Avrich Paul The Russian Anarchists AK Press Stirling 2006 1904859488 56 ] The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class. For anarchist historian Paul Avrich &quot; The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois societypolitical, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society. &quot; Some Russian individualists anarchists &quot; found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained &quot; philosophical &quot; anarchists who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books. &quot; Lev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolchevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Benjamin Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled Associational Anarchism, in which he advocated the &quot; free association of independent individuals. &quot;. { &quot; Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians &quot; } On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917. He was an advocate &quot; for the seizure of private homes &quot;, which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture. Chernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual.

[ Bookchin Murray Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism AK Press Stirling 1995 9781873176832 ] Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only negative liberty and rejects the idea of positive liberty. { Bookchin, Murray. &quot; Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism &quot;. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993-1998. } { AK Press, 1999, p. 155 } Philosopher Albert Meltzer proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism, and that it &quot; is sometimes too readily conceded &apos;that this is, after all, anarchism&apos;. &quot; He claimed that Benjamin Tucker &apos;s acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the &quot; employer&apos;s &apos;freedom&apos; &quot; ) is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as &quot; no government. &quot; { Meltzer, Albert. Anarchism: Arguments For and Against. AK Press, 2000. pp. 114-115 } Philosopher George Bernard Shaw initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was &quot; the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it. &quot; Shaw&apos;s argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of laissez-faire advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation. { Griffith, Gareth. Socialism and Superior Brain: The Political Thought of George Bernard Shaw. Routledge (UK). 1993. p. 310 } According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they &quot; do not see that as an injustice. &quot; { Anderson, Carlotta R. All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement, Wayne State University Press, 1998, p. 250 } Tucker explained, &quot; If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living. &quot; { Tucker, Benjamin.

Some sources, such as An Anarchist FAQ use the classification &quot; social anarchism / individualist anarchism &quot;. Some see individualist anarchism as distinctly non-socialist, and use the classification &quot; socialist anarchism / individualist anarchism &quot; accordingly. { Ostergaard, Geoffrey. &quot; Anarchism &quot;. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 14. } Other classifications include &quot; mutualist/communal &quot; anarchism. { Carson, Kevin, &quot; A Mutualist FAQ &quot;. } β [ B β none ] Michael Freeden identifies four broad type s of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates self-government with a &quot; progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others. &quot; The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of Egoism, as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is &quot; found in Herbert Spencer &apos;s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as Donisthorpe, foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution. &quot; The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships. γ [ C γ none ] See, for example, the Winter 2006 issue of the Journal of Libertarian Studies, dedicated to reviews of Kevin Carson&apos;s Studies in Mutualist Political Economy. Mutualists compose one bloc, along with agorists and geo-libertarians, in the recently formed Alliance of the Libertarian Left. δ [ D δ none ] Though this term is non-standard usage – by &quot; left &quot;, agorists mean &quot; left &quot; in the general sense used by left-libertarians, as defined by Roderick T. Long, as &quot;... an integration, or I&apos;d argue, a reintegration of libertarianism with concerns that are traditionally thought of as being concerns of the left. That includes concerns for worker empowerment, worry about plutocracy, concerns about feminism and various kinds of social equality. &quot; { Long, Roderick. T.
