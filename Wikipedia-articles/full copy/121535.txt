The Wednesday night ice cream social at the United Methodist Church kicks off the celebration and always draws a good turnout. For the athletes, Fun Days hosts one of the area&apos;s best volleyball tournaments and a softball tournament. The parade typically draws 50+ floats and is a favorite for the locals. There is also a flea market in the park and a treasure hunt in which a medallion is hidden and the finder gets a prize. The street dance brings live music to town and ropes off a beer garden with burgers and hot dogs. After the band calls it a night, the younger adults typically find themselves at one of the many late-night house parties hosted throughout town. Fun Days serves as a homecoming of sorts for many of the city&apos;s former residents and a great chance to catch up with some long-lived camaraderie. { http://www.cityofdanube.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC &amp; SEC={4EDB7C68-8780-46E8-8516-F6E44A3D0DFD} } [ Activities ] The youth of Danube enjoy some unique activities that help to keep Danube special. The youth ride bicycles as their way of getting around, and typically have ridden their bikes through the streets and sidewalks of Danube enough to accumulate 5,000 miles (unofficially). Skinned knees are an epidemic with these youth. Summer Rec is also a pastime in Danube - a &quot; little league &quot; baseball organization that runs through most of the summer alongside swimming lessons at a neighboring town&apos;s public pool. In their teenage years, residents will typically discover that the Danube water tower can be climbed (much to the chagrin of the city maintenance workers and the lone police officer) for a great view of the city and the surrounding area. These youth also discover the quonset building just North of town which they &quot; tag &quot; with their name, last name, or nickname. Adult activities include &quot; going up town &quot; for lunch at the cafe, catching up with the gossip at &quot; The 1-Stop &quot;, &quot; going up town &quot; to get the mail, or attending the high school&apos;s various sporting events. Nightlife is monopolized by Miller&apos;s on Main - the residents&apos; only choice for a place to sing some karaoke.
