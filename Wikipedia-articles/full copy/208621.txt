Population: [ 82,882 82,090 80,297 ] [ History ] [ Early settlements in the vicinity ] The mouth of the Don River has always been an important commercial center. At the start of the 3rd century BCE, the Greeks from the Bosporan Kingdom founded a colony here, which they called Tanais (after the Greek name of the river). Several centuries later, in the last third of 1st century BCE, the settlement was burnt down by king Polemon I of Pontus. The introduction of Greek colonists restored its prosperity, but the Goths practically annihilated it in the 3rd century. The site of ancient Tanais, now occupied by the khutor of Nedvigovka, has been excavated since the mid-19th century. In the 10th century, the area passed under control of the Slavic princedom of Tmutarakan. The Kipchaks, seizing the area in 1067, renamed it Azaq (i.e., lowlands), from which appellation the modern name is derived. The Golden Horde claimed most of the coast in the 13th and 14th centuries, but the Venetian and Genoese merchants were granted permission to settle on the site of modern-day Azov and founded there a colony which they called Tana (or La Tana). [ Archaeological digs ] In autumn 2000, Thor Heyerdahl wanted to further investigate his idea that Scandinavians may have migrated from the south via waterways. He was on the trail of Odin (Wotan), the Germanic and Nordic god of the mythologies of the early sagas. According to Snorre, the Icelandic author of the Nordic Sagas, who wrote in the 13th century, Odin was supposed to have migrated from the region of the Caucasus or the area just east of the Black Sea near the turn of the 1st century CE. Heyerdahl was particularly interested in Snorre&apos;s reference to the land of origin of the Æsir people. Heyerdahl wanted to test the veracity of Snorre and, consequently, organized the Joint Archaeological Excavation in Azov, Russia, in 2001. He had wanted to undertake a second excavation the following year, but it never happened due to his death in April 2002. { J. Bjornar Storfjell, &quot; Thor Heyerdahl&apos;s Final Projects, &quot; in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 10:2 (Summer 2002) } [ Fortress of Azov ] Ramparts of Azov Fortress A 17th-century Dutch engraving representing the Battle of Azov (1696) In 1471, the Ottoman Empire gained control of the area and built the strong fortress of Azak (Azov). The fort blocked the Don Cossacks from raiding and trading into the Black Sea. The Cossacks had attacked Azov in 1574, 1593, 1620, and 1626. In April 1637, three thousand Don and four thousand Zaporozhian Cossacks besieged Azov (the Turks had four thousand soldiers and two hundred cannons). The fort fell on June  21 and the Cossacks sent a request to the Tsar for re-enforcements and support. A commission recommended against this because of the danger of war with Turkey and poor state of the fortifications. In June 1641, Hussein Deli, Pasha of Silistria invested the fort with 70,000–80,000 men. In September, they had to withdraw because of disease and provisioning shortfalls. A second Russian commission reported that the siege had left very little of the walls. In March 1642, Sultan Ibrahim issued an ultimatum and Tsar Mikhail ordered the Cossacks to evacuate. The Turks reoccupied Azov in September 1642. { Brian L. Davies, &apos;Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe, 2007, page 88-90 } The fortress, however, had yet to pass through many vicissitudes. During the Azov campaigns of (1696), Peter the Great, who desired naval access to the Black Sea, managed to recover the fortress. { Lord Kinross, The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire, Perennial, 1979, p. 353. ISBN 0-688-03093-9. } Azov was granted town status in 1708, [ May 2010 ] but the disastrous Pruth River Campaign constrained him to hand it back to the Turks in 1711. [ Boeck Brian J. 2008 When Peter I Was Forced to Settle for Less: Coerced Labor and Resistance in a Failed Russian Colony (1695–1711) The Journal of Modern History 80 3 485–514 10.1086/589589 ] A humorous description of the events is featured in Voltaire &apos;s Candide. During the Great Russo-Turkish War, it was taken by the army under Count Rumyantsev and finally ceded to Russia under the terms of Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji (1774). For seven years Azov was a seat of a its own governorate, but with the growth of neighboring Rostov-on-the-Don it gradually declined in importance. It was occupied by the Germans between July 1942 and February 1943 during World War II. [ Administrative and municipal status ] Administratively, it is incorporated as Azov Urban Okrug —an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. { Law #340-ZS } Municipally, this administrative unit also has the urban okrug status. { Law #234-ZS } [ Government ] Sergey Bezdolny of United Russia was elected Mayor of Azov on April  3, 2005 and re-elected on October  11, 2009 by 72.9% of the voters. [ Climate ] Azov&apos;s climate is humid continental ( Köppen climate classification Dfa), featuring hot summers, cold winters (though quite mild for Russia), and fairly low precipitation.
