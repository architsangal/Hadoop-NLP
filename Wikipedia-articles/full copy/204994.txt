[ the genus of flowering plants ] [ Chinese Wisteria Blütentrauben.JPG 250px Flowering Wisteria sinensis Plantae Angiosperms Eudicots Rosids Fabales Fabaceae Faboideae Millettieae Wisteria Nutt. Species See text. ] Wisteria (also spelled Wistaria or Wysteria) is a genus of flowering plant s in the pea family, Fabaceae, that includes ten species of woody climbing vine s native to the Eastern United States and to China, Korea, and Japan. Some species are popular ornamental plants, especially in China and Japan. An aquatic flowering plant with the common name wisteria or &apos;water wisteria&apos; is in fact Hygrophila difformis, in the family Acanthaceae. [ Taxonomy ] The botanist Thomas Nuttall said he named the genus Wisteria in memory of Dr. Caspar Wistar (1761–1818).

Accessed 2009.06.02. } Questioned about the spelling later, Nuttall said it was for &quot; euphony &quot;, but his biographer speculated that it may have something to do with Nuttall&apos;s friend Charles Jones Wister, Sr., of Grumblethorpe, the grandson of the merchant John Wister.

They can climb as high as 20 m above the ground and spread out 10 m laterally. The world&apos;s largest known Wisteria vine is in Sierra Madre, California, measuring more than [ 1 acre ha ] in size and weighing 250 tons, planted in 1894 of the Chinese lavender variety. { sierramadrechamber.com Wistaria } { sierramadrenews.net Wistaria } The leaves are alternate, 15 to 35  cm long, pinnate, with 9 to 19 leaflets. The flower s are produced in pendulous raceme s 10 to 80  cm long, similar to those of the genus Laburnum, but are purple, violet, pink or white, but not yellow. Flowering is in the spring (just before or as the leaves open) in some Asian species, and in mid to late summer in the American species and W. japonica. The flowers of some species are fragrant, most notably Chinese Wisteria. The seed s are produced in pods similar to those of Laburnum, and, like the seeds of that genus, are poison ous. Wisteria is considered an invasive species in many parts of the U.S., especially the Southeast, due to its ability to overtake and choke out other native plant species. Wisteria species are used as food plants by the larva e of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail. [ Cultivation ] { Nymans Gardens, } { West Sussex, England. } { Ashikaga Flower Park in } { Ashikaga, Tochigi, } { Japan. The largest wisteria in Japan, it is dated to c. 1870 and covers approximately 1,990 square meters (half an } { acre ) as of May 2008. } Wisteria, especially Wisteria sinensis, is very hardy and fast-growing. It can grow in fairly poor-quality soils, but prefers fertile, moist, well-drained soil. They thrive in full sun.Wisteria can be propagated via hardwood cutting, softwood cuttings, or seed. However, specimens grown from seed can take decades to bloom; for this reason, gardener s usually grow plants that have been started from rooted cuttings or grafted cultivar s known to flower well. [ A lot of articles claim that any cutting also takes years to bloom, but this indicates that it does not March 2012 ] Another reason for failure to bloom can be excessive fertilizer (particularly nitrogen ). Wisteria has nitrogen fixing capability (provided by Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules), and thus mature plants may benefit from added potassium and phosphate, but not nitrogen. Finally, wisteria can be reluctant to bloom because it has not reached maturity. Maturation may require only a few years, as in Kentucky Wisteria, or nearly twenty, as in Chinese Wisteria. Maturation can be forced by physically abusing the main trunk, root pruning, or drought stress. Wisteria can grow into a mound when unsupported, but is at its best when allowed to clamber up a tree, pergola, wall, or other supporting structure. Whatever the case, the support must be very sturdy, because mature Wisteria can become immensely strong with heavy wrist-thick trunk s and stem s. These will certainly rend latticework, crush thin wooden posts, and can even strangle large trees. Wisteria allowed to grow on houses can cause damage to gutters, downspouts, and similar structures. Its pendulous racemes are best viewed from below. Wisteria flowers develop in buds near the base of the previous year&apos;s growth, so pruning back side shoots to the basal few buds in early spring can enhance the visibility of the flowers. If it is desired to control the size of the plant, the side shoots can be shortened to between 20 and 40  cm long in mid summer, and back to 10 to 20  cm in the fall. The flowers of some varieties are edible, and can even be used to make wine. Others are said to be toxic. Careful identification by an expert is strongly recommended before consuming this or any wild plant. [ In culture ] Fuji Musumè (藤娘) or Wisteria Maiden is an Otsu-e (Japanese folk painting in Ōtsu, Shiga ) subject thought to have been inspired by popular dances. These painting were often sold as good-luck charms for marriages. Fuji Musumè is also a famous classical Kabuki dance. In Barbara Kingsolver&apos;s novel The Bean Trees, Turtle refers to wisteria vines as bean trees, because the pre-bloomed flower pods are shaped like beans. Later, she and Taylor learn that wisteria is a legume (i.e., is in the bean family) and that wisteria and other legumes engage in symbiotic relationships, just as the book&apos;s characters do.
