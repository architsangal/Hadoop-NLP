[ the Russian aircraft manufacturer people with the surname Yakovlev (surname) ] [ A.S. Yakovlev Design Bureau JSC Yakolev Design Bureau logo Division 1934 Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev Aerospace and defense Military aircraft United Aircraft Corporation yak.ru ] The Yak Aircraft Corporation (formerly the A.S. Yakovlev Design Bureau JSC) is a Russian aircraft designer and manufacturer (design office prefix Yak). Its head office is in Aeroport District, Northern Administrative Okrug, Moscow. { Home page.

Yakovlev. During World War II Yakovlev designed and produced a famed line of fighter aircraft. It was merged into the Yak Aviation Company with Smolensk Aviation Plant Joint Stock Company in March 1992, although the two companies continued to be operated separately. It later underwent privatization and became Yak Aircraft Corporation. The Russian government is planning to merge the holding company with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Sukhoi and Tupolev as a new company named United Aircraft Building Corporation. { &quot; Russian Aircraft Industry Seeks Revival Through Merger. &quot; } { The New York Times. February 22, 2006. } The firm is the designer of the Pchela ( [ Пчела ], &quot; bee &quot; ) drone reconnaissance aircraft and is perhaps best known for its highly successful line of World War II-era piston-engined fighter aircraft. The name Yakovlev is used commonly in the West, but in Russia it is always abbreviated as Yak ( [ Як ] ) as a part of an aircraft name. The German transliteration, often used by the Russians, Poles, and others as well, is Jak.
