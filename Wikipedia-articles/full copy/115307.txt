[ History ] { Great Depression } In autumn of 1911, the Consolidation Coal Company purchased the current location of Jenkins as part of a one hundred thousand acre tract of land in Pike, Letcher and Floyd counties from the Northern Coal and Coke Company. After the acquisition was finalized, plans were made to extend the Lexington and Eastern Railroad from Jackson to a town named McRoberts. Also, there were plans for a town named Jenkins, after George C. Jenkins, a director of the Consolidation Coal Company. { History of Jenkins, Kentucky Retrieved on 2010-2-7 } Because of the need of hundreds of homes and other structures, nine sawmills and two brickyards were erected. A steam and electric plant was established to temporarily generate power to the houses. Next, a temporary narrow gauge railroad was built over Pine Mountain from Glamorgan, Virginia in order to carry supplies to further the development of the town. Jenkins&apos; city government was established as soon as the businesses and land were put up for sale. The company even went as far to supply the town with its own marshals to enforce the law. Jenkins was finally incorporated as a sixth-class city on January 9, 1912. [ Geography ] Jenkins is located at [ 37 10 48 N 82 37 56 W type:city ] (37.179914, -82.632148) [ 1 ].
