It is the second highest mountain in Iran and has a permanent crater lake formed at its summit. Sabalan has a ski resort (Alvares) and different tourist areas such as the Sarein spa. The mountain is known for its beautiful vistas, including the Shirvan gorge, where few climbers ever venture. Map of summit region and glaciers of Sabalan. [ The Sabalan mountain ] Savalan (The Wonder Peak) Located in the extreme north west of Iran in meshkin shar (khiav), it is the country&apos;s second highest peak. { Sources differ on the height of } { Alam Kuh. Due to its elevation being very near that of Sabalan, either of these peaks may be variously listed as either the second or third highest mountain in Iran. Some sources give a significantly higher elevation for Alam Kuh of 4850 m. However, more reliable sources such as Peaklist (Alam Kuh is listed here as &quot; Kuhha-ye Alborz &quot; ) state an elevation of 4805 m based on Soviet topographic maps and modern } { SRTM data. This data supports Sabalan as the second highest peak in Iran and Alam Kuh as the third highest. } At 4,811 metres it is taller than Mount Blanc in the Alps. The mountain offers many attractions throughout the year. On the slopes of the mountain the mineral water from springs attracts large amounts of tourists each year, many have faith in healing properties believed to be in the springs. The nomadic people of the area live in small villages, with their round &quot; Yurt &quot; tents appealing to tourism. Sabalan is a volcanic peak, and at 3,600 metres you can see gigantic &apos;sculptures&apos; which are eroded volcanic stone outcrops which resemble animals, birds and insects. [ Geology ] Savalan is a large andesite stratovolcano, the second highest volcano in meshkin shahr (khiav) Iranian Azerbaijan (North West Iran) after Mount Damavand. The volcano is quite old, as its rocks have been dated to 5.6–1.4  million years. Some references state that volcanic activity continued into the Holocene, less than 10,000  years ago. The summit region has several peaks exceeding [ 4500 m ft -2 ], primarily along a southwest-northeast trending ridge. The highest point [ 4811 m ft 0 ] is at the northeast end of the ridge, and is separated from the [ 4620 m ft -1 ] + group of southwestern summits by a [ 4190 m ft -1 on on on on ] col. The mountain is located in a continental climate with hot, dry summers and extremely cold, snowy winters. Precipitation falls primarily as snow in late autumn, winter, and spring, and is sufficient to sustain seven glacier s near the summit above [ 4000 m ft -3 ]. The largest of these were more than [ 1.5 km mi 0 ] in length as of the 1970s. There are also extensive rock glacier s, several of which are more than [ 3 km mi 0 on ] in length. [ Climbing ] The climbing surface includes rocks of various sizes (Class 2 scrambling ), and a moderate degree of fitness is required to climb it. The climb from the base camp starts easy, becomes challenging mid way, then eases in gradient near the top. The lake on the top remains frozen except for about four weeks in late July to early August. Some climbers start by driving to hot springs of Meshkin Shehr, where they start their climb. This climb takes about two days, reaching to the base camp on the first day. Others take a taxi to base camp early in the morning, and climb the mountain in one day. In 2006, there was talk of improving the road to the base camp. If this is done, a regular car should be able to make it to the base camp during the climbing season. The road goes through multiple nomadic encampments of shepherds. One or two days of acclimatization in Tehran or Ardabil may be advisable. Mountaineering has been popular among the youth in Iran. On a Friday during the climbing season (late June to mid August), one may find hundreds of people on the mountain. Guides can also be found in Ardabil. Adequate climbing equipment can be purchased in Ardabil or Tehran. [ Surrounding area ] The area around Sabalan, particularly near Meshkin and Dasht-eh Moghan produces large quantities of grain, including wheat. Thanks to the climate produced by the mountain, Ardabil remains pleasantly cool in the summers.There are lots of hot springs all around the slopes of Sabalan; and a main concentration is within Sareyn county having 10 various hot springs. Furthermore, there are some really proper slopes for skiing with a lot of snow even in near-summer; along with a very beautiful and useful ski piste named &quot; Alvares &quot; within an hour&apos;s drive from Sareyn to the Sabalan South ridge.
