[ Early years ] Sasha was born in Bangor, Wales on September 4, 1969, but spent most of his youth with his mother in the Welsh town of Sandycroft, Flintshire, North Wales. Sasha&apos;s mother, taught French at Hawarden High School. Sasha&apos;s early musical taste was primarily Top 40 pop music like The The and The Police.

However, he did not like Epsom and left before completing his Advanced Level (an academic qualification in England, Wales and Northern Ireland ). Instead of continuing his schooling, Sasha moved to Bangor to live with his father and stepmother. Sasha&apos;s stepmother forced him to take piano lessons which, although he disliked them at the time, Sasha ultimately found to be beneficial to his music career.

A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented announced that he was looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour. Sasha volunteered and made his first live appearance in nearby Stockport. Sasha recalled of his debut, &quot; I&apos;d never even touched a Technics : I thought the pitch control was the volume, I didn&apos;t even know where to plug my headphones in! I&apos;m sure I was absolutely horrendous. &quot; [ left Sasha - Magic (John Digweed&apos;s 3D Mix).ogg &quot; Magic (John Digweed&apos;s 3D Mix) &quot; (1994) Featuring vocalist Sam Mollison, &quot; Magic &quot; reached #32 on the UK Singles Chart. It was remixed by artists such as John Digweed and Way Out West. ] Sasha soon found himself in debt due to low-paying performances and the many records he bought. To finance his record collection, he performed at illegal warehouse rave s in the Blackburn and Blackpool areas. With the assistance of another local DJ, Jon DaSilva, Sasha secured work at The Haçienda, where he learned key mixing (matching melodic keys) from DaSilva and refined his ability to beatmatch (to synchronize the beats of two simultaneously playing records). Though he enjoyed playing at The Haçienda, in 1990 Sasha left for a club called Shelley&apos;s Laserdrome in Stoke-on-Trent. There, he established part of his signature sound by mixing euphoric Acid House music with Italian piano house and emotional a cappella s. Because of his increased popularity and visibility at Shelley&apos;s, Mixmag featured Sasha on its first cover, under the headline &quot; SASHA MANIA - THE FIRST DJ PINUP? &quot;. While continuing to DJ, Sasha began to produce several of his own dance tracks. This, he later noted, was contrary to the career paths of many successful DJs, for whom it was more common to start out as producers.

He released his first single, &quot; Appolonia &quot;, under the name BM:Ex with producer Tom Frederikse on Union City Recordings. After DJing at Shelley&apos;s for several years, Sasha left his position because of increasing gang violence in and around the club. As a result of his growing reputation, Sasha was offered work in several London and Australian clubs. He accepted, instead, a spot in the DJ rotation at Renaissance a club night started by Geoff Oakes at Venue 44 in Mansfield, England. Later in 1993, Sasha produced &quot; Together &quot;, his first single under the name Sasha. &quot; Together &quot;, which he produced with Danny Campbell for Pete Tong &apos;s FFRR, peaked on the UK Singles Chart at #57. With this success, Sasha began a series of records for Deconstruction Records with the singles &quot; Higher Ground &quot; and &quot; Magic &quot; (for which Digweed produced a remix) and The Qat Collection with Frederikse and vocalist Sam Mollison.

Sasha and Digweed honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. Renaissance was pleased with their performances, and had the duo compile the triple-CD mix album Renaissance - The Mix Collection, releasing it on the club&apos;s own Renaissance Records label. The album featured tracks from such artists as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice, and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed. The Mix Collection was released soon after Sasha&apos;s departure from Renaissance in April 1994. Following his success at Renaissance, Sasha was again featured on Mixmag with the tagline &quot; SON OF GOD? &quot;, though he resented the accolade. [ Brewster Bill Last Night a DJ Saved My Life Grove Press 2000 0-8021-3688-5 389 ] After touring together for two years, the duo became &quot; true superstars &quot; with the release of their double CD Northern Exposure on mega-label Ministry of Sound. Around this time, Sasha began a recurring mentorship and partnership with fellow producer BT with the album Ima. As well as providing guidance for BT, Sasha produced a &quot; euphoric &quot; and &quot; introspective &quot; 42-minute rendition of the album which formed the centrepiece of the UK release and appeared as a &quot; bonus &quot; second disc on the US release. [ Bidder Sean The Rough Guide to House Music Rough Guides 1999 1-85828-432-5 43 ] He continued to advance his own production work by pairing with vocalist Maria Nayler to produce the single &quot; Be as One &quot;, which reached #17 on the UK singles chart.

To support the album, the duo toured internationally, and in the process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s. After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City &apos;s famous Twilo nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night.

Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started Bedrock Records. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency &quot; Excession: The Agency LTD. &quot; Excession remains a booking agency for many DJs, including Hybrid, Nick Warren, and Steve Lawler.

Sasha continued his collaborations with BT on the track &quot; Ride &quot;, which was released as a single on Yoshitoshi Records and on BT&apos;s Movement in Still Life. Soon after, he worked with Underworld &apos;s Darren Emerson on the single &quot; Scorchio &quot;, Sasha&apos;s first charting single in four years. In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album Communicate in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States. Communicate had mixed reviews: Spin stated that despite a &quot; few stellar moments, [Communicate] is ultimately a let-down &quot;.

By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished. The Guardian &apos;s pop critic, Alexis Petridis, attributed the &quot; terminal decline &quot; of dance music to its over-commercialisation by big-name DJs, such as Sasha, and to their demands for increased fees for performances.

Though the accident temporarily impaired his hearing, he drew inspiration for the album from his ordeal. Airdrawndagger was finally released, in August 2002, to much fanfare. However, the album was &quot; received with a lot of head scratching &quot;, according to Sasha, which he attributed to its unexpected mix of genres. The album did not feature the heavier &quot; club sound &quot; of Sasha&apos;s previous mix albums, bearing a closer resemblance to ambient music.

Sasha described their music as &quot; driving and dark &quot; with &quot; a little throwback of Twilo sounds &quot;. The duo now perform together annually at the Winter Music Conference. Sasha runs a music studio and lives in New York City, and maintains a house in London. He brings his wife with him on his frequent tours. Sasha finds the constant touring to be physically tiring, though he also feels that he thrives on it.

He has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is so busy with DJing and production that he rarely has any free time. However, he enjoys watching football, cooking, and sampling the cuisine of the countries he visits.

By the early 1990s, he had moved towards a more dark European house music style, though by the time of his Shelley&apos;s residency he had begun to experiment more with American house. His tastes further developed as he moved to Renaissance, and he began to incorporate the pop-based sounds of Moby, Spooky, and Leftfield. Sasha&apos;s second Digweed collaboration, 1997&apos;s Northern Exposure, was described as &quot; epic house &quot;, and subsequent releases featured the spacey and atmospheric trance house sound of artists such as Sven Väth, Matt Darey, Tilt, and Armin Van Buuren. A rhythmic and bassy progressive house influence distinguished his Xpander EP and the mix albums of the late 1990s. [ Nathan Brackett Fireside 0-7432-0169-8 Rolling Stone Album Guide 4th Edition 2004 718 ] At the time, Sasha&apos;s music rotation included records by artists such as Space Manoeuvres, BT, and Breeder, and Sander Kleinenberg &apos;s single &quot; My Lexicon &quot;. With the 2000 album Communicate, the duo&apos;s work moved towards a deeper and darker house music sound. The album featured tracks by Morel, Mainline, and Jimmy Van M. The focus shifted from the melodic themes of previous releases in favour of a stronger emphasis on the bassline. The Delta Heavy Tour and Airdrawndagger marked a dramatic shift in style, and reflected the influences of relaxed ambient and breakbeat music on Sasha&apos;s work. These influences inspired the album&apos;s strong melodies, occasional breakbeat loops, and limited use of percussion. Involver was primarily a fusion of the musical style of house and ambient breakbeat music characterised by UNKLE and Lostep. With 2005&apos;s Fundacion, Sasha&apos;s style was mostly progressive house and electro-house music, with work by James Holden, Tiefschwarz, and Swayzak. With his success in progressive house, Sasha has commented that he feels people try to &quot; pigeon-hole &quot; him into playing that genre. Rather than calling it progressive house, Sasha considers his most recent material to be between house, trance, and breaks, [ http://www.kidzworld.com/site/p2584.htm DJ/Producer Sasha Interview 2006-12-31 Kidzworld http://web.archive.org/web/20051228175551/http%3A//www.kidzworld.com/site/p2584.htm 28 December 2005 ] though he has stated that he prefers not to associate himself with a specific genre of music. [ Techniques and technology ] { Ableton Live } Sasha attributes his success to his technical skill and ability to &quot; connect with his dancers &quot;. During performances, he balances new and experimental material, while ensuring that &quot; the party is still rockin &quot;. His spontaneity carries over to studio work; he typically has only a vague idea of the track listing when beginning work on a new mix album. [ Ben Blue Sasha - Fundacion NYC Interview http://dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/SashaFundInt.htm 2006-12-31 http://web.archive.org/web/20060501230744/http%3A//dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/SashaFundInt.htm 1 May 2006 ] Because of this, his albums never turn out quite as he expects. Sasha is known for applying new music technologies to both his studio and live work. Both Sasha and Digweed used Pro Tools on Macintosh computers when mixing their compilation albums, and used turntables and records during live performances. For their remixes, however, they used an Atari ST —an obsolete personal computer from the early 1990s—with Notator, a music sequencer used for arranging audio tracks. [ Gerrish Bruce Remix: The Electronic Music Explosion ArtistPro 2001 65, 127–133 ] For more recent albums such as Fundacion NYC, Sasha used Ableton Live for sequencing, partially because of Pro Tools&apos; higher price. In live performances up to the late 1990s, Sasha performed exclusively using records. Before he started using the CDJ1000, a &quot; turntable &quot; used for CDs, he had his digital music specially cut to acetate records before each tour. Once he integrated CDs into his live act, Sasha operated CDJ1000s with Allen &amp; Heath mixers and FireworX. While he is now known for heavily utilizing audio technologies, Sasha was one of the last DJs to begin using CDs in live performance. { Ableton Live at a 15 July 2006 performance at Panama, an } { Amsterdam nightclub. } Sasha began DJing with Ableton Live in his live act as well, using it in tandem with turntables. Having explored its functionality, Sasha found that he could perform entirely through Ableton Live. He then co-developed the Maven controller, which he uses as a physical interface to the Live software. (DJing with a mouse alone, he has said, is &quot; not going to look right or feel right &quot;.) Fundacion NYC was the first album on which he regularly used the Maven controller.

Sasha most often uses the built-in Ableton plugins, preferring their superior stability and performance over third party plugins. For the first public performance of Involver material, he used a PowerBook running Ableton, [ DJ Sasha talks Macs and Ableton Macworld 2006-12-31 http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID%3D15061%26amp%3BPage%3D1%26amp%3BpagePos%3D2 26 June 2006 ] but has since shifted to a setup that includes an iMac G5 and Ableton Live. Despite Sasha&apos;s insistence that Ableton Live allows for greater creativity and spontaneity, &quot; vinyl purists &quot; have accused him of taking much of the challenge and mystique out of DJing by using software in performances. The Internet has affected how Sasha obtains and uses tracks for performance. While he once hunted through record shops for new records on a regular basis, Sasha now regularly receives new tracks from producers and labels via the Internet. These tracks, which number in the hundreds each week, are edited by Sasha and others for use in his live DJ sets. He still buys hundreds of records on vinyl, which are then recorded and converted into music files prior to being edited in Ableton by his team of engineers.
