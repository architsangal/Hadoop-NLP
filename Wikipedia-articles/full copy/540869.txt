It has been manufactured by several countries, including the United States, China, Brazil, and several European countries, but as of 2007 only India and possibly Russia are still producing it. By November 2006, the use of lindane had been banned in 52 countries and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or pharmaceutical use. In 2009, an international ban on the use of lindane in agriculture was implemented under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and scabies for 5 more years. The production of the lindane isomers α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane was also banned. { Report of the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants on the work of its fourth meeting.

It was registered as an agricultural insecticide in the 1940s and as pharmaceutical in 1951. The EPA gradually began restricting its agricultural use in the 1970s due to concerns over its effects on human health and the environment. { U.S. EPA.

The study also documented a marked decrease in lindane wastewater contamination and a dramatic decline in lindane poisoning incidents reported to Poison Control Centers. The authors concluded that, &quot; The California experience suggests elimination of pharmaceutical lindane produced environmental benefits, was associated with a reduction in reported unintentional exposures and did not adversely affect head lice and scabies treatment. &quot; [ Humphreys EH, Janssen S, Heil A, Hiatt P, Solomon G, Miller MD Outcomes of the California ban on pharmaceutical lindane: clinical and ecologic impacts Environ.

June 18, 2007) (Bucklo, J.) } The defendants considered the legal action to be SLAPP suit and settled in 2008. The settlement did not require them to admit liability or make any payments to Morton Grove, but the Ecology Center did agree to clarify 7 of the statements it had published in its lindane factsheet. { Critics of drugs in for bad medicine, Laura Berman, The Detroit News, March 2, 2008. } { The Ecology Center&apos;s Clarification of Statements Regarding Lindane, Michigan Ecology Center, accessed March 3, 2008. } { Ecology Center&apos;s lindane suit settled, Art Aisner, Ann Arbor News, March 15, 2008. } [ Human health effects ] The EPA and WHO both classify lindane as &quot; moderately &quot; acutely toxic. It has an oral of 88  mg/kg in rats and a dermal LD 50 of 1000  mg/kg. Most of the adverse human health effects reported for lindane have been related to agricultural uses and chronic, occupational exposure of seed treatment workers. { Persistent Organic Pollutant Review Committee (POPRC). Draft risk management evaluation for lindane. May, 2007. http://www.pops.int/documents/meetings/poprc/drprofile/drme/DraftRME_Lindane.pdf } Exposure to large amounts of lindane can harm the nervous system, producing a range of symptoms from headache and dizziness to seizures, convulsions and more rarely death.

Prenatal exposure to β-HCH, an isomer of lindane and production byproduct, has been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels and could affect brain development.

In 1987, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified lindane as a group 2B &quot; possible &quot; human carcinogen, and in 2001 the EPA concluded there was “suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential.” The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined that all isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, including lindane, &quot; may reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans, &quot; and in 1999, the EPA characterized the evidence carcinogenicity for lindane as &quot; suggestive... of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential. &quot; Lindane and its isomers have also been on California&apos;s Proposition 65 list of known carcinogens since 1989. [ http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/files/P65single061110.pdf CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT JUNE 11, 2010 23 September 2010 ] In contrast, the World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that “lindane is not likely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.” { World Health Organization (WHO). Lindane in Drinking Water: Background Document for Development of WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality. 2004. http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/lindane/en/print.html } [ Adverse reactions to lindane pharmaceuticals ] A variety of adverse reactions to lindane pharmaceuticals have been reported, ranging from skin irritation to seizure s, and, in rare instances, death. The most common side effects are burning sensations, itching, dryness and rash. While serious effects are rare and have most often resulted from misuse, adverse reactions have occurred when used properly. { U.S. FDA. Lindane Post Marketing Safety Review. Posted 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/lindaneaeredacted.pdf } The FDA therefore requires a so-called black box warning on lindane products, which explains the risks of lindane products and its proper use. { U.S. FDA Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research. Lindane lotion and lindane shampoo questions and answers. Updated April 15, 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/lindaneQA.htm } { http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/default.htm } The black box warning emphasizes that lindane should not be used on premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders, and should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., dermatitis, psoriasis ) and people who weigh less than 110 lbs (50  kg) as they may be at risk of serious neurotoxicity. { Lindane lotion, USP, 1% prescribing information.

Updated March 28, 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2003/006309shampoolbl.pdf. } [ Environmental contamination ] Lindane is a persistent organic pollutant : it is relatively long-lived in the environment, it is transported long distances by natural processes like global distillation, and it can bioaccumulate in food chain s, though it is rapidly eliminated when exposure is discontinued. The production and agricultural use of lindane are the primary causes of environmental contamination, { U.S. EPA. Assessment of lindane and other hexachlorocyclohexane isomers. February 8, 2006 } and levels of lindane in the environment have been decreasing in the U.S., consistent with decreasing agricultural usage patterns. { United Nations Environment Programme. POPRC of the Stockholm Convention. Draft risk profile: Lindane. July 2006. } The production of lindane generates large amounts of waste hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and it is estimated that &quot; every ton of lindane manufactured produces about 9 tons of toxic waste. &quot; { Life after Lindane in California: Water Concentrations, Poison Control Calls Drop Following Ban, Environmental Health Perspectives, Volume 116, Number 3, March 2008. } Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic molecules, a process known as &quot; cracking. &quot; { International HCH &amp; Pesticides Association. The legacy of lindane HCH isomer production. 2006. http://www.ihpa.info/docs/library/Lindane%20Main%20Report%20DEF20JAN06.pdf } When lindane is used in agriculture, an estimated 12-30% of it volatilizes into the atmosphere, where it is subject to long-range transport and can be deposited by rainfall. Lindane in soil can leach to surface and even ground water and can bioaccumulate in the food chain. However, biotransformation and elimination are relatively rapid when exposure is discontinued. Most exposure of the general population to lindane has resulted from agricultural uses and the intake of foods, such as produce, meats and milk, produced from treated agricultural commodities. Human exposure has decreased significantly since the cancellation of agricultural uses in 2006. Even so, the CDC published in 2005 its Third National Report on Human Exposures to Environmental Chemicals, which found no detectable amounts of lindane in human blood taken from a random sampling of about 5,000 people in the US as part of the NHANES study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm ). { US CDC. Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals. 2005. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/ExposureReport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf. } The lack of detection of lindane in this large human &quot; biomonitoring &quot; study likely reflects the increasingly limited agricultural uses of lindane over the last two decades. The cancellation of agricultural uses in the U.S. will further reduce the amount of lindane introduced into the environment by more than 99%. Over time, lindane is broken down in soil, sediment and water into less harmful substances by algae, fungi and bacteria; however, the process is relatively slow and dependent on ambient environmental conditions. The ecological impact of lindane’s environmental persistence continues to be debated. The US EPA determined in 2002 that the Agency does not believe that lindane contaminates drinking water in excess of levels considered safe. U.S. Geologic Survey teams concluded the same in 1999 and 2000. { Kolpin DW, Furlong ET, Meyer MT, et al. Pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants in U.S. streams, 1999–2000: A national reconnaissance. Environ Sci Technol. 2002;36(6):1202–1211. } With regard to lindane medications, the EPA conducted &quot; down-the-drain &quot; estimates of the amount of lindane reaching public water supplies and concluded that lindane levels from pharmaceutical sources were &quot; extremely low &quot; and not of concern. Note that the EPA has set the maximum contaminant level or &quot; MCL &quot; for lindane allowed in public water supplies and considered safe for drinking at 200 parts per trillion (ppt). { U.S. EPA. Announcem[ent of completion of EPA’s review of existing drinking water standards. Federal Register. 68(138): July 18, 2003. } By comparison, the state of California imposes a lower MCL for lindane of 19 ppt. However, the California standard is based on a dated 1988 national water criterion that was subsequently revised by the EPA in 2003 to 980 ppt. { California Public Health Goal for Lindane in Drinking Water. Available at: http://oehha.ca.gov/water/phg/pdf/lindan_f.pdf. } { IPEN. Lindane: Agricultural and pharmaceutical alternatives to lindane. Available at: http://www.akaction.org/REPORTS/Alternatives%20to%20Lindane%20Report%204-29-09.pdf } The EPA stated that the change resulted from &quot; significant scientific advances made in the last two decades particularly in the areas of cancer and noncancer risk assessments. &quot; While the EPA considered raising the MCL standard for lindane to 980 ppt at that time, the change was never implemented because states had little difficultly in maintaining lindane levels below the 200 ppt MCL limit already in place. Today, the legally enforceable MCL standard for lindane is 200 ppt while the national water criterion for lindane is 980 ppt. [ Isomers ] Lindane is the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane ( &quot; γ-HCH &quot; ). In addition to the issue of lindane pollution are concerns related to the other isomers of HCH, namely alpha-HCH and beta-HCH, which are notably more toxic than lindane, lack its insecticidal properties, and are byproducts of lindane production. In the 1940s and 1950s lindane producers stockpiled these isomers in open heaps, which led to ground and water contamination. The International HCH and Pesticide Forum has since been established to bring together experts to address the clean-up and containment of these sites. [ July 2009 ] Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic industrial chemicals, a process known as &quot; cracking. &quot; Today, only a few production plants remain active worldwide to accommodate public health uses of lindane and declining agricultural needs. Lindane has not been manufactured in the U.S. since the mid-1970s but continues to be imported. α-hexachlorocyclohexane β-hexachlorocyclohexane [ See also ] Pesticide toxicity to bees [ References ] [ 2 ] [ External links ] [ Government and organizations ] FDA Information on Lindane EPA Information on Lindane Gamma Hexachlorocyclohexane Fact Sheet Agency for Toxics and Disease Registry: Toxicological Profile for Hexachlorocyclohexane World Health Organization Background Document on Lindane for Drinking-Water Quality Guidelines PAN Pesticides Database: Lindane Lindane Chemistry and Uses World Health Organization: Lindane (EHC 124) &quot; Lindane Facts &quot; - Website run by Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals headlice.org - Website of the National Pediculosis Association Michigan Ecology Center website Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals homepage - US producer of Lindane Medications U.S. National Library of Medicine: Hazardous Substances Databank – Lindane [ News stories and opinion articles ] &quot; Mom and Pros Tackle Lice &quot; - NPR story from 2006 Pepsi and Coca-Cola - Lindane in drinks in India - news story from 2004 India - Pesticides in Coke &amp; Pepsi drinks - news story from 2003 Category:Organochloride insecticides Category:IARC Group 2B carcinogens Category:Endocrine disruptors Category:Persistent organic pollutants cs:Lindan de:Lindan es:Lindano eu:Lindane fa:لیندان fr:Lindane it:Lindano mk:Линдан nl:Lindaan no:Lindan pl:Lindan pt:Lindano simple:Lindane sk:Lindan th:ลินเดน (ยาฆ่าแมลง) zh:γ-六氯环己烷
