A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. Less-frequently used synonyms are non-protein-coding RNA (npcRNA), non-messenger RNA (nmRNA) and functional RNA (fRNA). The term small RNA (sRNA) is often used for short bacteria l ncRNAs. The DNA sequence from which a non-coding RNA is transcribed is often called an RNA gene. Non-coding RNA genes include highly abundant and functionally important RNAs such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), as well as RNAs such as snoRNA s, microRNA s, siRNA s and piRNA s and the long ncRNA s that include examples such as Xist and HOTAIR (see here for a more complete list of ncRNAs). The number of ncRNAs encoded within the human genome is unknown, however recent transcriptomic and bioinformatic studies suggest the existence of thousands of ncRNAs.

These range from ncRNAs of central importance that areconserved across all or most cellular life through to more transientncRNAs specific to one or a few closely related species. The moreconserved ncRNAs are thought to be molecular fossils or relics from LUCA and the RNA world.

Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles called ribosome s are the &apos;factories&apos; where translation takes place in the cell. The ribosome consists of more than 60% ribosomal RNA, these are made up of 3 ncRNAs in prokaryotes and 4 ncRNAs in eukaryotes. Ribosomal RNAs catalyse the translation of nucleotide sequences to protein. Another set of ncRNAs, Transfer RNA s, form an &apos;adaptor molecule&apos; between mRNA and protein. The H/ACA box and C/D box snoRNAs are ncRNAs found in archaea and eukaryotes, RNase MRP is restricted to eukaryotes, both groups of ncRNA are involved in the maturation of rRNA. The snoRNAs guide covalent modifications of rRNA, tRNA and snRNA s, RNase MRP cleaves the internal transcribed spacer 1 between 18S and 5.8S rRNAs. The ubiquitous ncRNA, RNase P, is an evolutionary relative of RNase MRP. [ Zhu Y, Stribinskis V, Ramos KS, Li Y Sequence analysis of RNase MRP RNA reveals its origination from eukaryotic RNase P RNA RNA 12 5 699–706 2006 16540690 10.1261/rna.2284906 1440897 ] RNase P matures tRNA sequences by generating mature 5&apos;-ends of tRNAs through cleaving the 5&apos;-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Another ubiquitous RNP called SRP recognizes and transports specific nascent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryote s and the plasma membrane in prokaryote s. In bacteria Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is an RNP involved in rescuing stalled ribosomes, tagging incomplete polypeptides and promoting the degradation of aberrant mRNA. [ ncRNAs in RNA splicing ] Electron microscopy images of the yeast spliceosome. Note the bulk of the complex is in fact ncRNA. In eukaryotes the spliceosome performs the splicing reactions essential for removing intron sequences, this process is required for the formation of mature mRNA.The spliceosome is another RNP often also known as the snRNP or tri-snRNP. There are two different forms of the spliceosome, the major and minor forms.The ncRNA components of the major spliceosome are U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. The ncRNA components of the minor spliceosome are U11, U12, U5, U4atac and U6atac. Another group of introns can catalyse their own removal from host transcripts, these are called self-splicing RNAs.There are two main groups of self-splicing RNAs, these are the group I catalytic intron and group II catalytic intron. These ncRNAs catalyze their own excision from mRNA, tRNA and rRNA precursors in a wide range of organisms. In mammals it has been found that snoRNAs can also regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA, for example snoRNA HBII-52 regulates the splicing of serotonin receptor 2C. [ Kishore S, Stamm S 2006 The snoRNA HBII-52 regulates alternative splicing of the serotonin receptor 2C Science 311 5758 230–231 16357227 10.1126/science.1118265 2006Sci...311..230K ] In nematodes the SmY ncRNA appears to be involved in mRNA trans-splicing. [ ncRNAs in gene regulation ] The expression of many thousands of gene s are regulated by ncRNAs. This regulation can occur in trans or in cis. [ trans-acting ncRNAs ] In higher eukaryotes microRNA s regulate gene expression. A single miRNA can reduce the expression levels of hundreds of genes. The mechanism by which mature miRNA molecules act is through partial complementary to one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, generally in 3&apos; UTRs. The main function of miRNAs is to down-regulate gene expression. The ncRNA RNase P has also been shown to influence gene expression. In the human nucleus RNase P is required for thenormal and efficient transcription of various ncRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III. These include tRNA, 5S rRNA, SRP RNA and U6 snRNA genes. RNase P exerts its role in transcription through association with Pol III and chromatin of active tRNA and 5S rRNA genes. [ Reiner R, Ben-Asouli Y, Krilovetzky I, Jarrous N A role for the catalytic ribonucleoprotein RNase P in RNA polymerase III transcription Genes Dev 20 12 1621–35 2006 16778078 10.1101/gad.386706 1482482 ] It has been shown that 7SK RNA, a metazoan ncRNA, acts as a negative regulator of the RNA polymerase II elongation factor P-TEFb, and that this activity isinfluenced by stress response pathways. The bacterial ncRNA, 6S RNA, specifically associates with RNA polymerase holoenzymecontaining the sigma70 specificity factor. This interaction repressesexpression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase. Another bacterial ncRNA, OxyS RNA represses translation by binding to Shine-Dalgarno sequences thereby occluding ribosome binding. OxyS RNA is induced in response to oxidative stress in Escherichia coli. The B2 RNA is a small noncoding RNA polymerase III transcript that represses mRNA transcription in response to heat shock in mousecells. B2 RNA inhibits transcription by binding to core Pol II. Through this interaction, B2 RNA assembles into preinitiation complexes at the promoter and blocks RNA synthesis. [ Espinoza CA, Allen TA, Hieb AR, Kugel JF, Goodrich JA B2 RNA binds directly to RNA polymerase II to repress transcript synthesis Nat Struct Mol Biol 11 9 822–9 2004 15300239 10.1038/nsmb812 ] A recent study has shown that just the act of transcription of ncRNAsequence can have an influence on gene expression. RNA polymerase II transcription of ncRNAs is required for chromatin remodellingin the Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Chromatin is progressivelyconverted to an open configuration, as several species of ncRNAs aretranscribed. [ Hirota K, Miyoshi T, Kugou K, Hoffman CS, Shibata T, Ohta K Stepwise chromatin remodelling by a cascade of transcription initiation of non-coding RNAs Nature 456 7218 130–4 2008 18820678 10.1038/nature07348 2008Natur.456..130H ] [ cis-acting ncRNAs ] [ Five prime untranslated region Three prime untranslated region ] A number of ncRNAs are embedded in the 5&apos; UTRs of protein coding genes and influence their expression in various ways. Forexample, a riboswitch can directlybind a small target molecule, the binding of the target affectsthe gene&apos;s activity. RNA leader sequences are found upstream of the first gene of inamino acid biosynthetic operons. These RNA elements form one of two possible structures in regions encodingvery short peptide sequences that are rich in the end product aminoacid of the operon. A terminator structure forms when there is anexcess of the regulatory amino acid and ribosome movement over theleader transcript is not impeded. When there is adeficiency of the charged tRNA of the regulatory amino acid theribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminatorstructure forms. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe theoperon. Known RNA leaders are Histidine operon leader, Leucine operon leader, Threonine operon leader and the Tryptophan operon leader. Iron response element s (IRE) are bound by iron response proteins (IRP). The IRE is found in UTR s (Untranslated Regions) of various mRNA s whose products are involved in iron metabolism.When iron concentration is low, IRPs bind the ferritin mRNA IRE leading to translation repression. Internal ribosome entry site s (IRES) are a RNA structure that allow for translation initiation in the middle of a mRNA sequence as part of the process of protein synthesis. [ ncRNAs and genome defense ] Piwi-interacting RNA s (piRNAs) expressed in mammal ian testes and somatic cell s, they form RNA-proteincomplexes with Piwi proteins. These piRNA complexes (piRCs) havebeen linked to transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposon s and other genetic elements in germ line cells, particularly thosein spermatogenesis. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are repeats found in the DNA of many bacteria and archaea. The repeats are separated by spacers of similar length. It has beendemonstrated that these spacers can be derived from phage andsubsequently help protect the cell from infection. [ ncRNAs and chromosome structure ] Telomerase is an RNP enzyme that adds specific DNA sequence repeats ( &quot; TTAGGG &quot; in vertebrates) to telomeric regions, which are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. The telomeres contain condensed DNA material, givingstability to the chromosomes. The enzyme is a reverse transcriptase that carries Telomerase RNA, which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres, which are shortened after each replication cycle. Xist (X-inactive-specific transcript) is an long ncRNA gene on the X chromosome of the placental mammals that acts as major effector ofthe X chromosome inactivation process forming Barr bodies. An antisense RNA, Tsix, is a negative regulator of Xist. X chromosomes lacking Tsix expression (and thus having high levels of Xist transcription) are inactivated more frequently than normal chromosomes.In drosophilids, which also use an XY sex-determination system, the roX (RNA on the X) RNAs are involved in dosage compensation. [ Park Y, Kelley RL, Oh H, Kuroda MI, Meller VH Extent of chromatin spreading determined by roX RNA recruitment of MSL proteins Science 298 5598 1620–3 2002 12446910 10.1126/science.1076686 2002Sci...298.1620P ] Both Xist and roX operate by epigenetic regulation oftranscription through the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes.

The p53 protein functions as a transcription factor with a crucial role in orchestrating the cellular stress response. In addition to its crucial role in cancer, p53 has been implicated in other diseases including diabetes, cell death after ischemia, and various neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington, Parkinson, and Alzheimer. Studies have suggested that p53 expression is subject to regulation by non-coding RNA.

By the same mechanism it also raises concentrations of beta amyloid, the main constituent of senile plaques. BACE1-AS concentrations are elevated in subjects with Alzheimer&apos;s disease and in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. [ miR-96 and hearing loss ] Variation within the seed region of mature miR-96 has been associated with autosomal dominant, progressive hearing loss in humans and mice.

Yet the term fRNA could also include mRNA as this is RNA coding for protein and hence is functional. Additionally artificially evolved RNAs also fall under the fRNA umbrella term. Some publications state that the terms ncRNA and fRNA are nearly synonymous.
