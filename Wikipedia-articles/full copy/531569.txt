The Japanese language has many honorific s, parts of speech which show respect, and their use is mandatory in many social situations. Honorifics in Japanese may be used to emphasize social distance or disparity in rank, or to emphasize social intimacy or similarity in rank. The system of honorifics in Japan is very extensive, including various levels of respectful, humble, and polite speech, and it closely resembles the honorific systems of the Korean language, and in some elements, Chinese. [ Types of honorific ] Honorifics in Japanese are broadly referred to as keigo (敬語, literally &quot; respectful language &quot; ), and fall under three main categories: sonkeigo (尊敬語), respectful language; kenjōgo (謙譲語), { kenjōgo (謙譲語) is more rarely called kensongo (謙遜語), &quot; kenson &quot; being an alternative word for &quot; humility, modesty &quot;. } humble language (or &quot; modest language &quot; ); and teineigo (丁寧語), polite language. Linguistically, the former two are referent honorifics, used for someone being talked about, and the last is an addressee honorific, used for someone being talked to. Sometimes two more categories are also used, for five categories total: teichōgo (丁重語) &quot; courteous language &quot; and bikago (美化語), &quot; word beautification &quot;, but more often these are included in the above three: teichōgo as a kind of kenjōgo (humble), bikago as a kind of teineigo (polite)—these two other categories use the same forms as the general categories, but are used in different contexts, hence differentiated by some linguists. Each type of speech has its own vocabulary and verb endings. For example, the standard form of the verb &quot; to do &quot; is suru (する). This form is appropriate with family members and close friends. The polite form of suru, the addressee honorific, is shimasu. This form is appropriate in most daily interactions. When showing respect, such as when talking about a customer or a superior, however, the respectful word nasaru and its polite form nasaimasu are used, and when referring to one&apos;s own actions or the actions of a group member, the humble word itasu and its polite form itashimasu are used. These respectful and humble words are referent honorifics, and thus can coexist with addressee honorific -masu. [ Polite language ] Polite language, teineigo, is characterized by the use of the sentence ending &quot; desu &quot; and the verb ending &quot; masu &quot; and the use of prefixes such as &quot; o &quot; and &quot; go &quot; towards neutral objects. Television presenters invariably use polite language, and it is the form of the language first taught to most non-native learners of Japanese. Polite language can be used to refer to one&apos;s own actions or those of other people. [ Respectful language ] Respectful language, sonkeigo, is a special form or alternate word used when talking about superiors and customers. It is not used to talk about oneself. For example, when a Japanese hairdresser or dentist requests their client to take a seat, they say o kake ni natte kudasai to mean &quot; please sit down &quot;. However, they would use the verb suwaru rather than o kake ni naru to refer to themselves sitting down. The respectful version of language can only be used to refer to others. In general, respectful language is directed at those in positions of power; for example, a superior at work, or a customer. It also implies that the speaker is acting in a professional capacity. It is characterized by lengthy polite expressions. Common verbs may be replaced by more polite alternative verbs, for example, suru (do) by nasaru, or hanasu (talk) by ossharu when the subject is a person of respect. Some of these transformations are many-to-one: iku, (go), kuru (come), and iru (be) all become irassharu, and taberu (eat) and nomu (drink) both become meshiagaru. Verbs may also be changed to respectful forms. One respectful form is a modification of the verb with a prefix and a polite suffix. For example, yomu (read) becomes o-yomi ni naru, with the prefix o- added to the i-form of the verb, and the verb ending ni naru. The verb ending -(r)areru can also be used, such as yomareru. Nouns also undergo substitution to express respect. The normal Japanese word for person, hito, 人, becomes kata, 方, in respectful language. Thus a customer would normally be expected to be referred to as a kata rather than a hito. [ Humble language ] In general, humble language is used when describing one&apos;s actions or the actions of a person in one&apos;s in-group to others such as customers in business. Humble language tends to imply that one&apos;s actions are taking place in order to assist the other person. Humble language (kenjōgo) is similar to respectful language, in substituting verbs with other forms. For example suru (do) becomes itasu, and morau (receive) becomes itadaku. These two verbs are also seen in set phrase s such as dō itashimashite (you&apos;re welcome) and itadakimasu (いただきます—a phrase said before eating or drinking). Similar to respectful language, verbs can also change their form by adding a prefix and the verb &quot; suru &quot; or &quot; itasu &quot;. For example, motsu (carry) becomes o mochi shimasu. The use of humble forms may imply doing something for the other person; thus a Japanese person might offer to carry something for someone else by saying o mochi shimasu. This type of humble form also appears in the set phrase o matase shimashita, &quot; I am sorry to have kept you waiting &quot;, from mataseru (make wait) with the addition of o and shimasu. Similarly, o negai shimasu, &quot; please [do this] &quot;, from negau (request or hope for), again with the addition of o and shimasu. Even more politely, the form motasete itadaku literally means &quot; humbly be allowed to carry &quot;. This phrase would be used to express the idea that &quot; I will carry it if you please. &quot; The same forms may also be used when the speaker is not the agent, as a courtesy to the listener, as in the common phrase 電車が参ります (densha ga mairimasu &quot; a train is arriving &quot; ) at rail stations. In the case, the announcer himself is not arriving, but he is simply being courteous. Some linguists distinguish this from kenjōgo (where the speaker is the agent), calling it instead teichōgo (丁重語) &quot; courteous language &quot;, and defining it formally as: { Keigo Ronko, Tsujimura 1992, ISBN 978-4-625-42077-1, p. 98 } { Language change in East Asia, Thomas E. McAuley, p. 51 } Honorifics by which the Speaker shows consideration to the hearer through all expressions of the subject matter. This category was first proposed by Hiroshi Miyachi (宮地裕). { Tsujimura 1992, pp. 173–174 } { McAuley, p. 67, footnote 12 } Teichōgo, as an addressee honorific, is always used with the teineigo (-masu) form, the politeness sequence (using &quot; go &quot; as an example) being 行く、行きます、参ります. In humble language, name suffixes are dropped when referring to people from inside one&apos;s group. Thus, a Japanese-speaking company executive would introduce himself and his team by saying &quot; I am Gushiken the president, and this is Niwa, the CEO. &quot; Similarly to respectful language, nouns can also change. The word hito, 人, meaning person, becomes mono, written 者. The humble version is used when referring to oneself or members of one&apos;s group, such as one&apos;s company. [ Respectful verbs ] [ March 2011 ] some irregular respectful forms meaning plain respectful (sonkeigo) humble (kenjōgo) polite (teineigo) see / look / watch 見る; miru ご覧になる go-ran ni naru 拝見する haiken suru 見ます　mimasu meet 会う au regular (ex.お会いになる o-ai ni naru) お目にかかる o-me ni kakaru 会います　aimasu be 1 ある aru     ございます gozaimasu いる iru いらっしゃる irassharu おいでになる o-ide ni naru おる oru おる oru come / go 1 来る kuru (come) 行く iku (go) 伺う ukagau 参る mairu 参る mairu know 知る shiru ご存じ go-zonji 存じあげる zonji ageru 存じている zonji te iru eat / drink 食べる taberu (eat) 飲む nomu (drink) 召しあがる meshi-agaru 頂く itadaku 頂く itadaku receive もらう morau   頂く itadaku 2 頂戴する chōdai-suru 2 もらいます　moraimasu give (who receives is respected) やる yaru (considered rude today, except in Kansai dialect ) あげる ageru (once the humble form)   差しあげる sashiageru あげます　agemasu give (who gives is respected) くれる kureru くださる kudasaru   くれます　kuremasu do する suru なさる nasaru 致す itasu します　shimasu say 言う iu おっしゃる ossharu 申し上げる mōshi-ageru 申す mōsu 言います　iimasu put on 着る kiru お召しになる omeshi ni naru   着ます　kimasu sleep 寝る neru お休みになる o-yasumi ni naru   休みます yasumimasu die 死ぬ shinu お亡くなりになる o-nakunari ni naru   亡くなる nakunaru 1 The distinction between these three verbs is lost in some respectful forms. 2 Both are the humble form of receive (もらう morau); it can also be used for related verbs like eat (食べる taberu) and drink (飲む nomu). [ Word beautification ] [ #Honorific prefixes ] Word beautification (bikago, 美化語, &quot; beautified speech &quot;, in tanka also sometimes gago, 雅語, &quot; elegant speech &quot; ) is the practice of making words more polite or &quot; beautiful &quot;. This form of language is employed by the speaker to add refinement to one&apos;s manner of speech. This is commonly achieved by adding the prefix o- or go- to a word and used in conjunction with the polite form of verbs. In the following example, o before cha and senbei and the polite form of the verb are used to this effect. Example: お茶にお煎餅、よく合いますね O-cha ni o-senbei, yoku aimasu ne: Tea and rice crackers go well (together), don&apos;t they. In finer classifications, the above example is classified as word beautification—rather than honorific speech—as the speaker is voicing a general opinion regarding tea and rice crackers and is not intentionally deferential towards the listener. In the following example, the speaker is directly referring to the listener and items received by them and is regarded as honorific language. Example: お宅様からいただいたお菓子は大変おいしゅうございました O-taku-sama kara itadaita okashi wa taihen oishuugozaimashita: The sweets you gave me were most delectable. See the section on honorific prefixes, below, for further discussion. [ Usage ] [ Business ] Honorifics are considered extremely important in a business setting. Training in honorifics usually does not take place at school or university, so company trainees are trained in correct use of honorifics to customers and superiors. [ In groups and out groups ] [ Uchi-soto ] When using polite or respectful forms, the point of view of the speaker is shared by the speaker&apos;s in-group (内 uchi), so in-group referents do not take honorifics. For example, members of one&apos;s own company are referred to with humble forms when speaking with an external person; similarly, family members of the speaker are referred to humbly when speaking to guests. Similarly, the out-group (外 soto) addressee or referent is always mentioned in the polite style (though not necessarily with honorifics). Mastery of politeness and honorifics is important for functioning in Japanese society. Not speaking politely enough can be insulting, and speaking too politely can be distancing (and therefore also insulting) or seem sarcastic. Children generally speak using plain informal speech, but they are expected to master politeness and honorifics by the end of their teenage years. Recent trends indicate that the importance of proper politeness is not as high as before, particularly in metropolitan areas. The standards are inconsistently applied towards foreigners, though most textbooks attempt to teach the polite style before attempting the others. [ Gender differences ] [ Gender differences in spoken Japanese ] Depending on the situation, women&apos;s speech may contain more honorifics than men&apos;s. In particular, in informal settings, women are more likely to use polite vocabulary and honorific prefixes, such as gohan o taberu for &quot; eat cooked rice &quot;, whereas men may use less polite vocabulary such as meshi o kū for exactly the same meaning. This is part of a general pattern of difference in speech by gender. However, in many settings, such as customer service, there will be little or no difference between male and female speech. [ Grammatical overview ] Japanese has grammatical functions to express several different emotions. Not only politeness but also respectfulness, humility and formality can be expressed. [ Expressing politeness ] There are three levels of politeness, plain or direct ( [ 普通体 ] futsūtai or 常体 jōtai), polite or distal (敬体 keitai or 丁寧 teinei), and formal (generally, 敬語 keigo or 最敬体 saikeitai). Formal and polite can be combined. For example, for the sentence &quot; This is a book &quot;, informal polite formal polite formal これは本だ kore wa hon da. これは本です kore wa hon desu. これは本である kore wa hon de aru. これは本でございます kore wa hon de gozaimasu. The informal style is used among friends, the distal or polite style by inferiors when addressing superiors and among strangers or casual acquaintances, and the formal style generally in writing or prepared speeches. The plain formal and informal styles of verbs are identical, with the exception of the verb de aru used as a copula. However, formal language in Japanese uses different vocabulary and structures from informal language. For example, formal language uses many two- kanji Chinese-derived words conjugated with suru, and substitutes highly formal vocabulary such as joshi for josei (woman). [ Expressing respect ] Further to this, there is another factor, respect, which is indicated in yet other ways.For each politeness level there are two respectful forms (敬語 keigo). The respect language (尊敬語 sonkeigo) form shows respect to the subject of the sentence. The humble language (謙譲語 kenjōgo) form gives respect to the ( direct or indirect ) object by a variety of means, the most common being to humble the speaker. These respectful forms are represented by different verb endings. Since verbs come at the end of the sentence in Japanese, most of the factors formality, politeness, and respect is expressed at the very end of each sentence. Plain form ジョンさんが佐藤さんを待つJon san ga Satō san wo matsu. John waits for Sato. Respect for subject 先生がお待ちになるSensei ga o-machi-ni-naru. (The) teacher waits. Respect for object 先生をお待ちするSensei wo o-machi-suru. We wait for you, Teacher. The o-machi-suru humble forms carry an implication that the waiting or other activity is being (humbly) done by the speaker for the benefit of the person being addressed. Thus a humble sentence is unlikely to take a third person subject. For example, a sentence like jon ga sensei wo o machi suru (John waits for the teacher) is unlikely to occur. [ Honorific titles ] See Japanese honorifics. [ Requests ] Japanese requests and commands have many set forms depending on who is being addressed by whom. For example, the phrase yoroshiku o negai shimasu, meaning &quot; I ask you for favor &quot; can take various forms. At the bottom of the scale comes yoroshiku tanomu, which might be used between male friends. Its more polite variant yoroshiku tanomimasu might be used towards less familiar people or to superiors. Going up in politeness, the phrase yoroshiku onegai shimasu means the same thing, but is used in business settings. It is possible to go further, replacing the polite &quot; shimasu &quot; with the humble itashimasu, to get yoroshiku onegai itashimasu. In extremely formal Japanese, such as that used on New Year&apos;s greeting cards, this may be replaced with an even more polite expression yoroshiku onegai mōshiagemasu. When making requests, at the bottom of the politeness scale comes the plain imperative tabero or kue, literally &quot; Eat! &quot;, a simple order to be said to an inferior or someone considered to have no choice, such as a prisoner. This form might convey anger. Similarly, the &quot; no/n da &quot; suffix can make an order: taberu n da, or kuu n da &quot; Eat! &quot;. To express anger, the suffix yagaru also exists: &quot; kuiyagare &quot;, an extremely forceful and angry instruction to eat, expressing contempt for the addressee. Negatives are formed by adding suffix na: taberu na &quot; do not eat &quot;, gomi o suteru na: &quot; do not throw away rubbish &quot;. Similarly, the negative of da, ja nai, can be used: taberu n ja nai. More polite, but still strict, is the nasai suffix, which attaches to the i-form of the verb. This originates in the polite verb nasaru. Tabenasai thus is an order perhaps given by a parent to a child. This is often colloquially shortened to na, hence tabena. This form has no grammatical negative. Requests can also be formed by adding to the &quot; te &quot; form of a verb. The plainest form adds kure, an irregular form of the verb kureru, to the te form. For example tabete kure or kutte kure: &quot; eat it &quot;, less forceful than &quot; tabero &quot;. Negatives are made by using the negative &quot; te &quot; form: tabenaide kure or kuwanaide kure &quot; don&apos;t eat it &quot;. Going up one scale in politeness, the more polite verb kudasai is added. For example tabete kudasai. With this polite form, the rough kū verb is unlikely to be used. Similarly, tabenaide kudasai: &quot; please don&apos;t eat it &quot;. A similar entry on the scale of politeness is made by using the imperative form of a polite verb. For example, meshiagaru, the polite verb for &quot; to eat &quot;, when turned into meshiagare, the imperative, becomes the response to the set phrase itadakimasu. Further, more polite forms are also possible. These involve the &quot; i-form &quot; of the verb rather than the &quot; te form &quot;, and an honorific prefix (see honorific prefixes: verbs, below). For example, tsukau, &quot; use &quot;, becomes o tsukai kudasai: &quot; please use this &quot;. Politeness can be carried even further by conjugating kudasaru into its masu form and using the imperative, which becomes &quot; o tsukai kudasaimase. &quot; The most polite form of this would probably be along the lines of &quot; o tsukai ni natte itadakimasen deshou ka. &quot; &quot; You will probably not bestow the favor of honorably using this? &quot; Language like this, however, is rarely used. Other ways to increase politeness involve indirection of the request: kore o tsukau you ni o negai shimasu: &quot; I humbly request that you think about using this &quot;. [ Honorific prefixes ] The beautifying prefixes お〜 and ご〜 are commonly used for certain words, such as お湯 (&apos;&apos;o-yu&apos;&apos;) and お茶 (&apos;&apos;o-cha&apos;&apos;)—hot water and tea—on this tea machine. [ 御#Japanese 御 ] The bikago (beautifying) prefixes o- and go- (both written 御, or in hiragana ) are honorific prefixes which are applied to nouns and in some contexts to verbs. In general, go- (the on&apos;yomi) precedes Sino-Japanese words (that is, words borrowed from Chinese or made from Sino-Japanese elements), while o- (the kun&apos;yomi) precedes native Japanese words. There are exceptions, however, such as the Sino-Japanese word for telephone (denwa), which takes the honorific prefix o-. These prefixes are used for two purposes: to speak respectfully about a social superior&apos;s family, belongings, or actions (as part of 尊敬語, sonkeigo); or to speak in a generally refined or polite way (敬語 keigo generally, specifically 美化語, bikago). [ Prefix usage ] { Although these honorific prefixes are often translated into English as &quot; honorable &quot; ( &quot; o-denwa, &quot; for example, would be given as &quot; the honorable telephone &quot; ) this translation is unwieldy and cannot convey the true feeling of their use in Japanese. These prefixes are essentially untranslatable, but their use indicates a polite respect for the item named or the person to or about whom one is speaking. A shorter translation is &quot; dear &quot; —for example, o-ko-san, お子さん, translates idiomatically as &quot; your dear child &quot; —and a similar sentiment is expressed in such English expressions as &quot; Would you care for a spot of tea? &quot; or &quot; Would you care for a little tea? &quot; (as opposed to the plain &quot; Would you like some tea? &quot; ). } As with honorific word forms and titles, honorific prefixes are used when referring to or speaking with a social superior, or speaking about a superior&apos;s actions or possessions, but not usually when referring to oneself or one&apos;s own actions or possessions, or those of one&apos;s in-group. For example, when referring to one&apos;s own order at a restaurant, one would use chūmon, but when referring to a customer&apos;s order, the restaurant staff would use go-chūmon. Similarly, kazoku means &quot; my family, &quot; while go-kazoku means &quot; your family &quot; (or, broadly speaking, someone else&apos;s family). There are some words which frequently or always take these prefixes, regardless of who is speaking and to whom; these are often ordinary items which may have particular cultural significance, such as tea (o-cha) and rice (go-han). The word meshi, the Japanese equivalent of Sino-Japanese go-han, is considered rough and masculine ( 男性語 ). The honorific o- is also sometimes attached to [ verb stems 連用形 ren&apos;yōkei continuative form, -masu stem—see stem forms ] of native verbs (hence native o-) to refer to a specific item associated with the verb, as in oshibori (お絞り、絞る) &quot; hot towel &quot;, and onigiri / omusubi (お握り、握る and お結び、結ぶ) &quot; rice ball &quot;. In rare cases, both a base form and honorific are in use with different readings. A notable example is 利益 ri-eki &quot; benefit, profit (e.g., business) &quot; and 御利益 go-ri-yaku &quot; divine favor, grace &quot;; plain ri-yaku is sometimes used, but go-ri-eki is generally not. The former, an everyday term, uses the usual kan-on reading, while the later, a specialized religious term, uses the older go-on reading. Honorific prefixes can be used for other items, possibly for a comic or sarcastic effect (for example, o-kokakōra, &quot; honorable Coca-Cola &quot; ). Overuse of honorific prefixes may be taken as pretentious or simpering, and, as with other polite speech, they are more used by women than men. In tea ceremony, common ingredients and equipment always take the honorific o- or go-, including water (o-mizu), hot water (o-yu), and tea bowls (o-chawan). However, these terms are often heard in daily life as well. Foreign loanword s ( gairaigo, except those that come from Chinese; see above) seldom take honorifics, but when they do o- seems to be preferable to go-. Examples are o-bīru (bīru: beer), which can sometimes be heard at restaurants, o-kādo (kādo: card, as in credit card or point card), which is often heard at supermarkets and department stores, and o-sōsu (honorable sauce). [ Verbs ] [ #Requests ] For verbs, a respectful request—or rather a polite command—addressed to a group may be formed by using 御〜, followed by the masu-stem ( 連用形 ), followed by [ 下さい kudasai please ]. For Chinese verbs (kango + suru), the prefix is generally pronounced go-, while for native Japanese verbs the prefix is pronounced o-. { Genki II, Chapter 19–2 &quot; Giving Respectful Advice &quot;, p. 140 } This is generally written in kana. The most commonly heard use is [ ご注意ください go-chūi-kudasai please be careful ] (Chinese verb), which is used pervasively in recorded announcement in Japan (escalators, trains and subways, turning trucks), but other verbs are also used frequently, such as [ お座りください o-suwari-kudasai please sit down ] (Japanese verb). The respectful prefix can also be used in honorific verbs, when speaking about a superior, in which case it is formed by o-, followed by the masu-stem, followed by [ 〜になる -ni-naru ] (suitably conjugated), as in [ お帰りになりました o-kaeri-ni-narimashita went home ]. { Genki II, Chapter 19–1 &quot; Giving Respectful Advice &quot;, p. 138–140 } [ Female names ] O- was also commonly used as an honorific prefix to female given names in pre-war Japan, in which case only the first two syllables of a woman&apos;s name would be used in conjunction. For example, [ 花子 Hanako ] would be referred to as [ お花 O-hana ], [ 春美 Harumi ] would become [ お春 O-haru ], [ 雪 Yuki ] would become [ お雪 O-yuki ], and so on. This was a less polite honorific than &quot; san &quot;. For example, a female servant named Kikuko would be referred to as O-kiku rather than Kikuko-san. This usage has disappeared in current Japanese, and has been replaced by using the diminutive suffix -chan instead (compare to male -kun), as in Aki-chan for Akiko. [ Rare forms ] There is also a rarer prefix mi- (kun&apos;yomi), which is mostly used in words related to gods and the emperor, such as mi-koshi (御輿, &quot; portable shrine &quot; in Shinto ) and mi-na (御名, &quot; the Holy Name &quot; in Christianity ). However, in this context it is often replaced by 神 ( &quot; god &quot;, also pronounced mi-), and then a further 御 (pronounced お-, o-) may be added, as in 御神輿 (o-mi-koshi). Sometimes the reading is ambiguous—for example, 御霊屋 &quot; mausoleum &quot; may be pronounced either mi-tama-ya or o-tama-ya. Rarely, 御 is used instead as an honorific suffix, notably in 甥御 oigo &quot; your nephew &quot; and 姪御 meigo &quot; your niece &quot;. The character 御 has other readings, notably on (kun&apos;yomi) and gyo (on&apos;yomi), as seen in [ 御社 on-sha your company, literally &quot; honorable company &quot; ] and [ 御苑 gyo-en imperial garden, literally &quot; honorable garden &quot; ], but these are not productive (they are not used to form new words, but only in existing words). In one case, a triple honorific prefix may used, namely in the word o-mi-o-tsuke, a polite term for miso soup, which is ordinarily referred to as [ 味噌汁 miso-shiru miso soup ]. This may be spelt in kanji in multiple ways, including [ 御御御汁 honorable-honorable-honorable soup ], but also as [ 御味御汁 honorable flavor honorable soup ] (味 = mi, flavor), and the 御御御〜 spelling may be considered ateji, punning on 御 and 味 both having the reading mi. [ English analogs ] While English has different registers, its levels of formality and politeness are not as formalized as in Japanese. However, they can be instructive in gaining a feel for Japanese speech. English imperatives range from very blunt ( &quot; Give me the book, &quot; ) to very indirect and elaborate ( &quot; If it&apos;s not too much trouble, could you please be so kind as to pass me the book? &quot; —note the use of potential form, as in Japanese). Similarly, changes in word use can make language more flowery or respectful—rather than &quot; Do you know? &quot;, one might say &quot; Are you familiar with? &quot; or &quot; Are you acquainted with? &quot;, which convey some of the feel of 知る versus ご存知だ。 In English, words of Germanic origin are generally plainer, from French are generally more flowery (compare &quot; drink &quot; versus &quot; beverage &quot; ), and from Latin are more formal and technical (see Anglish and related articles); similarly in Japanese, words of Japanese origin are plainer, while words of Chinese origin are more formal. These are not hard-and-fast rules, but give a feel for the gradations. Humble language is less common in modern English, but is found in some contexts, such as guests saying &quot; I am honored to be here, &quot; (rather than &quot; I am glad to be here &quot; or &quot; I am happy to be here &quot; ) and in various valediction s such as &quot; Sincerely &quot;, which were formerly more formal and humble, with such forms as &quot; I am, Sir, your most humble and obedient servant, &quot; and the like. [ Manual keigo ] [ Manual keigo ] A form of ersatz keigo is used in some convenience stores and fast-food restaurants, with the young, often part-time employees—often unskilled in standard keigo—being instructed to use these form by instruction manuals. Accordingly, it is known as マニュアル敬語 (manyuaru keigo, &quot; manual keigo &quot; ) or バイト敬語 (baito keigo, &quot; part-timer keigo &quot; ). It features various forms which horrify linguistic purists and confuse those unfamiliar with the conventions. A common example is &quot; udon ni narimasu &quot; (literally &quot; [this] becomes udon &quot;, &quot; [this] will be udon &quot; ) as a polite form of &quot; udon desu &quot; ( &quot; [this] is udon &quot; ), instead of the standard &quot; udon de gozaimasu &quot; ( &quot; [this] is udon (polite) &quot; )—the manual keigo form is proscribe d on the basis that the udon is not becoming anything, and &quot; ni naru &quot; is not proper keigo. This can be compared to such English usages as &quot; We will be landing momentarily &quot; (literally &quot; We will be landing for a moment [but then taking off again almost immediately] &quot; ) for &quot; We will be landing soon &quot; —traditionally incorrect but now common usage with origins in standardized training.
