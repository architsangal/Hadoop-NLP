[ October 2010 ] Walter Moers (born 24 May 1957, Mönchengladbach, Germany ) is one of the best-known and commercially most successful German comic creators and author s. [ Life and work ] Walter Moers held odd jobs after leaving school before starting a commercial apprenticeship. He taught himself how to draw. Moers has been publishing since 1984. He first became known with cartoon -like comics that were marked by an ironic view of the world and a conscious violation of political correctness. Many of his works first appeared in the satirical magazine Titanic. Although he doesn&apos;t contribute to the magazine anymore, he&apos;s still listed as contributor. His last work published in &apos;Titanic&apos; was the Superhero-Parody &apos;Deadman&apos; (not to be confused with the DC-Comics Superhero of the same name, Moers Character was just a dead man lying in a coffin for three pages without a word or any change in the pictures). His best-known comic characters are: Das kleine Arschloch (The little asshole), a precocious and irreverent little boy who constantly gets one over on the adults. Der alte Sack (The old curmudgeon), a terminally ill old man in a wheel chair who makes sarcastic comments on what he sees. Adolf, die Nazisau (Adolf, the Nazi pig), an absurd interpretation of Adolf Hitler in today&apos;s world. In addition to these comics clearly intended for an adult audience, Moers also writes stories and book s that he has been publishing since 1985. In 1988, his first &quot; Käpt&apos;n Blaubär &quot; story was published, a character that has since been popular on TV, in books, and on audio cassettes.Recently, Moers also became famous for his novels, especially the Zamonia series. Moers wrote both the script and the song lyrics for the movie Kleines Arschloch (1997) and the script for the movie Käpt&apos;n Blaubär (1999). Walter Moers is said to avoid publicity and very rarely gives interview s or allows himself to be photographed. Darcy McCallum, director of Miffmania &amp; Color Blind Addiction is very interested in adapting Moers&apos; City of Dreaming Books to screen, a book Darcy described as &apos;the best book about books, ever&apos;.
