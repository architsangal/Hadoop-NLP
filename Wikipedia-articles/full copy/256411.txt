[ Senior Discount the band Senior Discount (band) ] [ February 2010 ] Discounts and allowances are reductions to a basic price of goods or services. They can occur anywhere in the distribution channel, modifying either the manufacturer&apos;s list price (determined by the manufacturer and often printed on the package), the retail price (set by the retailer and often attached to the product with a sticker), or the list price (which is quoted to a potential buyer, usually in written form). There are many purposes for discounting, including; to increase short-term sales, to move out-of-date stock, to reward valuable customers, to encourage distribution channel members to perform a function, or to otherwise reward behaviors that benefit the discount issuer. Some discounts and allowances are forms of sales promotion. [ Discount and allowance types ] The most common types of discounts and allowances are listed below. [ Discounts and allowances dealing with payment ] [ Prompt payment discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Prompt payment discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] Trade Discount:Deduction in price given by the wholesaler/manufacturer to the retailer at the list price or catalogue price.Cash Discount:Reduction in price given by the creditor to the debitor is known as cash discount.This discount is intended to speed payment and thereby provide liquidity to the firm.

[ Partial payment discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Partial payment discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] Similar to the Trade discount, this is used when the seller wishes to improve cash flow or liquidity, but finds that the buyer typically is unable to meet the desired discount deadline. A partial discount for whatever payment the buyer makes helps the seller&apos;s cash flow partially. [ Sliding scale ] [ Sliding scale fees ] A discount offered based on one&apos;s ability to pay. More common with non-profit organizations than with for-profit retail.

The date on the invoice is moved forward - example: purchase goods in November for sale during the December holiday season, but the payment date on the invoice is January 7. [ Seasonal discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Seasonal discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] These are price reductions given when an order is placed in a slack period (example: purchasing skis in April in the northern hemisphere, or in September in the southern hemisphere).

[ Trade discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Trade discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Functional discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] Trade discounts, also called functional discounts, are payments to distribution channel members for performing some function. Examples of these functions are warehousing and shelf stocking. Trade discounts are often combined to include a series of functions, for example 20/12/5 could indicate a 20% discount for warehousing the product, an additional 12% discount for shipping the product, and an additional 5% discount for keeping the shelves stocked. Trade discounts are most frequent in industries where retailers hold the majority of the power in the distribution channel (referred to as channel captains). Trade discounts are given to try to increase the volume of sales being made by the supplier. The discount described as trade rate discount is sometimes called &quot; trade discount &quot;. [ Trade rate discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Trade rate discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] A trade rate discount, sometimes also called &quot; trade discount &quot;, is offered by a seller to a buyer for purposes of trade or reselling, rather than to an end user. For example, a pharmacist might offer a discount for over-the-counter drugs to physicians who are purchasing them for dispensing to the physicians&apos; own patients. [ http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/trade-rate/4945920-1.html Business glossary All Business 2009-02-07 ] A seller supplying both trade or resellers, and the general public will have a general list price for anybody, and will offer a trade discount to bona-fide trade customers. [ Trade-in credit &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Trade-In credit &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] Trade-in credit, also called trade-up credit, is a discount or credit granted for the return of something. The returned item may have little monetary value, as an old version of newer item being bought, or may be worth reselling as second-hand. The idea from a seller&apos;s viewpoint is to offer some discount but have the buyer showing some &quot; counter action &quot; to earn this special discount. Sellers like this as the discount granted is not just &quot; given for free &quot; and makes future price/value negotiations easier. Buyers have the advantage of getting some value for something no longer used. Examples can be found in many industries. [ http://savings.tm.agilent.com/index.cgi?PageTradeList%3AALIAS%3Dtrade_specials%26amp%3BUser%3ALANGUAGE%3Den Example for Trade-In offerings in the Test- and Measurement Industry All Business 2011-05-23 ] [ Discounts and allowances dealing with quantity ] These are price reductions given for large purchases. The rationale behind them is to obtain economies of scale and pass some (or all) of these savings on to the customer. In some industries, buyer groups and co-ops have formed to take advantage of these discounts. Generally there are two types: [ Cumulative quantity discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Cumulative quantity discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] Cumulative quantity discounts, also called accumulation discounts, are price reductions based on the quantity purchased over a set period of time. The expectation is that they will impose an implied switching cost and thereby bond the purchaser to the seller. [ Non-cumulative quantity discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Non-uantity discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] These are price reductions based on the quantity of a single order. The expectation is that they will encourage larger orders, thus reducing billing, order filling, shipping, and sales personal expenses. [ Dependence of price on quantity &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Dependence of price on quantity &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] An extreme form of quantity discount is when, within a quantity range, the price does not depend on quantity: if one wants less than the minimum amount one has to be pay for the minimum amount anyway if one wants an amount between two of the fixed amounts on offer, one has to pay for the higher amount These also apply in the case of a service with &quot; quantity &quot; referring to time. For example, an entrance ticket for a zoo is usually for a day; if one stays shorter, the price is the same. It is a kind of pass for unlimited use of a service during a day, where one can distinguish whether or not, when leaving and returning, one has to pay again. Similarly a pass can be for another period. In the case of long periods, it is obvious that one can leave and return without paying again. If one has to buy more than one wants, we can distinguish between the surplus just not being used, or the surplus being a nuisance, e.g. because of having to carry a large container. [ Discounts and allowances dealing with customer characteristics ] The following discounts have to do with specific characteristic s of the customer. [ Disability discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Disability discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] A discount offered to customers with what is considered to be a disability. [ Educational or student discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Educational discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Student discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] These are price reductions given to members of educational institutions, usually students but possibly also to educators and to other institution staff. The provider&apos;s purpose is to build brand awareness early in a buyer&apos;s life, or build product familiarity so that after graduation the holder is likely to buy the same product, for own use or for an employer, at its normal price. Educational discounts may be given by merchants directly, or via a student discount program, such as CollegeBudget in the United States or NUS and Studentdiscounts.co.uk in the United Kingdom. [ Employee discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Employee discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] A discount offered by a company to employee s who buy its products. In 2005, the American automakers ran an &quot; employee discount &quot; for all customers promotional campaign in order to entice buyers, with some success. [ Military discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Military discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] A discount offered to customers who are or were members of a military service. [ Age-related discounts ] [ Toddler discount, child discount, kid discount &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Toddler discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Child discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Kid discount &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] A discount, or free service, offered to children younger than a certain age, commonly for admission to entertainments and attractions, restaurants, and hotels. There may be a requirement that the child be accompanied by an adult paying full price. Small children often travel free on public transport, and older ones may pay a substantially discounted price; proof of age may be required. [ Young person&apos;s discount ] Discounts are sometimes offered to young people below a certain age who are neither children nor in education { Example of young person&apos;s discount : UK 16-25 railcard offering 1/3 discount on rail travel, and other discounts, for an annual fee }. [ Senior discount ] [ senior discount the band Senior Discount (band) ] [ Senior discount ] A discount offered to customers who are above a certain relatively advanced age, typically a round number such as 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75; the exact age varies in different cases. The rationale for a senior discount offered by companies is that the customer is assumed to be retired and living on a limited income, and unlikely to be willing to pay full price; sales at reduced price are better than no sales. Non-commercial organisations may offer concessionary prices as a matter of social policy { Example of government concession : UK residents over 75 are entitled to a free } { television licence }. Free or reduced-rate travel is often available to older people (see, for example, Freedom Pass ). [ Special prices offered to friends of the seller ] A discounted price offered to friends of the salesperson, an attitude which is parodied in the stereotype of a salesman saying &quot; It costs [such-and such], but for you... &quot; In Australia and New Zealand, discounts to friends are known as &quot; mates&apos; rates. &quot; { Mates&apos; rates program at Intercontinental Hotels } In French this discount is known as prix d&apos;ami. { www.proz.com } [ Special prices offered to local residents ] Common in tourist destinations. In Hawai&apos;i, for example, many tourist attractions, hotels, and restaurants charge a deeply discounted price to someone who shows proof that they live in Hawai&apos;i; this is known as a &quot; Kama&apos;aina discount, &quot; after the Hawaiian word for an old-timer or native. { Honolulu Magazine, June 2009 } [ Discount card ] [ Discount card ] Sometimes a document, typically a plastic card similar to a payment card, is issued as proof of eligibility for discounts. In other cases existing documents proving status (as student, disabled, resident, etc.) are accepted. Documentation may not be required, for example, for people who are obviously young or old enough to qualify for age-related discounts. [ Coupons ] [ Coupon ] A discount, either of a certain specified amount or a percentage to the holder of a voucher, usually with certain terms. Commonly, the terms involve the terms of other discounts on this page, such as being valid only if a certain quantity is bought or only if the customer is older than a specified age. Coupons are often printed in newspapers, brochures, and magazines, or can be downloaded and printed from Worldwide Web pages that can be accessed via the Internet. [ Rebates ] [ Rebate (marketing) ] A refund of part of sometimes the full price of the product following purchase, though some rebates are offered at the time of purchase. A particular case is the promise of a refund in full if applied for in a restricted date range some years in the future; the hope is that the promise will lure customers and increase sales, but that the majority will fail to meet the conditions for a valid claim. [ Other discounts and allowances ] [ Promotional allowance ] [ Discounts and allowances ] Promotional allowances - These are price reductions given to the buyer for performing some promotional activity. These include an allowance for creating and maintaining an in-store display or a co-op advertising allowance. Brokerage allowance - From the point of view of the manufacturer, any brokerage fee paid is similar to a promotional allowance. It is usually based on a percentage of the sales generated by the broker.
