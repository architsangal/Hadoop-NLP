Marvel&apos;s modern incarnation dates from 1961, the year that the company launched Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and others. Marvel counts among its characters such well-known properties as Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Avengers, Fantastic Four, Thor and Captain America; antagonists such as Doctor Doom, the Green Goblin, Magneto, Galactus, Loki, and the Red Skull.

Launching his new line from his existing company&apos;s offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, New York, he officially held the titles of editor, managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman officially listed as publisher. Timely&apos;s first publication, Marvel Comics #1 ( cover date d Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos&apos; android superhero the Human Torch, and the first generally available appearance of Bill Everett&apos;s anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner, among other features.

The company&apos;s first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon, teamed with eminent industry legend Jack Kirby to create one of the first [ May 2011 ] patriotically themed superheroes, Captain America, in Captain America Comics #1. (March 1941) It, too, proved a major sales hit, with sales of nearly one million. While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these &quot; big three &quot;, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer, Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel.

Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles. Goodman&apos;s business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff. One of these shell companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics&apos; covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946-47), were labeled &quot; A Marvel Magazine &quot; many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961. { Cover, &apos;&apos;All Surprise Comics&apos;&apos; #12 at the } { Grand Comics Database } [ Atlas Comics ] [ Atlas Comics (1950s) ] The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion.

Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned, on comics cover-date d November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues. { Marvel : Atlas &lt; nowiki &gt; [wireframe globe &lt; /nowiki &gt; (Brand)] at the Grand Comics Database } This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications. { Marvel Indicia Publishers at the Grand Comics Database } Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following popular trends in television and movies— Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in movie monsters another time—and even other comic books, particularly the EC horror line. { Per } { Les Daniels in Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World&apos;s Greatest Comics, pp. 67-68: &quot; The success of EC had a definite influence on Marvel. As Stan Lee recalls, &apos;Martin Goodman would say, &quot; Stan, let&apos;s do a different kind of book, &quot; and it was usually based on how the competition was doing. When we found that EC&apos;s horror books were doing well, for instance, we published a lot of horror books&apos; &quot;. } Atlas also published a plethora of children&apos;s and teen humor titles, including Dan DeCarlo &apos;s Homer the Happy Ghost (à la Casper the Friendly Ghost ) and Homer Hooper (à la Archie Andrews ). Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers, variously), the Sub-Mariner (drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett ), and Captain America (writer Stan Lee, artist John Romita Sr. ). { The Fantastic Four &apos;&apos; #1 (Nov. 1961).

Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, during a game of golf, either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications) bragged to to Timely and Atlas publisher Martin Goodman about DC&apos;s success with the Justice League, which had debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 (Feb. 1960) before going on to its own title. However, film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan partly debunked the story in a letter published in Alter Ego #43 (December 2004), pp. 43-44: [ Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC&apos;s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ownedIndependent News).... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman.... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces.... Sol worked closely with Independent News&apos; top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse&apos;s mouth. ] Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA&apos;s strong sales, did direct his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in [ Origins of Marvel Comics Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books 1974 16 0-7851-0579-4 ] [ Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The[sic] Justice League of Americaand it was composed of a team of superheroes.... &apos; If the Justice League is selling &apos;, spoke he, &apos;why don&apos;t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?&apos; ] The introduction of modern Marvel&apos;s first superhero team, in The Fantastic Four #1, (Nov. 1961), { &apos;&apos;Fantastic Four&apos;&apos; at the } { Grand Comics Database } began establishing the company&apos;s reputation. The majority of its superhero stories were written by editor-in-chief Stan Lee. The company continued to publish a smattering of Western comics such as Rawhide Kid, humor comics such as Millie the Model, and romance comics such as Love Romances, and added the war comic Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos. Editor-writer Lee and freelance artist Jack Kirby &apos;s Fantastic Four, reminiscent of the non-superpowered adventuring quartet the Challengers of the Unknown that Kirby had created for DC in 1957, originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age. { Genter, Robert. &quot; &apos;With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility&apos;: Cold War Culture and the Birth of Marvel Comics &quot;, The Journal of Popular Culture 40:6, 2007 } Eschewing such comic book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a &quot; superheroes in the real world &quot; approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success. { Comics historian Greg Theakston has suggested that the decision to include monsters and initially to distance the new breed of superheroes from costumes was a conscious one, and born of necessity. Since DC distributed Marvel&apos;s output at the time, Theakston theorizes that &quot; Goodman and Lee decided to keep their superhero line looking as much like their horror line as they possibly could, &quot; downplaying &quot; the fact that [Marvel] was now creating heroes &quot; with the knock-on effect that they ventured &quot; into deeper waters, where DC had never considered going &quot;. See Ro, pp. 87-88 } Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, Ant-Man, Iron Man, the X-Men, and Daredevil, and such memorable antagonists as Doctor Doom, Magneto, Galactus, the Green Goblin, and Doctor Octopus. Lee and Steve Ditko generated the most successful new series in The Amazing Spider-Man. Marvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a parody comic, Not Brand Echh (a play on Marvel&apos;s dubbing of other companies as &quot; Brand Echh &quot;, à la the then-common phrase &quot; Brand X &quot; ).

Marvel often presents flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits—unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books.

[ June 2009 ] His sense of humor and generally lighthearted manner became the &quot; voice &quot; that permeated the stories, the letters and news-pages, and the hyperbolic house ads of that era&apos;s Marvel Comics. He fostered a clubby fan-following with Lee&apos;s exaggerated depiction of the Bullpen (Lee&apos;s name for the staff) as one big, happy family. This included printed kudos to the artists, who eventually co-plotted the stories based on the busy Lee&apos;s rough synopses or even simple spoken concepts, in what became known as the Marvel Method, and contributed greatly to Marvel&apos;s product and success. Kirby in particular is generally credited for many of the cosmic ideas and characters of Fantastic Four and The Mighty Thor, such as the Watcher, the Silver Surfer and Ego the Living Planet, while Steve Ditko is recognized as the driving artistic force behind the moody atmosphere and street-level naturalism of The Amazing Spider-Man and the surreal atmosphere of the Strange Tales mystical feature &quot; Doctor Strange &quot;. Lee, however, continues to receive credit for his well-honed skills at dialogue and sense of storytelling, for his keen hand at choosing and motivating artists and assembling creative teams, and for his uncanny ability to connect with the readers—not least through the nickname endearments he bestowed in the credits and the monthly &quot; Bullpen Bulletins &quot; and letters pages, giving readers humanizing hype about the likes of &quot; Jolly Jack Kirby, &quot; &quot; Jaunty Jim Steranko &quot;, &quot; Rascally Roy Thomas &quot;, &quot; Jazzy Johnny Romita &quot;, and others, right down to letterers &quot; Swingin&apos; Sammy Rosen &quot; and &quot; Adorable Artie Simek &quot;. Lesser-known staffers during the company&apos;s growth in the 1960s (some of whom worked primarily for Marvel publisher Martin Goodman &apos;s umbrella magazine corporation) included circulation manager Johnny Hayes, subscriptions person Nancy Murphy, bookkeeper Doris Siegler, merchandising-person Charles &quot; Chip &quot; Goodman (son of publisher Martin), and Arthur Jeffrey, described in the December 1966 &quot; Bullpen Bulletin &quot; as &quot; keeper of our MMMS [ Merry Marvel Marching Society ] files, guardian of our club coupons and defender of the faith &quot;. In 1968, while selling 50 million comic books a year, company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years, allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted. In the fall of that year he sold Marvel Comics and his other publishing businesses to the Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation, which grouped them as the subsidiary Magazine Management Company, with Goodman remaining as publisher. { Daniels, Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World&apos;s Greatest Comics, p. 139. } In 1969, Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with Curtis Circulation Company.

Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. However, the industry&apos;s self-censorship board, the Comics Code Authority, refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant. Lee, with Goodman&apos;s approval, published the story regardless in The Amazing Spider-Man #96-98 (May–July 1971), without the Comics Code seal. The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year. { Nyberg, Amy Kiste. Seal of Approval: History of the Comics Code.

A series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry. Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror ( The Tomb of Dracula ), martial arts, ( Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu ), sword-and-sorcery ( Conan the Barbarian, Red Sonja ), satire ( Howard the Duck ) and science fiction ( 2001: A Space Odyssey, &quot; Killraven &quot; in Amazing Adventures, Star Trek, and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. [ Marvel took advantage of this moment to surpass DC in title production for the first time since 1957, and in sales for the first time ever.

DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount. { Daniels, Marvel, pp.154-155 } Goodman, now disconnected from Marvel, set up a new company called Seaboard Periodicals in 1974, reviving Marvel&apos;s old Atlas name for a new Atlas Comics line, but this lasted only a year-and-a-half.

Cult hits such as Howard the Duck fell victim to the distribution problems, with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later date. [ April 2008 ] But by the end of the decade, Marvel&apos;s fortunes were reviving, thanks to the rise of direct market distribution—selling through those same comics-specialty stores instead of newsstands. Marvel held its own comic book convention, Marvelcon &apos;75, in spring 1975, and promised a Marvelcon &apos;76. At the 1975 event, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Jack Kirby, the artist co-creator of most of Marvel&apos;s signature characters, was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival DC Comics. { Bullpen Bulletins : &quot; The King is Back! &apos;Nuff Said! &quot;, in Marvel Comics } { cover date d October 1975, including } { Fantastic Four #163 } In October 1976, Marvel, which already licensed reprints in different countries, including the UK, created a superhero specifically for the British market.

Star Comics, a childrens-oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles, was briefly successful during this period. Despite Marvel&apos;s successes in the early 1980s, it lost ground to rival DC in the latter half of the decade as many former Marvel stars defected to the competitor.

These were collectible trading cards that featured the characters and events of the Marvel Universe. The 1990s saw the rise of variant cover s, cover enhancements, and swimsuit issues. Another common practice of this period was company-wide crossovers that affected the overall continuity of the fictional Marvel Universe. In 1996, Marvel had almost all its titles participate in the &quot; Onslaught Saga &quot;, a crossover that allowed Marvel to relaunch some of its flagship, albeit flagging, characters such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, and outsource them to the studios of former Marvel artists turned Image Comics founders, Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld. After an initial sales bump, sales quickly declined below expected levels, [ November 2011 ] and Marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run; the characters soon returned to the Marvel Universe proper. In 1998, the company launched the imprint Marvel Knights, taking place within Marvel continuity; helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, it featured tough, gritty stories showcasing such characters as the Inhumans, Black Panther and Daredevil.
