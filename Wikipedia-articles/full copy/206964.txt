White Homing pigeon The homing pigeon is a variety of domestic pigeon derived from the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia domestica) selectively bred to find its way home over extremely long distances.

This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances. Flights as long as [ 1800 km mi on ] have been recorded by birds in competition pigeon racing. [ Walcott Charles Pigeon Homing: Observations, Experiments and Confusions Journal of Experimental Biology http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/21.pdf Pdf article 2008-01-04 ] Their average flying speed over moderate distances (500 miles) is around 80  km/h (50  mph), [ June 2009 ] but speeds of up to 177  km/h (110  mph) have been observed in top racers for short distance (100 miles). [ The Speed of Birds BBC.Co.UK http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/birds/weeklyfeature/speedofbirds/ Web article 2008-01-04 ] Homing pigeons are called messenger or carrier pigeon s when they are used to carry messages. [ Sex Difference ] A Pigeon fancier can tell its gender by sight as pigeons can be easily identified by a number of physical factors like head, beak, height and breast. Males usually stand taller, and have a large sized beaks situated on a round head (crown), whereas females tend to be shorter with smaller beaks, flatter heads and fuller breasts. [ Fly off technique ] This technique is used to distinguish between male and female pigeons: the pigeon&apos;s head is placed on the bottom of one&apos;s hand with its body inverted (i.e. legs on top and head or neck at bottom) and roll it back with its neck remaining at bottom and its tail facing toward body or face. Then close the hand and hold it for few seconds, then open the hand a little (loose) so the pigeon can move freely or fly. If it remains inverted and its neck remains at the bottom and does not roll or flip off (fly) from the hands for few seconds then it is female. If it flies from hand than it is male. This was discovered and proved in New Zealand by pigeon fanciers. [ Reproduction ] During breeding season, usually during the warmer months, a male pigeon will court the female by puffing out his chest, bobbing his head and strutting circles around her, all the while cooing his affections. If she accepts, she will allow him onto her back in order to copulate. After mating the male will build nest out of gathered sticks in a suitable crevasse, while the female watches and makes changes. Urban birds will gladly use a roof on a building. The female will usually lay two eggs which will hatch 17 to 19days. Both parents aid in rearing the nestlings. Fledglings usually leave the nest three to four weeks after hatching. [ Characteristic of Good intelligent Pigeon ] Pigeon eye&apos;s pupil acts as an indicator which tells the quality of pigeon. If the pigeon has small pupils then it shows that pigeon is of good breed and quality.It also shows intelligence of pigeon. The pigeons which have reflecting and transparent eyes and smaller eye&apos;s pupil are often most intelligent, they will always return their home in rain,storm and hot weather. These are the qualities of champion homing pigeons. [ History ] Stamp for early Pigeon-Gram service The Egyptians and the Persians first used carrier pigeons 3,000 years ago [ September 2009 ]. They were also used to proclaim the winner of the Olympics. [ Blechman Andrew Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world&apos;s most revered and reviled bird.

In Damietta, by the mouth of the Nile, the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur saw carrier pigeons for the first time, in 1436, though he imagined that the birds made round trips, out and back. { &quot; I saw there for the first time carrier pigeons, which take letters in their tail-feathers. They carry them from the place where they are bred to other places, and when the letters are detached they are set free and return to their homes. By this means the inhabitants have speedy news of all who come and go by sea or land. &quot; {Pedro Tafur, Andanças e viajes ). } The Republic of Genoa equipped their system of watch towers in the Mediterranean Sea with pigeon posts. Tipu Sultan used carrier pigeons. They returned to the Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna, which was his headquarters. The pigeon holes may be seen in the mosque&apos;s minarets to this day. In 1860, Paul Reuter, who later founded Reuters press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminals of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the Battle of Waterloo was also first delivered by a pigeon to England. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. Possibly the first regular air mail service in the world was Mr. Howie&apos;s Pigeon-Post service from the Auckland New Zealand suburb of Newton to Great Barrier Island, starting in 1896. Certainly the world’s first &apos;airmail&apos; stamps were issued for the Great Barrier Pigeon-Gram Service from 1898 to 1908. { The Great Barrier Island Pigeon-Gram Service } Homing pigeons were still employed in the 21st century by certain remote police departments in Orissa state in eastern India to provide emergency communication services following natural disaster s. In March 2002, it was announced that India&apos;s Police Pigeon Service messenger system in Orissa was to be retired, due to the expanded use of the Internet.

Most researchers believe that homing ability is based on a &quot; map and compass &quot; model, with the compass feature allowing birds to orient and the map feature allowing birds to determine their location relative to a goal site (home loft). { Bingman, V. P. (1998). Spatial representations and homing pigeon navigation. In S. Healy (Ed). Spatial representation in animals. (pp. 67-85). Oxford: Oxford University Press. } While the compass mechanism appears to rely on the sun, the map mechanism has been highly debated. { Wallraff, H.G. (2004). Avian } { olfactory navigation : its empirical foundation and conceptual state. Animal Behaviour, 67, 189-204. } Some researchers believe that the map mechanism relies on the ability of birds to detect the Earth&apos;s magnetic field. It is true that birds can detect a magnetic field, to help them find their way home.Scientists have found that on top of piegon&apos;s beak large number of particles of iron are found which remain aligned to north like man made compass,thus it acts as compass which helps piegon in determining its home.A light-mediated mechanism that involves the eyes and is lateralized has been examined somewhat, but recent developments have implicated the trigeminal nerve in magnetoception. { Mora, C. V., Davison, M., Wild, J. M., and Walker, M. M. (2004). Magnetoreception and its trigeminal mediation in the homing pigeon. Nature, 432, 508-511. } { Gagliardo, A., Ioale, P., Savini, M., and Wild, J. M. (2006). Having the nerve to home: trigeminal magnetoreceptor versus olfactory mediation of homing in pigeons. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 209, 2888-2892. } Research by Floriano Papi (Italy, early 1970s) and more recent work, largely by Hans Wallraff, suggests that instead pigeons orient themselves using the spatial distribution of atmospheric odors, known as olfactory navigation. Near their home lofts, in areas they have previously visited, pigeons probably are guided by visual landmarks. Various experiments suggest that different breeds of homing pigeons rely on different cues to different extents. Charles Walcott at Cornell was able to demonstrate that while pigeons from one loft were confused by a magnetic anomaly in the Earth it had no effect on birds from another loft a mile away. Other experiments have shown that altering the perceived time of day with artificial lighting or using air conditioning to eliminate odors in the pigeons&apos; home roost affected the pigeons&apos; ability to return home. Some research also indicates that homing pigeons navigate by following roads and other man-made features, making 90 degree turns and following habitual routes, much the same way that humans navigate.

Pigeons can only go back to one &quot; mentally marked &quot; point that they have identified as their home. So &quot; pigeon mail &quot; can only work when the sender is actually holding the receiver&apos;s pigeons. White homing pigeons are used in Release Dove ceremonies at weddings, funerals, and some sporting events. [ In war ] [ Pigeons in World War I ] A B-type bus from London converted into a Pigeon loft for use in Northern France and Belgium during the Great war Birds were used extensively during World War I. One homing pigeon, Cher Ami, was awarded the French Croix de guerre for his heroic service in delivering 12 important messages, despite having been very badly injured. Soldier with message and carrier pigeon during World War I. During World War II, the Irish Paddy, the American G.I. Joe and the English Mary of Exeter all received the Dickin Medal. They were among 32 pigeons to receive this award, for their gallantry and bravery in saving human lives with their actions. Eighty-two homing pigeons were dropped into Holland with the First Airborne Division Signals as part of Operation Market Garden in World War II. The pigeons&apos; loft was located in London which would have required them to fly 240 miles to deliver their messages. { Cornelius Ryan - } { A Bridge Too Far } Also in World War II, hundreds of homing pigeons with the Confidential Pigeon Service were airdropped into northwest Europe to serve as intelligence vectors for local resistance agents. Birds played a vital part in the Invasion of Normandy as radios could not be used for fear of vital information being intercepted by the enemy. [ In computing ] The humorous IP over Avian Carriers (RFC 1149) is an Internet protocol for the transmission of messages via homing pigeon. Originally intended as an April Fools&apos; Day RFC entry, this protocol was implemented and used, once, to transmit a message in Bergen, Norway on April 28, 2001. { Bergen Linux User Group - The highly unofficial CPIP WG } In September 2009, a South African IT company, based in Durban, pitted an 11-month-old bird armed with a data packed 4GB memory stick against the ADSL service from the country&apos;s biggest internet service provider, Telkom. The pigeon named Winston took an hour and eight minutes to carry the data [ 80 km mi on ].
