[ History ] Keiko, whose name means &quot; lucky one &quot; in the Japanese language, { Keiko the Whale } { BBC NEWS | Keiko the &apos;Free Willy&apos; Whale Dies } was captured near Iceland in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in Hafnarfjörður. Three years later he was sold to Marineland in Ontario where he first started performing for the public and developed skin lesion s indicative of poor health. He was then sold to Reino Aventura (now named Six Flags Mexico ), an amusement park in Mexico City, in 1985. He was the star of the movie Free Willy in 1993. The publicity from his role in Free Willy led to an effort by Warner Brothers Studio to find him a better home. Donations from the studio and Craig McCaw led to the establishment of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation in February 1995. With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon spent over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of returning him to the wild. UPS provided ground transportation to the nearby Newport Municipal Airport in a specialized container. Weighing 3500  kg (7720 pounds), he was transported by air in a United States Air Force C-17 Globemaster III to his new home on January 7, 1996. During his years in Oregon his weight increased over a ton. { Keiko.com: Keiko&apos;s Story: The Timeline } The plan to return him to the wild was a topic of much controversy. Some felt his years of captivity made such a return impossible. Researchers in a scientific study later said attempts to return him to the wild were misguided. [ M. Simon, M. B. Hanson, L. Murrey, J.

Upon landing, the C-17 Globemaster aircraft suffered a landing gear failure causing over $1 million in damage, though Keiko was unharmed. { C-17A S/N 96-0006 } { &quot; C-17 Accident During Whale Lift Due To Design Flaw &quot; } His day-to-day care became the responsibility of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation with management assistance from the Ocean Futures Society. He underwent training designed to prepare him for his eventual release, including supervised swims in the open ocean. Ocean Futures left the Keiko project in late 2001. The Free Willy-Keiko Foundation and the The Humane Society of the United States re-established management of the project at that time until Keiko&apos;s death in 2003. A film about Keiko, Keiko: The Untold Story was released in 2010. Loading Keiko onto a U.S. Air Force C-17 transport on September 9, 1998 in Newport, Oregon for transport to the Westman Islands in Iceland [ Death ] Keiko died after beaching himself in Taknes Bay, Norway while under the care of personnel from The Free Willy-Keiko Foundation on December 12, 2003, at about 27 years of age. Pneumonia was later determined as his probable cause of death. Following requests from fans of the orca and Free Willy, the Oregon Coast Aquarium held a memorial service for him on February 20, 2004. 700 people attended the service, during which Thomas Chatterton, a veterinary chaplain said, &quot; Keiko was not one of our kind but nonetheless, was still one of us. &quot; { Oregonians bid farewell to Keiko, popular killer whale:Associated Press } There is a memorial site for Keiko set up by the locals in Halsa, Norway. Norwegian school children built a stone cairn to mark the spot where he is buried. [ Filmography ] Keiko en peligro (1990)...Keiko Free Willy (1993)...Willy Free Willy 2 (1995)...
