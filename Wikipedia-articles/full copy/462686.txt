It is a designated Pennsylvania Scenic River. The river is about [ 135 mi ] long. { U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 } Its watershed of about [ 2000 mi2 km2 0 on ] lies entirely within the state of Pennsylvania. The source of its eastern branch is in the Appalachian Mountains at Tuscarora Springs, near Tamaqua in Schuylkill County. The West Branch starts near Minersville and joins the eastern branch at the town of Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania. It then combines with the Little Schuylkill River downstream in the town of Port Clinton, Pennsylvania. The Tulpehocken Creek joins it at the western edge of Reading. Wissahickon Creek joins it in northwest Philadelphia. Other major tributaries include: Maiden Creek, Manatawny Creek, French Creek, and Perkiomen Creek. The Schuylkill joins the Delaware River, of which it is the largest tributary, at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, now the Philadelphia Naval Business Center, just northeast of Philadelphia International Airport.

[ Annals of Phoenixville and Its Vicinity: From the Settlement to the Year 1871 Pennypacker Samuel Whitaker Samuel W. Pennypacker 1872 Bavis &amp; Pennypacker, printers Phoenixville, PA 5 ] The river was later given the Dutch name Schuylkill ( [ sχœylkɪl pron ] ) by its European discoverer, Arendt Corssen of the Dutch West India Company. [ January 2011 ] One explanation given for this name is that it translates to &quot; hidden river &quot; and refers to the river&apos;s confluence with the Delaware River at League Island, which was nearly hidden by dense vegetation. Another explanation is that the name properly translates to &quot; hideout creek &quot;. Thomas Paine tried in vain to interest the citizens in funding an iron bridge over this river, before abandoning &quot; pontifical works &quot; on account of the French Revolution. Patriot papermaker Frederick Bicking owned a fishery on the river prior to the Revolution. { Strawberry Mansion Bridge over the river at dusk. } { Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River were once the source of Philadelphia&apos;s water supply and are now an attraction in } { Fairmount Park. } The restoration of the river was funded by money left for that purpose in Benjamin Franklin&apos;s will.

The river itself, the Schuylkill Canal, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad were vital shipping conduits from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th century. Rail freight still uses many of the same valley rights-of-way that the 19th-century railroads used. Passenger and commuter rail service is more limited. Today, the old railbed rights-of-way along the river between Philadelphia and Norristown contain SEPTA &apos;s Manayunk/Norristown Line (former Reading Railroad right-of-way) and the Schuylkill River Trail (former Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way). There are efforts to extend both rail and trail farther upriver than they currently reach. The Schuylkill River Trail continues upriver from Norristown to Mont Clare, and designers plan to connect it to sections above Pottstown. SEPTA Regional Rail service currently does not go farther upriver than Norristown. Visions of resuming commuter rail service farther up the Schuylkill valley ( &quot; Schuylkill Valley Metro &quot; ) have yet to become reality. The Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) and the Benjamin Franklin Highway (US 422) follow the course of the river from Philadelphia to Valley Forge to Reading. Above Reading, Pennsylvania Route 61 continues along the main river valley to Schuylkill Haven, then follows the east branch to Pottsville. U.S. Route 209 continues along the east branch of the river to its head in Tuscarora. In Philadelphia, Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), and Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive (formerly West River Drive) flank the river. [ Recreation ] The Schuylkill River Trail, [ March 2008 ] which generally follows the river bank, is a multi-use trail for walking, jogging, bicycling, rollerblading, and other outdoor activities. The trail presently runs from Philadelphia, through Manayunk to the village of Mont Clare, the latter are the locations of the last two remaining watered stretches of the Schuylkill Canal. There is also a section of trail starting at Pottstown and running upriver toward Reading. Plans are underway to complete the trail from the Delaware River to Reading. The Schuylkill River is very popular with watersports enthusiasts. The Dad Vail Regatta, an annual rowing competition, is held on the river near Boathouse Row, as is the annual Bayada Regatta, featuring disabled rowers from all over the continent, and in autumn the annual Head of The Schuykill Regatta takes place in Philadelphia. [ References in culture ] [ Television ] In the &apos;Thunder Gun Express&apos; episode of It&apos;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Frank Reynolds, played by Danny Devito steals a tourist ferry and travels down the Schuylkill River, noting that it&apos;s &quot; the depository of all the unsolved crimes and murders in Philadelphia &quot; [ Literature ] The angler, artist, and author Ron P. Swegman has made the Schuylkill River a focal point of two essay collections, Philadelphia on the Fly (Frank Amato Publications, 2005 &quot; &quot; ) and Small Fry: The Lure of the Little (The Whitefish Press, 2009 &quot; &quot; ). Both books describe the experience of fly fishing along the Philadelphia County stretch of the river in the twenty-first century. Beth Kephart published a series of poetic ruminations about the river in Flow: The Life and Times of Philadelphia&apos;s Schuylkill River in 2007. The river plays an important part of Jerry Spinelli &apos;s young-adult fiction novel Maniac Magee. The titular character&apos;s parents died before the main timeline of the story when their commuter train plunged into the Schuykill, and much of the main story takes place in the fictional town of Two Mills, which is based on Spinelli&apos;s home town of Norristown, Pennsylvania, also located on the Schuykill near Philadelphia. Jules Verne &apos;s novel, Robur the Conqueror, starts out in Philadelphia on the banks of the Schuylkill River.
