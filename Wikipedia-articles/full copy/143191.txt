Released in 1976, the album features an eponymous seven-part suite written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, with lyrics written by Neil Peart telling a dystopia n story set in the year 2112. The album is sometimes described as a concept album although the songs on the second side are unrelated to the plot of the suite. Rush repeated this arrangement on the 1978 album Hemispheres. 2112 is one of two Rush albums listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (the other being Moving Pictures ). In 2006, a poll of Planet Rock listeners picked 2112 as the definitive Rush album. The Toronto dates of the 2112 tour were recorded and released as All the World&apos;s a Stage in September 1976. [ The album ] [ Breakthrough ] Due to the relative commercial failure of their previous album, Caress of Steel, the record label is said to have pressured the band not to do another album with &quot; concept &quot; songs. Caress of Steel contains two multi-part epics: the 12-minute &quot; The Necromancer &quot; (side one) and the side-long epic &quot; The Fountain of Lamneth &quot; (side two). By their own recollection, the band stuck to their principles and recorded what would become their first commercial success, and ultimately a signature record. 2112 was released in March 1976 and landed on the Billboard Hot 100 album chart, becoming their first album to reach the Billboard Top 100. 2112 would eventually be certified Gold on November 16, 1977, along with the band&apos;s then current releases A Farewell to Kings and the live All The World&apos;s a Stage. 2112 reached Platinum status on February 25, 1981, shortly after the release of Moving Pictures in 1981, the latter being their biggest selling record to date. [ 2112 ] [ 2112 (song) ] In the year 2062, a galaxy-wide war results in the union of all planets under the rule of the Red Star of the Solar Federation. By 2112, the world is controlled by the &quot; Priests of the Temples of Syrinx, &quot; who determine the content of all reading matter, songs, pictures - every facet of life. A man discovers an ancient guitar and learns to play his own music. Thinking he has made a wonderful discovery that will be a boon to humanity, he goes to present the guitar to the priests of the Temples, who angrily destroy it and rebuke him for unearthing one of the &quot; silly whims &quot; that caused the collapse of the previous civilization. He goes into hiding and dreams of a world before the Solar Federation. Upon awakening he becomes distraught and commits suicide. As he dies, another planetary battle begins resulting in the ambiguous ending &quot; Attention all planets of the Solar Federation: We have assumed control. &quot; (This spoken section was created by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson reportedly &quot; messing around with a tape recorder. &quot; ) In the &quot; VH1 Classic Albums &quot; series about the album, Peart confirmed that he intended the ending to be a happy one as the people of the Solar Federation are liberated. On the album, Neil Peart credits &quot; the genius of Ayn Rand. &quot; Rand, a Russian-born Jewish-American novelist and creator of the philosophy of Objectivism, wrote a novella titled Anthem (itself adopted as the title of another Rush song, from the album Fly By Night ) from which Peart borrowed the broad strokes of the plot. [ Remaining songs ] The other songs on the album stand alone from the title track, with Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson writing lyrics for one song each ( &quot; Tears &quot; and &quot; Lessons, &quot; respectively). All other lyrics were penned by Peart. &quot; Tears &quot; would be the first Rush song to feature an outside musician. Hugh Syme, who would play keyboards on a number of Rush songs in the future, (e.g., &quot; Different Strings &quot; on Permanent Waves and &quot; Witch Hunt &quot; on Moving Pictures ) contributes a multi-tracked Mellotron string and flute part to the track. &quot; A Passage to Bangkok &quot; and &quot; The Twilight Zone &quot; are songs typical of this time period of Rush. &quot; The Twilight Zone &quot; was written and recorded in one day. &quot; Something for Nothing &quot; closes out the album. Neil Peart states: &quot; All those paeans to American restlessness and the American road carried a tinge of wistfulness, an acknowledgment of the hardships of the vagrant life, the notion that wanderlust could be involuntary, exile as much as freedom, and indeed, the understanding that freedom wasn&apos;t free. In the mid-&apos;70s, the band was driving to a show in downtown Los Angeles, at the Shrine Auditorium, and I noticed some graffiti splattered across a wall: &apos;Freedom isn&apos;t free,&apos; and I adapted that for a song on 2112, &apos;Something for Nothing.&apos; &quot; [ Starman emblem ] The Starman emblem (also known as the &apos;Man in the Star&apos; logo) was adopted by Rush fans as a logo since its first appearance on the back cover of 2112. Peart described the Starman in an interview with Creem magazine: &quot; All (the naked man) means is the abstract man against the masses. The red star symbolizes any collectivist mentality. &quot; With regard to the album, the &apos;collectivist mentality&apos; referred to is depicted as the Red Star of the Solar Federation, which according to the plot is a galaxy-wide confederation that controls all aspects of life during the year 2112. The figure in the emblem is depicted as being the &apos;Hero&apos; of the album. Hugh Syme, the creator of many of Rush&apos;s album covers, commented on the design: &quot; The man is the hero of the story. That he is nude is just a classic tradition...the pureness of his person and creativity without the trappings of other elements such as clothing. The red star is the evil red star of the Federation, which was one of Neil&apos;s symbols. We basically based that cover around the red star and that hero. &quot; The logo also appears on six other Rush album covers: on the backdrop behind Peart&apos;s drumkit in All the World&apos;s a Stage, their first live album released in 1976; in one of the pictures that is being moved in Moving Pictures; on Retrospective 1; on Archives, a compilation album released in 1978; on their 1981 live album Exit...Stage Left, in the background amongst symbols from all their previous work; on their 2003 compilation The Spirit of Radio; and on their 2004 covers album Feedback. [ Legacy and cultural significance ] The Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a non-profit Canadian charitable organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada&apos;s audio-visual heritage, has sponsored MasterWorks, which annually recognizes 12 culturally significant Canadian classics from the film, radio, TV and music industries. In 2006, 2112 was one of the albums chosen to be preserved. [ Video game adaptations ] The newest title in the Guitar Hero franchise, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock features the song 2112 in its entirety as seven different tracks. In the Quest mode of the game, the player receives the Legendary Guitar after finishing the 2112 chapter. Some of the venues in the game were inspired by the song.The narration in Quest mode of the game in the 2112 chapter is narrated by the band. The song is also available for download on the Harmonix music game Rock Band 3 to play either as three separate tracks or in its entire 20-minute form.
