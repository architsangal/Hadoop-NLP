The towns atop the cliff are Fort Lee and Cliffside Park, north and south, respectively. Edgewater abuts Fort Lee Historic Park in the borough of Fort Lee on the north. On the south it shares a border with the township of North Bergen, which lies in Hudson County. River Road runs into and out of the town from the north and south, lying just above the level of the Hudson. Only three roads lead up the Palisades Cliff. Route 5, with one switchback, ascends to Palisades Avenue, which leads north into Fort Lee and south into Cliffside Park. Gorge Road and Edgewater Road, the latter still referred to by many local residents by its Colonial-era name as Oxen Hill Road, lead up the Palisades to Cliffside Park.

Early in the 20th century the addition of landfill to the Hudson River changed the borough&apos;s appearance. Until that time, the Hudson River lay closer to River Road from just above Veteran&apos;s field southward to what is now the Binghamton Ferry Plaza. { Hall, Edgewater, p. 8 } The 20th century brought great change to Edgewater with industrialization, which overwhelmed the borough { Hall, Edgewater, p. 49 } and filled [ 3 mi ] of the shoreline with its operations. Transportation of factory goods was facilitated when the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway cut a tunnel through the Palisades in 1894 to connect the borough to its Jersey City line. Edgewater was also well situated for shipping, with deep water piers on the Hudson River and access to abundant labor from Manhattan. Generally, industrial development occurred in the southern end of the borough, while the northern end remained residential. As industrialization increased in the borough, picnic grounds lost their appeal and resort hotels faded. { Hall, Edgewater, p. 21 } Among the industries that would prosper in the first half of the 20th century were Alcoa Aluminum, the Ford Motor Company, Lever Brothers, Valvoline Oil Co. and Archer-Daniels-Midland. { Hall, Edgewater, p. 28 and pp. 33-37 } Railroad trains served various factories, traversing tracks laid in River Road. During the first 30 years of the century Edgewater&apos;s population quadrupled, and the transient workforce increased tenfold. Eventually the factories closed. The reasons were varied, but they included the globalization of industry, obsolete facilities and the replacement of railroad shipping by trucking, which could not run its large tractor trailer trucks on Edgewater&apos;s narrow streets. There is a wonderfully evocative portrait of Edgewater in the early 20th century in Joseph Mitchell&apos;s essay The Rivermen, which was published in The New Yorker and is included in his book The Bottom of the Harbor. 1930 Fortune magazine photo of industrial and chemical operations in south Edgewater.

Residential and shopping center development in south Edgewater where industry formerly thrived. The late 20th century history of Edgewater was one of change from an industrialized town to a residential one. With the closing of the factories, development came to Edgewater [ Daniels Lee A.

As seen in the population box on this page, it had remained mostly in the 4,000 to 5,000 range from 1930 to 1990. According to estimates from 2007, the population has roughly doubled. City council members and residents acknowledge the problem of increased traffic.

Because of the expense of buying property, some currently refer to Edgewater as the Gold Coast. A photographic history of Edgewater describes the population and demographics change and its possible consequence this way: Now a good number of residents live on the river in condominiums and rental apartments and town houses on land that was once the province of heavy industry. Some see this as the creation of a town divided, with the newcomers living on the east side of River Road by the Hudson River and the old-timers living on the west side of River Road. Although the borough is unrecognizable as the industrial town it once was, growing pains have left marks. When the old Alcoa plant site from 1916 began to be converted to condominiums, construction was forced to halt for cleanup of industrial contaminants, including excessively high concentrations of PCBs. In another case, construction of a condominium/shopping center in south Edgewater was interrupted for six months by safety measures to protect workers from chemical exposure in the lead- and arsenic-riddled soil. Next to this structure, behind a chain link fence lies a Superfund site. Operational Hess Oil tanks stand as a reminder of the borough&apos;s industrial phase beside the derelict Alcoa rolling mill, once the second-largest in the world, { Hall, Edgewater, p. 28 }, the building, occupying [ 1100000 sqft ] of space was designed in 1914 and was used to roll ingots of aluminum into sheets that were used to create everything from toothpaste tubes to aircraft frames before the facility was abandoned in 1967. { Barbanel, Josh. &quot; A &apos;New Ft.
