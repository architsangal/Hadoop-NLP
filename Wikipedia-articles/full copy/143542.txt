In the European Parliament, the city area is within the Scotland constituency, which covers all of the 32 council areas of Scotland. Glasgow City became one of the newly created single tier local authorities in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, { See also &apos;&apos;Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994&apos;&apos;, Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website ( OPSI home page ) } with boundaries somewhat different from those of the City of Glasgow district of the Strathclyde region : a Rutherglen and Fernhill area, a Cambuslang and Halfway area, were transferred from the city area to the new South Lanarkshire council area. The district had been created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, to include: the former county of city of Glasgow and a number of areas previously within county of Lanark : Cambuslang (Central and North, and South lying outwith East Kilbride ), Rutherglen (including the burgh of Rutherglen), part of a Carmunnock area (that lying outwith East Kilbride), and Baillieston, Garrowhill, Mount Vernon and Carmyle, and Springboig areas. [ Glasgow City Council ] [ History ] The early city was run by the old Glasgow Town Council. In 1895, the Town Council formally became The Corporation of the City of Glasgow (Glasgow Corporation or City Corporation). It retained this title until local government re-organisation in 1975, when it became City of Glasgow District Council. In 1996 Glasgow District Council became Glasgow City Council. The title Lord Provost of Glasgow, used now for the civic leader of the city council, has history dating from the 15th century. Glasgow Corporation Transport, was under the control of the Glasgow Corporation, and ran the local buses and Glasgow Trams, until creation of the Strathclyde region in 1975. During the period of two tier local government, 1975 to 1996, the Glasgow District Council was responsible for refuse collection, museums, libraries and housing, while Strathclyde Regional Council had responsibilities for policing, fire service, water, education, social work and transport. The city council established in 1996 took on the powers and responsibilities previously divided between councils of the Glasgow City district and the Strathclyde region. The council area borders onto the Renfrewshire council area, the West Dunbartonshire council area, the East Dunbartonshire council area, the North Lanarkshire council, the South Lanarkshire council area and the East Renfrewshire council area. [ Council structure ] The council is ceremonially headed by the Lord Provost of Glasgow, who is elected to convene the council and perform associated tasks as a general civil leader. The current incumbent is Bob Winter. The council&apos;s executive branch is headed by a Leader of the Council, who is the leader of the largest political grouping, currently the Labour Party. [ Elections ] [ Glasgow City Council election, 2012 ] The council consists of 79 councillor s elected for a four-year term from 21 wards. These wards were introduced for the 2007 election and each returns three or four members by the single transferable vote system of election. This system was introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, { See also &apos;&apos;Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004&apos;&apos;, Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website } as a means of ensuring a reasonably proportionately representative outcome. The most recent full council election took place on Thursday 3 May 2012. Labour retained overal majority control (45), with increased numbers for Scottish National Party (27), Greens (5) with the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Glasgow First returning one councillor each. No Scottish Socialist Party, Solidarity or independent councillors were returned. Since 2007 The Solidarity Councillor Ruth Black has since defected to the Labour Party in late 2007 after praising the Leadership of Steven Purcell. { See } While Alex Dingwall and Colin Deens have both defected from the SNP, becoming a Liberal Democrat and Independent respectively. John Mason, elected in the Baillieston ward as an SNP councillor resigned following election to the House of Commons on 25 July 2008 { http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2411745.0.mason_calls_time_on_council_career.php } with the SNP winning the resultant by-election in September. { SNP holds ward after by-election, BBC News, 19 September 2008 } However, Mason failed to retain his seat in House of Commons after Margaret Curran, in a landslide victory, won the seat for the Scottish Labour Party in the 2010 General Election. The third council by-election in four months and the second in Ballieston multi-member ward will be precipitated by the death of sitting Labour councillor Douglas Hay. { Labour council stalwart Douglas Hay dies aged 76, Gerry Braiden, The Herald, 20 October 2008 } The resulting by-election was won by the Labour candidate, Andy Muir On the same day of the European Elections 2009, a by-election was held for Ward 14, Anniesland and Drumchapel. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of sitting councillor, Bill Kidd { http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2504023.0.glasgow_msp_steps_down_from_council.php } (SNP). The resulting by-election was won by Labour candidate, Anne McTaggart. { http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5611A2A4-AB26-4EFC-ADCE-A0BFD4154D62/0/WARD14DrumchapelAnniesland.pdf } In February and March 2012, a series of Labour councillors resigned from the party, and formed the new political party Glasgow First. { http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/301792-ninth-glasgow-labour-councillor-resigns/ } 1 defected from Labour to the SNP. This resulted in a minority of Labour councillors on the council for the first time in 31 years. [ Current multi-member ward system ] A multi-member ward system was introduced for the 2007 council election: Ward Representation Map 1. Linn (4 members) 2 Lab; 1 SNP; 1 Lib Dem Wards in the Glasgow City 2. Newlands/Auldburn (3 members) 2 Lab; 1 SNP 3. Greater Pollok (4 members) 3 Lab; 1 SNP 4. Craigton (4 members) 3 Lab; 1 SNP;* 5.

North East (4 members) 3 Lab; 1 SNP [ Previous single-member ward system ] Prior to the 2007 election, there were 79 councillors elected from 79 single-member wards by the plurality ( first past the post ) system of election. The result from this system was 69 of the 79 councillors representing the Labour Party although that party gained only around half the votes cast in the previous general election to the council, and the Scottish National Party was represented by just four councillors despite gaining some 20% of the votes. There were also three Liberal Democrat councillors, one Conservative councillor, one Scottish Socialist Party councillor and one independent councillor. These old wards has been first used in the general election to the council in 1999: Ward Ward Ward &lt; LI &gt; Drumry &lt; LI &gt; Summerhill &lt; LI &gt; Blairdardie &lt; LI &gt; Knightswood Park &lt; LI &gt; Knightswood South &lt; LI &gt; Yoker &lt; LI &gt; Anniesland &lt; LI &gt; Jordanhill &lt; LI &gt; Kelvindale &lt; LI &gt; Scotstoun &lt; LI &gt; Victoria Park &lt; LI &gt; Hayburn &lt; LI &gt; Hyndland &lt; LI &gt; Hillhead &lt; LI &gt; Partick &lt; LI &gt; Kelvingrove &lt; LI &gt; Anderston &lt; LI &gt; Woodlands &lt; LI &gt; North Kelvin &lt; LI &gt; Wyndford &lt; LI &gt; Maryhill &lt; LI &gt; Summerston &lt; LI &gt; Milton &lt; LI &gt; Ashfield &lt; LI &gt; Firhill &lt; LI &gt; Keppochhill &lt; LI &gt; Merchant City &lt; LI &gt; Royston &lt; LI &gt; Cowlairs &lt; LI &gt; Springburn &lt; LI &gt; Wallacewell &lt; LI &gt; Milnbank &lt; LI &gt; Dennistoun &lt; LI &gt; Calton &lt; LI &gt; Bridgeton/ Dalmarnock &lt; LI &gt; Parkhead &lt; LI &gt; Carntyne &lt; LI &gt; Robroyston &lt; LI &gt; Gartcraig &lt; LI &gt; Queenslie &lt; LI &gt; Greenfield &lt; LI &gt; Barlanark &lt; LI &gt; Shettleston &lt; LI &gt; Tollcross Park &lt; LI &gt; Braidfauld &lt; LI &gt; Mount Vernon &lt; LI &gt; Baillieston &lt; LI &gt; Garrowhill Wards in the Glasgow City &lt; LI &gt; Garthamlock &lt; LI &gt; Easterhouse &lt; LI &gt; Drumoyne &lt; LI &gt; Govan &lt; LI &gt; Ibrox &lt; LI &gt; Kingston &lt; LI &gt; Mosspark &lt; LI &gt; North Cardonald &lt; LI &gt; Penilee &lt; LI &gt; Cardonald &lt; LI &gt; Pollok &lt; LI &gt; Crookston &lt; LI &gt; Nitshill &lt; LI &gt; Darnley &lt; LI &gt; Carnwadric &lt; LI &gt; Maxwell Park &lt; LI &gt; Pollokshields East &lt; LI &gt; Hutchesontown &lt; LI &gt; Govanhill &lt; LI &gt; Strathbungo &lt; LI &gt; Battlefield &lt; LI &gt; Langside &lt; LI &gt; Pollokshaws &lt; LI &gt; Newlands &lt; LI &gt; Cathcart &lt; LI &gt; Mount Florida &lt; LI &gt; Toryglen &lt; LI &gt; Kings Park &lt; LI &gt; Castlemilk &lt; LI &gt; Carmunnock &lt; LI &gt; Glenwood [ Scottish Parliament ] [ Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region) ] The Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament covers Glasgow City, a Rutherglen area of South Lanarkshire and a small eastern area of Renfrewshire. It includes ten constituencies, each electing one of the parliament&apos;s 73 first past the post constituency members. Also, the region elects seven of the parliament&apos;s 56 additional members. The system of election is designed to produce a form of proportional representation, and both kinds of member are known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Until the United Kingdom general election, 2005, the first past the post seats were the same for the Scottish Parliament ( Holyrood ) as for the United Kingdom Parliament ( Westminster ) (apart from Orkney and Shetland, which formed separate constituencies at Holyrood, but not Westminster). In 2005 the number of Westminster Members of Parliament (MPs) was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of constituencies and MSPs was retained for Holyrood. [ First past the post constituencies ] The nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region, and current MSPs, are:- Glasgow Anniesland Glasgow Cathcart Glasgow Southside Glasgow Kelvin Glasgow Maryhill &amp; Springburn Glasgow Pollok Glasgow Rutherglen* Glasgow Shettleston Glasgow Springburn | Bill Kidd James Dornan Nicola Sturgeon Sandra White Patricia Ferguson Johann Lamont James Kelly John Mason Paul Martin Scottish National Party Scottish National Party Scottish National Party Scottish National Party Labour Party Labour Party Labour Party Scottish National Party Labour Party The Rutherglen constituency is entirely within South Lanarkshire.

All seven are entirely within the Glasgow City council area, with boundaries first used in the 2005 general election, and each elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the plurality ( first past the post ) system of election. Prior to the 2005 election, Glasgow City was divided between Westminster constituencies with the same names and boundaries as now existing Holyrood constituencies. The seven Westminster constituencies created in 2005, and current MPs, are:- Glasgow Central Glasgow East Glasgow North Glasgow North East Glasgow North West Glasgow South Glasgow South West | Anas Sarwar Margaret Curran Ann McKechin Willie Bain John Robertson Tom Harris Ian Davidson Labour Party Labour Party Labour Party Labour Party Labour Party Labour Party Labour Co-operative [ Footnotes ] Category:Glasgow Category:Local authorities of Scotland bg:Глазгоу (област) da:Glasgow Kommune de:City of Glasgow gd:Comhairle Cathair Ghlaschu lt:Glazgas (sritis) no:City of Glasgow pl:Glasgow (hrabstwo) ru:Глазго (область) sv:Glasgow City uk:Глазго (область)
