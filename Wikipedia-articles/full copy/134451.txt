[ History ] Summerton is the source of Briggs v. Elliott (Court citation:347 US 483). Briggs was the first filed of the four cases combined into Brown v. Board of Education, the famous case in which the U.S. Supreme Court, in 1954, officially overturned racial segregation in U.S. public schools. Despite the outcome of Briggs and Brown, as of 2004 Summerton&apos;s schools remain effectively segregated, with nearly all white students now attending the private Clarendon Hall, leaving the public schools almost entirely African-American. As of 2004, 95% of public high school students at Scotts Branch High are black, despite 40% white population in the community. As of 2004 only 30% of the students at Summerton&apos;s Scott Branch High School took the SAT, and their composite scores were among the lowest in the state. Approximately 50% of Summerton public school students met standard on the State high school exit exam as of 2003. Scott&apos;s Branch&apos;s 761 SAT average is 228 points below the South Carolina average of 989, while Clarendon Hall, a local private school, had an average of 978 that does not meet the statewide average either, 11 points away. http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/72088 [ References ] [ External links ] &apos;&apos;Brown v.
