Funk Charles Earle 1936 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New York ] November 16, 1890 in Alliance Colony, New Jersey – July 2, 1995 in Windsor, Vermont ) was an American investigative journalist and media critic. The writer and critic Gilbert Seldes was his younger brother. Actress Marian Seldes is his niece. Influenced by Lincoln Steffens, his career began when he was nineteen years old and was hired at the Pittsburgh Leader. In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the Pittsburgh Post. In 1916, he went to the United Press in London and, starting in 1917, during World War I, he moved to France to work at the Marshall Syndicate. While there, he interviewed Paul von Hindenburg, the supreme commander of the German Army. Hindenburg commented on the defeat of Germany in the war, including U.S. involvement; however this interview was censored by the U. S. military. Seldes would later comment that the publishing of this interview could have avoided the rising of the Nazis to power and, thus, World War II. After World War I, he spent ten years as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune. In 1922, he interviewed Vladimir Lenin and, in 1923, got expelled from the Soviet Union, along with three colleagues, for disguising news reports as personal letters; a letter his publisher wrote for the Soviets only facilitated his expulsion. The newspaper then sent him to Italy, where he reported on opposition leader Giacomo Matteotti &apos;s murder, implicated Benito Mussolini in Matteotti&apos;s death, and was again expelled. In 1927, he became a reporter for the Chicago Tribune in Mexico, where he criticized the use of the country&apos;s mineral rights by American companies. Later, he returned to Europe; however, he was increasingly sidelined since his political ideas didn&apos;t match with those of the newspaper&apos;s owner. He then became a freelance reporter and author, writing a series of books and criticisms and, in 1940, founded a newsletter, &apos;&apos;In Fact&apos;&apos;, which brought attention to how the National Association of Manufacturers was able to use its advertising dollars to produce news stories favourable to its members and to suppress news stories unfavourable to them. Having both staunch admirers and strong critics, Seldes influenced many younger journalists. He received an award for professional excellence from the Association for Education in Journalism in 1980, and a George Polk Award for his life&apos;s work in 1981. Seldes also served on the board of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR). [ Early years ] George Seldes was born November 16, 1890 to ethnic Jewish emigres from Russia in Alliance Colony, a utopian community in New Jersey.

For this newspaper, he interviewed a saleswoman who had filed a rape complaint against the son of the owner on a large department store; however, the story was not published, and Seldes became outraged when the advertising department of the newspaper blackmail ed the owner into buying more advertising. In 1914, he was appointed night editor of the Pittsburgh Post. As a young journalist, he was influenced by the investigative journalism of muckraker Lincoln Steffens, whom he met in 1919. [ World War I ] In 1916, Seldes moved to London where he worked for the United Press. When the United States joined the First World War in 1917, Seldes was sent to France where he worked as the war correspondent for the Marshall Syndicate. At end of the war, he obtained an exclusive interview with Paul von Hindenburg, the supreme commander of the German Army, in which Hindenburg acknowledged the role America had played in defeating Germany. &quot; The American infantry, &quot; said Hindenburg, &quot; won the World War in battle in the Argonne. &quot; Seldes and the others were accused of breaking the Armistice and were court martial ed. They were also forbidden to write anything about the interview and it never appeared in American news media. Seldes believed that blocking publication of this interview proved tragic. Unaware of Hindenburg&apos;s direct testimony of Germany&apos;s military defeat, Germans adopted the Dolchstoss or &quot; stab-in-the-back &quot; theory that Germany had only lost the war because it was betrayed at home by &quot; the socialists, the Communists and the Jews, &quot; which served as Nazism &apos;s explanation for Germany&apos;s defeat. &quot; If the Hindenburg interview had been passed by Pershing&apos;s censors at the time, it would have been headlined in every country civilized enough to have newspapers and undoubtedly would have made an impression on millions of people and became an important page in history, &quot; wrote Seldes. &quot; I believe it would have destroyed the main planks on which Hitler rose to power, it would have prevented World War II, the greatest and worst war in all history, and it would have changed the future of all mankind. &quot; [ Witness to a Century Seldes George 1987 100 ] [ http://www.publiceye.org/glossary/seldes.html#fairobit Great Press Critic Leaves a Legacy of Courage Solomon Norman Norman Solomon Cohen Jeff Jeff Cohen (media critic) July 1995 PublicEye.org Political Research Associates January 11, 2011 ] Seldes claimed that the Battle of Saint-Mihiel never happened. In his account, General Pershing planned to capture the city, but on September 1 the Germans decided to remove their forces from Saint-Mihiel to reinforce other positions. Seldes claimed no shots were fired as the first Americans, he among them, entered the city on September 13 to be greeted as liberators before General Pershing, Pétain, and other high-ranking officers arrived. The thousands of German prisoners captured, he wrote, were taken as they mistakenly arrived at the train station days later to relieve the German troops that had left days earlier.

Notice the &apos;&apos;Chicago Tribune&apos;&apos; stamp Seldes spent the next ten years as an international reporter for the Chicago Tribune. He interviewed Lenin in 1922. He and three other reporters were expelled in 1923 when Soviet authorities, who routinely censored foreign reporters&apos; telegraphed dispatches, found articles by the four reporters, disguised as personal letters, being smuggled out in a diplomatic mailpouch to avoid censorship. The expulsion was facilitated, according to Seldes, after his publisher, Colonel Robert McCormick, failed to show sufficient respect when writing to the Soviets to protest censorship.

Seldes investigated the murder of Giacomo Matteotti, the head of the parliamentary section of the Italian United Socialist Party. His article implicated Mussolini in the killing, and Seldes was expelled from Italy.

Seldes returned to Europe, but found that his work increasingly censored to fit the political views of the newspaper&apos;s owner, Robert R. McCormick. [ Freelance ] Disillusioned, Seldes left the Tribune and went to work as a freelance writer. In his first two books, You Can&apos;t Print That! (1929) and Can These Things Be! (1931), Seldes included material that he had not been allowed to publish in the Tribune. His next book, World Panorama (1933), was a narrative history of the interbellum period. In 1932 he married Helen Larkin Wiesman (later Seldes), who died in the late 1970s. In 1934, Seldes published a history of the Roman Catholic Church, The Vatican. This was followed by an exposé of the global arms industry, Iron, Blood and Profits (1934) and an account of Benito Mussolini, Sawdust Caesar (1935). Two books on the newspaper business established his enduring reputation as a critic of the press: Freedom of the Press (1935) and Lords of the Press (1938). He took the title of the latter from a speech by Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes : &quot; Our ancestors did not fight for the right of a few Lords of the Press to have almost exclusive control of and censorship over the dissemination of news and ideas. &quot; He believed &quot; that advertisers were a far greater threat to journalistic freedom than government censorship. &quot; [ Obituary: George Seldes Guttenplan John http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-george-seldes-1591344.html The Independent July 14, 1995 January 11, 2011 ] The press and news, he wrote, &quot; are coming more and more under the domination of a handful of corporate publishers who may print such news as they wish to print and omit such news as they do not wish to print. &quot; [ Communication, Power, and Media Gibson Donald 2004 Nova Science Hauppauge, NY 14 ] Time was initially positive in its response: &quot; A rambling but effective attack on U.

On his return to the United States in 1940, Seldes published Witch Hunt, an account of the persecution of people with left-wing political views in America, and The Catholic Crisis, which sought to demonstrate the close relationship between the Catholic Church and fascist organizations in Europe. When Time reviewed the latter, it noted several of Seldes&apos; works and said he &quot; stuck out his tongue at Benito Mussolini... thumbed his nose at U. S. journalism...and uttered some hoarse Bronx cheers at the Roman Catholic Church. &quot; The review complained that his detailed accounts of church activities were &quot; in part damaging &quot; but &quot; not all germane to the subject. &quot; [ Religion: Seldes vs. Rome http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C762893%2C00.html TIME November 7, 1929 January 11, 2011 ] [ In Fact ] Cover of volume IX of edition 22 of &apos;&apos;In Fact, An Antidote for Falsehood in the Daily Press&apos;&apos; From 1940 to 1950, Seldes published a political newsletter, In Fact, &quot; a four-page weekly compendium of news other newspapers wouldn&apos;t print. &quot; Washington Post editor and later press critic Ben Bagdikian said, &quot; When Seldes was no longer printed by the mainstream press, he was an important conduit to the journalistic community, who knew that there were flaws in the system, but often couldn&apos;t get printed in their own newspapers, because the press cannot be a watchdog on itself. So they fed stories critical of the press to Seldes. &quot; At the height of its popularity it had a circulation of 176,000. One of the first articles published in the newsletter concerned the dangers of cigarette smoking. [ George Seldes Is Dead at 104; An Early, Fervent Press Critic Dicke William http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/03/obituaries/george-seldes-is-dead-at-104-an-early-fervent-press-critic.html The New York Times July 3, 1995 January 11, 2011 ] Seldes later explained that at the time, &quot; The tobacco stories were suppressed by every major newspaper. For ten years we pounded on tobacco as being one of the only legal poisons you could buy in America. &quot; At a time when tobacco companies were major advertisers, Seldes discussed the contents of a study called, &quot; Tobacco Smoking and Longevity &quot;, which he said had been suppressed since 1939. Throughout the 10-year run of In fact, Seldes published more than 50 stories on the health effects of tobacco, and the cigarette industry&apos;s attempts and suppressing such news. Among the favorite targets of In Fact was the National Association of Manufacturers. Defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg, who subscribed to In Fact while an undergrad at Harvard, said, &quot; I heard about the National Association of Manufacturers first from Seldes and more from Seldes than I ever heard again. If you were to read the mainstream press, you&apos;d hardly become aware that such organizations existed, that businessmen worked together to pursue their own interests. &quot; In fact also attacked Charles Lindbergh for his Nazi sympathies, the American Legion for helping to break strikes, and labeled many captains of industry as &quot; native fascists. &quot; Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said, &quot; [Seldes] used the word fascism to reflect an authoritarian state of mind that tended to stifle free speech and dissent and also tended to believe that might was right. &quot; [ September 2011 ] In Fact immediately attracted the attention of government authorities. President Roosevelt ordered an FBI investigation of Seldes and In Fact in 1940. [ O&apos;Reilly Kenneth 1982 A New Deal for the FBI: The Roosevelt Administration, Crime Control, and National Security Journal of American History 69 649 ] Articles claiming that the FBI was infiltrating unions and monitoring union activities resulted in FBI surveillance of Seldes and his publication. J. Edgar Hoover sent Seldes a 15-page letter denying such FBI activities. [ Lasar Matthew 1998 &apos;Right Out in Public&apos;: Pacifica Radio, the Cold War, and the Political Origins of Alternative Media Pacific Historical Review 67 537 ] The FBI subsequently questioned In Fact subscribers, particularly servicemen and -women, and had US postal officials reporting to the FBI on Seldes&apos; mail correspondence. In Fact lost many of its subscribers in the late 1940s. Seldes later claimed that his critical coverage of Yugoslavia got the publication banned from Communist Party bookstores. The political climate discouraged subscriptions on the part of less ideologically committed readers as well. [ Lasar Matthew 1998 &apos;Right Out in Public&apos;: Pacifica Radio, the Cold War, and the Political Origins of Alternative Media Pacific Historical Review 67 537 537–8 ] In Fact ceased publication in 1950. I. F. Stone&apos;s Weekly, which started publication in 1953, took In Fact as its model. In addition to writing his newsletter, Seldes continued to publish books. These included Facts and Fascism (1943) and One Thousand Americans (1947), an account of the people who controlled America. Time called One Thousand Americans &quot; a collection of truths, half-truths and untruths about the U.S. press and industry. &quot; [ The Press: The Beaver&apos;s World http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C798474-2%2C00.html TIME April 26, 1948 January 11, 2011 ] One Thousand Americans introduced a wide audience to the conspiracy theory known as the Business Plot, a supposed plan of America&apos;s corporate elite to overthrow the U.S. government in the early 1930s.

He makes too much of the failure of newspapers to print exactly what George Seldes would have printed if he were the managing editor. But he is a useful citizen. In fact is a fine little gadfly, representing an enormous effort for one man and his wife. &quot;. But a whole generation of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy said, &quot; He was a reporter who didn&apos;t worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write.
