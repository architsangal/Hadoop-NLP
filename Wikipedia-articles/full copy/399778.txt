[ Henry Brown ] { lithograph by } { Samuel Rowse published in 1850&apos;&apos; } Henry &quot; Box &quot; Brown ( 1815 –after 1889) [ Spenser, S. http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Brown_Henry_Box_ca_1815 Henry Box Brown (1815 or 1816–after February 26, 1889) Dictionary of Virginia Biography) 01 January 2012 17 May 2012 ] was a 19th century Virginia slave who escaped to freedom by arranging to have himself mailed to Philadelphia abolitionists in a wooden crate. For a short time he became a noted abolitionist speaker and later a showman, but later lost the support of the abolitionist community, notably Frederick Douglass, who wished Brown had kept quiet about his escape so that more slaves could have escaped using similar means. [ Biography ] Born into slavery in 1815 or 1816 in Louisa County, Virginia, Brown was sent to Richmond in 1830 to work in a tobacco factory. There, he married another slave, Nancy, and the couple had three children. Brown used his wages to pay Nancy&apos;s master for the time she spent caring for them. However, in 1848, his wife and children were sold to a slave trader and sent to North Carolina. Brown claimed that he was powerless to prevent this. { Hollis Robbins, &quot; Fugutive Mail: The Deliverance of Henry Box Brown. &quot; American Studies, 50:1/2 (Spring/Summer 2009): 5-30 } { Ruggles, Jeffrey, The Unboxing of Henry Brown. Library of Virginia, 2003 } With the help of James C. A. Smith and a sympathetic white storekeeper named Samuel Smith (no relation), Brown devised a plan to have himself shipped to a free state by Adams Express Co. Brown paid $86 (out of his savings of $166) to Smith, who contacted Philadelphia abolitionist James Miller McKim, who agreed to receive the box. Brown burned his hand with oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) as an excuse for missing work. During the trip, which began on March 23, 1849, Brown&apos;s box traveled by wagon, railroad, steamboat, wagon again, railroad, ferry, railroad, and finally delivery wagon. Several times during the 27-hour journey, carriers placed the box upside-down or handled it roughly, but Brown was able to remain still enough to avoid detection. The box containing Brown was received by McKim, William Still, and other members of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee. When Brown was released, one of those present remembered his first words as &quot; How do you do, gentlemen? &quot; He then sang a psalm from the Bible he had previously selected for his moment of freedom. { Brown, Henry, Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, (Revised version with introduction by Richard Newman, foreword by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.) } Brown became a well-known speaker for the Anti-Slavery Society. He was bestowed the nickname of &quot; Box &quot; at a Boston antislavery convention in May 1849, and thereafter used the name Henry Box Brown. He published two versions of his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown; first in Boston in 1849 and the second in Manchester, England in 1851. Brown exhibited a moving panorama titled &quot; Mirror of Slavery &quot; in the northeastern United States until he was forced to move to England after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Brown toured Britain with his antislavery panorama for the next 10 years, performing several hundred times a year and visiting virtually every town and city over that period. Brown stayed on the British show circuit for twenty-five years, until 1875. In the 1860s, he began performing as a mesmerist, and some time after that as a conjuror, under the show names Prof. H. Box Brown and the African Prince. Leaving his first wife and children in slavery (though he had the means to purchase their freedom), he married a second time to a white British woman, and began a new family. In 1875, he returned to the U.S. with a family magic act. There is also a later report of the Brown Family Jubilee Singers. The cause and date of his death are unknown. The last record of Brown is a newspaper report of a performance by Brown at Brantford, Ontario, Canada. [ Legacy ] The Resurrection of Henry Box Brown at Philadelphia, a lithograph by Samuel Rowse, depicted Henry Brown emerging from the shipping box into freedom in Philadelphia. The lithograph was published to help raise funds to produce Brown&apos;s anti-slavery panorama. One of only three known originals is preserved in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond. [ August 2010 ] There is a monument to Henry &quot; Box &quot; Brown along the Canal Walk in downtown Richmond, Virginia in the form of a metal reproduction of the box in which Brown escaped. In 2005, Brown was the subject of a Tony Kushner play entitled Henry Box Brown. { A Tony Kushner Debut, Courtesy of NYU - NYTimes.com } Thomas Bradshaw&apos;s play &quot; Southern Promises &quot;, produced at P.S. 122 in New York City in 2008, features a character inspired by Brown. Ellen Levine wrote a children&apos;s picture book entitled Henry&apos;s Freedom Box based upon Brown&apos;s life. The book, published in 2007, was illustrated by Kadir Nelson and was awarded the Caldecott Honor. { Caldecott Medal &amp; Honor Books, 1938-Present | Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) } A historical fiction book on Henry Brown was published in 2011 called The Disappearing Man, written by Doug Peterson. A biography of Henry Box Brown was published in 2003, The Unboxing of Henry Brown, by Jeffrey Ruggles. Another children&apos;s picture book, Freedom Song: The Story of Henry &quot; Box &quot; Brown, written by Sally M. Parker and illustrated by Sean Qualls, was published in 2012. { News from Sean Qualls: Another *Starred Review (BCCB) for Freedom Song } In 2012, Louisa County set a historical marker honoring Henry Box Brown and his escape from slavery. { Historical Marker Honors Local Man Who Escaped Slavery } [ References ] [ External links ] Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself.
