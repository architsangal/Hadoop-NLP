Although he is best known for discovering the dwarf planet Pluto in 1930, the first object to be discovered in what would later be identified as the Kuiper Belt, Tombaugh also discovered many asteroid s; he also called for serious scientific research of unidentified flying object s. [ Biography ] Tombaugh was born in Streator, Illinois. [ Tombaugh Clyde Patrick Moore Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto Stackpole Books 1980 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17 0-8117-1163-3 ] { &quot; I was born on a farm near Streator, Illinois, on 4 February 1906. &quot; } After his family moved to Burdett, Kansas, Tombaugh&apos;s plans for attending college were frustrated when a hail storm ruined their crops.

He sent drawings of Jupiter and Mars, as well as his telescopes to the Lowell Observatory. These resulted in a job offer. Tombaugh was employed at the Lowell Observatory from 1929 to 1945. Following his discovery of Pluto, Tombaugh earned bachelor&apos;s and master&apos;s degrees in astronomy from the University of Kansas in 1936 and 1938. During World War II he taught naval personnel navigation at Northern Arizona University. He worked at White Sands Missile Range in the early 1950s, and taught astronomy at New Mexico State University from 1955 until his retirement in 1973. He died in Las Cruces, New Mexico in 1997, aged 90. He was survived by his widow, Patricia and their children: daughter Annette and son Alden.

He discovered hundreds of asteroids, beginning with 2839 Annette in 1929, mostly as a by-product of his search for Pluto and his searches for other celestial objects. Tombaugh named some of them after his wife, children and grandchildren. The Royal Astronomical Society awarded him the Jackson-Gwilt Medal in 1931. [ October 2010 ] [ Death ] Tombaugh died in 1997 in Las Cruces, New Mexico at the age of 90. Approximately one ounce of his ashes is being carried on the New Horizons spacecraft, launched in 2006 for a flyby of Pluto in 2015.

Tombaugh used the observatory&apos;s 13-inch astrograph to take photographs of the same section of sky several nights apart. He then used a blink comparator to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930, using images taken the previous month. { Kansas State Historical Society portrait } The name &quot; Pluto &quot; was reportedly suggested by Venetia Burney, then an 11-year-old English school girl, who died in April 2009, having lived to see the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. It won out over numerous other suggestions because it was the name of the Roman god of the underworld, who was able to render himself invisible, and because Percival Lowell &apos;s initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930. { Pluto at } { apparent magnitude +15.4 } Following the discovery, starting in the 1990s, of other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto began to be seen not as a planet orbiting alone at 40 AU, but as the largest of a group of icy bodies in that region of space. After it was shown that at least one such body was larger than Pluto, on August 24, 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto, grouping it with two similarly sized &quot; dwarf planet s &quot; rather than with the eight &quot; classical planets &quot;. Tombaugh&apos;s widow Patricia stated after the IAU&apos;s decision that while Clyde may have been disappointed with the change since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto&apos;s planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he &quot; was a scientist. He would understand they had a real problem when they start finding several of these things flying around the place. &quot; [ Associated Press Associated Press Pluto Discoverer Saw It Coming, Says His Widow CTV 2006-08-25 http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060825/pluto_discoverer_widow_060825/20060825?hub%3DSciTech 2007-02-28 ] [ Further search ] Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, and the lack of further discoveries left him satisfied that no other object of a comparable apparent magnitude existed near the ecliptic. No more trans-Neptunian objects were discovered until [ (15760) 1992 QB 1 ], in 1992. However, more recently the relatively bright object [ Makemake ] has been discovered. It has a relatively high orbital inclination, but at the time of Tombaugh&apos;s discovery of Pluto, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic near the border of Taurus and Auriga { based on Minor Planet Center online Minor Planet Ephemeris Service: March 1, 1930: RA: 05h51m, Dec: +29.0 } at an apparent magnitude of 16.

On August 20, 1949, Tombaugh saw several unidentified objects near Las Cruces, New Mexico. He described them as six to eight rectangular lights, stating: &quot; I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, because... nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since... I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with astonishment. &quot; [ Clyde Tombaugh, Ph.D. UFO Evidence http://www.etcontact.net/researchers/detail107.htm 2007-02-28 ] [ May 2012 ] Tombaugh observed these rectangles of light for about 3 seconds and his wife saw them for about 1½ seconds. He never supported the interpretation as a spaceship that has often been attributed to him. He considered other possibilities, with a temperature inversion as the most likely cause. { The World of Flying Saucers: A scientific examination of a major myth of the space age, by } { Donald H. Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd, 1963, Doubleday, pp. 266-70. } From my own studies of the solar system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on other planets, not even for Mars... The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the nearer stars is staggering. In consideration of the hundreds of millions of years in the geologic time scale when such visits may have possibly occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event. A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in reflective index, as in an inversion layer. I have never seen anything like it before or since, and I have spent a lot of time where the night sky could be seen well. This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation. Another sighting by Tombaugh a year or two later while at a White Sands observatory was of an object of &amp; minus;6 magnitude, four times brighter than Venus at its brightest, going from the zenith to the southern horizon in about 3 seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as in Tombaugh&apos;s first sighting. [ Steiger Brad Project Blue Book Ballantine Books 1976 280 0-345-34525-8 ] Tombaugh later reported having seen three of the mysterious green fireballs, which suddenly appeared over New Mexico in late 1948 and continued at least through the early 1950s. Despite this, the final report of Project Twinkle — see external link — claimed that he &quot;... never observed an unexplainable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky. &quot; [ October 2010 ] In 1956 Tombaugh had the following to say about his various sightings: &quot; I have seen three objects in the last seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomenon, such as Venus, atmospheric optic, meteors or planes. I am a professional, highly skilled, professional astronomer. In addition I have seen three green fireballs which were unusual in behavior from normal green fireballs... I think that several reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of extraterrestrial origin and nature. &quot; [ Ledger Don UFO UpDates 2004-09-20 http://virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2004/sep/m20-022.shtml 2007-02-28 http://web.archive.org/web/20070210090352/http%3A//virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2004/sep/m20-022.shtml 2007-02-10 ] [ May 2012 ] Shortly after this in January 1957, in an Associated Press article in the Alamogordo Daily News titled &quot; Celestial Visitors May Be Invading Earth&apos;s Atmosphere, &quot; Tombaugh was again quoted on his sightings and opinion about them. &quot; Although our own solar system is believed to support no other life than on Earth, other stars in the galaxy may have hundreds of thousands of habitable worlds. Races on these worlds may have been able to utilize the tremendous amounts of power required to bridge the space between the stars... &quot; Tombaugh stated that he had observed celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but has seen none personally since 1951 or 1952. &quot; These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed. Their apparent lack of obedience to the ordinary laws of celestial motion gives credence. &quot; [ Clark Jerry UFO Encyclopedia: Volume 2 1997 896 ] In 1949, Tombaugh had also told the Naval missile director at White Sands Missile Range, Commander Robert McLaughlin, that he had seen a bright flash on Mars in August 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast. [ McLaughlin Robert Letter from Robert McLaughlin to James Van Allen Roswell Proof 1949-05-12 http://www.roswellproof.com/McLaughlin_Van_Allen_letter.html 2007-02-28 ] Tombaugh also noted that the first atomic bomb tested in New Mexico would have lit up the dark side of the Earth like a neon sign and that Mars was coincidentally quite close at the time, the implication apparently being that the atomic test would have been visible from Mars. In June 1952, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer acting as a scientific consultant to the Air Force&apos;s Project Blue Book UFO study, secretly conducted a survey of fellow astronomers on UFO sightings and attitudes while attending an astronomy convention. Tombaugh and four other astronomers, including Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico, told Hynek about their sightings. Tombaugh also told Hynek that his telescopes were at the Air Force&apos;s disposal for taking photos of UFOs, if he was properly alerted. [ Steiger Brad Project Blue Book Ballantine Books 1976 268–85 0-345-34525-8 ] [ Near-Earth satellite search ] { Lincoln LaPaz (right), March 3, 1954. Photo from &apos;&apos;The Albuquerque Journal&apos;&apos; } Tombaugh&apos;s offer may have led to his involvement in a search for near-Earth satellite s, first announced in late 1953 and sponsored by the Army Office of Ordnance Research. Another public statement was made on the search in March 1954 (photo at right), emphasizing the rationale that such an orbiting object would serve as a natural space station. [ Armed Forces Seeks &quot; Steppingstone to Stars &quot; Los Angeles Times 1954-03-04 http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_LATimes_SciNL_1954.html ] However, according to Donald Keyhoe, later director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth orbiting objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in the summer of 1953, according to his Pentagon source. By May 1954, Keyhoe was making public statements that his sources told him the search had indeed been successful, and either one or two objects had been found. [ 1 or 2 Artificial Satellites Circling Earth, Says Expert San Francisco Examiner 14 1954-05-14 http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_Keyhoe_May1954.html ] However, the story did not break until August 23, 1954, when Aviation Week magazine stated that two satellites had been found only 400 and 600 miles out. They were termed &quot; natural satellites &quot; and implied that they had been recently captured, despite this being a virtual impossibility. The next day, the story was in many major newspapers. Dr. LaPaz was implicated in the discovery in addition to Tombaugh. LaPaz had earlier conducted secret investigations on behalf of the Air Force on the green fireballs and other unidentified aerial phenomena over New Mexico. LaPaz vehemently denied his involvement in the search, although the New York Times reported on August 29 that a source close to the project said that the story was true and LaPaz was indeed involved, in fact had been the one to spot and identify the objects as natural rather than artificial satellites. The same source denied the search had anything to do with flying saucers. [ Earth &apos;Satellites&apos; Spur Army Study New York Times 35 1954-08-29 http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_NYTIMES_1954.html ] However, both LaPaz and Tombaugh were to issue public denials that anything had been found. The October 1955 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine reported: &quot; Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won&apos;t say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered. He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers. &quot; [ Stimson, Jr. Thomas E. He Spies on Satellites Popular Mechanics 106 October 1955 http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_PopMech_Oct55.html ] At a meteor conference in Los Angeles in 1957, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for &quot; natural satellites &quot; had been unsuccessful. [ Los Angeles Times 1957-09-04 ] In 1959, Tombaugh was to issue a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search. His personal 16-inch telescope was reassembled and dedicated on September 17, 2009 at Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico (near Animas, New Mexico, adjacent to Astronomy &apos;s new observatory.
