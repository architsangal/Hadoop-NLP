The initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes the acute (short-lived) illness chickenpox which generally occurs in children and young people. Once an episode of chickenpox has resolved, the virus is not eliminated from the body but can go on to cause shingles—an illness with very different symptoms—often many years after the initial infection. Herpes zoster is not the same disease as herpes simplex despite the name similarity (both the varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus belong to the same viral subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae ). Varicella zoster virus can become latent in the nerve cell bodies and less frequently in non-neuronal satellite cells of dorsal root, cranial nerve or autonomic ganglion, without causing any symptoms. Years or decades after a chickenpox infection, the virus may break out of nerve cell bodies and travel down nerve axon s to cause viral infection of the skin in the region of the nerve. The virus may spread from one or more ganglia along nerves of an affected segment and infect the corresponding dermatome (an area of skin supplied by one spinal nerve) causing a painful rash. [ Peterslund NA Herpesvirus infection: an overview of the clinical manifestations Scand J Infect Dis Suppl 80 15–20 1991 1666443 ] Although the rash usually heals within two to four weeks, some sufferers experience residual nerve pain for months or years, a condition called postherpetic neuralgia. Exactly how the virus remains latent in the body, and subsequently re-activates is not understood. Throughout the world the incidence rate of herpes zoster every year ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 cases per 1,000 healthy individuals, increasing to 3.9–11.8 per year per 1,000 individuals among those older than 65 years. Over a lifetime, a large fraction of people develop herpes zoster, though usually only once – in a 1960s US study, 50% of individuals living to age 85 had at least one attack, while 1% had at least two attacks. Antiviral drug treatment can reduce the severity and duration of herpes zoster if a seven-to-ten day course of these drugs is started within 72 hours of the appearance of the characteristic rash.

The pain and rash most commonly occurs on the torso, but can appear on the face, eyes or other parts of the body. At first the rash appears similar to the first appearance of hives; however, unlike hives, herpes zoster causes skin changes limited to a dermatome, normally resulting in a stripe or belt-like pattern that is limited to one side of the body and does not cross the midline. [ Zoster sine herpete ] Zoster sine herpete ( &quot; zoster without herpes &quot; ) describes a patient who has all of the symptoms of herpes zoster except this characteristic rash.

The painful vesicles eventually become cloudy or darkened as they fill with blood, crust over within seven to ten days; usually the crusts fall off and the skin heals, but sometimes, after severe blistering, scarring and discolored skin remain.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus involves the orbit of the eye and occurs in approximately 10–25% of cases. It is caused by the virus reactivating in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. In a few patients, symptoms may include conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and optic nerve palsies that can sometimes cause chronic ocular inflammation, loss of vision, and debilitating pain. [ Shaikh S, Ta CN Evaluation and management of herpes zoster ophthalmicus Am Fam Physician 2002 66 9 1723–1730 12449270 http://www.aafp.org/afp/20021101/1723.html ] Herpes zoster oticus, also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II, involves the ear. It is thought to result from the virus spreading from the facial nerve to the vestibulocochlear nerve. Symptoms include hearing loss and vertigo (rotational dizziness). [ Pathophysiology ] { lymph, break open (3), crust over (4), and finally disappear. } { Postherpetic neuralgia can sometimes occur due to nerve damage (5), } { thumb } The causative agent for herpes zoster is varicella zoster virus (VZV), a double-stranded DNA virus related to the Herpes simplex virus group. Most people are infected with this virus as children, and suffer from an episode of chickenpox. The immune system eventually eliminates the virus from most locations, but it remains dormant (or latent ) in the ganglia adjacent to the spinal cord (called the dorsal root ganglion ) or the ganglion semilunare (ganglion Gasseri) in the base of the skull. [ Steiner I, Kennedy PG, Pachner AR The neurotropic herpes viruses: herpes simplex and varicella-zoster Lancet Neurol 6 11 1015–28 2007 17945155 10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70267-3 ] Repeated attacks of herpes zoster are rare, and it is extremely rare for patients to suffer more than three recurrences. Herpes zoster occurs only in people who have been previously infected with VZV; although it can occur at any age, approximately half of the cases in the USA occur in those aged 50 years or older. [ Weinberg JM Herpes zoster: epidemiology, natural history, and common complications J Am Acad Dermatol 57 6 Suppl S130–5 2007 18021864 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.08.046 ] The disease results from the virus reactivating in a single sensory ganglion.

The virus has not been recovered from human nerve cells by cell culture and the location and structure of the viral DNA is not known. Virus-specific proteins continue to be made by the infected cells during the latent period, so true latency, as opposed to a chronic low-level infection, has not been proven.

Unless the immune system is compromised, it suppresses reactivation of the virus and prevents herpes zoster. Why this suppression sometimes fails is poorly understood, [ Donahue JG, Choo PW, Manson JE, Platt R The incidence of herpes zoster Arch. Intern. Med 155 15 1605–9 1995 7618983 10.1001/archinte.155.15.1605 ] but herpes zoster is more likely to occur in people whose immune system is impaired due to aging, immunosuppressive therapy, psychological stress, or other factors.

Lancet Infect Dis 4 1 26–33 2004 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00857-0 14720565 ] Upon reactivation, the virus replicates in the nerve cells, and virion s are shed from the cells and carried down the axon s to the area of skin served by that ganglion. In the skin, the virus causes local inflammation and blisters. The short- and long-term pain caused by herpes zoster comes from the widespread growth of the virus in the infected nerves, which causes inflammation. [ Schmader K Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults Clin. Geriatr.

This newly infected individual may then develop chickenpox, but will not immediately develop shingles. Until the rash has developed crusts, a person is extremely contagious. A person is also not infectious before blisters appear, or during postherpetic neuralgia (pain after the rash is gone). [ Diagnosis ] Herpes zoster on the chest If the rash has appeared, identifying this disease (making a differential diagnosis ) requires only a visual examination, since very few diseases produce a rash in a dermatomal pattern (see map). However, herpes simplex virus (HSV) can occasionally produce a rash in such a pattern. The Tsanck smear is helpful for diagnosing acute infection with a herpes virus, but does not distinguish between HSV and VZV. [ Oranje AP, Folkers E The Tzanck smear: old, but still of inestimable value Pediatr Dermatol 5 2 127–9 1988 2842739 10.1111/j.1525-1470.1988.tb01154.x ] When the rash is absent (early or late in the disease, or in the case of zoster sine herpete), herpes zoster can be difficult to diagnose.

Laboratory test s are available to diagnose herpes zoster. The most popular test detects VZV-specific IgM antibody in blood; this appears only during chickenpox or herpes zoster and not while the virus is dormant. [ Arvin AM Varicella-zoster virus Clin.

In this comparison, viral culture detected VZV with only a 14.3% sensitivity, although the test was highly specific (specificity=100%). By comparison, real-time PCR resulted in 100% sensitivity and specificity. Overall testing for herpes simplex and herpes zoster using PCR showed a 60.4% improvement over viral culture.

The rationale is that until the entire population could be immunized, adults who have previously contracted VZV would instead derive benefit from occasional exposure to VZV (from children), which serves as a booster to their immunity to the virus, and may reduce the risk of shingles later on in life.

Topical lotions containing calamine can be used on the rash or blisters and may be soothing. Occasionally, severe pain may require an opioid medication, such as morphine.

[ Antivirals ] Antiviral drugs inhibit VZV replication and reduce the severity and duration of herpes zoster with minimal side effects, but do not reliably prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Of these drugs, acyclovir has been the standard treatment, but the new drugs valaciclovir and famciclovir demonstrate similar or superior efficacy and good safety and tolerability. The drugs are used both as prophylaxis (for example in AIDS patients) and as therapy during the acute phase.

Nevertheless, one trial studying immunocompetent patients older than 50 years of age with localized herpes zoster, suggested that administration of prednisone with aciclovir improved healing time and quality of life.

Med. 125 5 376–83 1996 8702088 ] Upon one-month evaluation, aciclovir with prednisone increased the likelihood of crusting and healing of lesions by about twofold, when compared to placebo. This trial also evaluated the effects of this drug combination on quality of life at one month, showing that patients had less pain, and were more likely to stop the use of analgesic agents, return to usual activities and have uninterrupted sleep. However, when comparing cessation of herpes zoster-associated pain or post herpetic neuralgia, there was no difference between aciclovir plus prednisone and simply aciclovir alone. Because of the risks of corticosteroid treatment, it is recommended that this combination of drugs only be used in people more than 50 years of age, due to their greater risk of postherpetic neuralgia. [ Herpes zoster ophthalmicus ] Herpes zoster ophthalmicus Trigeminal herpes zoster with uveitis and keratitis Treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus is similar to standard treatment for herpes zoster at other sites.

In some patients, herpes zoster can reactivate presenting as zoster sine herpete: pain radiating along the path of a single spinal nerve (a dermatomal distribution), but without an accompanying rash. This condition may involve complications that affect several levels of the nervous system and cause many cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, or aseptic meningitis. Other serious effects that may occur in some cases include partial facial paralysis (usually temporary), ear damage, or encephalitis. During pregnancy, first infections with VZV, causing chickenpox, may lead to infection of the fetus and complications in the newborn, but chronic infection or reactivation in shingles are not associated with fetal infection.

Herpes zoster has no relationship to season and does not occur in epidemics. There is, however, a strong relationship with increasing age. The incidence rate of herpes zoster ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 per 1,000 person-years among healthy individuals, increasing to 3.9–11.8 per 1,000 person‐years among those older than 65 years, and incidence rates worldwide are similar.

Another important risk factor is immunocompromise : HIV is an important example of immune compromise [ Colebunders R, Mann JM, Francis H, et al.

Other potential risk factors include mechanical trauma and exposure to immunotoxin s. There is no strong evidence for a genetic link or a link to family history. A 2008 study showed that people with close relatives who have had shingles are twice as likely to develop it themselves, [ Hicks LD, Cook-Norris RH, Mendoza N, Madkan V, Arora A, Tyring SK Family history as a risk factor for herpes zoster: a case-control study Arch Dermatol 144 5 603–8 2008 May 18490586 10.1001/archderm.144.5.603 ] but a 2010 study found no such link. Adults with latent VZV infection who are exposed intermittently to children with chickenpox receive an immune boost. This periodic boost to the immune system helps to prevent shingles in older adults. When routine chickenpox vaccination was introduced in the US, the concern was that because older adults would no longer receive this natural, periodic boost, this would result in an increase in the incidence of shingles in the US. Multiple studies and surveillance data, at least when viewed superficially, demonstrate no consistent trends in incidence in the U.S. since the chickenpox vaccination program began in 1995.

Clements KM, Seward JF 15960856 10.1186/1471-2458-5-68 1177968 ] The results of a further study by Yawn et al. showed a 28% increase in shingles incidence from 1996 to 2001.

In one study, it was estimated that 26% of patients who contract herpes zoster eventually present with complications. Postherpetic neuralgia arises in approximately 20% of patients.

It was only in the late eighteenth century that William Heberden established a way to differentiate between herpes zoster and smallpox, [ Weller TH 2000 Chapter 1. Historical perspective Varicella-Zoster Virus: Virology and Clinical Management Arvin AM, Gershon AA Cambridge University Press 0-521-66024-6 ] and only in the late nineteenth century that herpes zoster was differentiated from erysipelas. In 1831, Richard Bright hypothesized that the disease arose from the dorsal root ganglion, and this was confirmed in an 1861 paper by Felix von Bärunsprung. [ Oaklander AL The pathology of shingles: Head and Campbell&apos;s 1900 monograph Arch. Neurol. 56 10 1292–4 1999 October 10520948 10.1001/archneur.56.10.1292 ] The first indications that chickenpox and herpes zoster were caused by the same virus were noticed at the beginning of the 20th century. Physicians began to report that cases of herpes zoster were often followed by chickenpox in the younger people who lived with the shingles patients. The idea of an association between the two diseases gained strength when it was shown that lymph from a sufferer of herpes zoster could induce chickenpox in young volunteers. This was finally proved by the first isolation of the virus in cell cultures, by the Nobel laureate Thomas Huckle Weller, in 1953. [ Weller TH Serial propagation in vitro of agents producing inclusion bodies derived from varicella and herpes zoster Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 83 2 340–6 1953 13064265 ] Until the 1940s, the disease was considered benign, and serious complications were thought to be very rare. [ Holt LE, McIntosh R Holt&apos;s Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 1936 D Appleton Century Company 931–3 ] However, by 1942, it was recognized that herpes zoster was a more serious disease in adults than in children, and that it increased in frequency with advancing age. Further studies during the 1950s on immunosuppressed individuals showed that the disease was not as benign as once thought, and the search for various therapeutic and preventive measures began. [ Weller TH Varicella-herpes zoster virus Viral Infections of Humans: Epidemiology and Control Evans AS, Kaslow RA Plenum Press 1997 865–92 978-0-306-44855-3 ] By the mid-1960s, several studies identified the gradual reduction in cellular immunity in old age, observing that in a cohort of 1,000 people who lived to the age of 85, approximately 500 (i.e., 50%) would have at least one attack of herpes zoster, and 10 (i.e., 1%) would have at least two attacks. [ Hope-Simpson RE 1965 The nature of herpes zoster; a long-term study and a new hypothesis Proc R Soc Med 58 9–20 14267505 1898279 1 ] In historical shingles studies, shingles incidence generally increased with age. However, in his 1965 paper, Dr. Hope-Simpson was first to suggest, “The peculiar age distribution of zoster may in part reflect the frequency with which the different age groups encounter cases of varicella and because of the ensuing boost to their antibody protection have their attacks of zoster postponed.” Lending support to this hypothesis that contact with children with chickenpox boosts adult cell-mediated immunity to help postpone or suppress shingles, is the study by Thomas et al., which reported that adults in households with children had lower rates of shingles than households without children. [ Thomas SL, Wheeler JG, Hall AJ 2002 Contacts with varicella or with children and protection against herpes zoster in adults: a case-control study Lancet 360 678–682 12241874 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09837-9 9334 ] Also, the study by Terada et al. indicated that pediatricians reflected incidence rates from 1/2 to 1/8 that of the general population their age.
