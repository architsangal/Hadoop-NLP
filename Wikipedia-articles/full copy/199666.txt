RAM supported for PC-2100 ( DDR -266) or PC-2700 ( DDR -333) SO-DIMM. Processors - Socket 479 an Intel Pentium M (codenamed Banias ) processor with a 400 MT/s FSB, or an Intel Pentium M (codenamed Dothan ) processor with a 400 MT/s FSB (after May 2004). Centrino Carmel platform Mobile chipset Mobile processor Wireless network an Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 B (codenamed Calexico) or later 2200 BG mini-PCI Wi-Fi adapter (codenamed Calexico2). Industry-watchers initially criticized the Carmel platform for its lack of an IEEE 802.11 g -solution, because many independent Wi-Fi chip-makers like Broadcom and Atheros had already started shipping 802.11g products. Intel responded that the IEEE had not finalized the 802.11g standard at the time of Carmel&apos;s launch, and that it only wanted to launch products based on a finalized standard.In early 2004, after the finalization of the 802.11g standard, Intel permitted an Intel PRO/Wireless 2200 BG to substitute for the 2100. At the same time, they permitted the new Dothan Pentium M to substitute for the Banias Pentium M. Initially, Intel permitted only the 855GM chipset, which did not support external graphics. Later, Intel allowed the 855GME and 855PM chips, which did support external graphics, in Centrino laptop s. Despite criticisms, the Carmel platform won quick acceptance among OEMs and consumers. Carmel could attain or exceed the performance of older Pentium 4-M platforms, while allowing for laptops to operate for 4 to 5 hours on a 48 W-h battery. Carmel also allowed laptop manufacturers to create thinner and lighter laptops because its components did not dissipate much heat, and thus did not require large cooling systems. [ Sonoma platform (2005) ] Intel used Sonoma as the codename for the second-generation Centrino platform, introduced in January 2005. an Intel Mobile 915 Express series chipset (codenamed Alviso with Intel GMA 900 ), including ICH6M southbridge. RAM supported for PC2-4200 ( DDR2 -533) SO-DIMM. Processors - Socket 479 an Intel Pentium M (codenamed Dothan ) processor with a 533 MT/s FSB. Centrino Sonoma platform Mobile chipset Mobile processor Wireless network an Intel PRO/Wireless 2200 BG or 2915 ABG mini-PCI Wi-Fi adapter (both codenamed Calexico2). The Mobile 915 Express chipset, like its desktop version, supports many new features such as DDR2, PCI Express, Intel High Definition Audio, and SATA. Unfortunately, the introduction of PCI Express and faster Pentium M processors causes laptops built around the Sonoma platform to have a shorter battery-life than their Carmel counterparts; Sonoma laptops typically achieve between 3.5–4.6 hours of battery-life on a 53 W-h battery. [ Napa platform (2006) ] The codename Napa designates the third-generation Centrino platform, introduced in January 2006 at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show. The platform initially supported Intel Core Duo processors but the newer Core 2 Duo processors were launched and supported in this platform from July 27, 2006 onwards. an Intel Mobile 945 Express series chipset (codenamed Calistoga with Intel GMA 950 ), including ICH7M southbridge. RAM supported for PC2-4200 ( DDR2 -533) and PC2-5300 ( DDR2 -667) SO-DIMM. Processors - Socket M / Micro-FCBGA an Intel Core Solo, Core Duo (codenamed Yonah ) processor, or an Intel Core 2 Duo (codenamed Merom ) processor with a 667 MT/s FSB for Napa Refresh platform, or an Intel Core 2 Solo (codenamed Merom) processor with 533 MT/s FSB for Napa Refresh platform (Sept 2007). an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 ABG mini-PCIe Wi-Fi adapter (codenamed Golan). Some newer models (as of 1st quarter 2007) of the Napa Refresh platform contain the newer 4965AGN (a/b/g/draft-n) wireless cards. Centrino Napa platform Mobile chipset Mobile processor Wireless network Intel uses Centrino Duo branding for laptops with dual- core Core Duo processors and retains the Centrino name for laptops with single core ( Core Solo ) processors.
