The Bahá&apos;í Faith consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God, who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Judaism considers Jesus to have been simply a man and not the Messiah. Other world religions such as Buddhism have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. [ Christianity ] [ Jesus in Christianity Christology ] [ Ministry of Jesus Parables of Jesus Miracles of Jesus Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament ] [ collapsed ] Christian views of Jesus are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the Canonical gospels, New Testament letters, the Christian creeds, as well as specific denominational teachings. These outline the key beliefs held by Christian about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life. Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah or Christ. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament. { One teacher: Jesus&apos; teaching role in Matthew&apos;s gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 ISBN 3-11-018151-7 pages 240-241 } Christian consider Jesus the Christ and believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life. { Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649 } These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an &quot; agent and servant of God &quot;. { The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199-200 } { The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79 } The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam &apos;s disobedience. { Systematic Theology, Volume 2 by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303 } Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate, God the Son, and &quot; true God and true man &quot; (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the Bible, God raised him from the dead.

[ Islam ] [ Jesus in Islam ] [ section October 2011 ] In Islam, Jesus is known as Isa and is one of God&apos;s highest-ranked and most-beloved prophets, specifically sent to guide the Children of Israel. Unlike Christian writings, the Qur&apos;an does not describe Jesus as the son of God, but as one of five major human messengers (out of many prophets ) sent by God throughout history to guide mankind. It also states that Jesus&apos; message to mankind was originally very similar to that of the other Islamic prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, but that it was subsequently distorted by early Christians. Jesus is said to have lived a life of piety and generosity, and abstained from eating flesh of swine (or of any animals, according to some Muslim authors, even some who were not vegetarians themselves). In the Muslim tradition, Jesus did not drink alcohol. Muslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the Injeel and corresponding to the Christian New Testament. However, Muslims hold that the New Testament has been changed over time (as they also believe of the Old Testament) and does not accurately represent God&apos;s original message to mankind. However, the Qur&apos;an and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus&apos; life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary ( Maryam in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever. The Qur&apos;an also specifies that Jesus was able to perform miracle s —though only by the will of God —including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers. One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Qur&apos;an, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of adultery. The Qur&apos;an also says that Jesus was a &apos;word&apos; from God, since he was predicted to come in the Old Testament. Most Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. The Qur&apos;an narrates that God made it appear so that Jesus was crucified to his enemies but he was not, and lived. According to Islam, Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually Judas Iscariot who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in heaven and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the Antichrist, once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life. [ Judaism ] [ Judaism&apos;s view of Jesus ] Judaism rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the Messiah, arguing that he had not fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after Malachi, who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE. { Simmons, Shraga, &quot; Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus &quot;, Retrieved April 15, 2007; &quot; Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus &quot;, } { Ohr Samayach  — Ask the Rabbi, Retrieved April 15, 2007; &quot; Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah? &quot;, } { AskMoses.com, Retrieved April 15, 2007 } The Babylonian Talmud include stories of Yeshu [ he יֵשׁוּ ]; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the historical Jesus. { Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz.

[ Juan Cole The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá&apos;í Writings 1982 Bahá&apos;í Studies monograph 9 1–38 http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation ] In Bahá&apos;í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single progressive religion from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress. [ Smith Peter A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá&apos;í Faith Progressive revelation 2000 Oneworld Publications Oxford 1-85168-184-1 276–277 ] The Manifestations of God are taught to be &quot; one and the same &quot;, and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience&apos;s needs and culture. Bahá&apos;u&apos;lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual &quot; return &quot; of all the previous Manifestations of God. In this way, Bahá&apos;ís believe that Bahá&apos;u&apos;lláh is, in both respects, the return of Jesus. [ Other ] Traditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and Buddhism and Christianity have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of Gautama Buddha and Jesus. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor Ashoka around 250 BCE in many of the Greek Seleucid kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began. { Old World Encounters.
