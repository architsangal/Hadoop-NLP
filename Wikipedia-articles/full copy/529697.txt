There is also another similarly titled record label, Aftermath Music, which is based in Norway. [ January 2012 ] [ 200px Universal Music Group 1996 Dr. Dre Interscope (U.S.) Polydor (outside U.S.) Hip hop United States Santa Monica, California ] Aftermath Entertainment is an American record label founded by Dr. Dre. It operates as a subsidiary of, and is distributed through, Universal Music Group &apos;s Interscope Records. Current acts include Dr. Dre, Eminem, 50 Cent, Slim the Mobster, Kendrick Lamar and Black Hippy, with former acts including Busta Rhymes, Game, Raekwon, Stat Quo and many others. The labels acts over the years have earned RIAA certification s of platinum or higher on fourteen of its eighteen released albums. [ History ] Upon his departure from Death Row Records in June 1996, Dr. Dre quickly launched Aftermath Entertainment through Interscope Records. It was founded as a &quot; boutique label &quot; that prides itself on &quot; quality over quantity &quot;, focusing on small numbers of high-profile releases. [ http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page%3Dintrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_AngeloSanders.html Interview With Angelo Sander HitQuarters December 19, 2005 June 20, 2010 ] Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath was released towards the year&apos;s end, featuring artists who were amongst the label&apos;s first signees (most of the acts featured, however, quickly became disassociated with the company). In 1997, Dawn Robinson announced her departure from the R &amp; B group En Vogue and that she had signed with Aftermath.

In the autumn of 1997, Aftermath released the only collaborative project by hip hop super-group The Firm (composed of AZ, Foxy Brown, Nas, and Nature ). Despite the highly anticipated album featuring production and cameo appearances by Dr. Dre himself, debuting atop the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200 and being certified gold, it sold below commercial expectation. The group subsequently disbanded. Aftermath&apos;s next release was supposed to be by rapper King Tee. His album, however, was shelved, and King Tee was released from his contractual obligations in 2001. [ http://www.linkedin.com/pub/king-t/40/25/23 King T LinkedIn January 4, 2012 ] Last Emperor had also been signed during this time, but was shelved due to creative differences with an A &amp; R at Aftermath.

The following year, Eminem&apos;s major label debut, The Slim Shady LP was released. The album topped the Billboard albums chart, went on to be certified quadruple platinum, and arguably became the label&apos;s first successful release. Also in 1999, Aftermath released 2001, Dr. Dre&apos;s follow-up to his 1992 album, The Chronic. The album went on to be certified six-times-platinum. Several more artists were signed to, and later dropped from Aftermath, including Hittman and Rakim due to production conflicts. Legal troubles forced singer Truth Hurts to subsequently get dropped from the label after her album&apos;s release.

Rapper The Game, who signed with the label in 2003, also released his debut album The Documentary through a joint venture with 50 Cent&apos;s G-Unit Records in 2005. Shortly after the release of The Documentary, tension between The Game and 50 Cent ignited, resulting in The Game leaving Aftermath Entertainment in mid-2006. Busta Rhymes was also signed and released one album before later being dropped from the label due to conflict with Interscope head, Jimmy Iovine.
