This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It is derived from the metabolism of salicin. In addition to being a compound that is chemically similar to but not identical to the active component of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), it is probably best known for its use in anti-acne treatments. The salts and ester s of salicylic acid are known as salicylates. [ Chemistry ] Salicylic acid has the formula C 6 H 4 (OH)COOH, where the OH group is ortho to the carboxyl group. It is also known as 2-hydroxybenzenecarboxylic acid. It is poorly soluble in water (0.2 g/100 ml H 2 O at 20 °C). [ http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0563.htm Salicilyc acid 2008-10-13 ] Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) can be prepared by the esterification of the phenol ic hydroxyl group of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. [ Plant hormone ] Salicylic acid (SA) is a phenol ic phytohormone and is found in plants with roles in plant growth and development, photosynthesis, transpiration, ion uptake and transport. SA also induces specific changes in leaf anatomy and chloroplast structure. SA is involved in endogenous signaling, mediating in plant defense against pathogens. [ Salicylic acid - A Plant Hormone S. Hayat, A. Ahmad 1-4020-5183-2 2007 Springer ] It plays a role in the resistance to pathogens by inducing the production of pathogenesis-related protein s. [ http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/67/10/2135.pdf Induction by Salicylic Acid of Pathogenesis-related Proteins and Resistance to Alfalfa Mosaic Virus Infection in Various Plant Species HOOFT VAN HUIJSDUIJNEN 2009-05-28 ] It is involved in the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in which a pathogenic attack on one part of the plant induces resistance in other parts. The signal can also move to nearby plants by salicylic acid being converted to the volatile ester, methyl salicylate. { Plant Physiology Third Edition, Taiz and Zeiger, 2002, page 306 } [ Production ] Salicylic acid is biosynthesize d from the amino acid phenylalanine. In Arabidopsis thaliana it can also be synthesized via a phenylalanine-independent pathway. Sodium salicylate is commercially prepared by treating sodium phenolate (the sodium salt of phenol ) with carbon dioxide at high pressure (100 atm) and high temperature (390K) -a method known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. Acidification of the product with sulfuric acid gives salicylic acid: 400px It can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) [ Hydrolysis of ASA to SA http://www.crscientific.com/article-aspirin.html July 31, 2007 ] or methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) with a strong acid or base. [ History ] [ History of aspirin ] { Salix alba &apos;&apos;) is a natural source of salicylic acid } The Greek physician Hippocrates wrote in the 5th century BC about a bitter powder extracted from willow bark that could ease aches and pains and reduce fevers. [ May 2012 ] This remedy was also mentioned in texts from ancient Sumer, Lebanon, and Assyria. [ May 2012 ] The Cherokee and other Native Americans used an infusion of the bark for fever and other medicinal purposes for centuries. { Paul B. Hemel and Mary U. Chiltoskey, Cherokee Plants and Their Uses -- A 400 Year History, Sylva, NC: Herald Publishing Co. (1975); cited in Dan Moerman, A Database of Foods, Drugs, Dyes and Fibers of Native American Peoples, Derived from Plants. A search of this database for &quot; salix AND medicine &quot; finds 63 entries. } The medicinal part of the plant is the inner bark and was used as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments. The Reverend Edward Stone, a vicar from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, noted in 1763 that the bark of the willow was effective in reducing a fever. [ Stone, E An Account of the Success of the Bark of the Willow in the Cure of Agues Philosophical Transactions 1763 195–200 53 http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/openurl.asp?genre%3Darticle%26amp%3Bissn%3D0260-7085%26amp%3Bvolume%3D53%26amp%3Bspage%3D195 10.1098/rstl.1763.0033 ] The active extract of the bark, called salicin, after the Latin name for the white willow ( Salix alba ), was isolated and named by the German chemist Johann Andreas Buchner in 1826. A larger amount of the substance was isolated in 1828 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist. Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second component, which on oxidation becomes salicylic acid.

While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as gastric irritation, bleeding, diarrhea, and even death when consumed in high doses. [ Dietary sources ] Fruits and vegetables are natural sources of salicylic acid, particularly blackberries, blueberries, cantaloupe s, dates, raisin s, guava s, apricot s, green pepper, olive s, tomato es, radish, mushroom s and chicory. Some herb s and spice s contain quite high amounts, although meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products all have little to no salicylates. Of the legume s, seed s, nuts, and cereal s, only almond s, water chestnut s and peanut s have significant amounts. { http://www.food-info.net/uk/qa/qa-fi27.htm } [ Medicinal and cosmetic uses ] Salicylic acid is known for its ability to ease aches and pains and reduce fever s. These medicinal properties, particularly fever relief, have been known since ancient times, and it is used as an anti-inflammatory drug. [ Brief History of Antipyretic Therapy Philip A. Mackowiak Clinical Infectious Diseases, 31 2000 154–156 10.1086/317510 11113017 ] Some researchers [ March 2011 ] believe that salicylate is an essential micronutrient in the human diet, potentially qualifying as a vitamin, namely Vitamin S. [ Rapid Responses to: Aspirin protects women at risk of pre-eclampsia without causing bleeding Kamran Abbasi British Medical Journal 327 2003 7424 10.1136/bmj.327.7424.0-h http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/327/7424/0-h 7424 ] [ April 2012 ] In modern medicine, salicylic acid and its derivatives are used as constituents of some rubefacient products. For example, methyl salicylate is used as a liniment to soothe joint and muscle pain, and choline salicylate is used topically to relieve the pain of aphthous ulcer s. { Cotton pads soaked in salicylic acid can be used to chemically } { exfoliate skin } As with other beta hydroxy acid s, salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of Seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, callus es, corns, keratosis pilaris, and wart s. { http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119449119/abstract?CRETRY=1 &amp; SRETRY=0 } The standard treatment for calluses is a 6% aspirin suspension in vaseline, applied on the callus for one hour and then removed with washing. It works as a keratolytic, bacteriocide and comedolytic agent by causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again by constricting pore diameter, and allowing room for new cell growth. { Salicylic Acid Essential Actives, KAVI. } Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoo s used to treat dandruff. Use of concentrated solutions of salicylic acid may cause hyperpigmentation on unpretreated skin for those with darker skin types ( Fitzpatrick phototypes IV, V, VI), as well as with the lack of use of a broad spectrum sunblock.

[ May 2012 ] [ Mechanism of action ] [ April 2012 ] One effect of salicylic acid is to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, and this has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. { &quot; The Ancient Drug Salicylate Directly Activates AMP-Activated Protein Kinase &quot; by Simon Hawley et al., Science, Published online April 19, 2012. } { &quot; Clues to aspirin&apos;s anti-cancer effects revealed &quot; by Lisa Raffensperger, } { New Scientist online, 19 April 2012. } [ Other uses ] Although toxic in large quantities, salicylic acid is used as a food preservative and as bactericidal and an antiseptic. [ http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey%3D25386 Definition of Salicylic acid MedicineNet.com ] For some people with salicylate sensitivity even these small doses can be harmful. [ December 2010 ] Sodium salicylate is a useful phosphor in the vacuum ultraviolet with nearly flat quantum efficiency for wavelengths between 10 to 100  nm. { JAR Samson Techniques of Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectroscopy } It fluoresces in the blue at 420  nm. It is easily prepared on a clean surface by spraying a saturated solution of the salt in methanol followed by evaporation. [ Safety ] Topically, as a beta-hydroxy acid (and unlike alpha-hydroxy acids) salicylic acid is capable of penetrating and breaking-down fats and lipids, making it capable of causing moderate chemical burns of the skin if at very high concentrations (such as near or actually the majority ingredient) within a solvent. It is capable of damaging the lining of pores in such cases if the solvent is alcohol, acetone, or an oil. Over-the-counter limits are set at 2% for topical left on the face and 3% for those expected to be washed off, such as acne cleansers or shampoo. Caution should be exercised when handling large volumes of salicylic acid, and protective gloves are recommended for any repeat, prolonged exposure. 17% salicylic acid, which is often sold for wart removal, should not be applied to the face and should not be used for acne treatment. Even for wart removal, such a solution should only be applied twice a day - more frequent use may lead to an increase in side effects without an increase in efficacy. { &quot; salicylic acid 17 % Topical Liquid. &quot; Kaiser Permanente Drug Encyclopedia.

[ HNO 2004 52 4 347–51 Reversible hearing loss in acute salicylate intoxication Wecker, H.; Laubert, A. German 15143764 10.1007/s00106-004-1065-5 ] It can induce transient hearing loss in zinc -deficient individuals. This finding is based on clinical studies with rat s. An injection of salicylic acid induced hearing loss in zinc-deficient rats, while a simultaneous injection of zinc reversed the hearing loss. An injection of magnesium in the zinc-deficient rats did not reverse the salicylic acid-induced hearing loss. There are no studies specifically looking at topical salicylic acid in pregnancy. Oral salicylic acid has not been associated with an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but use in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. [ 7312229 1981 Nov Rumack, Cm; Guggenheim, Ma; Rumack, Bh; Peterson, Rg; Johnson, Ml; Braithwaite, Wr Neonatal intracranial hemorrhage and maternal use of aspirin 58 5 Suppl 52S–6S 0029-7844 Obstetrics and gynecology ] The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents, and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential. { Acne and Pregnancy } Salicylic acid overdose can lead to salicylate intoxication, which often presents clinically in a state of metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. In patients presenting with an acute overdose, a 16% morbidity rate and a 1% mortality rate are observed. { http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/818242-overview } Some people are hypersensitive to salicylic acid and related compounds. The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends the use of sun protection when using skincare products containing salicylic acid (or any other BHA) on sun-exposed skin areas.

The National Reye&apos;s Syndrome Foundation cautions against the usage of these substances, and other substances similar to aspirin, on children and adolescents. Epidemiological research has shown an association between the development of Reye&apos;s Syndrome and the use of aspirin (a salicylate compound) for treating the symptoms of influenza-like illnesses, chicken pox, colds, etc. The U.S. Surgeon General, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses, because of a concern about Reye&apos;s Syndrome.
