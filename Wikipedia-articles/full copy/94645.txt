Although the county contains the urban Springfield and Missouri State University, the county is located in the heart of the Bible Belt where voters tend to be very socially conservative and therefore more amendable to voting Republican. George W. Bush carried Greene County in 2000 and 2004 by almost two-to-one margins, and like many other counties throughout the Bible Belt in Southwest Missouri, Greene County favored John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008. The last Democratic presidential nominee to win Greene County was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Like most areas throughout the Bible Belt in Southwest Missouri, voters in Greene County traditionally adhere to socially and culturally conservative principles which tend to strongly influence their Republican leanings. In 2004, Missourians voted on a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman —it overwhelmingly passed Greene County with 72.04 percent of the vote. The initiative passed the state with 71 percent of support from voters as Missouri became the first state to ban same-sex marriage. In 2006, Missourians voted on a constitutional amendment to fund and legalize embryonic stem cell research in the state —it narrowly failed in Greene County with 51.62 percent voting against the measure. The initiative narrowly passed the state with 51 percent of support from voters as Missouri became one of the first states in the nation to approve embryonic stem cell research. Despite Greene County’s longstanding tradition of supporting socially conservative platforms, voters in the county have a penchant for advancing populist causes like increasing the minimum wage. In 2006, Missourians voted on a proposition (Proposition B) to increase the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 an hour—it passed Greene County with 74.41 percent of the vote. The proposition strongly passed every single county in Missouri with 78.99 percent voting in favor as the minimum wage was increased to $6.50 an hour in the state. During the same election, voters in five other states also strongly approved increases in the minimum wage. [ Missouri Presidential Preference Primary (2008) ] Voters in Greene County from both political parties supported candidates who finished in second place in the state at large and nationally. Although a conservative/Republican stronghold, former U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D- New York ) still received more votes, a total of 18,322, than any candidate from either party in Greene County during the 2008 presidential primary.
