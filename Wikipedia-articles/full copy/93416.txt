In 1859, the eastern part of Taos County, including all of the territory of Colfax County, was split off to form Mora County. Colfax County was established on January 25, 1869 from the northern part of Mora County. The original county seat was the gold mining town of Elizabethtown.

Cimarron was on the stage coach route along the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail, and was the headquarters of the Maxwell Land Grant. The Colfax County Courthouse in Cimarron is a contributing structure in the Cimarron Historic District, and is still in use as a Masonic lodge. In 1881, the county seat was moved from Cimarron to Springer, located on the former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, since 1996 part of the Burlington Northern Railroad. The Colfax County Courthouse in Springer was the site of one of the last important shoot-outs in the Colfax County War. [ 122-124 ] This former courthouse, which is on the National Register of Historic Places is now the home of a museum devoted to the Santa Fe Trail. The eastern portions of Colfax, Mora, and San Miguel counties were severed to form Union County in 1893. After a referendum and a bitter legislative fight, the county seat moved from Springer to Raton in 1897. [ Conway Jay T. A brief community history of Raton, New Mexico Gazette Print 1930 Raton 17 p ] [ 23-24 ] Raton was an important coal-mining town, and was also a railroad center. The citizens of Raton raised $8000 to pay one third of the costs of a new courthouse. That courthouse was replaced in 1932 by the current Colfax County Courthouse (Raton, New Mexico), an art-deco WPA structure that also is on the National Register of Historic Places.
