It is located in the north-central portion of the province. As it is bounded on the west by the Jiuling Mountains, and on the east by Poyang Lake, it is famous for its scenery, rich history and cultural sites. Owing to its central location relative to the Yangtze and Pearl River Delta regions, it is a major railroad hub in Southern China. [ History ] The modern Jiangxi area – including Nanchang – was first incorporated into Chinese territory during the Qin dynasty, when it was conquered from the Baiyue peoples and organized as Jiujiang Commandery ( [ 九江郡 ] ). { Zhongguo gujin diming dacidian 中国古今地名大词典 [ &quot; Dictionary of Chinese Place-names Ancient and Modern &quot; ], (Shanghai: Shanghai cishu chubanshe, 2006), p. 2080. } In 201 BC, during the Han dynasty, the city was given the Chinese name Nanchang and became the administrative seat of Yuzhang Commandery ( [ 豫章郡 ] ), and was governed by Guan Ying ( [ 灌嬰 ] ), one of Emperor Gaozu of Han &apos;s generals. The name Nanchang means &quot; southern flourishing &quot;, and is from a motto of developing what is now southern China that is traditionally attributed to Emperor Gaozu himself. In AD 589, during the Sui dynasty, this commandery was changed into a prefecture named Hongzhou ( [ 洪州 ] ), and after 763 it became the provincial center of Jiangxi, which was then beginning the rapid growth that by the 12th century made it the most populous province in China. In 653, the Tengwang Pavilion was constructed. In 675, Wang Bo wrote the classic &quot; Tengwang Ge Xu &quot;. The building as well as the city became celebrated for Wang&apos;s introduction article and the author is known to all Chinese-speaking population by this masterpiece. The Pavilion has been destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout China&apos;s history. In its present form, Tengwang Pavilion was reconstructed in the 1980s after being destroyed in 1929 during the Chinese Civil War. In 959, under the Southern Tang regime, it became Nanchang superior prefecture and also the southern capital. After the conquest by the Song regime in 981 it reverted to the name Hongzhou. In 1164 it was renamed Longxing prefecture, which name it retained until 1368. At the end of the Yuan ( Mongol ) period (1279–1368), it became a battleground between Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and the rival local warlord, Chen Youliang. At the beginning of the 16th century it was the power base from which Zhu Chenhao, the prince of Ning, launched a rebellion against the Ming regime. During the reign of the Wanli Emperor of the Ming dynasty, it housed relatives of the emperor who had been exiled because they were potential claimants of the imperial throne, members of the imperial family constituting about one quarter of the city&apos;s population; as a result of this, Matteo Ricci came here when trying to gain entry to Beijing. { Mary Laven, Mission to China: Matteo Ricci and the Jesuit Encounter with the East, ISBN 0-571-22517-9, 2011, p. 103 } In the 1850s it suffered considerably as a result of the Taiping Rebellion (1850–64), and its importance as a commercial center declined as the overland routes to Canton were replaced by coastal steamship services in the latter half of the 19th century. Nanchang has, however, remained the undisputed regional metropolis of Jiangxi. On August 1, 1927, Nanchang was the site of one of a series of insurrections organized by the Chinese Communist Party. The Nanchang Uprising, led by pro-communist Kuomintang officers under Russia n direction, succeeded in holding the city for only a few days, and provided a core of troops and a method of organization from which the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) later developed. In 1939, the Battle of Nanchang, a ferocious battle between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Japan ese Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War took place. In 1949 Nanchang was still essentially an old-style administrative and commercial city, with little industry apart from food processing; it had a population of about 275,000. Nanchang first acquired a rail connection in 1915, when the line to Jiujiang, a port on the Yangtze River, was opened. Several other rail links have since been opened. After World War II a line was completed to Linchuan and Gongqi in the Ru River Valley to the south-southeast. Since 1949 Nanchang has been extensively industrialized. It is now a large-scale producer of cotton textiles and cotton yarn. Papermaking is also a large industry, as is food processing (especially rice milling ). Heavy industry began to be important in the mid-1950s. A large thermal-power plant was installed and uses coal brought by rail from Fengcheng, to the south. A machinery industry also grew up, at first mainly concentrating on the production of agricultural equipment and diesel engine s. Nanchang then became a center of the automotive industry, producing trucks and tractors and also such equipment as tires. An iron- smelting plant helping to supply local industry was installed in the later 1950s. There is also a large chemical industry, producing agricultural chemicals and insecticides as well as pharmaceuticals.
