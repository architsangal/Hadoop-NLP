Port of Algeciras is one of the largest ports in Europe and in the world in three categories: container, cargo and transhipment. It is situated 20  km north-east of Tarifa on the Río de la Miel, which is the southernmost river of the Iberian peninsula and continental Europe. It has a population in 2009 of 116,209 people. It is the biggest city among its metropolitan area, that also includes the municipalities of Los Barrios, La Línea de la Concepción, Castellar de la Frontera, Jimena de la Frontera, San Roque and Tarifa, with a population of 263,739. { Plan de Ordenación del Territorio del Área del Campo de Gibraltar, } { Junta de Andalucía (Spanish) } [ Name ] The site of Roman cities called Portus Albus, Caetaria (current Getares) and Iuliua Tracta, the current name of Algeciras comes from the Arab period of the Iberian Peninsula : AlJazīra AlKhadrā&apos; Arabic الجزيرة الخضراء or Green Island. [ History ] The area of the city has been populated since prehistory, and the earliest remains belong to Neanderthal populations from the Paleolithic. Due to its strategic position it was an important port under the Phoenician s, and was the site of the relevant Roman port of Portus Albus ( &quot; White Port &quot; ), with two near cities called Caetaria (most likely Iberians ) and Iulia Transducta ( Tarifa ), founded by the Romans themselves. After being destroyed by the Germanic Barbarians and their Vandal allies, the city was founded again in 711 by the invading Moors, as the first city created by the Arabs on the occupied Spanish soil. It enjoyed a brief period of independence as a taifa state from 1035-1058. It was named al-Jazirah al-Khadra&apos; ( &quot; Green Island &quot; ) after the offshore Isla Verde; the modern name is derived from this original Arabic name (compare also Algiers and Al Jazeera ). After many centuries of Muslim rule, the tide of the reconquista arrived at Algeciras. In July 1309 Ferdinand IV of Castile laid siege to Algeciras as well as Gibraltar. The latter fell into Christian hands, but Muslim Algeciras held on for the following three decades, until Alfonso XI of Castile resumed its siege. Juan Nunez de Lara, Juan Manuel, Pedro Fernández de Castro, Juan Alfonso de la Cerda, lord of Gibraleón all participated in the siege, as did knights from France, England and Germany, and even King Philip III of Navarre, king consort of Navarra, who came accompanied by 100 horsemen and 300 infantry. In March 1344, after several years of siege, Algeciras surrendered. The city was, however, retaken by the Moors in 1368 - but was destroyed on the orders of Muhammed V of Granada. The site was subsequently abandoned. Algeciras was refounded in 1704 by refugees from Gibraltar following the territory&apos;s capture by Anglo-Dutch forces in the War of the Spanish Succession. It was rebuilt on its present rectangular plan by Charles III of Spain in 1760. In July 1801, the French and Spanish navies fought the British Royal Navy offshore in the Battle of Algeciras, which ended in a British victory. The city hosted the Algeciras Conference in 1906, an international forum to discuss the future of Morocco which was held in the Casa Consistorial (town hall). In July 1942 Italian frogmen set up in a secret base in the Italian tanker Olterra, which was interned in Algeciras, in order to attack shipping in Gibraltar. During the Franco era, Algeciras underwent substantial industrial development, creating many new jobs for the local workers made unemployed when the border between Gibraltar and Spain was sealed by Franco between 1969 and 1982. In 1982 there was a failed plan codenamed Operation Algeciras conceived by the Argentinian military to sabotage the British military facilities in Gibraltar during the Falklands War. The Spanish authorities intervened just before the attack, and deported the two Argentine Montoneros and military liaison officer involved. { Falklands war nearly spread to Gibraltar } [ Demographics ] [ 103,106 104,087 105,066 106,710 108,779 109,665 111,283 ] [ Economy ] { es ) } Algeciras is principally a transport hub and industrial city. Its principal activities are connected with the port, which serves as the main embarkation point between Spain and Tangier and other ports in Morocco as well as the Canary Islands and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. It is ranked as the 16th busiest port in the world. The city also has a substantial fishing industry and exports a range of agricultural products from the surrounding area, including cereals, tobacco and farm animals. Port of Algeciras In recent years it has become a significant tourist destination, with popular day trips to Tarifa to see bird migrations; to Gibraltar to see the territory&apos;s sights and culture; and to the Bay of Gibraltar on whale watching excursions. Algeciras is the southern terminus of two principal north-south Euroroute s, the E05 and E15. Both routes, moreover, run to Scotland (the E05 terminates at Greenock and the E15 at Inverness ) via France and England.
