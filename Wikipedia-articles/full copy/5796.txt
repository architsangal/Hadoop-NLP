The term is synonymous with wealth (commonly denoted as a person with fame and fortune), implied with great popular appeal, prominence in a particular field, and is easily recognized by the general public. Various careers within the fields of sport s and entertainment are commonly associated with celebrity status. These fields have produced prominent figures within these two industries. Many professional athletes have risen to fame such as golfer Tiger Woods, former boxer Muhammad Ali, football player Tom Brady, hockey player Wayne Gretzky, and basketball player Michael Jordan. Prominent entertainment figures have also reached celebrity status such as models Sofia Vergara, Gisele Bündchen, and Adriana Lima, authors J.K.

Celebrities may be known around the world (e.g., pop stars Celine Dion and Michael Jackson, film actors Jackie Chan, Rajinikanth ), within a specific country (e.g., a top Australian rugby player); or within a region (e.g., a local TV news anchor). [ Regional and cultural implications ] { Barack Obama. } Cultures and regions with a significant population may have their own independent celebrity systems, with distinct hierarchies. For example, the Canadian province of Quebec, which is French-speaking, has its own system of French-speaking television, movie and music celebrities. A person who garners a degree of fame in one culture may be considered less famous or obscure in another. Some nationwide celebrities might command some attention outside their own nation; for example, the singer Lara Fabian is widely known in the French-speaking world, but only had a couple of Billboard hits in the U.S., whereas the francophone Canadian singer Celine Dion is well known in both the French-speaking world and in the U.S. Regions within a country, or cultural communities (linguistic, ethnic, religious) can also have their own celebrity systems, especially in linguistically or culturally distinct regions such as Quebec or Wales. Regional radio personalities, newscasters, politician s or community leader s may be local or regional celebrities. English-speaking media commentators and journalists will sometimes refer to celebrities as belonging to the A-List or state that a certain actor belongs to the B-List, the latter being a disparaging context. These informal rankings indicate a placing within a hierarchy. However, due to differing levels of celebrity in different regions, it is difficult to place people within one bracket. A Brazilian actor might be a B-list action film actor in the US, but an A-list star in Portugal. An objective method of placing celebrities from any country into categories from A-List to H-List based on their number of Google hits has been proposed. { E. Schulman, &quot; Measuring Fame Quantitatively. III. What Does it Take to Make the &apos;A&apos; List?, &quot; } { Annals of Improbable Research Vol. 12, No. 1 (2006), 11. } Some elements are associated with fame, such as appearing on the cover of Time, being spoofed in Mad, having a wax statue in Madame Tussauds, or receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Certain people are known even to people unfamiliar with the area in which they excelled. If one has to name a famous boxer, they are more likely to name Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson, since their fame expanded beyond the sport itself. Pablo Picasso&apos;s style and name are known even to people who are not interested in art; likewise many know that Harry Houdini was an illusionist, Bill Gates, an entrepreneur, Albert Einstein a scientist; Mozart and Beethoven classical composers; Luciano Pavarotti an opera singer. [ Fictional implications ] The same phenomenon is true for fictional character s. When most people think of a superhero or a comic book celebrity, Superman, Spider-Man, and Batman will usually be the first that comes to mind. If one has to name a famous wizard, the names would typically be Merlin, Gandalf or Harry Potter. Mickey Mouse is perhaps the most famous cartoon character and fictional mouse in the world. The most famous movie monster s are King Kong and Godzilla, the archetypical detective is Sherlock Holmes and most people&apos;s idea of a spy is James Bond.

The term &quot; instant celebrity &quot; describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. Someone who achieves a small amount of transient fame (through, say, hype or mass media ) may become labeled a &quot; B-grade celebrity &quot;. Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it. [ January 2012 ] [ Success ] There are no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with individuals that come from the fields of sports and entertainment or a person who is a public figure in that is commonly recognizable in mass media. With innate talent, passion, diligence, discipline, self-motivation and tenacity, being the core factors of achieving success to becoming a celebrity, fame and fortune sometimes occurs spontaneously with relatively little effort due to sheer luck, being fortunate with connections, or simply being at the right place during the right time. Celebrities are incessantly stereotyped and fantasized as individuals who possess exorbitant amounts of wealth and glamour. They are also sometimes denigrated by the general public as being overpaid and publicly overrated compared to a normal worker such as a doctor, police officer or a teacher. Though glamor and wealth certainly plays a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments sphere, be it music, film, television, radio, model ling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only an infinitesimal percentage (usually less than 1%) achieve fame and fortune. Due to the Machiavellian and competitive nature within both industries, a vast amount of aspiring entertainers and athletes in the world, even some of the most talented may never be recognized and won&apos;t ever receive the opportunity to carve a name for themselves.

For instance, David Letterman is well known for branching into late night television as a talk show host while honing his skills a stand-up comedian, Barbra Streisand ventured into acting while operating as a singer, or Clint Eastwood, who achieved even greater fame in Hollywood for being a film director and a producer than for his acting credentials.

Entertainment based occupations that are not as well known in the general public or are simply antiquated (e.g. magicians, photographer s, and some visual artist s such as painter s and potters ) relative to the present day mass media industry are less likely to become celebrities (though there are exceptions such as illusionists David Copperfield and Criss Angel, or photographer David LaChapelle ). In other sub-fields within the entertainment industry, there is a similar situation. For instance, in the music industry, the top-selling pop singers have a strong potential to become celebrities, but the behind-the-scenes professionals tend to remain little known to the general public (e.g. dancer s, disc jockey s, record producers, and composers ); though in recent years, Club DJ s such as David Guetta, Skrillex and Deadmau5 or composer David Foster have achieved worldwide fame for their respective work in the music industry. High-end fashion designer s and jewelry designer s are likely to become celebrities but will not garner the same and equal importance in the entertainment sphere compared to a successful film or television actor or a widely known musician. A similar phenomenon is also true within the field of professional sport s as professional athletes who are directly involved directly with the competition, the physical aspects of scoring and defending, as well as being widely spectated by fans are more than likely to become celebrities. However, other professionals that play a more peripheral role in the field of professional sports (e.g. coaches, general manager s, referee s, commentators and announcer s, sports team owners and executives, sports commissioner s ) who are more active in the internal aspects of field tend to remain in obscurity and are less likely to achieve celebrity status.

The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to general public doesn&apos;t the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor. They can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a significant amount market share than the average entrepreneur.

As a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. The release of Kim Kardashian &apos;s sex tape with rapper Ray J in 2007 brought her to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals, and reality TV series.

Due to the high visibility of celebrities&apos; private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal with their political views. For example, Matt Damon expressed his displeasure with 2008 U.S. Vice Presidential Nominee Sarah Palin, as well as with the 2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis.

[ Jenkins Joe Contemporary moral issues Heinemann 2002 4, illustrated Examining Religions 178 0-435-30309-0, 9780435303099 ] The term is a pejorative, suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities. [ Jones Jen Being Famous Capstone Press 2007 Snap Books: 10 Things You Need to Know about 20 1-4296-0126-4, 9781429601269 ] Even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work. Amy Argetsinger coined the term &quot; famesque &quot; to define entertainer s such as actor s and singer s, or professional athletes who have become celebrities despite having achieved very little, if any, success in their careers. [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/09/AR2009080902084.html They Must Be Stars Because They Get So Much Press, but What Is It They Do Again?

[ Families ] Another example of celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. In some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. For example, the Kennedy family is associated with US politics; The House of Windsor with royalty; The Osbournes, Chaplin, and Barrymore families with entertainment. Other well-known families include the Hilton family, the Bush family, and the Kardashian family. [ Restricted access ] Access to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes publicist s, agent s, personal assistant s, and bodyguard s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews. An interview with writer and actor Michael Musto cites: [ You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity&apos;s personal publicist. They all have to approve you. Michael Musto en.wikinews.org ] Celebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive paparazzi photographers or autograph-seeking fans ) to serious ( assault, kidnapping, assassination, or stalking ). The bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands. Celebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats. { International Association of Close Protection Officers } [ Celebrity-stalking has common threads http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section%3Dnews%2Fentertainment%26amp%3Bid%3D6730960%3D ABC March 26, 2009 November 17, 2011 ] [ 15 minutes of fame ] See also: 15 minutes of fame, One-hit wonder Andy Warhol famously coined the phrase &quot; 15 minutes of fame &quot;. &quot; Celebrities &quot; in the 21st century can now be famous simply by being in the right place at the right time. Certain &quot; 15 minutes of fame &quot; celebrities can be average people seen with an A-list celebrity, who are sometimes noticed on entertainment news channels such as E! News. These &quot; celebs &quot; are regular people who originally are not celebrities, becoming celebrities, and are often turned into celebrities based on the ridiculous things they do. &quot; In fact, many reality show contestants fall into this category: the only thing that qualifies them to be on TV is that they&apos;re real. &quot; { Maasik, Sonia, and Jack Solomon. Signs of Life in the USA. 5th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2006. } Certain people are only remembered today because of a movie portrayal, certain story or urban legend surrounding their life and less for their accomplishments. Antonio Salieri was a famous and well-known 18th-century composer, who sank into obscurity the next two centuries. He was rediscovered thanks to the musical and film Amadeus, but his fictional portrayal as an antagonist has been more famous than his music since the end of the 20th century. Roscoe &quot; Fatty &quot; Arbuckle and O.J. Simpson are more notorious for their association with murder trials than for their respective movie and sports careers. Ronald Reagan is more famous as a politician today than as a movie actor. Centuries after his death, Andrea Mantegna now better known as the mentor of Leonardo Da Vinci than for his own paintings. [ Social networking ] Celebrities have been flocking to social networking and video hosting sites such as Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and MySpace. { Murad, Ahmed &quot; The 50 most popular celebs on Twitter &quot;, The Sunday Times, February 2, 2009 } Social networking sites allow celebrities to communicate directly with their fans, removing the middle-man known as traditional media. Social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as Us Weekly and People Weekly. Celebrity blogging have also spawned stars such as Perez Hilton who is well known for not only blogging, but also outing celebrities. [ Perez Hilton’s gay witch hunt http://www.salon.com/2006/12/15/hilton_2/%3D ABC December 15, 2006 November 17, 2011 ] Social media sites have even catapulted some to fame. Tila Tequila for example, shot to stardom on MySpace. { Trebay, Guy &quot; She&apos;s Famous (and So Can You) &quot;, The New York Times, October 28, 2007 } [ Health implications ] Common threats such as stalking have spawned a term called Celebrity Worship Syndrome, which a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity&apos;s personal life. { Schumaker, John F., &apos;Star Struck&apos; New Internationalist; Issue 363, p34-35, 2p, December 2003 } Psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over glamorous film, television, sport and pop star s per the disparity in salaries in society seems to value professional athlete s and entertainment industry based professional s.
