[ History ] Spencerville was built on the new Miami and Erie Canal ca. 1840. The canal made the area quite prosperous through the 1850s, when railroads began supplanting the slower canal system. The Erie Railroad and subsequently the Erie-Lackawanna Railway ran through Spencerville until abandoned in 1976 by the Conrail merger in favor of a parallel former Penn Central line running through Lima. In 1978 the now defunct Spencerville and Elgin Railroad (SPEG) operated as a short line running on a portion of the abandoned E-L line between Lima and Ohio City until it closed down in 1997. Originally, the SPEG ran all the way to the Ohio-Indiana state line where it met up with the trains of the now defunct Erie Western Railway which ran from that point towards Chicago. The SPEG line&apos;s western terminus was then moved back to Glenmore. Since that time,the short line was taken over (and is now owned) by the Western Ohio division of the R.J. Corman Railroad Group which moved the terminus back to Elgin in May of 2010 with the section between Elgin and Glenmore abandoned and the trackage sold for scrap. The shortline now owned by R.J. Corman continues to serve the Spencerville,Elgin and Lima commuities.(see video reference below) [ References ] 4.
