{ London Victoria station } { Toronto Subway and RT } { Hong Kong } { MTR Train } &quot; Mind the gap &quot; is a warning to train passengers to take caution while crossing the gap between the train door and the station platform. It was introduced in 1969 on the London Underground. The phrase is also associated with t-shirts that Transport for London sells featuring the phrase printed over a London Transport symbol. [ Variants ] { Bakerloo Line, } { Paddington Station } Because some platforms on the Underground are curved and the rolling stock that uses them are straight, an unsafe gap is created when a straight car stops at a curved platform. In the absence of a device to automatically fill the gap some form of visual and auditory warning was needed to prevent passengers from being caught unaware and suffering injury by stepping into the wide gap. The phrase &quot; mind the gap &quot; was chosen for this purpose and can be found painted along the edges of curved platforms as well as via a recorded announcement played when a train arrives. The recording is also used where platforms are non-standard height. Deep-level tube trains have a floor height around [ 200 mm in 0 in ] less than sub-surface stock trains. Where trains share platforms, for example some Piccadilly Line (tube) and District Line (sub-surface) stations, the platform is a compromise. &quot; Mind the gap &quot; is played at Central Line platforms at Bank, Northern Line northbound platform at Embankment and Bakerloo Line platforms at Piccadilly Circus. The markings on the platform edge usually line up with the doors on the cars. This can be useful when catching trains. While the message is often played on some lines over the platform&apos;s public address system, it is becoming more common as an arrival message inside the train itself: &quot; Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. &quot; [ Origin of the phrase ] The phrase &quot; mind the gap &quot; was coined around 1968 for a planned automated announcement after it had become impractical for drivers and station attendants to warn passengers. The Underground chose digital recording using solid state equipment with no moving parts. As storage capacity was expensive, the phrase had to be short. A short warning was also easier to write on the platform. The equipment was supplied by AEG Telefunken. According to the Independent on Sunday, sound engineer Peter Lodge, who owned Redan Recorders in Bayswater, working with a Scottish Telefunken engineer, recorded an actor reading &quot; mind the gap &quot; and &quot; stand clear of the doors please &quot;, but the actor insisted on royalties and the phrases had to be re-recorded. Lodge read the phrases to line up the recording equipment for level and those were used. { http://www.gradewinner.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_200312/ai_n12746493 } While Lodge&apos;s recording is still in use, some lines use other recordings. One was recorded by Manchester voice artist Emma Clarke. Others, on the Piccadilly line, are by Tim Bentinck, who plays David Archer in The Archers. At least ten stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd., Milton Keynes. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their Industrial Sales Manager at the time (May 1990). It can still be heard, at Paddington for example.
