[ June 2009 ] Technophobia (from Greek τέχνη - technē, &quot; art, skill, craft &quot; { τέχνη, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus } and φόβος - phobos, &quot; fear &quot; { φόβος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus } ) is the fear or dislike of advanced technology or complex devices, especially computers. [ 3 ] { (1) tech·no·pho·bi·a (těk&apos;nə-fō&apos;bē-ə) n. Fear of or aversion to technology, especially computers and high technology.-Related forms: tech&apos;no·phobe&apos; n., tech&apos;no·pho&apos;bic (-fō&apos;bĭk) adj. &quot; — (American Heritage Dictionary) } [ 3 ] { (2) &quot; tech·no·pho·bi·a } [ ˌ t ɛ k n ə ˈ f oʊ b i ə ] { - Show Spelled Pronunciation [tek-nuh-foh-bee-uh] –noun abnormal fear of or anxiety about the effects of advanced technology.[Origin: 1960–65; techno- + -phobia] —Related forms: tech·no·phobe, noun —(Dictionary.com unabridged (v1.1) based on the Random House unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2006.) } The term is generally used in the sense of an irrational fear, but others contend fears are justified. It is the opposite of technophilia. First receiving widespread notice during the Industrial Revolution, technophobia has been observed to affect various societies and communities throughout the world. This has caused some groups to take stances against some modern technological developments in order to preserve their ideologies. In some of these cases, the new technologies conflict with established beliefs, such as the personal values of simplicity and modest lifestyles. A number of examples of technophobic ideas can be found in multiple forms of art, ranging from literary works such as Frankenstein to films like Metropolis and Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs. Many of these works portray the darker side of technology as seen by the technophobic. As technologies become increasingly complex and difficult to understand, people are more likely to harbor anxieties relating to their use of modern technologies. [ Prevalence ] A study published in the journal Computers in human behavior was conducted between 1992 and 1994 surveying first-year college students across various countries.

Rosen A Study of Technological Sophistication and Technophobia in University Students From 23 Countries Computers in human behavior 11 1 95–133 1995 Over a two-year period, from 1992 - 1994, data were collected from 3,392 first year university students in 38 universities from 23 countries on their level of technological sophistication and level of technophobia. Technological sophistication was measured by the use of consumer technology (video-cassette recorder, microwave ovens, automated banking, computer/video games), university computing (classroom computer use, word processing experience, programming experience and use of library computers) and computer ownership. Technophobia was assessed by instruments measuring computer anxiety, computer cognitions and computer attitudes. ] The overall percentage of the 3,392 students who responded with high-level technophobic fears was 29%.

Percentage of Students in each country who possessed high levels of technophobia &quot; ] {; Several points are worth noting from Table 2. First, a group of countries including Indonesia, Poland, India, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Mexico and Thailand show large percentages (over 50%) of technophobic students. In contrast, there are five countries which show under 30% technophobes (USA, Yugoslavia - Croatia, Singapore, Israel and Hungary). The remaining countries were in between these two groupings. } In comparison, Japan had 58% high-level technophobes, India had 82%, and Mexico had 53%. A published report in 2000 stated that roughly 85 to 90 percent of new employees at an organization may be uncomfortable with new technology, and are technophobic to some degree.

With the development of new machines able to do the work of skilled craftsmen using unskilled, underpaid men, women, and children, those who worked a trade began to fear for their livelihoods. In 1675, a group of weavers destroyed machines that replaced their jobs. By 1727, the destruction had become so prevalent Parliament made the demolition of machines a capital offense. This action, however, did not stop the tide of violence. The Luddites, a group of anti-technology workers, united under the name “Ludd” in March 1811, removing key components from knitting frames, raiding houses for supplies, and petitioning for trade rights while threatening greater violence. Poor harvests and food riots lent aid to their cause by creating a restless and agitated population for them to draw supporters from. [ Kevin Binfield http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/kevin.binfield/luddites/LudditeHistory.htm Luddite History - Kevin Binfield - Murray State University Campus.murraystate.edu 2010-06-02 ] The 19th century was also the beginning of modern science, with the work of Louis Pasteur, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Michael Faraday, Henri Becquerel, and Marie Curie, and inventors such as Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. The world was changing rapidly, too rapidly for many, who feared the changes taking place and longed for a simpler time. The Romantic movement exemplified these feelings. Romantics tended to believe in imagination over reason, the “organic” over the mechanical, and a longing for a simpler, more pastoral times. Poets like William Wordsworth and William Blake believed that the technological changes that were taking place as a part of the industrial revolution were polluting their cherished view of nature as being perfect and pure. [ http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html Romanticism Wsu.edu 2010-06-02 ] After World War II, a fear of technology continued to grow, catalyzed by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. With nuclear proliferation and the Cold War, people began to wonder what would become of the world now that humanity had the power to destroy it. In the post-WWII era, environmentalism also took off as a movement. The first international air pollution conference was held in 1955, and in the 1960s, investigations into the lead content of gasoline sparked outrage among environmentalists. In the 1980s, the depletion of the ozone layer and the threat of global warming began to be taken more seriously.

Many technophobic groups revolt against modern technology because of their beliefs that these technologies are threatening to their ways of life and livelihoods. [ http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/luddites.html The Luddites Regent.edu 2010-06-02 ] The Luddites were a social movement of British artisans in the 19th century who organized in opposition to technological advances in the textile industry. These advances replaced many skilled textile artisans with comparatively unskilled machine operators. [ Technophobia in arts ] An early example of technophobia in fiction and popular culture is Mary Shelley &apos;s Frankenstein. It has been a staple of science fiction ever since, exemplified by movies like Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot; Metropolis &quot;, which offer an example of how technophobia can occur, and Charlie Chaplin &apos;s &quot; Modern Times &quot;, in which people are reduced to nothing but cogs in the machinery, a product of new industrial techniques like the assembly line. This persisted through the 1950s, with the fears of nuclear weapon s and radiation leading to giant insects of monster movie s, as well as cautionary tale s like &quot; The Day the Earth Stood Still &quot;, and into the 1960s, with the likes of The Hulk. It was joined by fears of superintelligent machines, and rebellion amongst them, which was a recurring theme of Star Trek, from the original series to &quot; ST:TNG &quot; to &quot; Voyager &quot; in the 1990s. Also in the 1960s, the film Omega Man (loosely based on the Richard Matheson novel I am Legend ) showed a world scarred by biological warfare and only a handful of humans and a cult of mutants remain alive. Charlton Heston&apos;s character is a scientist who is being targeted by the mutants who wish to destroy all science and machinery due to their technophobic beliefs. Technophobia is also thematic in Walter M. Miller &apos;s novel A Canticle for Leibowitz, where nuclear war produces an attempt to stamp out science itself as held to be responsible. In the 1970s, &quot; The Forbin Project &quot; and &quot; Demon Seed &quot; also offered samples of domination by computers. Also in the 1970s, Rich Buckler created Deathlok, a cyborg revivified by a madman as a slave killing machine, a dark twist on Frankenstein. Technophobia achieved commercial success in the 1980s with the movie The Terminator, in which a computer becomes self-aware, and decides to kill all humans. Blade Runner shows us how human replicas were able to live on Earth, portraying technology gone wrong in &quot; replicants &quot; unhappy with their man-made limitations which demand they be &quot; modified &quot;. &quot; Star Trek: Voyager &quot; introduced another twist, when &quot; surplus &quot; EMHs, such sophisticated expert system s as to be almost indistinguishable from human, being effectively reduced to slavery, while other similar systems were turned into sentient prey. More recently there have been movies like &apos;&apos;I, Robot&apos;&apos;, The Matrix Trilogy, WALL-E, and the Terminator sequels. Shows such as Doctor Who - most specifically in the episode Robots of Death - have also tackled the issue of technophobia, with a character in Robots of Death displaying a great fear of robots due to their lack of body language, described by the Fourth Doctor as giving them the appearance of &apos; dead men walking &apos;. Series consultant Kit Pedler also used this fear as a basis for the inspiration of classic Doctor Who monsters the Cybermen, with the creatures being inspired by his own fear of artificial limbs becoming so common that it would become impossible to know when someone had stopped being a man and become simply a machine. Virtuosity speaks of a virtual serial killer who manages to escape to the real world. He goes on a rampage before he is inevitably stopped. This is a true technophobic movie in that its main plot is about technology gone wrong. It introduces a killer who blatantly destroys people. { Technophobia: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology } In the Dune series, Butlerian Jihad is a war between humanity and malevolent artificial intelligence, led by Omnius who explicitly desires extinction of the human race. In the Pixar film WALL-E humans are shown to have evolved into obese, docile, and lazy people as a result of robots being able to do everything for them. Godfrey Reggio&apos;s Qatsi trilogy also deals heavily with issues of technophobia. The idea of keeping the &quot; thinkers &quot; and &quot; workers &quot; separate shows us that even the people who embraced technology feared the potential of it in some way. In the PC game Wing Commander: Privateer, a fanatical quasi-religious group, called the Retros, wishes to overthrow all forms of technology, even if doing so, they themselves have to use it in order to fulfill their goal. They play a central role in the Righteous Fire expansion game, where a new mysterious leader leads the group in an attempt to destroy all non-adherents of their religion.
