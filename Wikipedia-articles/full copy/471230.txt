[ the Napoleonic client-state of the same name Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic) ] [ Poland ] The Free City of Danzig ( [ Freie Stadt Danzig ]; [ Wolne Miasto Gdańsk ] ) was a semi- autonomous city-state that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the Baltic Sea port of Danzig (today Gdańsk ) and surrounding areas.

The Free City included the city of Danzig and over two hundred nearby towns, villages, and settlements. As the League of Nations decreed, the region was to remain separated from the nation of Germany, and from the newly resurrected nation of Poland. The Free City was not an independent state; [ http://books.google.com/?id%3DRFkx76YTmbIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA198%26amp%3Bdq%3D15%2BNovember%2B1920%2Bdanzig#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D15%20November%201920%20danzig%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Public International Law Alina Kaczorowska Routledge 2010 0-203-84847-0 199 ] it was under League of Nations protection and put into a binding customs union with Poland.

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the Free City was abolished and incorporated into the newly formed Reichsgau of Danzig-West Prussia. Widespread anti-Semitic and anti-Polish discrimination and organized murder followed. After the city&apos;s conquest by the Soviet Army in the early months of 1945, large numbers of ethnic German citizens of the former Free City of Danzig were forced to leave (expelled). The city was subsequently put under Polish administration by the Allied Potsdam Agreement, and Polish settlers were brought in to replace the German population. [ Establishment ] [ Tradition of independence and autonomy ] { Danzig gulden note } Danzig had a long tradition of city-state independence of its own. It was a leading player in the Prussian Confederation ( [ Preußischer Bund ], [ Związek Pruski ] ) directed against the Teutonic Monastic State of Prussia. The Confederation stipulated with the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon, that the Polish Crown would be invested with the role of head of state of western parts of Prussia ( Royal Prussia ). In contrast, Ducal Prussia remained a Polish fief. Danzig and other cities such as Elbing and Thorn financed most of the warfare and enjoyed a high level of city autonomy, and Danzig used the title Royal Polish City of Danzig (Polish: [ pl Królewskie Polskie Miasto Gdańsk ] ). In 1569, when Royal Prussia&apos;s estates (German: [ de Landtag ], Polish: [ pl Sejmik ] ) agreed to incorporate the region into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by way of a real union, the city insisted on preserving its special status within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, went through the costly Siege of Danzig in 1577 in order to preserve special privileges, and subsequently insisted on negotiating its issues by sending emissaries directly to the Polish king [ April 2011 ]. The city-state was denied the use of the term of Hanseatic City as part of its official name, which referred to Danzig&apos;s long-lasting membership in the Hanseatic League.

[ Polish rights declared by Treaty of Versailles ] The Free City was to be represented abroad by Poland and was to be in a customs union with it. The German railway line that connected the Free City with newly created Poland was to be administered by Poland, as were all rail lines in the territory of the Free City. On November 9, 1920, a convention that provided for the Presence of a Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig was signed between the Polish government and the Danzig authorities. In article 6, the Polish government undertook not to conclude any international agreements regarding Danzig without previous consultation with the Free City&apos;s government. { Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 6, pp. 190-207. } After local dockworkers had refused to unload ammunition supplies throughout the Polish-Soviet War in 1920, the Westerplatte peninsula (until then a city beach) was also given to Poland to build up an ammunition dump and a military post within the city&apos;s harbor. There was also a separate Polish post office established, besides the existing municipal one.

According to E. Cieślak the population registers of the Free City show that in 1929 the Polish population at over thirty five thousand or 9.5% of the population { Cieślak, E Biernat, C (1995) History of Gdánsk, Fundacji Biblioteki Gdanskiej, P455 } [ April 2012 ] Henryk Stępniak estimates the Polish population up to around 22,000 [ April 2012 ], or around 6% of the population, increasing to around 13% in the 1930s. { Zapiski historyczne: Volume 60, page 256, Towarzystwo Naukowe w Toruniu.

German inhabitants lost their German Citizenship with the creation of the Free City, but were given the right to re-obtain it within the first two years of the state&apos;s existence; however, if they did so they were required to leave their property and make their residence outside of the Free State of Danzig area in the remaining part of Germany.

The executive body of that ecclesiastical province, the consistory (est. 1 November 1886), was seated in Danzig and was restricted after 1920 in its competence to those congregations within the Free City&apos;s territory. { While those congregations in Polish-annexed West Prussia ( } { Pomeranian Voivodeship ) merged into the new } { United Evangelical Church in Poland ( } [ Unierte Evangelische Kirche in Polen ] { ), which emerged from the old-Prussian Posen ecclesiastical province, with its consistory seated in } { Poznań. } The consistory was presided by General Superintendent Paul Kalweit (1920-1933) and Bishop Johannes Beermann (1933-1945). Unlike the Second Polish Republic, which opposed the cooperation of the United Evangelical Church in Poland with EKapU, Volkstag and Senate of Danzig approved cross-border religious bodies so that Danzig&apos;s Regional Synodal Federation — just as the regional synodal federation of the autonomous Memelland — retained the status of an ecclesiastical province within EKapU. { In June 1922 the Senate of Danzig and the old-Prussian executive body, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council (Evangelischer Oberkirchenrat, EOK) concluded a contract to that end. Cf. Adalbert Erler, Die rechtliche Stellung der evangelischen Kirche in Danzig, Berlin: 1929, simultaneously Univ. of Greifswald, Department of Law and Politics, doctor thesis of 21 February 1929, pp. 36  seqq. } After the German annexation of the Free City in 1939 the EKapU merged the Danzig regional synodal federation in 1940 into the Ecclesiastical Region of Danzig-West Prussia (Kirchengebiet Danzig-Westpreußen), also comprising the Polish congregations of the United Evangelical Church in Poland in the homonymous Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and the German congregations in the West Prussia governorate, with Danzig&apos;s consistory functioning as executive body for that region. With the flight and expulsion of most Protestant parishioners from the area of the Free City of Danzig between 1945 and 1948 the congregations vanished. In March 1945 the consistory had relocated to Lübeck and opened there a rescue centre for Danzigers (Hilfsstelle beim evangelischen Konsistorium Danzig) led by Upper Consistorial Councillor Gerhard M. Gülzow. The Lutheran congregation of St. Mary&apos;s Church could relocate its valuable parament collection and the presbytery granted it on loan to St. Annen Museum in Lübeck after the war. Other Lutheran congregations of Danzig could reclaim their church bells, which the Wehrmacht had requisitioned as non-ferrous metal for war purposes since 1940, but which had survived, not yet smelted down, in storages (e.g. Glockenfriedhof ) in the British zone of occupation. The presbyteries granted them usually to Northwestern German Lutheran congregations which had lost bells due to the war. [ Diocese of Danzig of the Roman Catholic Church ] [ Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gdańsk#history Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gdańsk ] { Cathedral of Ss. Trinity, Mary and Bernard in Oliva, Danzig. } The 36 Catholic parish es in the territory of the Free City in 1922 used to belong in equal shares to the then mostly Polish Diocese of Culm and the then mostly German Diocese of Ermland. While the Second Polish Republic wanted all the parishes within the Free City to form part of Polish Culm, Volkstag and Senate wanted them all to become subject to German Ermland. { Georg May, } { Ludwig Kaas : der Priester, der Politiker und der Gelehrte aus der Schule von Ulrich Stutz: 3 vols., Amsterdam: Grüner, 1981-1982 (=Kanonistische Studien und Texte; vols. 33-35), vol. 1, p. 175. ISBN 90-6032-197-9. } The Holy See suspended the jurisdictions of both dioceses over their parishes in the Free State and established an exempt apostolic administration for the territory in 1922. The first apostolic administrator was Edward O&apos;Rourke who became Bishop of Danzig on the occasion of the elevation of the administration to an exempt diocese. He was naturalised as Danziger on the same occasion. In 1938 he resigned after quarrels with the Nazi-dominated Senate of Danzig on appointments of parish priests of Polish ethnicity.

O&apos;Rourke was succeeded by Bishop Carl Maria Splett, a native form the Free City area. Splett remained bishop after the German annexation of the Free City. In early 1941, he applied for admitting the Danzig diocese as member in Archbishop Adolf Bertram &apos;s Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and thus at the Fulda Conference of Bishops; however, Bertram, also speaker of the Fulda conference, rejected the request. { Jerzy Pietrzak, &quot; Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939–1942 und 1945 im Vergleich &quot;, in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939–1989, Hans-Jürgen Karp and Joachim Köhler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: Böhlau, 2001, pp. 157–174, here p. 162. ISBN 3-412-11800-1. } Any arguments that the Free City of Danzig had been annexed to Nazi Germany did not impress Bertram since Danzig&apos;s annexation lacked international recognition. Until the reorganisation of the Catholic dioceses in Danzig and the formerly eastern territories of Germany the diocesan territory remained unaltered and the see exempt. However, with the replacement of Danzig&apos;s population between 1945 and 1948 by mostly Catholic Poles the number of Catholic parishes increased and most formerly Protestant churches were taken over for Catholic services. [ Jewish Danzigers ] [ Jewish Community of Danzig#Free City of Danzig Jewish Community in the Free City of Danzig ] { Great Synagogue on Reitbahn street, Rechtstadt quarter of Danzig. } Since 1883 most of the Jewish congregations in the later territory of Free State had merged into Synagogengemeinde Danzig ( [ Synagogal Community of Danzig ] ). Only the Jews of Tiegenhof (Nowy Dwór Gdański) ran their own congregation (Synagogengemeinde Tiegenhof) until 1938. Danzig became a centre of Polish and Russian Jewish emigration to North America. Between 1920 and 1925 60,000 Jews emigrated via Danzig to the US and Canada. Nonetheless, many remained in Danzig, reinforced by immigrants from Germany quadrupling the number of community members. Native Jews and newcomers established themselves in the city and contributed to its civic life, culture and economy. Danzig became a venue for international meetings of Jewish organisations, such as the convention of delegates from Jewish youth organisations of various nations, attended by David Ben-Gurion, which founded the World Union of Jewish Youth on 2 September 1924 in the Schützenhaus venue. On 21 March 1926 the Zionistische Organisation für Danzig convened delegates of Hechalutz from all over for the first conference in Danzig using Hebrew as common language, also attended by Ben Gurion. With the takeover of a Nazi majority in Volkstag and Senate the situation deteriorated severely. Anti-semitic atrocities and discrimination occurred unsanctioned by the authorities. In contrast to Germany, which exercised capital outflow control since 1931, emigration of Danzig&apos;s Jews was nonetheless somewhat easier, with capital transfer enabled by the Bank of Danzig. Moreover, the comparatively few Danzig Jews were offered easier refuge in safe countries while the numerous Jewish Germans and Jewish Poles were faced with exhausted quotas for them and their fellow nationals. The German November Pogrom was imitated in Danzig a few days later. The Jewish community decided to organise their emigration and managed to rescue most of its members to safe countries.

A Communist Party was founded in 1921 with its origins in the Spartacus League and the Communist Party of East Prussia. Several liberal parties and Free Voter&apos;s Associations existed and ran in the elections with varying success. A Polish Party represented the Polish minority and received between 3% (1933) and 6% (1920) of the vote (in total, 4,358 votes in 1933 and 9,321 votes in 1920). { Die Freie Stadt Danzig, Wahlen 1919–1935 } Initially, the Nazi Party had only a small amount of success (0.8% of the vote in 1927) and was even briefly dissolved.

In spite of approaches repeatedly made by the opposition parties, we rejected any attempt to draw us into action against the Senate. I mentioned quite confidentially that the Polish minority in Danzig was advised not to join forces with the opposition at the time of elections. When Carl J. Burckhardt became High Commissioner in February 1937, both Poles and Germans openly welcomed his withdrawal, and Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Józef Beck notified him not to &quot; count on the support of the Polish State &quot; in the case of difficulties with the Senate or the Nazi Party. { Prazmowska, page 81 } While the Senate appeared to respect the agreements with Poland, the &quot; Nazification of Danzig proceeded relentlessly &quot; { Prazmowska, page 85 } and Danzig became a springboard for anti-Polish propaganda among the German and Ukrainian minority in Poland. { Prazmowska, page 83 } The Catholic Bishop of Danzig, Edward O&apos;Rourke, was forced to withdraw after he had tried to implement four additional Polish nationals as parish priests in October 1937.

It had up to 10,000 refugees on board at the time, including about 1,000 seriously wounded soldiers and sailors. At the Potsdam conference, the Allied Powers agreed that the former Free State was to become part of Poland (The Yalta conference was unclear on this point).
