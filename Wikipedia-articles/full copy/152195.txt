A frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Rickles has acted in comedic and dramatic roles, but is best known as an insult comic. [ Early life ] Rickles was born in the New York City borough of Queens to Max Rickles, who had emigrated in 1902 with his parents Joseph and Frances Rickles from Kaunas, Lithuania { World War I draft registration, NY City, #31-9-149-B, Max S. Rickles, born 12 Aug 1897 in Kovna (Kaunas), Russia } (then in the Russian Empire ), and Etta (Feldman) Rickles, born in New York to immigrant parents from the Austrian Empire. { US Census, 1930.

Rickles grew up in the Jackson Heights area. { Witchel, Alex. &quot; I&apos;m No Howard Stern, You Dummy &quot;, } { The New York Times, August 25, 1996. Accessed 2007-10-08. } After graduating from Newtown High School, Rickles enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served during World War II on the USS &apos;&apos;Cyrene&apos;&apos; as a seaman first class. He was honorably discharged in 1946. Two years later, he studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and then played bit parts on television. Frustrated by a lack of acting work, Rickles began doing stand-up comedy. He became known as an insult comedian by responding to his heckler s. The audience enjoyed these insults more than his prepared material, and he incorporated them into his act. When he began his career in the early 1950s he started calling ill-mannered members of the audience a &quot; hockey puck &quot;. { The Tonight Show with Jay Leno April 15, 2009 } His style was similar to an older insult comic, &quot; Mr. Warmth &quot; Jack E. Leonard, though Rickles denies that Leonard influenced his style. [ http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/drickles.htm MacPherson, Guy Don Rickles Interview The Comedy Couch 2006-10-06 2007-05-17 ] [ Career ] [ 1950s–1960s ] While working in a Miami Beach nightclub known as &quot; Murray Franklin&apos;s &quot; early in his career, he spotted Frank Sinatra and remarked to him, &quot; I just saw your movie, The Pride and the Passion and I want to tell you, the cannon&apos;s acting was great. &quot; He added, &quot; Make yourself at home, Frank. Hit somebody! &quot; Sinatra, whose pet name for Rickles was &quot; bullet-head &quot;, enjoyed Rickles so much that he encouraged other celebrities to see Rickles&apos; act and be insulted by him. Sinatra&apos;s support helped Rickles become a popular headline performer in Las Vegas. [ http://www.thehockeypuck.com/bio.html Biography The Hockey Puck 2007-05-17 ] Rickles earned the nicknames &quot; The Merchant of Venom &quot; and &quot; Mr. Warmth &quot; for his insult comedy, in which he pokes fun at people of all ethnicities and walks of life. When he is introduced to an audience or on a television talk show, Spanish matador music, &quot; La Virgen de la Macarena &quot;, will usually be played, subtly foreshadowing that someone is about to be metaphorically gored. Rickles has said, &quot; I always pictured myself facing the audience as the matador. &quot; In 1958, Rickles made his film debut in a serious part in Run Silent, Run Deep starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster. Throughout the 1960s, he appeared frequently on television in sitcom s and dramatic series. Rickles guest-starred in Get Smart as &quot; Sid &quot;, an old war buddy of Max who comes to stay with him. In an episode of the 1960s drama series Run for Your Life, Rickles played a distressed comedian whose act culminates when he strangles a patron while imploring the patron to &quot; Laugh! &quot; Rickles took a dramatic turn in the Roger Corman film X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes as a carnival barker out to exploit the title character. [ April 2011 ] Rickles also appeared in the popular &apos;&apos;Beach Party&apos;&apos; film series. He recalled in his memoirs that at a White House dinner, Barbara Bush teased him about his decision to appear in those films, and remarked &quot; Was your career really going that badly? &quot; [ April 2011 ]. Rickles&apos; agent, Jack Gilardi, was married to Annette Funicello when Rickles was cast in the Beach Party films. { The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson &apos;&apos;. } { Frank Sinatra was one of the guests that night. } As his career progressed, Rickles began appearing more frequently on television talk show s, first appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1965. He became a frequent guest and guest host, appearing more than 100 times on The Tonight Show during Carson&apos;s era. An early Carson-Rickles Tonight highlight occurred in 1968 when, while two Japanese women treated Carson to a bath and massage by foot, Rickles walked onto the set. At one point, he decided to play massage therapist to the prone and towel-clad Carson. Rickles leaned over and wrapped his arms around Carson, ad-libbing, &quot; I&apos;m so lonely, Johnny! &quot; Carson broke into hysterical laughter, got up, grabbed Rickles, and tossed the suit-clad comedian into the bathtub. Rickles also made frequent appearances on The Dean Martin Show and became a fixture on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast s specials, which continued until 1984. In 1968, Rickles released a live comedy album, Hello, Dummy !, which reached #54 on &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos;&apos;s Hot 100. [ Don Rickles Charts &amp; Awards Allmusic 2007-05-17 ] The same year he starred in his own variety show on ABC, The Don Rickles Show, with comedy writer Pat McCormick as his sidekick. The show lasted one season. During the 1960s, Rickles made guest appearances on The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Munsters, The Addams Family, The Mothers -in- Law, Gilligan&apos;s Island, Get Smart, The Andy Griffith Show and I Dream of Jeannie. [ 1970s–1980s ] [ April 2011 ] In 1970, Rickles had a notable role as the con man Sgt. Crapgame in the hit film Kelly&apos;s Heroes with Clint Eastwood. In 1972, he starred in the sitcom The Don Rickles Show which lasted for thirteen episodes. He also starred in a series of television specials. In his memoir, Rickles acknowledged that a scripted sitcom was not well-suited to his ad-lib style of performing. In 1973 Don Rickles was a popular comedian at The Dean Martin Roasts. In 1976, he starred in the sitcom C.P.O. Sharkey, which lasted two seasons. The show is primarily remembered for the cigarette box incident when Johnny Carson visited during an episode&apos;s taping because he was &quot; incensed &quot; that Rickles broke his cigarette box while Bob Newhart was guest-hosting. The incident was often replayed in Tonight Show retrospective s and was considered a highlight of the 1970s era of the show. Rickles occasionally appeared as a panelist on Hollywood Squares and was depicted in comic book form by Jack Kirby during his work on the Superman&apos;s Pal Jimmy Olsen series. [ 1980s–1990s ] In the early 1980s, Rickles began performing with singer Steve Lawrence in concerts in Las Vegas. In 1983, the duo co-hosted the short-lived ABC-TV series Foul-Ups, Bleeps &amp; Blunders, an imitation of NBC &apos;s TV&apos;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes. In 1985, when Frank Sinatra was asked to perform at Ronald Reagan &apos;s Second Inaugural Ball, he stipulated he would not perform unless Rickles was allowed to perform with him. Rickles considers this performance the highlight of his career. In 1990, he appeared in the second season of Tales From the Crypt in the episode &quot; The Ventriloquist&apos;s Dummy &quot;. In 1992, he was cast in the film Innocent Blood, directed by John Landis. In his memoir, Rickles wrote that he recalled that Landis was once a &quot; Production Assistant &quot; to director Brian G. Hutton during the filming of Kelly&apos;s Heroes. During the filming of Innocent Blood, Rickles would kid Landis by ordering him to get coffee or to run other errands befitting his one-time &quot; gofer &quot; status. In 1993, Rickles starred in another short-lived sitcom, Daddy Dearest, with comedian Richard Lewis. In 1995, he made a return to film in two high-profile projects: a dramatic role as Robert De Niro &apos;s trusted colleague in Martin Scorsese &apos;s Casino, and voicing Mr. Potato Head in the Pixar computer-animated film Toy Story. He reprises the latter role in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. In 1998 he portrayed a movie theater manager in Dirty Work, starring Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange. Again in 1998, he was the voice of Cornwall, one of the heads of a two-headed dragon, in the movie &quot; Quest for Camelot &quot;. [ 2000s–present ] Rickles continued to be very active on the stand-up comedy scene, and is still a popular performer in Las Vegas. [ http://www.pollstar.com/tour/searchall.pl?By%3DArtist%26amp%3BContent%3Drickles Pollstar—Don Rickles Concert Dates 2008-01-05 ] He has no plans to retire as he recently said in an interview: &quot; I&apos;m in good health. I&apos;m working better than I ever have. The audiences are great. Why should I retire? I&apos;m like a fighter. The bell rings and you come out and fight. My energy comes alive. And I still enjoy it. &quot; [ http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20070316%2FENT09%2F703160315%2F1091%2FENT Insults still flying from legendary Don Rickles Darrow, Chuck The Daily Record 2007-03-16 2007-05-17 ] In February 2007, Rickles made a cameo appearance as himself in a strange, recurring dream sequence that was woven through an episode titled &quot; Sub Conscious &quot; of the CBS dramatic series, The Unit. { &quot; The Unit: Sub Conscious &quot;, from TV.com } Rickles&apos; memoir, titled Rickles&apos; Book, was released on May 8, 2007 by Simon &amp; Schuster. Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project, a documentary about Rickles directed by John Landis, made its debut on HBO on December 2, 2007. Rickles won two Emmys for the documentary, including one for &quot; Individual Performance &quot; besting a number of notable comics, including David Letterman, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. To this Rickles remarked, &quot; Stephen Colbert&apos;s a funny man, but he&apos;s too young. He has got plenty of time to win awards, but this may be my last year and I think that I made it count. On second thought it was probably just a mercy award for an old man. &quot; { Jon Stewart Can&apos;t Win an Emmy for his Showdown with Jim Cramer } Rickles reprised the role of Mr. Potato Head in the Toy Story Midway Mania! attraction at Disney California Adventure Park and Disney&apos;s Hollywood Studios.

In 2009, Rickles appeared on Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List and met Griffin&apos;s mother, Maggie, to fulfill one item on Maggie&apos;s &quot; bucket list &quot;. In 2010, he appeared in a commercial during Super Bowl XLIV as a talking rose. On June 27, 2010, he appeared on the 37th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards on CBS TV. In 2011, Rickles joined Joe Pesci in a Snickers advertisement highlighting the actors known for their &quot; short fuses. &quot; [ http://theadbuzz.com/2011/05/joe-pesci-and-don-rickles-join-the-snickers Joe Pesci and Don Rickles Join the Snickers â€œPartyâ€? The Ad Buzz 2011-05-18 2012-05-11 ] Also in 2011, he made a surprise appearance as the late husband of Elka ( Betty White ) on the TV Land original comedy Hot in Cleveland -- a &quot; surprise &quot; because Rickles&apos; character was thought to be dead. [ Style ] It is well known that Rickles has nothing against the people that he insults during his routine, and that it is all just part of the act. Although sarcastically nicknamed &quot; Mr. Warmth &quot; due to his offensive and insensitive stage personality, in reality most know him to be actually quite genial and pleasant. It has been said that being insulted by Rickles is like &quot; wearing a badge of honor &quot;.

I&apos;m always afraid that somewhere out there, there is one person in the audience that I&apos;m NOT going to offend! &quot; [ December 2010 ] Rickles is known for lackadaisically saying the word &quot; anyway &quot; and &quot; let me tell ya this &quot;, following most of his comedic insults, in order to appear nonchalant about the comic volley he had just thrown at an audience member, show host, etc. This is widely regarded as one of Rickles&apos; classic comedic tactics that contribute to his impeccable sense of timing. [ February 2012 ] [ Personal life ] Rickles has been married for more than 45 years to his wife, Barbara, who was raised in Philadelphia. The couple had two children; a daughter Mindy, and a son, producer Larry Rickles, who died in December 2011 at the age of 41.

Rickles is a life-long Democrat. However, he performed at the inaugurations of Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush with his friend Frank Sinatra. { &quot; Time Magazine Interview: Don Rickles &quot;, from Time Magazine } Rickles considers comedian Bob Newhart to be his best friend.
