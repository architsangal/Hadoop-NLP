Azerbaijan geopolitical map with rail and road network The transport in Azerbaijan involves air traffic, waterways and railroads. All transportation activities in Azerbaijan except for oil and gas pipelines are regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Azerbaijan Republic.

[ Railways ] { Azerbaijan Railways map (current) } [ Azerbaijan Railways ] There are [ 2932 km mi on ] kilometers of rail tracks out of which only [ 2117 km mi on ] kilometers are in common carrier service and [ 810 km mi on ] kilometers are industrial lines. [ http://www.indexmundi.com/azerbaijan/railways.html Indexmundi Azerbaijan Railways 2009-12-19 2007-11-01 ] Of the [ 2932 km mi on ] kilometers of rail tracks, 72% or [ 2117 km mi on ] kilometers are single track and 28% or [ 815 km mi on ] kilometers are double track. Of the total exploitation length of route 43% or [ 1272 km mi on ] are electrified. About 38% of the length of the railway routes or [ 1126 km mi on ] are equipped with full automatic blocks and 16% or [ 479 km mi on ] are equippedwith centralized dispatchers. The railways has 176 stations, 2 of which, Bilajari and Shirvan are completely automated, 12 stations have container courts with adapted mechanisms and machines, 3 stations – Keşlə, Ganja and Khirdalan are able to supply high cargo containers. In freight traffic, the exportation of oil from the oil wells from Baku at the Caspian Sea to the Georgian port of Batumi at the Black Sea, forms an important share of the rail transport in Azerbaijan.The freight market share of the Azerbaijan State Railway was 21% in 1999. The freight market share of the railways are also expected to rise rapidly with completion of the Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway. Much of the rail track and rolling stock is in need of repair or replacement.

On September 12, 2007, Musa Panahov, the Deputy Minister of Transport of Azerbaijan, announces that construction on the Baku - Tiblisi - Kars railway will begin in October. Construction is budgeted at $ 200  million, of which $50  million has been allocated from the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan ( SOFAZ ). On November 21, 2007, the presidents of Azerbaijan - Ilham Aliyev, Georgia - Mikheil Saakashvili, and Turkey - Abdullah Gül inaugurated the construction of the railroad at a groundbreaking ceremony at the Marabda junction south of Tbilisi, and the first rails were planned to be laid in April 2008. [ 2008 ] The Russian-Georgian-Ossetian conflict ( 2008 South Ossetia war ) and environmental problems delayed the project, which was originally to be completed by 2010 but is now scheduled for completion by 2012. { Baku-Tbilisi-Kars Line, International www.railway-technology.com } [ Metro System ] City with metro system: Baku Metro in Baku [ Roadways ] { Azerbaijan and } { Georgia at } { Balakan } There are about 25,000 kilometers of roads in Azerbaijan, serving domestic cargo traffic and giving access to international main highways. Highways are mostly in fair condition and need an upgrade to international standards in a view to accommodate growing transit traffic. Main and rural roads are in poor condition and in urgent need of rehabilitation and maintenance. The total vehicle fleet in Azerbaijan was about 517,000 in 2004, with about 49 private passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants, which is quite low compared to European benchmarks but rapidly increasing due to the fast economic growth. Road transport accounted for 54% of all freight in 2003, up from about 48% in 1999. Main highways carrying international traffic are the Baku - Alat - Ganja - Qazakh - Georgian Border corridor (Azerbaijani section of TRACECA corridor) with a length of 503  km and the so-called North-South Corridor that stretches out from the Russia n to the Iran ian border along 521  km. Road connections are disrupted with Armenia because of the unresolved conflict regarding the possession of the Nagorno-Karabakh. Travel between mainland and the detached enclave of Nakhichevan is made by air or by road through Iran. Nakhichevan has a 9-kilometre strategic border with Turkey. Total: 59,141  km Country comparison to the world: 75 Paved: 29,210  km Unpaved: 29,931  km (2004) [ Pipelines ] { Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline } Baku is the centre of a major oil- and gas-producing region, and major long-distance pipelines radiate from the region&apos;s oil fields to all neighboring areas. Pipelines are generally high capacity lines and have diameters of either 1,020 or 1,220 millimeters. The main petroleum pipeline was completed in 2005 under American pressure to limit Russian and Iranian influence in the area. It runs from Baku via Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey, therefore the acronym BTC pipeline. It made partly obsolete the old Soviet pipeline pumping crude oil from the onshore and offshore Caspian fields near Baku west across Azerbaijan and Georgia to the port of Batumi, where the oil is either exported in its crude form or processed at Batumi&apos;s refinery. Two natural gas lines parallel the old petroleum line as far as Tbilisi, where they turn north across the Caucasus Mountains to join the grid of natural gas pipelines that supply cities throughout Russia and Eastern Europe. Condensate 1  km; gas 3,361  km; oil 1,424  km (2008) [ Ports and harbors ] { Baku International Sea Trade Port } Sea and water cargo transportation have vital importance for Azerbaijan, especially in regions where road and rail connections are disputed. Azerbaijan has direct maritime connections only with other Caspian littoral states ( Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan ). However, the Volga - Don canal provides a maritime access to the high seas. The main activity is transport of cargo, mainly of oil and oil products. Shipping regions are Caspian, Black, Mediterranean and Marmara Seas. The main shipping company owes 72 ships, 37 of which are tankers (including 1 water-carrier). Baku International Marine Trade Port is the largest port on the Caspian Sea. Its ferry terminal underwent a major reconstruction supported by a US$16.2 million loan from EBRD. It is now able to handle 30 million tons of freight a year. The Caspian Sea provides vital transport links with other countries and is being used to ship oil until various pipeline projects are completed. On June 4, 2004 the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of Azerbaijan established the Maritime Administration. As the regulatory authority in maritime transport, its functions include participating in the formulation of state policy, regulating transport demand of goods and passengers and for other types of maritime transport services, as well as implementing state programs, concepts and projects for the development of maritime transport.

The national airline is Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL). There are 5 international airports located in Baku, Ganja, Nakhchivan, Lenkaran, Zaqatala. Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku reopened in 1999 after a US$64 million upgrading and extension financed by Turkish company Enka. The airport can now handle 1,600 passengers an hour. The new runways are also able to serve jumbojets. The complete overhaul of International Airport in Nakhchivan has been completed in May 2004. The US$32 million reconstruction project of Ganja Airport has been launched by the Government and was completed by mid 2006. In 2008, two more airports were opened in Azerbaijan. The Lankaran International Airport is located in southern part of Azerbaijan, Zaqatala Airport is in the north-west of Azerbaijan territory.
