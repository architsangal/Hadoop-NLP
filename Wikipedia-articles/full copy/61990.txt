Trilobites form one of the earliest known groups of arthropods. The first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian stage of the Early Cambrian period ( [ Atdabanian ] ), and they flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when, during the Devonian, almost all trilobite orders, with the sole exception of Proetida, died out. Trilobites finally disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about [ 250 ]. The trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, roaming the oceans for over 270 million years. { http://firstlifeseries.com/learn-more/ } When trilobites first appeared in the fossil record they were already highly diverse and geographically dispersed. Because trilobites had wide diversity and an easily fossil ized exoskeleton an extensive fossil record was left behind, with some 17,000 known species spanning Paleozoic time. The study of these fossils has facilitated important contributions to biostratigraphy, paleontology, evolutionary biology and plate tectonics. Trilobites are often placed within the arthropod subphylum Schizoramia within the superclass Arachnomorpha (equivalent to the Arachnata), [ Cotton T. J. S. J. Braddy 2004 The phylogeny of arachnomorph arthropods and the origins of the Chelicerata Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh : Earth Sciences 94 169–193 10.1017/S0263593303000105 3 ] although several alternative taxonomies are found in the literature. Trilobites had many life styles; some moved over the sea-bed as predator s, scavenger s or filter feeder s and some swam, feeding on plankton. Most life styles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites, with the possible exception of parasitism (where there are still scientific debates).

Most scientists believe that order Redlichiida, and more specifically its suborder Redlichiina, contains a common ancestor of all other orders, with the possible exception of the Agnostina. While many potential phylogenies are found in the literature, most have suborder Redlichiina giving rise to orders Corynexochida and Ptychopariida during the Lower Cambrian, and the Lichida descending from either the Redlichiida or Corynexochida in the Middle Cambrian. Order Ptychopariida is the most problematic order for trilobite classification. In the 1959 Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, [ Moore R. C. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part O, Arthropoda 1, Trilobita xix+ 560 pp., 415 figs.

The most recently recognized of the nine trilobite orders, Harpetida, was erected in 2002. [ Ebach M. C. K. J. McNamara 2002 A systematic revision of the family Harpetidae (Trilobita) Records of the Western Australian Museum 21 135–167 ] The progenitor of order Phacopida is unclear. [ Relationship to other taxa ] Once soft-part anatomy had been recovered, the trilobites were originally allied to the Crustacea; however, this suggestion has since fallen out of favour. A relationship with the Chelicerata, in a clade termed Arachnomorpha (Arachnata), was in vogue for some time; a position in the Mandibulata (=Myriapoda + Crustacea + Hexapoda) stem-group may be a more parsimonious alternative.

A few locations ( [ de Lagerstätte n ] ) preserve identifiable soft body parts (legs, gills, musculature &amp; digestive tract) and enigmatic traces of other structures (e.g. fine details of eye structure) as well as the exoskeleton. Trilobites range in length from [ 1 mm 2 ] to [ 72 cm ], with a typical size range of [ 3 - 10 cm on ]. The world&apos;s largest trilobite, Isotelus rex, was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists in Ordovician rocks on the shores of Hudson Bay. [ Rudkin D.A. Young G. A. Elias R. J. Dobrzanske E. P. 2003 The world&apos;s biggest trilobite: Isotelus rexnew species from the Upper Ordovician of northern Manitoba, Canada Palaeontology 70 1 99–112 http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request%3Dget-document%26amp%3Bamp%3Bdoi%3D10.1666%2F0022-3360%282003%29077%3C0099%3ATWBTIR%3E2.0.CO%3B2%26amp%3Bct%3D1 10.1666/0022-3360(2003)077 &lt; 0099:TWBTIR &gt; 2.0.CO;2 ] { tagmata ): 1 – cephalon; 2 – thorax; 3 – pygidium. Trilobites are so named for the three longitudinal lobes: 4 – right pleural lobe; 5 – axial lobe; 6 – left pleural lobe; the antennae and legs are not shown in these diagrams. } The exoskeleton is composed of calcite and calcium phosphate minerals in a protein lattice of chitin that covers the upper surface (dorsal) of the trilobite and curled round the lower edge to produce a small fringe called the &quot; doublure &quot;. Three distinctive tagmata (sections) are present: cephalon (head); thorax (body) and pygidium (tail). [ Terminology ] As might be expected for a group of animals comprising [ 5,000 ] genera, [ Jell P. A. Adrain J. M. Available generic names for trilobites Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 48 2 331–553 2003 ] the morphology and description of trilobites can be complex. However, despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics that distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, dorsal, chitin ous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a thorax comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield ( pygidium ). When describing differences between trilobite taxa, the presence, size, and shape of the cephalic features are often mentioned. During moulting, the exoskeleton generally split between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups facial sutures on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to lobster s and crab s, trilobites would have physically &quot; grown &quot; between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton. [ Cephalon ] [ Cephalon (arthropod anatomy) ] [ right Morphology of the trilobite cephalon center vertical 218 Trilobite cephalon areas numbered.svg alt2 Labeled diagram of cephalon areas of a trilobite The subdivisions can be further broken down into different areas used in describing trilobite cephalic morphology. 1 – preocular area; 2 – palpebral area; 3 – postocular area; 4 – posterolateral projection; 5 – occipital ring; 6 – glabella; 7 – posterior area; 8 – lateral border; 9 – librigenal area; 10 – preglabellar area Trilobite cranidium-en.svg Labeled diagram of major parts of the cephalon The major subdivisions of the cephalon. ] The cephalon of trilobites is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the &quot; crop &quot; or &quot; stomach &quot;. Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the hypostome, a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backwards at the rear edge of the hypostome. Hypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described. { Fortey, 1990 } The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific ecological niche s. { Fortey, 2004 } The anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the Harpetida, in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch. Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon. [ Facial sutures ] Facial or Cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the cephalon of trilobites. Their function was to assist the trilobite in shedding its old exoskeleton during ecdysis (or molting). [ Riccardo Levi-Setti Trilobites University of Chicago Press 1995 978-0-226-47452-6 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DrRyHMz-FkJUC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover ] Primitive trilobites from the Early Cambrian (like Fallotaspis, Eofallotaspis, Schmidtiellus, and Profallotaspis ) lacked facial sutures. They are all classified under the suborder Olenellina. They are believed to have never developed facial sutures, having pre-dated their evolution. Because of this (along with other primitive characteristics), they are thought to be the earliest ancestors of later trilobites. [ B. S. Lieberman Phylogenetic analysis of some basal early Cambrian trilobites, the biogeographic origins of the eutrilobita, and the timing of the Cambrian radiation Journal of Paleontology 76 4 692–708 2002 10.1666/0022-3360(2002)076 &lt; 0692:PAOSBE &gt; 2.0.CO;2 4 ] Some other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily. [ http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/taxa/arthropoda/trilobita/TriOri.html Trilobite Origins Chris Clowes April 15, 2006 Peripatus April 13, 2011 ] The type of sutures found in different species are used extensively in the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites. [ Dorsal sutures ] The dorsal surface of the trilobite cephalon (the frontmost tagma, or the &apos;head&apos;) can be divided into two regions - the cranidium and the librigena ( &quot; free cheeks &quot; ). The cranidium can be further divided into the glabella (the central lobe in the cephalon) and the fixigena ( &quot; fixed cheeks &quot; ). [ Rhona M.

Trilobite facial sutures on the dorsal side can be roughly divided into three main types according to where the sutures end relative to the gena l angle (the edges where the side and rear margins of the cephalon converge).

Example genera showing this type of suture include Dalmanites of Phacopina ( Phacopida ) and Ekwipagetia of Eodiscina ( Agnostida ). Gonatoparian - The facial suture ends at the tip of the genal angle. Example genera showing this type of suture include Calymene and Trimerus of Calymenina ( Phacopida ). Opisthoparian - The facial suture ends at the posterior margin of the cephalon. Example genera showing this type of suture include Peltura of Olenina ( Ptychopariida ) and Bumastus of Illaenina ( Corynexochida ). This is the most common type of facial suture. 600px In some trilobites the sutures may be difficult to see as they run along the margins of the cephalon. This is considered a fourth type of suture known as marginal (or hypoparian sutures). In this type, the sutures run mostly or wholly along the margin of the cephalon. They are not considered for formal phylogenetic classifications like the previous types as they have independently arisen in several groups of trilobites. Hypoparian sutures usually develop from other types of sutures when trilobite groups acquire secondary blindness (a “devolution” of visual organs in some trilobites). The marginal sutures exhibited by the harpetids and trinucleioids, for example, are derived from opisthoparian sutures.

There are also two types of sutures in the dorsal surface connected to the compound eye s of trilobites. [ http://www.trilobites.info/sutures.htm Trilobite Facial Sutures Samuel M. Gon III February 3, 2009 A Guide to the Orders of Trilobites April 13, 2011 ] They are: Ocular sutures - are sutures surrounding the edges of the compound eye. Trilobites with these sutures lose the entire surface of the eyes when molting. It is common among Cambrian trilobites. Palpebral sutures - are sutures which form part of the dorsal facial suture running along the top edges of the compound eye. [ Ventral sutures ] 400px Dorsal facial sutures continue downward to the ventral side of the cephalon where they become the Connective sutures that divide the doublure. The following are the types of ventral sutures. [ Euan Neilson Kerr Clarkson Invertebrate palaeontology and evolution Wiley-Blackwell 1998 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dg1P2VaPQWfUC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 978-0-632-05238-7 ] Connective sutures - are the sutures that continue from the facial sutures past the front margin of the cephalon. Rostral suture - is only present when the trilobite possesses a rostrum (or rostral plate). It connects the rostrum to the front part of the dorsal cranidium. Hypostomal suture - separates the hypostome from the doublure when the hypostome is of the attached type. It is absent when the hypostome is free-floating (i.e. natant). it is also absent in some coterminant hypostomes where the hypostome is fused to the doublure. Median suture - exhibited by asaphid trilobites, they are formed when instead of becoming connective sutures, the two dorsal sutures converge at a point in front of the cephalon then divide straight down the center of the doublure. [ Rostrum ] The rostrum (or the rostral plate) is a distinct part of the doublure located at the front of the cephalon. It is separated from the rest of the doublure by the rostral suture. During molting in trilobites like Paradoxides, the rostrum is used to anchor the front part of the trilobite as the cranidium separates from the librigena. The opening created by the arching of the body provides an exit for the molting trilobite. It is absent in some trilobites like Lachnostoma. [ Hypostome ] The hypostome is the hard mouthpart of the trilobite found on the ventral side of the cephalon typically below the glabella. The hypostome can be classified into three types based on whether they are permanently attached to the rostrum or not and whether they are aligned to the anterior dorsal tip of the glabella. Natant - Hypostome not attached to doublure. Aligned with front edge of glabella. Conterminant - Hypostome attached to rostral plate of doublure. Aligned with front edge of glabella. Impendent - Hypostome attached to rostral plate but not aligned to glabella. Below is an illustration of the three types. The doublure is shown in light brown, the inside surface of the cephalon in gray, and the hypostome in light blue. The glabella is outlined in red broken lines. 600px [ Thorax ] { Phacops rana crassituberculata &apos;&apos; } The thorax is a series of articulated segments that lie between the cephalon and pygidium. The number of segments varies between 2 and 61 with most species in the 2 to 16 range. [ Whittington H. B. Harry B. Whittington Morphology of the Exoskeleton Kaesler R. L.

The pleurae are sometimes abbreviated or extended to form long spines. Apodemes are bulbous projections on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton to which most leg muscles attached, although some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton. [ Bruton D. L. Haas W.

Trilobite fossils are often found &quot; enrolled &quot; (curled up) like modern pill bugs for protection; evidence suggests enrollment helped protect against the inherent weakness of the arthropod cuticle that was exploited by anomalocarid predators. [ Nedin, C. 1999 Anomalocarispredation on nonmineralized and mineralized trilobites Geology 27 11 987–990 10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027 &lt; 0987:APONAM &gt; 2.3.CO;2 http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/11/987 1999Geo....27..987N ] Some trilobites achieved a fully closed capsule (e.g. Phacops ), while others with long pleural spines (e.g. Selenopeltis ) left a gap at the sides or those with a small pygidium (e.g. Paradoxides ) left a gap between the cephalon and pygidium. In Phacops, the pleurae overlap a smooth bevel (facet) allowing a close seal with the doublure. The doublure carries a Panderian notch or protuberance on each segment to prevent over rotation and achieve a good seal. Even in an agnostid, with only 2 articulating thoracic segments, the process of enrollment required a complex musculature to contract the exoskeleton and return to the flat condition. [ Bruton D. L. Nakrem H. A. 2005 Enrollment in a Middle Ordovician agnostoid trilobite Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 50 3 441–448 http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-441.pdf PDF June 22, 2009 ] [ Pygidium ] The pygidium is formed from a number of segments and the telson fused together. Segments in the pygidium are similar to the thoracic segments (bearing biramous limbs) but are not articulated. Trilobites can be described based on the pygidium being micropygous (pygidium smaller than cephalon), subisopygous (pygidium sub equal to cephalon), isopygous (pygidium equal in size to cephalon), or macropygous (pygidium larger than cephalon). [ Prosopon (surface sculpture) ] Trilobite exoskeletons show a variety of small-scale structures collectively called prosopon. Prosopon does not include large scale extensions of the cuticle (e.g. hollow pleural spines) but to finer scale features, such as ribbing, domes, pustules, pitting, ridging and perforations. The exact purpose of the prosopon is not resolved but suggestions include structural strengthening, sensory pits or hairs, preventing predator attacks and maintaining aeration while enrolled. In one example, alimentary ridge networks (easily visible in Cambrian trilobites) might have been either digestive or respiratory tubes in the cephalon and other regions. [ Clarkson E. N. K. Euan Clarkson 1998 Invertebrate Paleontology and Evolution 4th Wiley/Blackwell Science Oxford 0-632-05238-4 452 http://www.google.co.uk/books?id%3Dg1P2VaPQWfUC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPP1%26amp%3Blpg%3DPP1 ] [ Spines ] { Devonian } { Hamar Laghdad Formation, } { Alnif, } { Morocco } Some trilobites such as those of the order Lichida evolved elaborate spiny forms, from the Ordovician until the end of the Devonian period. Examples of these specimens have been found in the Hamar Laghdad Formation of Alnif in Morocco. There is, however, a serious counterfeiting and fakery problem with much of the Moroccan material that is offered commercially. Spectacular spined trilobites have also been found in western Russia; Oklahoma, USA; and Ontario, Canada. Some trilobites had horns on their heads similar to those of modern beetles. Based on the size, location, and shape of the horns the most likely use of the horns was combat for mates, making the Asaphida family Raphiophoridae the earliest exemplars of this behavior. [ Knell R. J. Fortey R. A. 2005 Trilobite spines and beetle horns: sexual selection in the Palaeozoic?

When enrolled trilobites could protect their softer inards.A conclusion likely to be applicable to other trilobites as well, such as in the Phacopid trilobite genus Walliserops that developed spectacular tridents.

The antennae and legs are preserved as reflective carbon films. } [ Soft body parts ] Only 21 or so species are described from which soft body parts are preserved, so some features (e.g. the posterior antenniform cerci preserved only in Olenoides serratus ) [ Whittington H. B. Harry B. Whittington 1980 Exoskeleton, moult stage, appendage morphology, and habits of the Middle Cambrian trilobite Olenoides serratus Palaeontology 23 171–204 ] remain difficult to assess in the wider picture. [ Appendages ] { Triarthrus eatoni &apos;&apos;. } Trilobites had a single pair of preoral antenna e and otherwise undifferentiated biramous limbs (2, 3 or 4 cephalic pairs, followed by a variable number of thorax + pygidium pairs). [ Hughes Nigel 2003 Trilobite tagmosis and body patterning from morphological and developmental perspectives Integrative and Comparative Biology 43 1 185–205 10.1093/icb/43.1.185 http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/185 1 ] Each exopodite (walking leg) had 6 or 7 segments, homologous to other early arthropods. Expodites are attached to the coxa, which also bore a feather-like epipodite, or gill branch, which was used for respiration and, in some species, swimming. The base of the coxa, the gnathobase, sometimes have heavy, spiny adaptations that were used to tear at the tissues of prey. [ Ramskold L. Edgecombe G. D. 1996 Trilobite appendage structure – Eoredlichiareconsidered Alcheringa 20 269–276 10.1080/03115519608619471 4 ] The last exopodite segment usually had claws or spines. Many examples of hairs on the legs suggest adaptations for feeding (as for the gnathobases) or sensory organs to help with walking. [ Whittington H. B. Harry B. Whittington The Trilobite Body.

The mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The &quot; intestine &quot; led backwards from there to the pygidium. The &quot; feeding limbs &quot; attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth, possibly &quot; slicing &quot; the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first. Alternative lifestyles are suggested, with the cephalic legs used to disturb the sediment to make food available. A large glabella, (implying a large stomach), coupled with an impendent hypostome has been used as evidence of more complex food sources, i.e. possibly a carnivorous lifestyle. [ Internal organs ] While there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth, stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart, brain and liver are only implied (although &quot; present &quot; in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence. [ Musculature ] Although rarely preserved, long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to mid way down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way. [ Sensory organs ] Many trilobites had complex eyes; they also had a pair of antenna e. Some trilobites were blind, probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them. As such, they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution. Other trilobites (e.g. Phacops rana and Erbenochile erbeni ) had large eyes that were for use in more well lit, predator-filled waters. [ Antennae ] The pair of antenna e suspected in most trilobites (and preserved in a few examples) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled. Also, one species ( Olenoides serratus ) preserves antennae-like cerci that project from the rear of the trilobite. [ Eyes ] Even the earliest trilobites had complex, compound eyes with lenses made of calcite (a characteristic of all trilobite eyes), confirming that the eyes of arthropods and probably other animals could have developed before the Cambrian.

The number of lenses in such an eye varied: some trilobites had only one, while some had thousands of lenses in a single eye. In compound eyes, the lenses were typically arranged hexagonally. The fossil record of trilobite eyes is complete enough that their evolution can be studied through time, which compensates to some extent the lack of preservation of soft internal parts. Lens es of trilobites&apos; eye s were made of calcite ( calcium carbonate, CaCO 3 ). Pure forms of calcite are transparent, and some trilobites used crystallographically oriented, clear calcite crystals to form each lens of each of their eyes. [ Clarkson E. N.

Lenses were hexagonally close packed, touching each other, with a single corneal membrane covering all lenses. Holochroal eyes had no sclera, the white layer covering the eyes of most modern arthropod s. Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders and through the entirety of the Trilobites&apos; existence. Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface. { Erbenochile erbenii &apos;&apos;; the eye shade is unequivocal evidence that } { some trilobites were diurnal. } [ Fortey R.

Lenses were separate, with each lens having an individual cornea that extended into a rather large sclera. Schizochroal eyes appear quite suddenly in the early Ordovician, and were presumably derived from a holochroal ancestor. Field of view (all around vision), eye placement and coincidental development of more efficient enrollment mechanisms point to the eye as a more defensive &quot; early warning &quot; system than directly aiding in the hunt for food. Modern eyes that are functionally equivalent to the schizochroal eye were not thought to exist, but are found in the modern insect species Xenos peckii. [ Jell P. A. 1975 The abathochroal eye of Pagetia, a new type of trilobite eye Fossils and Strata 4 33–43 ] Abathochroal eyes are found only in Cambrian Eodiscina, had around 70 small separate lenses that had individual cornea. The sclera was separate from the cornea, and did not run as deep as the sclera in schizochroal eyes. Although well preserved examples are sparse in the early fossil record, abathochroal eyes have been recorded in the lower Cambrian, making them among the oldest known. Environmental conditions seem to have resulted in the later loss of visual organs in many Eodiscina. Secondary blindness is not uncommon, particularly in long lived groups such as the Agnostida and Trinucleioidea. In Proetida and Phacopina from western Europe and particularly Tropidocoryphinae from France (where there is good stratigraphic control), there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness. Several other structures on trilobites have been explained as photo-receptors. Of particular interest are &quot; macula &quot;, the small areas of thinned cuticle on the underside of the hypostome. In some trilobites macula are suggested to function as simple &quot; ventral eyes &quot; that could have detected night and day or allowed a trilobite to navigate while swimming (or turned) upside down. [ Sensory pits ] There are several types of prosopon that have been suggested as sensory apparatus collecting chemical or vibrational signals. The connection between large pitted fringes on the cephalon of Harpetida and Trinucleoidea with corresponding small or absent eyes makes for an interesting possibility of the fringe as a &quot; compound ear &quot;. [ Development ] { Elrathia kingii &apos;&apos; growth series with holaspids ranging from 16.2  mm to 39.8  mm in length } Trilobites grew through successive moult stages called instar s, in which existing segments increased in size and new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal generative zone during the anamorphic phase of development. This was followed by the epimorphic developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and moult, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton. The combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth constitutes the hemianamorphic developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods. [ http://www.trilobites.info/ontogeny.htm Trilobite Development Sam Gon III ] Trilobite development was unusual in the way in which articulations developed between segments, and changes in the development of articulation gave rise to the conventionally recognized developmental phases of the trilobite life cycle (divided into 3 stages), which are not readily compared with those of other arthropods. Actual growth and change in external form of the trilobite would have occurred when the trilobite was soft shelled, following moulting and before the next exoskeleton hardened.

Size and morphology of the first calcified stage are highly variable between (but not within) trilobite taxa, suggesting some trilobites passed through more growth within the egg than others. Early developmental stages prior to calcification of the exoskeleton are a possibility (suggested for fallotaspids), but so is calcification and hatching coinciding. The earliest post-embryonic trilobite growth stage known with certainty are the &quot; protaspid &quot; stages (anamorphic phase). Starting with an indistinguishable proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (anaprotaspid) a number of changes occur ending with a transverse furrow separating the proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (metaprotaspid) that can continue to add segments. Segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium but, all segments remain fused together. The &quot; meraspid &quot; stages (anamorphic phase) are marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk. Prior to the onset of the first meraspid stage the animal had a two-part structure  — the head and the plate of fused trunk segments, the pygidium. During the meraspid stages, new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as well as additional articulations developing at the front of the pygidium, releasing freely articulating segments into the thorax. Segments are generally added one per moult (although two per moult and one every alternate moult are also recorded), with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments. A substantial amount of growth, from less than 25% up to 30%–40%, probably took place in the meraspid stages. The &quot; holaspid &quot; stages (epimorphic phase) commence when a stable, mature number of segments has been released into the thorax. Moulting continued during the holaspid stages, with no changes in thoracic segment number. Some trilobites are suggested to have continued moulting and growing throughout the life of the individual, albeit at a slower rate on reaching maturity. Some trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar, which has been called &quot; trilobite metamorphosis &quot;. Radical change in morphology is linked to the loss or gain of distinctive features that mark a change in mode of life. [ Chatterton B. D. E. Speyer S. E. Larval ecology, life history strategies, and patterns of extinction and survivorship among Ordovician trilobites 118–132 1989 Paleobiology 15 ] A change in lifestyle during development has significance in terms of evolutionary pressure, as the trilobite could pass through several ecological niche s on the way to adult development and changes would strongly affect survivorship and dispersal of trilobite taxa. It is worth noting that trilobites with all protaspid stages solely planktonicand later meraspid stages benthic (e.g. asaphids) failed to last through the Ordovician extinctions, while trilobites that were planktonic for only the first protaspid stage before metamorphosing into benthic forms survived (e.g. lichids, phacopids). Pelagic larval life-style proved ill-adapted to the rapid onset of global climatic cooling and loss of tropical shelf habitats during the Ordovician. [ Fossil record ] { Paradoxides &apos;&apos;, may represent the ancestral trilobites. } { Walliserops trifurcatus&apos;&apos;, from Djebel Oufaten, Morocco } The earliest trilobites known from the fossil record are fallotaspids ( order Redlichiida, suborder Olenellina, superfamily Fallotaspidoidea ) and bigotinids (order Ptychopariida, superfamily Ellipsocephaloidea ) dated to some [ 540 520 ].

Fallotaspids lack facial sutures, that is to say fallotaspids are thought to pre-date facial sutures (as opposed to a group that secondarily lost facial sutures). Fallotaspids are strongly suggested to be the ancestral trilobite stock: absence of facial sutures; apparently un-calcified protaspid stages and fallotaspids underlying (pre-dating) or co-existing with all other trilobite occurrences.

[ Origins ] Early trilobites show all of the features of the trilobite group as a whole; there do not seem to be any transitional or ancestral forms showing or combining the features of trilobites with other groups (e.g. early arthropods). Morphological similarities between trilobites and early arthropod-like creatures such as Spriggina, Parvancorina, and other &quot; trilobitomorphs &quot; of the Ediacaran period of the Precambrian are ambiguous enough to make detailed analysis of their ancestry far from compelling. [ http://www.trilobites.info/origins.htm Origins of Trilobites Sam Gon III ] Morphological similarities between early trilobites and other Cambrian arthropods (e.g. the Burgess Shale fauna and the Maotianshan shales fauna) make analysis of ancestral relationships difficult. [ http://www.trilobites.info/triloclass.htm#trilobites Trilobite Classification Sam Gon III ] However, it is still reasonable to assume that the trilobites share a common ancestor with other arthropods prior to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. Evidence suggests significant diversification had already occurred prior to the preservation of trilobites in the fossil record, easily allowing for the &quot; sudden &quot; appearance of diverse trilobite groups with complex, derived characteristics (e.g. eyes). [ Divergence and extinction ] { Olenoides erratus &apos;&apos; from the Mt. Stephen Trilobite Beds ( } { Middle Cambrian ) near } { Field, British Columbia, Canada } For such a long lasting group of animals, it is no surprise that trilobite evolutionary history is marked by a number of extinction events where unsuccessful groups perished while surviving groups diversified to fill ecological niches with more successful adaptations. Generally, trilobites maintained high diversity levels throughout the Cambrian and Ordovician periods before entering a drawn out decline in the Devonian culminating in final extinction of the last few survivors at the end of the Permian period. [ Evolutionary trends ] Principal evolutionary trends from primitive morphologies (e.g. eoredlichids) include the origin of new types of eyes, improvement of enrollment and articulation mechanisms, increased size of pygidium (micropygy to isopygy) and development of extreme spinosity in certain groups. Changes also included narrowing of the thorax and increasing or decreasing numbers of thoracic segments. [ Fortey R. A. Owens R. M. Evolutionary History Kaesler R. L.

Several morphologies appeared independently within different major taxa (e.g. eye reduction or miniaturization). Effacement is also a common evolutionary trend. It is the loss of surface detail in the cephalon, pygidium, or the thoracic furrows. The most notable examples of which happen in the order s Agnostida, Asaphida, and the suborder Illaenina of Corynexochida. It is believed that effacement is an indication of either a burrowing lifestyle or a pelagic one. Effacement poses a problem for taxonomist s since the loss of details (particularly of the Glabella ) can make the determination of phylogenetic relationships difficult.

Gon III July 20, 2008 A Guide to the Orders of Trilobites April 14, 2011 ] [ Pre-Cambrian ] Phylogenetic biogeographic analysis of Early Cambrian Olenellidae and Redlichidae suggests that a uniform trilobite fauna existed over Laurentia, Gondwana and Siberia before the tectonic breakup of the super-continent Pannotia between [ 600 ] and [ 550 ]. Tectonic break up of Pannotia then allowed for the diversification and radiation expressed later in the Cambrian as the distinctive olenellid province ( Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica ) and the separate Redlichid province (Australia, Antarctica and China). [ Fortey R. A. Briggs D. E. G. Wills M. A.

[ Cambrian ] Very shortly after trilobite fossils appeared in the lower Cambrian, they rapidly diversified into the major orders that typified the Cambrian— Redlichiida, Ptychopariida, Agnostida and Corynexochida. The first major crisis in the trilobite fossil record occurred in the Middle Cambrian, surviving orders developed isopygus or macropygius bodies and developed thicker cuticles, allowing better defense against predators (see Thorax above). The end Cambrian mass extinction event marked a major change in trilobite fauna; almost all Redlichiida (including the Olenelloidea) and most Late Cambrian stocks went extinct. A continuing decrease in Laurentia n continental shelf area is recorded at the same time as the extinctions, suggesting major environmental upheaval. [ Ordovician ] { Cheirurus sp. &apos;&apos;, middle } { Ordovician age, } { Volkhov River, } { Russia } { Isotelus rex &apos;&apos;, the largest known trilobite from the middle to upper } { Ordovician of } { North America } The Early Ordovician is marked by vigorous radiations of articulate brachiopods, bryozoans, bivalves, echinoderms, and graptoloids with many groups appearing in the fossil record for the first time. Although intra-species trilobite diversity seems to have peaked during the Cambrian, [ Mark Webster A Cambrian peak in morphological variation within trilobite species Science 317 499–502 2007 10.1126/science.1142964 17656721 5837 ] trilobites were still active participants in the Ordovician radiation event with a new fauna taking over from the old Cambrian one. Phacopida and Trinucleioidea are characteristic forms, highly differentiated and diverse, most with uncertain ancestors. The Phacopida and other &quot; new &quot; clade s almost certainly had Cambrian forebears, but the fact that they have avoided detection is a strong indication that novel morphologies were developing very rapidly. Changes within the trilobite fauna during the Ordovician foreshadowed the mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician allowing many families to continue into the Silurian with little disturbance. [ Adrain Jonathan M. Fortey Richard A. Richard Fortey Westrop Stephen R. Post-Cambrian trilobite diversity and evolutionary faunas Science 280 1809 1998 10.1126/science.280.5371.1922 9632387 5371 1922–5 ] Ordovician trilobites were successful at exploiting new environments, notably reefs. However, the end Ordovician mass extinction did not leave the trilobites unscathed; some distinctive and previously successful forms such as the Trinucleioidea and Agnostida became extinct. The Ordovician marks the last great diversification period amongst the trilobites, very few entirely new patterns of organisation arose post-Ordovician; later evolution in trilobites was largely a matter of variations upon the Ordovician themes. By the Ordovician mass extinction vigorous trilobite radiation has stopped and gradual decline beckons. [ Silurian and Devonian ] { Phacopid trilobite, } { Devonian age, } { Ohio, United States } [ Tribnod1.jpg Image of phacopidan trilobite Calymene tristani in nodule. 450 152 ] Most Early Silurian families constitute a subgroup of the Late Ordovocian fauna. Few, if any, of the dominant Early Ordovician fauna survived to the end of the Ordovician, yet 74% of the dominant Late Ordovician trilobite fauna survived the Ordovician. Late Ordovician survivors account for all post-Ordovician trilobite groups except the Harpetida. Silurian and Devonian trilobite assemblages are superficially similar to Ordovician assemblages, dominated by Lichida and Phacopida (including the well-known Calymenina ). However, a number of characteristic forms do not extend far into the Devonian and almost all the remainder were wiped out by a series of drastic Middle and Late Devonian extinction s. Three orders and all but five families were exterminated by the combination of sea level changes and a break in the redox equilibrium (a meteorite impact has also been suggested as a cause). Only a single order, the Proetida, survived into the Carboniferous. [ Carboniferous and Permian ] The Proetida survived for millions of years, continued through the Carboniferous period and lasted until the end of the Permian (where the vast majority of species on Earth were wiped out). It is unknown why order Proetida alone survived the Devonian. The Proetida maintained relatively diverse faunas in deep water and shallow water, shelf environments throughout the Carboniferous. For many millions of years the Proetida existed untroubled in their ecological niche. An analogy would be today&apos;s crinoid s, which mostly exist as deep water species; in the Paleozoic era, vast &apos;forests&apos; of crinoids lived in shallow near-shore environments. [ Final extinction ] Exactly why the trilobites became extinct is not clear; with repeated extinction events (often followed by apparent recovery) throughout the trilobite fossil record, a combination of causes is likely. After the extinction event at the end of the Devonian period, what trilobite diversity remained was bottlenecked into the order Proetida. Decreasing diversity [ Owens R. M.

With so many marine species involved in the Permian extinction, the end of nearly 300 million successful years for the trilobite is hardly surprising. The closest extant relatives of trilobites may be the horseshoe crab s, or the cephalocarids.

Within the marine paleoenvironment, trilobites were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water. Trilobites, like brachiopods, crinoids, and corals, are found on all modern continents, and occupied every ancient ocean from which Paleozoic fossils have been collected. The remnants of trilobites can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton, which it sheds in the process known as ecdysis. In addition, the tracks left behind by trilobites living on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils. There are three main forms of trace fossils associated with trilobites: Rusophycus; Cruziana &amp; Diplichnites  – such trace fossils represent the preserved life activity of trilobites active upon the sea floor. Rusophycus, the resting trace, are trilobite excavations involving little or no forward movement and ethological interpretations suggest resting, protection and hunting. [ Baldwin C.

Because they appeared quickly in geological time, and moulted like other arthropods, trilobites serve as excellent index fossil s, enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found. They were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention, and new species are being discovered every year. A famous location for trilobite fossils in the United Kingdom is Wren&apos;s Nest, Dudley in the West Midlands, where Calymene blumenbachi is found in the Silurian Wenlock Group.
