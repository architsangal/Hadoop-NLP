Every fall hunters flock to this Northeast region of Utah to try and score trophy bucks. Many families continue the tradition of deer hunting in the area and have done so with much success. Recently many private landowners in the area have begun restricting hunters from shooting game in their fields. Also, Ute Indian tribal lands are off limits during the hunt. Both of these facets continue to negatively affect the overall likelihood of being successful within town limits and thus forces hunters to focus their hunting time in areas such as Tabiona Mountain or West Fork. Elk hunting and fishing are also very popular pastimes in the area. [ Religion ] The dominant religion in Tabiona is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The local church building is about half a block from the high school.
