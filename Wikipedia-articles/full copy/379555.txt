[ August 2011 ] [ 21 101 #017E60 ] { European Parliament } [ 0 6 #017E60 ] The Estonian Centre Party ( [ Eesti Keskerakond ] ) is a centrist, social liberal party in Estonia. Keskerakond is a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party. It has the largest membership of an Estonian party, with over 12 000 members. The party was founded on 12 October 1991, on the basis of the Popular Front of Estonia after several parties had split from it. At that time, the party was called Rahvakeskerakond (People&apos;s Centre Party), in order to differentiate from the smaller Maa-Keskerakond (Rural Centre Party). The party&apos;s chairman is Edgar Savisaar. Vice chairmen of the party are Kadri Simson and Enn Eesmaa. The party claims that its goal is the formation of a strong middle class in Estonia. Keskerakond declares itself as &quot; middle class liberal party &quot;; however, against the backdrop of Estonia&apos;s economically liberal policies, the Centre Party has a reputation of having more left-leaning policies. It supports small enterprises. [ April 2010 ] It is by far the most popular party among Russians in Estonia. [ History ] In general elections in March 1995, CPE placed third with 14.2% of votes and 16 seats. It entered the coalition, Savisaar taking the position of the Minister of Internal Affairs, and 4 other ministerial positions (Social Affairs, Economy, Education and Transportation &amp; Communications). After the &quot; tape scandal &quot; (secret taping of talks with other politicians) where Savisaar was involved, the party was forced to go to opposition. A new party was formed by those who were disappointed by their leader&apos;s behaviour. Edgar Savisaar became the Chairman of the City Council of the capital city Tallinn. In 1996, CPE candidate Siiri Oviir ran for the presidency of Estonia. In the general elections in March 1999, Keskerakond, whose main slogan was progressive income tax, gained 23.4% of votes (the first result) and 28 seats in the Riigikogu. CPE members are active in its 26 branches – eight of them are active in Tallinn, 18 in towns and counties. The Centre Party became the member of the ELDR European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party in 2003 London Congress. The party applied for the membership of the Liberal International (LI) in 2001, but the LI decided to reject the party&apos;s application in August 2001, as Savisaar&apos;s conduct was adjudged to &apos;not always conform to liberal principles&apos;. [ Political parties of the world Day Alan John 2002 John Harper London 978-0-9536278-7-5 165 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DpmwYAAAAIAAJ ] In 2001, Kreitzberg ran for the presidency of Estonia. In January 2002, Keskerakond and the Reform Party formed a new governmental coalition where Centre Party got 8 ministerial seats (Minister of Defense, Education, Social Affairs, Finances, Economy &amp; Communications, Interior, Agriculture and Minister of integration and national minorities). The coalition stayed until the new elections in 2003, in which the party won 28 seats. Though the Centre Party won the greatest percent of votes, it was in opposition until March, 2005 when Juhan Parts&apos; government collapsed. In 2003, the majority of the party&apos;s assembly did not support Estonia&apos;s joining the European Union (EU). Savisaar did not express clearly his position. A number of Keskerakond members left the party in fall 2004, mostly due to objections with Savisaar&apos;s autocratic tendencies and the party&apos;s anti-EU stance, forming the Social Liberal group. Some of them joined the Social Democratic Party, others the Reform Party and others the People&apos;s Party. One of these MPs later rejoined Keskerakond. Keskerakond is affiliated with the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party since July 2003. Savisaar was the Mayor of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, from 2001 to fall 2004, when he was forced to step down after a vote of no confidence. He was replaced by Tõnis Palts of Res Publica. In 2004 Keskerakond gained one member in the European Parliament – Siiri Oviir. The Centre Party gathered 17.5% share of votes on the elections to the European Parliament. Keskerakond participated in government with the Estonian Reform Party and the People&apos;s Union of Estonia from 12 April 2005 until a new government took office after the March 2007 elections. They had 5 minister portfolios (Edgar Savisaar as Minister of Economy, also Minister of Social Affairs, Education, Culture and Interior). Local elections on 16 October 2005 were very successful to the Centre Party. Keskerakond managed to win 32 seats out of 63 in Tallinn City Council, having now an absolute majority in that municipality. One of the factors behind this success in Tallinn was probably the immense popularity of Centre Party among Russian speaking voters. The controversial contract of co-operation between the Estonian Centre Party and the Russian party of power United Russia has probably contributed to the success in ethnic Russian electorate as well. Centre Party formed one-party government in Tallinn was led by Jüri Ratas, a 27 year old politician elected the Mayor of Tallinn in November 2005. He was replaced by Savisaar in April 2007. [ http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/17623/ Article baltictimes.com ] The Centre Party is also a member of coalitions in 15 other major towns of Estonia like Pärnu, Narva, Haapsalu and Tartu. In the Estonian parliamentary election, 2007, they received 143,528 votes (26.1% of the total), an improvement of +0.7%. They took 29 seats, a gain of one seat compared to the 2003 elections, though due to the 2004 defections which had decreased their strength, they actually gained 10 seats. They are now the second largest party in Parliament and the largest opposition party. IEight Top-Ranking Members to Leave Centre Party (1) n 2008, the party criticised Andrus Ansip &apos;s policies, that in Centre Party&apos;s opinion have contributed to Estonia&apos;s economic problems of recent times. On June 16, 2007, Edgar Savisaar and Jaan Õmblus published a proposal of how to improve what they regard as Estonia&apos;s economic crisis. [ http://kesk.eurorscg4d.ee/news.php?nsID%3D3dd48ab31d016ffcbf3314df2b3cb9ce%26amp%3Blang%3Dest Keskerakond ] In the European Parliament elections of 2009, the Centre Party gained the most votes and 2 out of 6 Estonian seats, which were filled by Siiri Oviir and Vilja Savisaar. In local elections of 2009, the party strengthened its absolute majority in the Tallinn city council. Despite their absolute majority, they formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party. Recent polls suggest the party is especially popular amongst Estonia&apos;s Russophone minority. { http://www.postimees.ee/?id=305551 } On 9 April 2012 eight prominent Centre Party members decided to leave the party citing frustration of their attempts to bring openness and transparency into party leadership. Previously MP Kalle Laanet was expelled on 21 March for his criticism of the party leadership. The leaving politicians included MEPs Siiri Oviir and Vilja Savisaar-Toomast, MPs Inara Luigas, Lembit Kaljuvee, Deniss Boroditš and Rainer Vakra, and also Ain Seppik, Toomas Varek.
