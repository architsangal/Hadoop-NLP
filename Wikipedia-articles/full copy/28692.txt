[ November 2011 ] Sabermetrics is the specialized analysis of baseball through objective evidence, especially baseball statistics that measure in-game activity. The term is derived from the acronym SABR, which stands for the Society for American Baseball Research. It was coined by Bill James, who is one of its pioneers and is often considered its most prominent advocate and public face. [ General principles ] The Sabermetric Manifesto by David Grabiner (1994) [ http://baseball1.com/baseball-archive/sabermetrics/sabermetric-manifesto/ The Sabermetric Manifesto &quot; David J. Grabiner The Baseball Archive ] begins: Bill James defined sabermetrics as &quot; the search for objective knowledge about baseball. &quot; Thus, sabermetrics attempts to answer objective questions about baseball, such as &quot; which player on the Red Sox contributed the most to the team&apos;s offense? &quot; or &quot; How many home runs will Ken Griffey hit next year? &quot; It cannot deal with the subjective judgments which are also important to the game, such as &quot; Who is your favorite player? &quot; or &quot; That was a great game. &quot; It may, however, attempt to settle questions such as &quot; Was Willie Mays faster than Mickey Mantle ? &quot; by establishing several possible parameters for examining speed in objective studies (how many triples each man hit, how many bases each man stole, how many times he was caught stealing) and then reaching a tentative conclusion on the basis of these individual studies. Sabermetricians frequently question traditional measures of baseball skill. For instance, they doubt that batting average is as useful as conventional wisdom says it is because team batting average provides a relatively poor fit for team runs scored. [ http://knology.net/~johnfjarvis/runs_survey.html A Survey of Baseball Player Performance Evaluation Measures Jarvis J. 2003-09-29 2007-11-02 ] Sabermetric reasoning would say that runs win ballgames, and that a good measure of a player&apos;s worth is his ability to help his team score more runs than the opposing team. This may imply that the traditional RBI (runs batted in) is an effective metric; however, sabermetricians also reject RBI, for a number of reasons. Rather, sabermetric measures are usually phrased in terms of either runs or team wins. For example, a player might be described as being worth 54 runs more than a replacement-level player at the same position over the course of a full season, as the sabermetric statistic VORP can indicate. Sabermetrics is concerned both with determining the value of a player or team in current or past seasons and with attempting to predict the value of a player or team in the future. Many areas of study are still in development, specifically in the area of performance measurement. [ Early history ] Sabermetrics research began in the middle of the 20th century. Earnshaw Cook was one of the earliest researchers of sabermetrics. Cook gathered the majority of his research in his 1964 book, Percentage Baseball. The book was the first of its kind to gain national media attention, [ Albert James Jay M.

He became GM of the New York Mets in late 2010. Billy Beane - Athletics&apos; General Manager since 1997. Although not a public proponent of sabermetrics, it has been widely noted that Beane has steered the team during his tenure according to sabermetric principles. In 2003, Michael Lewis published Moneyball about Billy Beane&apos;s use of a more quantitative approach. In 2011, a film based on Lewis&apos; book which dramatised Beane&apos;s use of sabermetrics was released, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Beane. Carson Cistulli - Senior editor of FanGraphs, Cistulli is the founder of statistics such as SCOUT and NERD, and one of the first poets to include sabermetrics in his poetic oeuvre.

He began publishing his Baseball Abstracts in 1977 to study some questions about baseball he found interesting, and their eclectic mix of essays based on new kinds of statistics soon became popular with a generation of thinking baseball fans. He discontinued the Abstracts after the 1988 edition, but continued to be active in the field. His two Historical Baseball Abstract editions and Win Shares book have continued to advance the field of sabermetrics, 25 years after he began. In 2002 James was hired as a special advisor to the Boston Red Sox.

The website also publishes original research on baseball. It demonstrates and promotes the use of graphs and charts. FanGraphs is a website that publishes advanced baseball statistics as well as graphics that evaluate and track the performance of players and teams. The site also favors the analysis of play-by-play data and Pitch f/x. It draws on some of the advanced baseball metrics developed by well-known sabermetricians such as Tom Tango and Mitchel Lichtman. SABR is the Society for American Baseball Research, founded in 1971, and the root of the term sabermetrics. Statistical study, however, is only a small component of SABR members&apos; research, which also focuses on diverse issues including ballparks, the Negro Leagues, rules changes, and the desegregation of baseball as a mirror of American culture. Fielding Bible Awards are voted on by a panel of sabermetically inclined writers to recognize the best defensive player for each fielding position. It provides an alternative to the Gold Glove Awards, the traditional measurement of fielding excellence.
