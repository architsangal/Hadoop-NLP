[ August 2011 ] [ August 2011 ] [ the class of vehicle drivetrains other uses Four by four/Four-wheel drive (disambiguation) ] [ All-wheel drive the all-wheel drive in motorcycles two-wheel drive ] { Jeep Wrangler is a 4WD vehicle with a transfer case to select low range or high range 4WD. } Four-wheel drive, 4WD, or 4×4 ( &quot; four by four &quot; ) is a four-wheeled vehicle with a drivetrain that allows all four wheel s to receive torque from the engine simultaneously. While many people associate the term with off-road vehicle s and Sport utility vehicle s, powering all four wheels provides better control than normal road cars on many surfaces, and is an important part in the sport of rallying. In abbreviations such as 4×4, the first figure is normally the total number of wheels, and the second the number of powered wheels. (The numbers actually refer to axle-ends, which may have more than one wheel.) 4×2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits engine power to only two axle-ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive. [ http://4wheeldrive.about.com/cs/offroadingtips/a/aa021401a.htm Walczak Jim 4WD vs 2WD: The Differences Between 4×4 And 4×2 about com 7 August 2010 ] [ 4WD versus AWD ] Controls for locking center, front, and rear differentials independently. In the view of some, it is the ability to lock differentials that distinguishes 4WD from AWD. The term four-wheel drive typically describes larger passenger vehicles that may allow the driver to manually switch (sometimes with an automatic option) between two-wheel-drive mode (if available) for streets and four-wheel-drive mode for low- traction conditions such as ice, mud, snow, or loose gravel. All-wheel drive (AWD) most typically describes a &quot; full time &quot; 4WD that may be used on dry pavement. These systems incorporate an inter-axle differential that allows the front and rear wheels to turn at different speeds. This eliminates driveline binding, wheel hop, and other driveline issues associated with use of 4WD on dry pavement. Because all four tires in a full-time AWD system are connected by a system of differentials, they are potentially very susceptible to spin when a wheel loses traction. Without sophisticated traction control systems, they would become immobilized when any one of the four tires lost traction. A traditional part time 4WD system does not connect the front and rear via a differential, and therefore does not suffer any front/rear torque reduction—if a front tire loses traction, it does not reduce torque delivered to the rear tires, even without traction control systems. Part-time 4WD systems are mechanically simpler and cheaper than AWD systems. Also, a part-time 4WD transfer case is usually equipped with a reduction gear setting, or, low range, which provides for higher torque at lower speeds, a vital feature for vehicles that see much off-road use. In AWD systems a more expensive separate reduction gearbox is usually used. The main drawback of 4WD is that because it lacks a center differential, a part-time 4WD system can only be used in low traction situations where the wheels have the ability to slip as needed. For these reasons, full-time AWD is appropriate for improving on-road handling and is seen on cars and crossover/sports utility vehicles, while traditional part-time 4WD systems without center differentials, or with locking center differentials, are better for heavy-duty use such as off-road or in deep snow and are commonly seen on trucks and truck-based SUVs. Identical drivetrain systems are commonly marketed under different names for a particular nameplate&apos;s branding and, conversely, different drivetrain systems are commonly marketed under the same name for brand uniformity. Audi &apos;s quattro, Mercedes-Benz &apos;s 4Matic, BMW with the xDrive, Saab &apos;s XWD, and Volkswagen &apos;s 4motion, for example, can mean either an automatically engaging &quot; on-demand &quot; system with Borg-Warner ITM 3e magnetic or Haldex Traction hydraulic clutch, or a continuously-operating permanent 4WD system with a Torsen (torque-sensing) or other type of a differential. [ 4WD versus IWD ] The term Individual-wheel drive is coined to identify those electric vehicles whereby each wheel is driven by its own individual electric motor. This system essentially has inherent characteristics that would be generally attributed to Four-Wheel drive systems like the distribution of the available power to the wheels. The IWD drive is not limited to 4 wheels as there is generally a motor that drives each wheel that can number upwards of 4, but could also identify a single wheeled vehicle. [ Design ] Diagram of front-engined 4WD [ Differentials ] { Lamborghini Murciélago is an AWD that powers the front via a } { viscous coupling unit if the rear slips. } { HMMWV is a 4WD/AWD that powers all wheels evenly (continuously) via a manually lockable center differential, with } { Torsen differentials for both front and rear. } { Subaru Impreza } { rally car uses AWD for traction. } When powering two wheels simultaneously the wheels must be allowed to rotate at different speeds as the vehicle goes around curves. The problem is even more complicated when driving all four wheels. A design that fails to account for this makes the vehicle handle poorly on turns, fighting the driver as the tires slip and skid from the mismatched speeds. A differential allows one input shaft to drive two output shafts independently with different speeds. The differential distributes torque (angular force) evenly, while distributing angular velocity (turning speed) such that the average for the two output shafts is equal to that of the differential ring gear. Each powered axle requires a differential to distribute power between the left and the right sides. When all four wheels are driven, a third differential can be used to distribute power between the front and the rear axles. The described system handles extremely well, as it is able to accommodate various forces of movement, and distribute power evenly and smoothly; making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheelslip. [ Limiting slippage ] Traction control was invented to solve this problem for 2WD vehicles. When one wheel spins out of control the brake is automatically applied to that wheel. By preventing one wheel from spinning freely, power is divided between the pavement for the non-slipping wheel and the brake for the slipping wheel. This is an effective solution, although it causes additional brake wear and may cause a sudden jolt that affects handling. By extending traction control to act on all four wheels the simple three-differential AWD design limits wheel spin. This design is common on luxury crossover SUV s [ April 2012 ]. Locking differential s work by temporarily locking together a differential&apos;s output shafts, causing all wheels to turn at the same rate, providing torque in case of slippage. This is generally used for the center differential, which distributes power between the front and the rear axles. While a drivetrain that turns all wheels equally would normally fight the driver and cause handling problems, this is not a concern when wheels are slipping. The two most common factory-installed locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit to join the shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle&apos;s computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior [ April 2012 ]. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer. A third approach to limiting slippage is the Torsen differential. A Torsen differential allows the output shafts to receive different amounts of torque. This design does not provide for traction when one wheel is spinning freely, where there is no torque. It provides excellent handling in less extreme situations [ April 2012 ]. A typical Torsen II differential can deliver up to twice as much torque to the high traction side before traction is exceeded at the lower tractive side. Finally, many lower-cost vehicles entirely eliminate the center differential. These vehicles behave as 2WD vehicles under normal conditions. When the drive wheels begin to slip, one of the locking mechanisms discussed above joins the front and rear axles. Such systems distribute power unevenly under normal conditions and thus do not help prevent the loss of traction, instead only enabling recovery once traction is lost. Most minivan 4WD/AWD systems are of this type, usually with the front wheels powered during normal driving conditions and the rear wheels served via a viscous coupling unit. Such systems may be described as having a 95/5 or 90/10 power split. [ August 2011 ] [ History ] The 1903 Spyker 60 H.P. 4WD Center transfer case sending power from the transmission to two output shafts: to the rear axle (visible on the right) as well as to the front axle (on the left side). Selection lever In 1893, before the establishment of a modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer Bramah Joseph Diplock patented a four-wheel-drive system for a traction engine, including four-wheel steering and three differentials, which was subsequently built. The development also incorporated Bramah&apos;s Pedrail wheel system in what was one of the first four-wheel-drive automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh&apos;s previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads. Ferdinand Porsche designed and built a four-wheel-driven Electric vehicle for the k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner &amp; Co. at Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition at Paris. An electric hub motor at each wheel powered the vehicle. Although clumsily heavy, the vehicle proved a powerful sprinter and record-breaker in the hands of its owner E.W. Hart. Due to its unusual status the so-called Lohner-Porsche is not widely credited as the first four-wheel-driven automobile. The first four-wheel-drive car, as well as hill-climb racer, with internal combustion engine, the Spyker 60 H.P., was presented in 1903 by Dutch brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker of Amsterdam.

Designs for four-wheel drive in the U.S., came from the Twyford Company of Brookville, Pennsylvania in 1905, six were made there around 1906; one still exists and is displayed annually. { The Novak Guide to the Dana Spicer Model 18 Transfer Case, Novak Conversions. Retrieved on 2010-01-13. } The second U.S. four-wheel-drive vehicle was built in 1908 by (what became) the Four Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD) of Wisconsin (not to be confused with the term &quot; FWD &quot; as an acronym for front-wheel drive). FWD would later produce around 15,000 of its four-wheel-drive Model B trucks for the British and American armies during World War I.

The Quad not only came with four-wheel drive and four-wheel brakes, but also featured four-wheel steering. The Reynolds-Alberta Museum has a four-wheel-drive &quot; Michigan &quot; car from about 1905 in unrestored storage. The Marmon-Herrington Company was founded in 1931 to serve a growing market for moderately priced four-wheel-drive vehicles. Marmon-Herrington specialized in converting Ford trucks to four-wheel drive and got off to a successful start by procuring contracts for military aircraft refueling trucks, 4×4 chassis for towing light weaponry [ 27 Trailer Towing Tips Jimmy Nylund http://www.fourwheeler.com/techarticles/129_0607_trailer_towing/index.html February, 2009 ], commercial aircraft refueling trucks, and an order from the Iraqi Pipeline Company for what were the largest trucks ever built at the time.

Daimler-Benz also has a history in four-wheel drive. In 1907 the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called Dernburg-Wagen, also equipped with four-wheel steering, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated four-wheel drive, the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4×4 featured full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the G500 and G55 AMG still feature some of the attributes, with the exception of fully independent suspension since it hinders suspension articulation. The Unimog is another Mercedes truck. It was not until &quot; go-anywhere &quot; vehicles were needed for the military that four-wheel drive found its place. The Jeep, originally developed by American Bantam but mass-produced by Willys and Ford, became the best-known four-wheel-drive vehicle in the world during World War II. Willys (since 1950 owner of the Jeep name) introduced the CJ-2A in 1945 as the first full-production four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. Possibly beaten by the 1938 GAZ-61. The Land Rover appeared at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948, originally conceived as a stop-gap product for the struggling Rover car company, and despite chronic under-investment succeeded far better than the passenger cars. Land Rover developed a luxury 4WD with the Range Rover in the 1970s, which, unlike some offerings from other manufacturers, was capable of serious off-road use. The inspiration was a Willys MB that was frequently run off-road on the farm belonging to chief engineer Maurice Wilks, and was felt that it needed some refinement. Kaiser Jeep, the successor to Willys, introduced a 4WD wagon called the Wagoneer in 1963. It was revolutionary at the time, not only because of its technical innovations such as an independent front suspension and the first automatic transmission with 4WD, but also because it was equipped and finished as a regular passenger automobile.

Its high level of equipment made it the first &quot; luxury &quot; SUV. American Motors (AMC) acquired Kaiser&apos;s Jeep Division in 1970 and quickly upgraded and expanded the entire line of serious off-road 4WD vehicles.

Subaru introduced the mass-produced Leone in 1972 featuring a part-time four-wheel-drive system that could not be engaged on dry pavement. The American Motors Company introduced a full time AWD vehicle the same year as the Subaru in the Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer with Quadra Trac (1973 model year first models sold in Sept 1972).

The new Eagles combined Jeep technology with an existing and proven AMC passenger automobile platform. They ushered a whole new product category of &quot; sport-utility &quot; or crossover SUV. AMC&apos;s Eagles came with the comfort and high-level appointments expected of regular passenger models and used the off-road technology for an extra margin of safety and traction.

Audi also introduced a permanently all-wheel-driven road-going car, the Audi Quattro, in 1980. Audi&apos;s chassis engineer, Jorg Bensinger, had noticed in winter tests in Scandinavia that a vehicle used by the German Army, the Volkswagen Iltis, could beat any high-performance Audi. He proposed developing a four-wheel-drive car, that would also used for rallying to improve Audi&apos;s conservative image. The Audi Quattro system was successful and became a feature on production cars. In 1987, Toyota also developed a car built for competition in rally campaigns.

The All-Trac system was later available on serial production Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, and Toyota Previa models. Some of the earliest mid-engined four-wheel-drive cars were the various road-legal rally cars made for Group B homologation, such as the Ford RS200 made from 1984 to 1986. In 1989, niche maker Panther Westwinds created a mid-engined four-wheel-drive, the Panther Solo 2. In 2008, Nissan introduced the GT-R featuring a rear mounted transaxle. The AWD system requires two drive shaft s, one main shaft from the engine to the transaxle and differential and a second drive shaft from the transaxle to the front wheels.

Bugatti created a total of three four-wheel-drive racers, the Type 53, in 1932, but the cars were notorious for having poor handling. Ferguson Research Ltd. built the front-engine P99 Formula One car that actually won a non-World Championship race with Stirling Moss in 1961. In 1969, Team Lotus raced cars in the Indy 500 and two years later in Formula 1 with the Lotus 56, that had both turbine engines and 4WD, as well as the 4WD-Lotus 63 that had the standard 3-litre V8 Ford Cosworth engine. Matra also raced a similar MS84, and McLaren entered their M9A in the British Grand Prix, while engine manufacturers Ford-Cosworth produced their own version which was tested but never raced. All these F1 cars were considered inferior to their RWD counterparts, as the advent of aerodynamic downforce meant that adequate traction could be obtained in a lighter and more mechanically efficient manner, and the idea was discontinued, even though Lotus tried repeatedly. Nissan and Audi had success with all-wheel drive in road racing with the former&apos;s advent of the Nissan Skyline GT-R in 1989. So successful was the car that it dominated the Japanese circuit for the first years of production, going on to bigger and more impressive wins in Australia before weight penalties eventually levied a de facto ban on the car. Most controversially was the win pulled off at the 1990 Macau Grand Prix where the car led from start to finish. Audi &apos;s dominance in the Trans-Am Series in 1988 was equally controversial as it led to a weight penalty mid season and to a rule revision banning all-AWD cars, its dominance in Supertouring eventually led to a FIA ban on AWD system in 1998.

The first to utilize a 4WD system was Case Corporation (then known as J.I. Case Co.), who designed a hearty four-wheel-drive system that was instantly tested, and placed on several models of their Loader/Backhoe line. This system was first used in 1987, and has become somewhat of a benchmark in construction equipment. Today, several construction equipment manufacturers offer a 4WD system as an option on their equipment, mostly backhoes. The 4WD systems on construction equipment are much stronger and larger than their automobile counterparts, incorporating several redundancies in their design, it is also equipped with an external method of lubricating the gears inside of the transfer case, and the front differential, which are both monitored in the cab by temperature gauges, this is to primarily prevent overheating, and welding of the gears in the transfer case. The change in outer appearance of a loader–backhoe equipped with 4WD is instantly noticeable, mostly in the difference of the front hubs, which are flat in design, instead of having the standard rear drive appearance, with the large cone protruding from the rims. The second noticeable difference is the design of the front tires, which have a tread on them similar to that of the rear tires, but in smaller scale. The final difference is usually the designation &quot; 4×4 &quot;, placed somewhere noticeable, usually on either the battery box or the rear fenders. [ Terminology ] Even though in the general context, the term &quot; four-wheel drive &quot; usually refers to an ability that a vehicle may have, it is also used to designate the entire vehicle itself. In Australia, vehicles without significant off-road abilities are often referred to as All-Wheel Drives (AWD) or SUVs, while those with off-road abilities are referred to as &quot; four-wheel drives &quot;. This term is sometimes also used in North America, somewhat interchangeably for SUV s and pickup trucks and is sometimes mistakenly applied to two-wheel-drive variants of these vehicles. The term 4×4 (read: four by four) was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles as early as the 1940s, { Instruction Book: Driving, Maintenance, Repair. Department of National Defence, Canada. Ford Motor Company of Canada and General Motors Products of Canada. 1940., available from } with the first number indicating the total number of wheels on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels. Today, the term 4×4 is common in North America, and is generally used when marketing a new or used vehicle, and is sometimes applied as badging on a vehicle equipped with four-wheel drive. Similarly, a 4×2 would be appropriate for most two-wheel-drive vehicles, and is often used to describe them as a two-wheel drive. In Australia the term is often used to describe a ute that sits very high on its suspension. This is to avoid the confusion that the vehicle might be a 4×4 because it appears otherwise suited to off-road applications. Large American trucks with dual tires on the rear axles and two driven axles are officially designated as 4×4s, despite having six driven wheels, because the &quot; dual &quot; wheels behave as a single wheel for traction and classification purposes, and are not individually powered. True six-wheel-drive vehicles with three powered axles such as the famous M35 2½ ton cargo truck used by the U.S. Army has three axles (two rear, one front), all of them driven. This vehicle is a true 6×6, as is the Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe. Another related term is 4-wheeler (or four-wheeler). This generally refers to all-terrain vehicle s with four wheels, and does not indicate the number of driven wheels; a &quot; four-wheeler &quot; may have two- or four-wheel drive. (In CB slang, truckers refer to any two-axled vehicle as a &quot; four-wheeler &quot;, sometimes in a derogatory context, as distinguished from an &quot; eighteen-wheeler &quot; or tractor/trailer.) [ Unusual systems ] Prompted by a perceived need for a simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, the French motor manufacturer Citroën developed the 2CV Sahara. Unlike other 4×4 vehicles which use a conventional transfer case to drive the front and rear axle, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards. The two throttles, clutches and gear change mechanisms could be linked, so the two [ 12 hp kW 0 on ] [ 425 cc CID 0 on ] engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two separate drive trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today. [ http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/frame.php?file%3Dcar.php%26amp%3Bcarnum%3D1870 Citroën 2CV Sahara - Ultimatecarpage.com - Images, Specifications and Information Ultimatecarpage.com 2010-08-07 ] Enthusiasts have built their own &quot; new &quot; Saharas, by rebuilding a 2CV and fitting the modified engine, gearbox and axle onto a new, strengthened chassis. BMC experimented with a twin-engine Mini Moke (dubbed the &quot; Twini Moke &quot; ) in the mid-1960s, but never put it into production. This made advantage of the Mini&apos;s &apos;power pack&apos; layout, with a transverse engine and the gearbox in the engine sump. Simply by fitting a second engine/gearbox unit across the rear, a rudimentary 4×4 system could be produced. Early prototypes had separate gear levers and clutch systems for each engine. Later versions sent for evaluation by the British Army had more user-friendly linked systems. In 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick, patented, GB 1113068, a 4WD system that used hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick&apos;s design that did not use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system&apos;s integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios. Suzuki Motors introduced the Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Edition in 1996. Earlier Suzuki versions were twin engined, from 1996 on the engine is a twin-turbocharged 2.0  L V6, mated to a sequential 6-speed manual transmission. Nissan Motors has developed a system called E4WD. It designed for cars that are normally front-wheel drive, however the rear wheels are powered by electric motors. This system was introduced in some variants of the Nissan Cube and Tiida. (This is similar to the system used on the Ford Escape Hybrid AWD. [ http://www.edmunds.com/ford/escapehybrid/2009/review.html 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Review and Specs Edmunds.com 2009-08-01 ] ) Chrysler&apos;s Jeep Division debuted the twin engine, [ 670 hp kW 0 on ] Jeep Hurricane concept at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This vehicle has a unique &quot; crab crawl &quot; capability, which allows it to rotate 360° in place. This is accomplished by driving the left wheels as a pair and right wheels as a pair, as opposed to driving the front and rear pairs. A central gearbox allows one side to drive in the opposite direction to the other. It also has dual Hemi V8s. Some hybrid vehicles such as the Lexus RX400h provide power to an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to the front wheels and one to the rear. In the case of the AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the Harrier hybrid), the front wheels can also receive drive power directly from the vehicle&apos;s gasoline engine as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an all-wheel-drive system. The 4RM system used in the Ferrari FF is unique in that it uses two gearboxes, in addition to the traditional Ferrari rear transaxle behind the engine, the system also uses a smaller transaxle drawing power from the front of the engine, sending it to the front wheels as needed. To save space and weight the front transaxle only has three forward speeds (and no reverse). Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to &apos;slip&apos; to give the required road wheel speeds. The system usually operates in the rear-drive only mode and only engages the clutches for the front transaxle when the rear wheels start losing grip.

Since there is no center differential to allow for speed differences between the front and rear wheels when turning, a small amount of tire slippage must occur during turns. When used on slick surfaces, this is not a problem, but when turning on dry pavement, the tires grip, then are forced to slip, then grip again, and so on, until the turn is completed. This causes the vehicle to exhibit a &apos;hopping&apos; sensation. Using part-time 4WD systems on dry pavement is not recommended, as damage to the drive-line eventually occurs.
