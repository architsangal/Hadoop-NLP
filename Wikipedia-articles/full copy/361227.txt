[ Elliot 1869 ] { * Pallasicarbo perspicillatus } [ Coues 1869 ] { * Carbo perspicillatus } [ Rothschild 1907 ] { * Compsohalieus perspicillatus } The Spectacled Cormorant or Pallas&apos;s Cormorant (Phalacrocorax perspicillatus { Phalacrocorax, } { Ancient Greek word for cormorants (literally &quot; bald raven &quot; ). perspicillatus, } { Latin for &quot; spectacled &quot;, in allusion of the birds&apos; large size. } ) is an extinct marine bird of the cormorant family of seabird s that inhabited Bering Island and possibly other places in the Komandorski Islands and the nearby coast of Kamchatka. [ BirdLife International 2008 144628 Phalacrocorax perspicillatus 05 March 2011 ] A presumed prehistoric record from Amchitka Island, Alaska (Siegel-Causey et al., 1991), is based on misidentification of Double-crested Cormorant remains (Olson, 2005). It is the largest species of cormorant known to have existed. [ Discovery ] Illustration from 1913 The species was first identified by Georg Steller in 1741 on Vitus Bering &apos;s disastrous second Kamchatka expedition. He described the bird as large, clumsy and almost flightless — though it was probably reluctant to fly rather than physically unable — and wrote &quot; they weighed 12 – 14 pounds, so that one single bird was sufficient for three starving men. &quot; Though cormorants are normally notoriously bad-tasting, Steller says that this bird tasted delicious, particularly when it was cooked in the way of the native Kamtchadal s, who encased the whole bird in clay and buried it and baked it in a heated pit. [ Ellis Richard Richard Ellis (biologist) No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species Harper Perennial 2004 New York 135 0-06-055804-0 ] Apart from the fact that it fed on fish, almost nothing else is known about this bird. The population declined quickly after further visitors to the area started collecting the birds for food and feather s, and their reports of profitable whaling grounds and large populations of Arctic fox es and other animals with valuable pelts led to a massive influx of whalers and fur traders into the region; the last birds were reported to have lived around 1850 on Ariy Rock ( [ Арий Камень ] { Ariy Kamen&apos;. Often misspelt &quot; Aji Kamen &quot; or even &quot; Aii Kimur &quot;. } )islet, off the northwestern tip of Bering Island.
