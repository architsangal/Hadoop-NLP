[ November 2010 ] Official Xbox Banner used on games exclusive to Xbox This is a list of all 968 games for the Xbox video game console. The list includes fifty-eight titles exclusive to Europe, twenty-four exclusive to Japan, three titles exclusive to Australasia. See Lists of video games for related lists. The column &quot; Exclus. &quot; indicates whether the Xbox is the only platform on which the game is available. This does not include handheld game consoles or mobile phones which generally run a completely different version of the game under the same name. A value of &quot; Console &quot; for exclusivity means that, while a title may be available as an arcade game or on a PC using Microsoft Windows, Unix / Linux, or Mac OS X, it is not available on any other video game console in its native mode. The games that are compatible with the Xbox 360 will require a software update to play.Some games may not be available in your country.
