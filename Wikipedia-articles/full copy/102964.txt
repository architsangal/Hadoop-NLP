Orchard Pond was a small camp, having only four campsites during its entire lifetime. It was used from 1927 to 1947, when it was sold. The council moved its summer camp operations to Camp Semialachee, located on the west side of Moore Lake south of SR 20 on the Silver Lake Road west of Tallahassee. Semialachee got its name indirectly from the union of &quot; Seminole &quot; and &quot; Apalachee &quot;, two primary groups of Native Americans in the United States from the north Florida region. Camp Semialachee was kept until 1965, when camping was moved to Wallwood Scout Reservation, located just south of Quincy, Florida. The land for the new camp was donated by Dr. Charlie K. Wall and his wife Margaret as a gift to Scouting. The buildings and equipment were donated by various community leaders, Scouters, and organizations. The dedication of Wallwood came in 1964, the buildings were constructed in 1965, and the first camping season was the summer of 1966. Wallwood covers over [ 500 acre km2 ] of land bordered on one side by a branch of Lake Talquin.
