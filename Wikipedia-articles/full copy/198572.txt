[ May 2011 ] [ Biography ] Steller was born in Windsheim, near Nuremberg in Germany, son to Johann Jakob Stöhler (after 1715, Stöller), and studied at the University of Wittenberg. He then traveled to Russia, arriving in November 1734. He met the naturalist Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt (1685 –1735) at the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Two years after Messerschmidt&apos;s death, Steller married his widow and acquired notes from his travels in Siberia not handed over to the academy. [ Egerton Frank N. A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 27: Naturalists Explore Russia and the North Pacific During the 1700s Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 89 1 39–60 2008 10.1890/0012-9623 (2008) 89 [39:AHOTES] 2.0.CO;2 ] Steller heard about Vitus Bering ’s Second Kamchatka Expedition, that had already left St Petersburg in February 1733. He volunteered to join it and was accepted. He then left St Petersburg in January 1738, met Johann Georg Gmelin in Yeniseisk in January 1739, and finally reached Okhotsk and the main expedition in March 1740. In September 1740, the expedition sailed to the Kamchatka Peninsula. Steller spent the winter in Bolsherechye, where he helped to organize a local school. He was then appointed to join Bering on the voyage to America. The expedition landed in Alaska at Kayak Island on Monday 20  July 1741, wanting only to stay long enough to take on fresh water. Steller forced Captain Bering to give him more time for his expedition and was granted 10  hours. During this time, as the first non-native to have set foot upon Alaskan soil, Steller became the first European naturalist to describe a number of North American plants and animals, including a jay later named Steller&apos;s Jay. Of the 6  species of birds and mammals that were discovered by Steller, two are extinct (the Steller&apos;s sea cow and the Spectacled Cormorant ), and three are endangered or in severe decline ( Steller&apos;s sea lion, Steller&apos;s Eider and Steller&apos;s Sea Eagle ). The sea cow, in particular, a massive northern relative of the manatee, lasted barely 25  years after Steller discovered and named it, a victim of over-hunting by the Russian crews that followed in Bering&apos;s wake. The Steller&apos;s Jay is one of the few species named after Steller that is not currently endangered. In his brief encounter with the bird, Steller was able to deduce that the jay was kin to the American Blue Jay, a fact which seemed proof that Alaska was indeed part of North America. { Tyumen, Siberia, where he had died of fever, aged 37, over 260 years earlier. } On the return journey the expedition was shipwrecked on what later became known as Bering Island. In the aftermath of the ship&apos;s sinking, Bering died and almost half of the crew perished from scurvy. The remaining men made camp with little food or water, a situation made only worse by frequent raids by arctic fox es. Despite the hardships the crew endured, Steller studied the flora, fauna, and topography of the island in great detail. Of particular note were the only detailed behavioral and anatomical observations of Steller&apos;s sea cow, a large sirenian mammal whose global range was confined to the shallow kelp beds around the Commander Islands, and which was driven to extinction within 30  years of discovery by Europeans. Based on these and other observations, Steller later wrote De Bestiis Marinis (‘On the Beasts of the Sea’)., describing the fauna of the island, including the Northern fur seal, the sea otter, Steller&apos;s sea lion, Steller&apos;s sea cow, Steller&apos;s Eider and the Spectacled Cormorant. Steller claimed the only recorded sighting of the marine cryptid Steller&apos;s sea ape. In the spring of 1742 the crew constructed a new vessel to return to Avacha Bay and nicknamed it The Bering. Steller spent the next two years exploring the Kamchatka peninsula. He was recalled to Saint Petersburg but caught a fever on the journey and died at Tyumen. His journals, which did reach the Academy and were later published by Peter Simon Pallas, were used by other explorers of the North Pacific, including Captain Cook. [ Legacy ] There is a secondary school in Anchorage, Alaska named after him: Steller Secondary School.
