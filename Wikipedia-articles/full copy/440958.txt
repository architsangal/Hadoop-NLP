[ September 2011 ] During the American Revolutionary War (1775–83) the management and treatment of prisoners of war (POW) was very different from the standards of modern warfare. Modern standards, as outlined in the Geneva Conventions, expect captives to be held and cared for by their captors. One primary difference in the eighteenth century was that care and supplies for captives were expected to be provided by their own army, their government, or private resources. However, it was not until seven years into the conflict and only one year before the Treaty of Paris (1783) officially ended the war, and primarily as a consequence of the Battle of Yorktown in 1781 resulting in the second British army of the war being captured, that American combatants were finally recognized as POWs by the Parliament of Great Britain in 1782. [ Background ] Throughout the war, there were exchanges of prisoners. These were made in the field or at higher levels of organization. Usually high ranking officer exchanges were negotiated for specifically named people. There were some exchanges based on numbers for random lower ranking people, but these were limited. Three other aspects were different from those normally seen in modern warfare. The first is that letters were permitted and sometimes even encouraged. Prisoners could buy or exchange for food and clothing, including any money sent by their families. The second was the use of &apos;Parole&apos; by both sides. This would allow prisoners some freedom, in exchange for their promise not to resume the war. The last is that prisoners were encouraged to enlist in the army of the other side. Over the course of the war, as much as a quarter of each army had actually seen service on the other side. [ July 2007 ] [ American prisoners ] George III of Great Britain had declared American forces traitors in 1775, which denied them prisoner of war status. However, British strategy in the early conflict included pursuit of a negotiated settlement and therefore official s declined to try and/or hang them, the usual procedure for treason, to avoid unnecessarily risking any public sympathy the British might have enjoyed in the Americas. The Continental Army capture of a British army at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 resulted in thousands of British prisoners in the hands of the Americans. This had the effect of further dissuading British officials from hanging prisoners, despite the abandoned hopes of a settlement by this stage, as they feared reprisals on prisoners being held by the Americans. Neither policy, however, prevented the British from treating common American military members being held prisoner far more harshly than the standards of the day for POWs allowed. { West, Charles E.. &quot; Horrors of the prison ships: Dr. West&apos;s description of the wallabout floating dungeons, how captive patriots fared. &quot; Eagle Book Printing Department, 1895. } In actuality, a malicious British neglect resulted in starvation and disease slowly and torturously achieving the same results as hanging for many American prisoners, or disability and inhumane suffering for most others who were not officers or otherwise likely to be useful in prisoner exchanges. { Andros, Thomas. &quot; The old Jersey captive: Or, A narrative of the captivity of Thomas Andros...on board the old Jersey prison ship at New York, 1781.

American prisoners tended to be accumulated at these sites. New York City was a major site of occupation, where sugar houses were used to detain prisoners.

Facilities at these places were limited. At times the occupying army was actually larger than the total civilian population. The British solution to this problem was to use obsolete, captured, or damaged ships as prisons. { Dring, Thomas and Greene, Albert. &quot; Recollections of the Jersey Prison Ship &quot; (American Experience Series, No 8).

Elias Boudinot, as one of these commissaries, was competing with other agents seeking to gather supplies for George Washington &apos;s army at Valley Forge. During the war, at least 16 hulks, including the infamous HMS &apos;&apos;Jersey&apos;&apos;, were placed by British authorities in the waters of Wallabout Bay off the shores of Brooklyn, New York as a place of incarceration for many thousands of American soldiers and sailors during about 1776 –83. The prisoners were harassed and abused by guards who, with little success, offered release to those who agreed to serve in the British Navy. { Taylor, George. &quot; Martyrs To The Revolution In The British Prison-Ships In The Wallabout Bay. &quot; (originally printed 1855) Kessinger Publishing, LLC.

Their corpses were often tossed overboard, though sometimes they were buried in shallow graves along the eroding shoreline. { Stiles, Henry Reed. &quot; Letters from the prisons and prison-ships of the revolution. &quot; Thomson Gale, December 31, 1969.

Their labor made up for shortages caused by the number of men serving in the American army. Usually their return was room and board, supplied by the contractor. Notable prisoners included John Burgoyne, Charles Cornwallis and John Andre. [ References ] [ Further reading ] Armbruster. Eugene L. The Wallabout Prison Ships: 1776-1783. New York, 1920.
