[ Kokushi Daijiten (国史大辞典) Magatama http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ 2012-04-02 2012 Shogakukan Tokyo ] The beads, also described as jewels, were made of primitive stone and earthen materials in the early period, but by the end of the Kofun period were made almost exclusively of jade. Magatama originally served as decorative jewelry, but by the end of the Kofun period functioned as ceremonial and religious objects.

Magatama from the Jōmon period period were irregularly shaped, lacked continuity in form from region to region, and have been called &quot; Stone Age magatama &quot; for this reason. Magatama are thought to be an imitation of the teeth of large animals, pierced with a hole, which are found in earlier Jōmon remains. [ Dijitaru daijisen Magatama http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ 2012-04-01 2012 Shogakukan Tokyo ] These resemble magatama, but more recent scholarship indicates that these early Jōmon may have simply had a decorative function, and have no relationship to magatama. Magatama in the Jōmon period appear to have moved from the purely decorative to having a status and ceremonial function by the end of the period.

The Kamegaoka remains are among the largest known Jōmon settlement in Japan, and the magatama, among other decorative objects found, may be an indicator of the high social status of the settlement. Other sites associated with the Kamegaoka settlement have yielded magatama, including the Ōboriya shell mound, in the northwest corner of Ōfunato Bay, which yielded a huge number of beads, as well as the Karekawa site, near Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture. Remains from the Karekawa site kan be seen at the Karekawa Achaeogical Museum in Hachinohe. Stone and clay magatama and magatama-like bead s have also been discovered at the Amataki site, Ninohe, Iwate Prefecture, Osagata site, Ibaraki Prefecture, and the Kou site, Fujiidera, Osaka Prefecture. Numerous magatama at the Ōishi site, Bungo-ōno, Ōita Prefecture, Kyūshū show signs of being used for ceremonial, rather than decorative, purposes. The Sannai-Maruyama site, excavated 1992 in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture, yielded 3 large jade beads, 5.5  cm x 6.5  cm. [ Yayoi period ] [ Kobe Archaeology Center 神戸市埋蔵文化財センター Kōbeshi Maizō Bunkazai Sentā ] Magatama in the Yayoi period, ca. 300 BC to 300 AD, are notably different than Jōmon period magatama. The jewels moved from a primitive, non-standard form towards more polished and uniform form in this period. The technology to cut large gemstones and polish jewels notably advanced in the Yayoi period.

Yayoi period magatama are noted for their reverse C-shaped form, which by the end of the period became an almost squared shape. From the Yayoi period on magatama uniformly feature a bored hole that allowed the jewels to be held on a string. The Yayoi period is marked by specific centers specializing in magatama and the widespread trade of magatama. The period is marked by the formation of power centers that came to be individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including magatama. Magatama producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically rice, leading to the widespread distribution of magatama across Japan.

The necklace was typically constructed of jadeite magatama separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small beads of dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet was typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze.

In 2003 the excavation of a large Yayoi period settlement in Tawaramoto, Nara Prefecture revealed two large jade magatama, one, the second in length. The larger Tawaramoto magatama is the 10th largest found to date in Japan. Both jade magatama from the site are of unusually high-quality brilliant green jade. 弥生で最大級のひすい製品　唐古・鍵遺跡出土の勾玉 One known center of Yayoi magatama production was in the area of the Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine in Osaka. Tamatsukuri literally means &quot; jewel making &quot; and a guild, the Tamatsukuri-be, was active from the Yayoi period. An existing jewel at the shrine is said to have great spiritual power. Magatama appear on all sorts of implements of the present-day temple, including amulet s, roof tile s, and lanterns. The inari female fox at the gate of a subshrine of Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine wears a necklace of magatama. The shrine has an exhibit on the history and production of magatama. [ Kofun period ] Necklace of jade magatama from a Japanese burial Magatama became very common in the Kofun period, ca. 250 AD to 538 AD., and by the end of the period almost all kofun tumuli contained magatama. In the early Kofun period magatama were made from jadeite as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from jasper, and by the end of the period, almost exclusively of agate and jade. Magatama capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large magatama made of talc, imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as funerary objects. Magatama are found in kofun tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave good s.

A bronze mirror imported from China accompanying the burial is dated to 239 AD. The kofun is a Designated Historical Spot of the city of Kishiwada. Ceremonial offerings from a burial from the Kisami-Araida area of Shimoda, Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture reveal clay reproductions of magatama used as effigies. The excavation of the Ubusuna Kofun 史跡　産土山古墳 in Kyōtango, Kyoto Prefecture yielded two fully intact magatama necklaces of jade and agate with segments between 1.7 and 5.1  cm in length. The large Muro Miyayama Kofun of Katsuragi, Nara, Nara Prefecture on the Yamato Plain, 238m m in length, was plundered long before its excavation, but revealed 600 talc ceremonial magatama among other funerary objects, which also included 10 bronze Han Chinese mirrors. The Hiraide remains of Shiojiri, Nagano Prefecture, is one of the three largest prehistorical sites in Japan, and was far from any any regional power center. The Hiraide site not only includes typical Kofun period remains, but also objects associated with modern Shinto ceremonial practice. Nevertheless, kofun in Hiraide reveal both plain and elaborate magatama among other funerary objects. The Sakurai Kofun in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture, excavated in 1949, represents a kofun from the final phase of the Kofun period, and is possibly from a ruler associated with the imperial family. The kofun is high and shows evidence of being surrounded by a moat s. Among the very large number of funerary objects were high-quality weapons, including swords, 10 mirrors, and a necklace of jadeite magatama, agate cylinders, and glass beads used to make a magatama-style necklace. [ Origin of magatama forms ] Archaeologists and historians are unable yet to explain what the origins of magatama forms are, or whether these forms can be traced back to one convergent source. However, these alternative explanations have been provided: Magatama may be fashioned after animal fangs/teeth Magatama may be modeled after the shape of fetuses Magatama could symbolize the shape of the soul Magatama are patterned after large comma shapes Magatama may be modeled after the shape of the moon That there is meaning and connotation attached to the shape of the magatama itself (i.e. meaning comes from the form itself, and not that magatama has been patterned after anything else) Magatama comes from the recycled use of broken earrings [ Magatama in Japanese mythology ] Artist&apos;s rendition of Amaterasu emerging from the cave; Amaterasu holds a magatama necklace in her left hand with a sword The Kojiki and Nihon shoki, completed in the 8th century, have numerous references to magatama. They appear in the early in the first chapter of the Nihon shoki, which largely describes the mythology of Japan. Susanoo, god of the sea and storms, received five hundred magatama from Tamanoya no mikoto, or Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto, the jewel-making deity.

Gogok of the kingdom of Silla and magatama of the Yayoi and Kofun period show a strong connection; { Golden Treasures: The Royal Tombs of Silla } historical and archaeological evidence establishes strong economic and cultural ties between East Asia and Japan in this period. The usage of magatama and gogok were not exactly similar. Magatama and gogok were both used in decorative jewelry, and later for ceremonial purposes. Gogok, however, were used in large crowns, a practice not seen in the Japanese arcaeaological record to date. Japanese scholarship on the relationship between gogok and magatama suggests a variety of possibilities. Some scholars suggests that magatama originated from Japan and spread to Korea. Other Japanese scholarship suggests an ambiguous connection between the magatama of Japan and similar jewels of the Korean Peninsula, and more generally, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and region north of China. Lacking a complete archaeological picture, the relationship between gogok and magatama remains unclear. &quot; The magatama&apos;s origins are more controversial. These curved jewels of jadeite are common in Kofun Period burials, and they are common also in Korean sites of the same age. But magatama are found in Yayoi sites, too, and unquestionable true magatama are reported also in Jomon sites in Tohoku, Japan as early as about 1000 B.C., long before true magatama appeared in Korea. &quot; (Charles Keally) { Kofun Culture } The Encyclopædia Britannica equates magatama with gogok, but offers no supporting references.
