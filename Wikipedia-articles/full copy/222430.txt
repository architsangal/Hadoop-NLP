Al-Gharb, meaning &quot; The West &quot; ) is the southernmost region of mainland Portugal. It has an area of [ 5,412 km2 sqmi ] with approximately 450,484 [ Censos 2011 Resultados Preliminares 2011 INE http://www.ine.pt/scripts/flex_v10/Main.html ] permanent inhabitants, and incorporates 16 municipalities. { http://www.ine.pt/scripts/flex_v10/Main.html } The region coincides with the Faro District, and has as its administrative centre the city of Faro, where both the region&apos;s international airport at Faro (FAO) and public university (the University of the Algarve ) are located. Tourism and related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve&apos;s summer economy. Fish, seafood and fruit production, which includes oranges, carob bean s, fig s and almond s, are other important activities in the region. The Algarve is the most popular tourist destination in Portugal, and one of the most popular in Europe. Its population triples in the peak holiday season thanks to a high influx of visitors, and receives an average of 7 million foreign tourists each year. In total, including national visitors, almost 10 million people visit the Algarve every year. The Algarve is currently the third richest region in Portugal, with a GDP per capita of 86% of the European average. { ESTAT-2002-05354-00-00-EN-TRA-00 (FR) } [ History ] [ Kingdom of the Algarve ] { Lagos } { Silves. Silves was the capital of the Algarve during } { Moorish rule. } Human presence in southern Portugal dates back to the Neolithic, and Palaeolithic. The presence of megalithic stones in the area of Vila do Bispo attests to this presence. The Conii, influenced by Tartessos, were established by the sixth century BC in the region of the Algarve. They would be strongly influenced by the Celtici. The Phoenicians had established trading ports along the coast circa 1000 BC. The Carthaginians founded Portus Hanibalis — known today as Portimão in about 550 BC. The Romans in the 2nd century BC spread through the Iberian Peninsula, and many Roman ruins can still be seen in the region, notably in Lagos. Roman bath complexes and fish salting tanks have been found near the shore in several locations, for example the ones near Vilamoura and Praia da Luz. In the 5th century the Visigoths took control of the Algarve until the beginning of the Moorish invasion in 711. When the Moors conquered Lagos in 716 it was called Zawaia. Faro, which the Christian residents had called Santa Maria, was renamed Faraon, which means &quot; the settlement of the Knights. &quot; Due to the Moorish conquest of Iberia, the region was called Al-Gharb Al-Andalus; Al-Gharb (الغرب) means &quot; the west &quot;, while Al-Andalus is the Arabic name of Muslim Iberia. But, for several years, the town of Silves was the capital of the region under Moorish rule. In the mid-12th century, the Moorish occupation ended in the region due to the successful military campaigns of the Kingdom of Portugal. The &quot; Al-Gharb &quot; became the Kingdom of the Algarve, but battles with the Moors persisted. It was not until the 13th century that the Portuguese finally secured the region against subsequent Moorish attempts to recapture the area, what was referred to as the Reconquista. King Afonso III of Portugal started calling himself King of Portugal and the Algarve. After 1471, with the conquest of several territories in Northern Africa (the area considered an extension of the Algarve) Afonso V of Portugal began fashioning himself as the King of Portugal and the Algarves (referring to the European and African possessions). Prior to the independence of Brazil, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (1815–1822) was an official designation for Portugal which also alluded to the Algarve. Portuguese monarchs continued used this title until the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910. Between 1595 and 1808, the Algarve was a semi-autonomous area of Portugal with its own governor, as well as a separate taxation system. [ February 2008 ]. In the 15th century, Prince Henry the Navigator based himself near Lagos and conducted various maritime expeditions which established Portugal as a colonial power. It was also from Lagos that Gil Eanes set sail in 1434 to become the first seafarer to round Cape Bojador in West Africa. The voyages of discovery brought Lagos fame and fortune. Trade flourished and Lagos became the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577 and remained so until after 1755, the year of the fabled Lisbon earthquake. The earthquake damaged many areas in the Algarve and an accompanying tsunami destroyed or damaged coastal fortresses, while coastal towns and villages were heavily damaged (except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of Ria Formosa lagoon). In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For many Portuguese coastal regions, including the Algarve, the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake proper. In 1807, while Junot lead the first Napoleonic invasion in the north of Portugal, the Algarve was occupied by Spanish troops under Manuel Godoy. Beginning in 1808, and after subsequent battles in various towns and villages, the region was the first to drive out the Spanish occupiers. In 1910, with the Portuguese First Republic, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve ceased to exist as such. [ Geography ] { Lagos } { Portuguese Water Dog s are native to the Algarve. They were the fisherman&apos;s main companion and were often taken with sailors during the } { Portuguese discoveries } The Algarve has approximately 5412 square km, extending just south of the Tagus valley to the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Its highest point is Fóia, [ 902 m ft ], in the mountain range of Monchique. It also includes some islands and islets. The region is also the home of the Ria Formosa lagoon, a nature reserve of over 170 square kilometres and a stopping place for hundreds of different birds. The length of the south-facing coastline is approximately 155 kilometres. Beyond the westernmost point of Cape St. Vincent it stretches a further 50 kilometres to the north. The coastline is notable for picturesque limestone cave s and grottoes, particularly around Lagos, which are accessible by powerboat. [ Climate ] The maximum recorded temperatures in the Algarve fluctuate between 25 °C in winter and 48 °C in summer, with the temperature never usually falling below zero in the winter months. The winter of 2008/2009 was exceptionally cold and wet. Temperatures below 0 °C were recorded for the first time in many years. [ Human geography ] There are about 450,000 permanent inhabitants (76 residents per square kilometre) living in the area annually, although this figure increases to over a million people at the height of summer, due to an influx of tourist s. The Algarve has several cities, towns and villages: the region&apos;s capital is the city of Faro, while other cities include Albufeira, Lagoa, Lagos, Loulé, Olhão, Portimão, Quarteira, Silves, Tavira, and Vila Real de Santo António, in addition to various summer retreats such as Vilamoura, Praia da Rocha, Armação de Pêra, Alvor, Monte Gordo, Tavira, and Sagres. The region is subdivided into 16 municipalities, within the District of Faro { The Algarve region and the } { Faro District are coexistent (comprise exactly the same territory). } : [ 4 ] Albufeira Alcoutim Aljezur Castro Marim Faro Lagoa Lagos Loulé Monchique Olhão Portimão São Brás de Alportel Silves Tavira Vila do Bispo Vila Real de Santo António [ Economy ] { Lagos is one of the most developed cities in the Algarve } Algarve is recognized for many of the luxury resorts and hotel spas that meander the beaches of the region Agricultural products of the region include fig, almond, orange, carob bean, strawberry tree and cork oak. Horticulture is important and the region&apos;s landscape was known for the large areas of land covered with plastic greenhouse s which are used for that end. Fishing and aquaculture are important activities in the coastal area of Algarve, with sardine s, soles, cyprinids, gilt-head bream and various seafood, including the grooved carpet shell, being the major productions. Algarve&apos;s wine s are also renowned. There are four wines in the region which have Protected Designation of Origin ( Denominação de Origem Controlada - DOC): Lagoa DOC, Lagos DOC, Portimão DOC and Tavira DOC. Food processing, cement and construction, are the main industries. Tourism related activities are extensive and make the bulk of Algarve&apos;s economy during summer time. The Algarve&apos;s economy has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since ancient times. Only since the 1960s, has the region embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. [ Development ] Since the 1960s, Algarve has been experiencing a large development due to the need to accommodate its visitors. The region started the construction of better infrastructures, mainly roads, sanitation, power grids, telecommunications, hospitals and better housing. Sadly due to the austerity measures introduced in 2011, tolls have now been put in place on the main motorway that crosses the region which has reduced the use of the new infrastructure and is expected to seriously affect the local economy. It also started the construction of a huge variety of hotels, resorts, golf courses (which are considered to be some of the best in Europe ) and villa s. All this led to a huge development in the region, especially for locals who had previously lived in poorer circumstances. Today, Algarve is amongst the regions in Portugal with best quality of life and safety. And it&apos;s one of the many reasons why millions of tourists, mostly European, choose this sunny part of Portugal as their holiday destination. [ Tourism ] In the 1960s the Algarve became a very popular destination for tourists, mainly from Britain. It has since become a common destination for Germans, Dutch and Irish people. Many of these tourists own their own property in the region. There are Algarve-based English-written publications and newspapers specifically addressed to this community. In addition to the natural beauties and plenty of beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of golf courses. Well-known beaches in the Algarve range from Praia da Marinha to Armação de Pêra. A well known spa town is Caldas de Monchique. The Algarve is a popular destination for tourism, primarily because of its beach es, Mediterranean climate, safety, cuisine and relatively low costs. Algarve&apos;s mild climate has attracted interest from Northern Europeans wishing to have a holiday home or residence in the region. Being a region of Portugal, and therefore in the European Union, any EU citizen has the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality in the Algarve. { &quot; On the Rights of Citizens of the Union... &quot;, EC Directive 2004/58 EC, retrieved 25 May 2007. } British expatriates, followed by German, Dutch and Scandinavians, are among the largest groups wishing to own a home in this sunny region of Portugal. Tourism plays an important role in the economy of the Algarve. A large number of seasonal job opportunities are tourism-related and are fulfilled by thousands of immigrant workers from countries like Brazil, Ukraine and Cape Verde, among others. In March 2007, the Minister of Economy, Manuel Pinho, announced the creation of the &quot; Allgarve &quot; brand, as a part of a strategical promotion of the Algarve as a tourism destination for foreign citizens. { http://www.correiodamanha.pt/noticia.asp?id=234857 &amp; idselect=11 &amp; idCanal=11 &amp; p=200 } [ Accommodation ] Accommodation in the Algarve ranges from high rise resorts in places like Albufeira to traditional guesthouses, located in the small towns and villages surrounding the Algarve coast. Over the past 50 years the Algarve has seen an increase in development, particularly from non-Portuguese developers. Over the past few years many tourists visiting the Algarve have moved away from the resorts, and have chosen the comfort of a traditional Algarve guesthouse, many of these run by ex-pats from England, Holland, and Germany who have escaped to the Algarve for a higher quality of life. [ Education ] The University of the Algarve, headquartered in Faro with an extension in Portimão, is a public university which awards all academic degrees in fields ranging from marine biology to economics to environmental engineering. There are also several higher education private institutions, state-run and private secondary education schools, including a number of international school s, and a wide network of kindergarten s and primary school s. [ Sports ] The Algarve has many sports clubs, including football teams which play in the first ( Olhanense, Portimonense ), second and third layers of the main national football championships&apos; pyramid. SC Farense is the most successful football club in the Algarve, however, after financial troubles it is currently (season 2008/2009) playing in the 4th level of Portuguese football. The Clube de Ciclismo de Tavira is a noted Portuguese cycling team. The major stadium in the Algarve is the Estádio Algarve, where SC Farense and Louletano play their home matches. The region is also host to the annual Algarve Cup invitational tournament for national teams in women&apos;s football. The Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, a [ 4.692 km mi ] race circuit, is located in Portimão. [ Culture ] { Estádio Algarve &apos;&apos;). } { pottery from Porches. } The Algarve is famous for its pottery and ceramics, particularly hand-painted pottery and azulejos or tiles. There are numerous ceramics and pottery outlets throughout the Algarve.
