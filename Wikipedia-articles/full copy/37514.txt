{ 30 mm round Figure 1. DU penetrator from the A-10 30mm round } Depleted uranium (DU; also referred to in the past as Q-metal, depletalloy or D-38) is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope U-235 than natural uranium. (Natural uranium is about 99.27% U-238, 0.72% U-235 —the fissle isotope, and 0.0055% U-234 ). Uses of DU take advantage of its very high density of 19.1  g/cm 3 (68.4% denser than lead ). Civilian uses include counterweight s in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industrial radiography equipment and containers used to transport radioactive materials. Military uses include defensive armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles. Most depleted uranium arises as a byproduct of the production of enriched uranium for use in nuclear reactor s and in the manufacture of nuclear weapon s. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of lower-mass uranium isotopes (in particular U-235, which is the uranium isotope supporting the fission chain reaction ) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium, in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium. { and, therefore, about a 0.5% increase in U-238 content } U-238 has a much longer halflife than the lighter isotopes, and DU therefore emits less alpha radiation than the same mass of natural uranium: the US Defense Department states DU used in US munitions has 60% the radioactivity of natural uranium. { &quot; Properties and Characteristics of DU &quot; U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense } Since the U-235 content of nuclear reactor fuel is reduced by fission, uranium recovered by nuclear reprocessing from spent nuclear reactor fuel made from natural uranium will have a lower-than-natural U-235 concentration. Such ‘reactor-depleted’ material will have different isotopic ratios from enrichment byproduct DU, and can be distinguished from it by the presence of U-236. [ http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/unep81.doc.htm UN Press Release UNEP/81: Uranium 236 found in depleted uranium penetrators UN ] Trace transuranics (another indicator of the use of reprocessed material) have been reported to be present in some US tank armour. The use of DU in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects. [ Pattison John E. Hugtenburg Richard P. Green Stuart 2010 Enhancement of Natural Background Gamma-radiation Dose around Uranium Micro-particles in the Human Body Journal of the Royal Society Interface 7 45 603–611 10.1098/rsif.2009.0300 ] Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a toxic metal. It is weakly radioactive and remains so because of its long radioactive half-life (4.468 billion years for uranium-238, 700 million years for uranium-235 ). The biological half-life (the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days. [ http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/biohalf.html#c2 Biological Half Lives Georgia State University ] The aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites, leading to possible inhalation by human beings. { Mitsakou C, Eleftheriadis K, Housiadas C, Lazaridis M Modeling of the dispersion of depleted uranium aerosol. 2003 Apr. Retrieved January 15, 2009. } The actual level of acute and Chronic toxicity of DU is also a point of medical controversy. Several studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of leukemogenic, gene tic, reproductive, and neurological effects from chronic exposure. [ Miller AC, McClain D.

[ http://www.kbaverstock.org/EVIDENCDETOBELGIANCOMM.pdf Depleted Uranium Weapons Keith Baverstock ] [ History ] Enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the United States began its nuclear weapons program. Later in the decade, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union began their nuclear weapon s and nuclear power programs. It was at this time that depleted uranium was first stored as an unusable waste product ( uranium hexafluoride ). There was some hope that the enrichment process would be improved and fission able isotope s of U-235 could, at some future date, be extracted from the depleted uranium. This re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 contained in the depleted uranium is no longer a matter of the future: it has been practiced for several years. [ http://www.inesap.org/bulletin17/bul17art05.htm Depleted Uranium: A By-product of the Nuclear Chain Peter Diehl 1999 International Network of Engineers and Scientists Against Proliferation ] Also, it is possible to design civilian power-generating reactors using unenriched fuel, but only about 10% of reactors ever built utilize that technology. Both nuclear weapons production and naval reactors require fuel containing concentrated U-235. In the 1970s, the Pentagon reported that the Soviet military had developed armor plating for Warsaw Pact tanks that NATO ammunition could not penetrate. The Pentagon began searching for material to make denser armor-piercing projectiles. After testing various metals, ordnance researchers settled on depleted uranium. The US and NATO militaries used DU penetrator rounds in the 1991 Gulf War, the Bosnia war, [ http://cancerpage.com/cancernews/cancernews2268.htm NATO: 50 Countries See No Depleted Uranium Illness Douglas Hamilton 25 January 2001 (?)

[ http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0812-06.htm Is an Armament Sickening U.S. Soldiers? 2006-11-01 August 12, 2006 Associated Press ] While clearing a decades-old Hawaii firing range in 2005, workers found depleted uranium fins from training rounds from the formerly classified Davy Crockett recoilless gun tactical battlefield nuclear delivery system from the 1960-1970s. [ http://aec.army.mil/usaec/nepa/usarpacdspeis.pdf Draft Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement For Army Growth And Force Structure Realignment 2008-08-03 May 2008 US Army Pacific Page 200 (Lines 10–14) ] These training rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired before DU had become an item of interest, more than 20 years before the Gulf War. [ Production and availability ] Natural uranium metal contains about 0.71% U-235, 99.28% U-238, and about 0.0054% U-234. In order to produce enriched uranium, the process of isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the U-235 for use in nuclear power, weapons, or other uses. The remainder, depleted uranium, contains only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235, enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing 1  kg of 5% enriched uranium requires 11.8  kg of natural uranium, and leaves about 10.8  kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% U-235 remaining. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) defines depleted uranium as uranium with a percentage of the 235 U isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight (see 10 CFR 40.4 ). The military specifications designate that the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contain less than 0.3% 235 U (AEPI, 1995). In actuality, DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% 235 U (AEPI, 1995). [ Uranium hexafluoride ] Hexafluoride tank leaking About 95% of the depleted uranium produced is stored as uranium hexafluoride, a crystalline solid, (D)UF 6, in steel cylinders in open air storage yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 short tons) of UF 6. In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF 6 had accumulated by 1993. In 2008, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth, Ohio and Paducah, Kentucky. { How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States, anl.gov } { Depleted UF &lt; sub &gt; 6 &lt; /sub &gt; Management Program Documents } The storage of DUF 6 presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF 6 is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce UO 2 F 2 ( uranyl fluoride ), a solid, and HF ( hydrogen fluoride ), a gas, both of which are highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak, limiting further escape of depleted UF 6. Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation. { What happens if a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride leaks? } Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks and are repainted and repaired as necessary. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades. { &quot; Dear Arjun &quot;, IEER: Science for Democratic Action Vol. 5 No. 2 } A tenfold jump in uranium prices has transformed approximately one-third of the U.S. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion, assuming DOE re-enriches the tails. This estimate is based on February 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services, and DOE&apos;s access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity. { Agency review nuclear waste, Cibola County Beacon – News, April 3, 2008 } There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States, including one in which 31 workers were exposed to a cloud of UF 6 and its reaction products. [ August 2010 ] Though some of the more highly exposed workers showed evidence of short-term kidney damage (e.g., protein in the urine ), none of these workers had lasting kidney toxicity from the uranium exposure. { FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride? } The U.S. government has been converting DUF 6 to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal. { FAQ 22-What is going to happen to the uranium hexafluoride stored in the United States? } Such disposal of the entire DUF 6 inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million. { FAQ 27-Are there any currently-operating disposal facilities that can accept all of the depleted uranium oxide that would be generated from conversion of DOE&apos;s depleted UF6 inventory? } World depleted uranium inventory [ United States ] [ Russia ] [ France ] [ United Kingdom ] [ United Kingdom ] [ Germany ] [ Netherlands ] [ Japan ] [ China ] [ South Korea ] [ South Africa ] [ Singapore ] Country Organization Estimated DU stocks (tonnes) Reported DOE 480,000         2002 FAEA 460,000         1996 Areva NC 190,000         2001 BNFL 30,000         2001 URENCO 16,000         1999 JNFL 10,000         2001 CNNC 2,000         2000 KAERI 200         2002 NECSA 73         2001 DSO National Laboratories 60         2007 TOTAL 1,188,273         2008 { ::::: &apos;&apos;Source:&apos;&apos; WISE Uranium Project } [ Military applications ] The 105mm M900 APFSDS-T (Depleted Uranium Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot – Tracer) Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19050  kg/m³, it is 1.67 times as dense as lead, only slightly less dense than tungsten and gold, and 84% as dense as osmium or iridium, which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Thus a given mass of it has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile, with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectile ordnance is often incendiary because of its pyrophoric property. { US Dept. of Energy Handbook, &quot; Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity &quot;, Chapter &quot; Uranium &quot; } [ Armor plate ] Because of its high density, depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor, sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate. For instance, some late-production M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams tanks built after 1998 have DU reinforcement as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade the rest (see Chobham armor ). [ Nuclear weapons ] Depleted uranium is used as a tamper in fission bomb s. [ Ammunition ] Most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm caliber ordnance, primarily the 30  mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing incendiary round from the GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the A-10 Thunderbolt II used by the United States Air Force. 25  mm DU rounds have been used in the M242 gun mounted on the U.S. Army&apos;s Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Marine Corp&apos;s LAV-25. The United States Marine Corps uses DU in the 25  mm PGU-20 round fired by the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon of the AV-8B Harrier, and also in the 20  mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships. The United States Navy &apos;s Phalanx CIWS &apos;s M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20  mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabot s which were made using depleted uranium, later changed to tungsten. Another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrator s anti-armor rounds, such as the 120  mm sabot rounds fired from the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams. { Fahey, D. (2003) &quot; Science or Science Fiction? Facts, Myths and Propaganda In the Debate Over Depleted Uranium Weapons &quot;, Table 1 on p. 13 } Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by discarding sabot. Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually titanium or molybdenum. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of titanium. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium. { Phalanx CIWS aboard } { USS &apos;&apos;Missouri&apos;&apos;. } According to recent research, [ Embedded Weapons-Grade Tungsten Alloy Shrapnel Rapidly Induces Metastatic High-Grade Rhabdomyosarcomas in F344 Rats http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/7791/7791.html Kalinich, J.F. et al. June 2005 Environmental Health Perspectives 113 6 10.1289/ehp.7791 ] at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions, such as tungsten- cobalt or tungsten- nickel -cobalt alloys, also possess extreme carcinogen ic properties, which by far exceed those (confirmed or suspected) of depleted uranium itself: 100% of rat s implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal rhabdomyosarcoma within a few weeks. Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening and pyrophoric. On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp. The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties. When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle, it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel, killing the crew, and possibly causing the vehicle to explode. DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120  mm or 105  mm cannons employed on the M1 Abrams tank. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115  mm guns in the T-62 tank and the 125  mm guns in the T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks. The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20  mm projectiles, 200 g in 25  mm ones, 280 g in 30  mm, 3.5  kg in 105  mm, and 4.5  kg in 120  mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make grenades, cluster bomb s, and mines, but those applications have been discontinued, according to Alliant Techsystems. [ November 2011 ] The US Navy used DU in its 20  mm Phalanx CIWS guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten. It is thought that between 17 and 20 countries have weapons incorporating depleted uranium in their arsenals. They include the U.S., the UK, France, Russia, China, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, Iraq and Taiwan. [ July 2008 ] DU ammunition is manufactured in 18 countries. Only the US and the UK have acknowledged using DU weapons. { The International Legality of the Use of Depleted Uranium Weapons: A Precautionary Approach, Avril McDonald, Jann K. Kleffner and Brigit Toebes, eds.

Retrieved February 3, 2009. } Iran also has performed wide research on DU penetrators since 2001. [ Legal status in weapons ] In 1996 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the &quot; legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons &quot;. { ADVISORY OPINION 1996 July 8; General List No.95 (req: UNGA). Cornnet.nl. Retrieved on 2011-01-16. } This made it clear, in paragraphs 54, 55 and 56, that international law on poisonous weapons—the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925—did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence &quot; The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate, &quot; also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy materiel and kill soldiers through kinetic energy.

Yeung Sik Yuen in accordance with Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights resolution 2001/36. He argues that the use of DU in weapons, along with the other weapons listed by the Sub‑Commission, may breach one or more of the following treaties: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the Genocide Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions including Protocol I, the Convention on Conventional Weapons of 1980, and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Yeung Sik Yuen writes in Paragraph 133 under the title &quot; Legal compliance of weapons containing DU as a new weapon &quot; : [ Annex II to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 1980 (which became operative on 8 February 1997) classifies DU as a category II nuclear material. Storage and transport rules are set down for that category which indicates that DU is considered sufficiently &quot; hot &quot; and dangerous to warrant these protections. But since weapons containing DU are relatively new weapons no treaty exists yet to regulate, limit or prohibit its use. The legality or illegality of DU weapons must therefore be tested by recourse to the general rules governing the use of weapons under humanitarian and human rights law which have already been analysed in Part I of this paper, and more particularly at paragraph 35 which states that parties to Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have an obligation to ascertain that new weapons do not violate the laws and customs of war or any other international law. As mentioned, the International Court of Justice considers this rule binding customary humanitarian law. ] Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of DU in weapons. Their findings were that: { Joe Sills et al Environmental Crimes in Military Actions and the International Criminal Court (ICC)-United Nations Perspectives (PDF) ( HTML ) of American Council for the UN University, April 2002.

There is a developing scientific debate and concern expressed regarding the impact of the use of such projectiles and it is possible that, in future, there will be a consensus view in international legal circles that use of such projectiles violate general principles of the law applicable to use of weapons in armed conflict. No such consensus exists at present.

Metallic uranium is prone to slow corrosion and small pieces are pyrophoric at room temperature in air. When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn, they create depleted uranium oxide s in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds. Additionally, fragments of munitions or armor can become embedded in the body.

Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: inhalation, ingestion, and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination. Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption, distribution, translocation, elimination and the resulting toxicity. For example, metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent uranium(VI) uranyl compounds such as uranium trioxide. { «Gmelin Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie» 8th edition, English translation, Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, vol.

Most is in the skeleton. The biochemistry of depleted uranium is, for all practical purposes, the same as natural uranium. [ Radiological hazards ] The primary radiation danger from depleted uranium is due to alpha particle s, which do not travel far through air, and do not penetrate clothing. Thus, the primary concern is internal exposure, due to inhalation, ingestion or shrapnel contamination. Available evidence suggests that this risk is small relative to the chemical hazard.

The hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited, and limited to very specific circumstances &quot;. { NATO Press Conference on Depleted Uranium } A 2002 study from the Australia n defense ministry concluded that &quot; there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries... studies of Gulf War veterans show that, in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury, it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels, but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow-up. &quot; { Military medical aspects of depleted uranium munitions } Pier Roberto Danesi, then-director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Seibersdorf +Laboratory, stated in 2002 that &quot; There is a consensus now that DU does not represent a health threat &quot;. [ http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/297/5588/1801?ck%3Dnck ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY: New Findings Allay Concerns Over Depleted Uranium Science Magazine Richard Stone 2002-09-13 ] The IAEA reported in 2003 that, &quot; based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts, &quot; although &quot; Like other heavy metals, DU is potentially poisonous. In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity. High concentration could cause kidney damage. &quot; The IAEA concluded that while depleted uranium is a potential carcinogen, there is no evidence that it has been carcinogenic in humans. [ http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml IAEA Depleted Uranium Factsheet ] A 2005 study by Sandia National Laboratories’ Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War. Marshall’s study concluded that the reports of cancer risks from DU exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics. Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium. { An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study, Albert C. Marshall, Sandia National Laboratories } Chemical effects, including potential reproductive issues, associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper. { Marshall, A. C. Gulf war depleted uranium risks Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology 18, 95-108 (January 2008) | } [ 10.1038/sj.jes.7500551 ] [ Atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions ] Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain. These elevated readings appear to coincide with Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan, and the Shock and Awe bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War. { http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2759.pdf } { C. Busby and S. Morgan, 2006, Did the Use of Uranium Weapons in Gulf War 2 Result in Contamination of Europe?

Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as counter balance weights on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints. [ Safety and environmental issues ] About 95% of the depleted uranium produced till now is stored as uranium hexafluoride, (D)UF 6, in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 US tons) of UF 6. In the U.S. alone, 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF 6 had accumulated by 1993. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky., The long-term storage of DUF 6 presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF 6 is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO 2 F 2 (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride), both of which are highly soluble and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated life time of the steel cylinders is measured in decades. There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States. The vulnerability of DUF 6 storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports. However, the U.S. government has been converting DUF 6 to solid uranium oxides for disposal. Disposing of the whole DUF 6 inventory could cost anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars. left DUF 6 cylinders: painted (left) and corroded (right) [ See also ] Environmental issues with war Traveling wave reactor - a reactor that uses depleted uranium for fuel [ References ] [ 30em ] [ External links ] [ Depleted uranium ] Scientific bodies US Health Physics Society United Nations &quot; Human rights and weapons of mass destruction, or with indiscriminate effect, or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering &quot; (The UN 2002 report) Depleted Uranium and the IAEA Scientific reports ATSDR – Case Studies in Environmental Medicine (CSEM): Uranium Toxicity U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &quot; Depleted Uranium in Bosnia and Herzegovina – Postconflict Assessment &quot; by UN Environment Programme &quot; Radiological Conditions in Areas of Kuwait With Residues of Depleted Uranium &quot; by International Atomic Energy Agency &quot; Technical Report on Capacity-building for the Assessment of Depleted Uranium in Iraq &quot; by UN Environment Programme &quot; A Review of the Scientific Literature As It Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses &quot; by RAND Depleted Uranium article from the Royal Society An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study by Sandia National Laboratories Depleted Uranium Human Health Fact Sheet by Argonne National Laboratory Environmental Assessment Division Depleted uranium (DU) normative value pilot study: levels of uranium in urine samples from the general population by AD Jones, BG Miller S Walker, J Anderson, AP Colvin, PA Hutchison, CA Soutar.
