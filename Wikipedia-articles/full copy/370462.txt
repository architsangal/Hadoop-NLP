Esa-Pekka Salonen (2008) Esa-Pekka Salonen ( [ Fi-Esa-Pekka_Salonen.ogg pronunciation ]; born June 30, 1958 in Helsinki ) is a Finnish orchestral conductor and composer. He is currently Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London and Conductor Laureate of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. [ Biography ] [ Early career ] Salonen, born in Helsinki, Finland, studied horn and composition at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, as well as conducting with Jorma Panula. His conducting classmates included Jukka-Pekka Saraste and Osmo Vänskä.Another classmate on the composition side was the composer Magnus Lindberg and together they formed the new-music appreciation group Korvat auki ( &quot; Ears open &quot; in the Finnish language ) and the experimental ensemble Toimii (lit. &quot; It works &quot; ). Later, Salonen studied with the composers Franco Donatoni, Niccolò Castiglioni and Einojuhani Rautavaara. His first experience with conducting came in 1979 with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, though he still thought of himself principally as a composer; in fact, Salonen has said that the primary reason he took up conducting was to ensure that someone would conduct his own compositions. In 1983, however, he replaced an indisposed Michael Tilson Thomas to conduct a performance of Mahler &apos;s Symphony No. 3 with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London at very short notice without ever having studied the score before that time, and it launched his career as a conductor. [ http://music.guardian.co.uk/classical/story/0%2C%2C1999437%2C00.html LA Variation The Guardian Nicholas Wroe 27 January 2007 13 April 2007 ] He was subsequently principal guest conductor of the Philharmonia from 1985 to 1994. Salonen was principal conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1984 to 1995. [ Los Angeles Philharmonic ] Salonen made his U.S. conducting debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1984. His initial reaction was as follows: &quot; I had no idea what to expect. But the one thing that I didn&apos;t expect was when an older player came to talk to me after the first concert and said, &apos;Consider this your future home.&apos; Something was going on, because I felt the same. I sensed with an absolute certainty that this orchestra, in whatever way, was going to be a very important part of my life. Always. &quot; In 1989, he was offered the title of Principal Guest Conductor by Executive VP Ernest Fleischmann and was to take the orchestra on a tour of Japan; however, controversy ensued when André Previn, the orchestra&apos;s Music Director at the time, was not consulted on either the Principal Guest appointment or the tour, and objected to both. Continued friction between Fleischmann and Previn led to Previn&apos;s resignation in April 1989. [ The Tyrant of Philharmonic Los Angeles Times Martin Bernheimer 8 October 1989 ] Four months later, Salonen was named the orchestra&apos;s tenth Music Director, officially taking the post in 1992 and holding it until 2009. Salonen&apos;s tenure with the orchestra first began with a residency at the 1992 Salzburg Festival in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera Saint François d&apos;Assise by Olivier Messiaen; it was the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and residencies at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, The Proms in London, in Cologne for a festival of Salonen&apos;s own works, and perhaps most notably, in 1996 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez; it was during this Paris residency that key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics and were re-invigorated to lead fundraising efforts to complete construction of Walt Disney Concert Hall. Under Salonen&apos;s leadership, the Philharmonic has become an extremely progressive and well-regarded orchestra. Alex Ross of The New Yorker said this: The Salonen era in L.A. may mark a turning point in the recent history of classical music in America. It is a story not of an individual magically imprinting his personality on an institution – what Salonen has called the &quot; empty hype &quot; of conductor worship – but of an individual and an institution bringing out unforeseen capabilities in each other, and thereby proving how much life remains in the orchestra itself, at once the most conservative and the most powerful of musical organisms. [ The New Yorker Alex Ross The Anti-maestro; How Esa-Pekka Salonen transformed the Los Angeles Philharmonic April 30, 2007 ] In 2007, Salonen and the orchestra announced the conclusion of his music directorship in 2009, with Gustavo Dudamel taking his place.

He ultimately decided not to buy the house.

(1980, a saxophone concerto with a title taken from Franz Kafka &apos;s The Trial ), Floof for soprano and ensemble (1982, on texts by Stanisław Lem ) and the orchestral L.A. Variations (1996). Salonen has stated that his time in California has helped him to be more &quot; free &quot; in his compositions. Mark Swed, chief music critic of the Los Angeles Times, described it this way: When [Salonen] arrived in Los Angeles, he still liked to consider himself a composer-conductor, but the truth was that he had stopped writing music. &quot; The obvious and easy explanation for me to give to people when they were asking why there hadn&apos;t been any new pieces for a while was that I had been conducting so much, I had no time, &quot; he said. &quot; But that was only half the explanation. &quot; As a European Modernist, Salonen said, he had been inculcated with negatives, such as to avoid melody, harmonic identity and rhythmic pulse. Secretly, though, he was attracted to John Adams, who was then dismissed overseas as being simplistic. &quot; Only after a couple of years here did I begin to see that the European canon I blindly accepted was not the only truth, &quot; he said. &quot; Over here, I was able to think about this rule that forbids melody. It&apos;s madness. Madness! &quot; Without a European musical elite looking over his shoulder, Salonen began to feel that it was fine to have his own ideas. &quot; My focus moved from an ideological principle to a pleasure principle &quot; is how he described the composition of his breakthrough piece, &quot; LA Variations, &quot; which the Philharmonic premiered in 1997. Although a work of great intricacy and virtuosity that doesn&apos;t ignore Salonen&apos;s Modernist training, &quot; LA Variations &quot; builds on rhythmic innovations closer to Adams. The piece proved an immediate hit, so much so that Salonen was stunned by the reaction and then by the score&apos;s continuing success – it has been taken up by several other conductors and had more than 80 performances worldwide. In order to devote more time to composition, Salonen took a year&apos;s sabbatical from conducting in 2000, during which time he wrote a work for solo horn (Concert Étude, the competition piece for Lieksa Brass Week), Dichotomie for pianist Gloria Cheng, Mania for the cellist Anssi Karttunen and sinfonietta, and Gambit, an orchestral piece that was a birthday present for fellow composer and friend Magnus Lindberg. In 2001, Salonen composed Foreign Bodies, his largest work in terms of orchestration, which incorporated music from the opening movement of Dichotomie. Another orchestral piece, Insomnia, followed in 2002, and another, Wing On Wing, in 2004. Wing On Wing includes parts for two sopranos and distorted samples of architect Frank Gehry &apos;s voice as well as a fish. As is apparent with his interpretations of such avant-garde works as Jan Sandström&apos;s Motorbike Concerto, Esa-Pekka Salonen voices a distaste for ideological and dogmatic approaches to composition and sees music creation as deeply physical. In the liner notes for Deutsche Grammophon &apos;s release of Wing On Wing, he is quoted saying &quot; Musical expression is bodily expression, there is no abstract cerebral expression in my opinion. It all comes out of the body. &quot; A recurring theme in his music is the fusion of or relationship between the mechanical and the organic.
