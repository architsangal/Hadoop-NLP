[ March 2012 ] [ 1922 literature poetry ] The year 1922 in literature involved some significant events and new books. Under the current U.S. copyright law, all works published before January 1, 1923 with a proper copyright notice entered the public domain no later than 75 years from the date of the copyright. Hence books published in 1922 or earlier are now in the public domain.
