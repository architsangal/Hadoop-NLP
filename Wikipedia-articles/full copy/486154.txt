[ June 2011 ] The [ Tanaka Memorial 田中上奏文 Tanaka Josobun ] is an alleged Japan ese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Baron Tanaka Giichi laid out for the Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. Today it is generally considered by scholars to be a forgery. [ Chang The Rape of Nanking 178 ] [ Background ] The Tanaka Memorial gained its first publicity when it was first published in the 1929, December edition of Chinese publication &quot; 時事月報 &quot; (Current Affair Monthly) in Nanking, a Nationalist Chinese publication (also reproduced in 24 September 1931, pp.  923–34 of &quot; China Critic &quot;, an English publication in Shanghai). [ Harries Soldiers of the Rising Sun 162 ] {. } [ In order to take over the world, you need to take over China; In order to take over China, you need to take over Manchuria and Mongolia. If we succeed in conquering China, the rest of the Asiatic countries and the South Sea countries will fear us and surrender to us. Then the world will realize that Eastern Asia is ours. ] The English translation of this document was in circulation before February 1934, and formed the foundation of the lead article on the front page of the first edition of The Plain Truth magazine published by Herbert W. Armstrong in February of that year, [ Cog Home School The Plain Truth 1934-02-02 http://www.coghomeschool.org/site/cog_archives/plain_truth/1934/02%20February%201934.pdf PDF ] {. } although it had first appeared in the less widely circulated Communist International magazine in 1931. The Tanaka Memorial was depicted extensively by United States wartime propaganda as a sort of Japanese counterpart of Mein Kampf. Frank Capra &apos;s Academy Award -winning movie series Why We Fight, the installments The Battle of China and Prelude to War describe the Tanaka Memorial as the document that was the Japanese plan for war with the United States. [ Dower War Without Mercy 22 ] {. } As presented in Battle of China, the four sequential steps to achieve Japan&apos;s goal of conquests are Conquest of Manchuria Conquest of China Establishment of bases in the Pacific Conquest of the United States Even though its authenticity is not accepted by scholars today, the Tanaka Memorial was widely accepted as authentic in the 1930s and 40s because Japan&apos;s actions corresponded so closely to these plans. The 1931 Mukden Incident, 1937 Second Sino-Japanese War, and the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Pacific War seemed to confirm this suspicion. { Coble, Parks M. Facing Japan: Chinese politics and Japanese imperialism, 1931–1937 p. 36. Harvard University Press, 1991. ISBN 0-674-77530-9. } Some historical experts such as Edwin P. Hoyt, state unequivocally that &quot;...the Tanaka Memorial was real. It was just too good a copy of what Prime Minister Tanaka had said and what the supernationalists had been saying for months to be otherwise. &quot; { Hoyt, Edwin P. (2001). Japan&apos;s War The Great Pacific Conflict. Cooper Square Press, 62. ISBN 0-8154-1118-9. } Others, such as Meirion Harries, state just as unequivocally that the Tanaka Memorial &quot;...was one of the most successful “dirty tricks” of the twentieth century – a bogus document so brilliantly conceived that thirty years later Westerns were still being taken in by it &quot;. Likewise, historian WG Beasley states that &quot;...the nature of this document, as published variously in English and Chinese, does not carry conviction as to its authenticity &quot;. [ Beasley Japanese Imperialism 1894–1945 185 ] {. } Dr. Haruo Tohmatsu, Professor of Diplomacy and War History of International Relations at the National Defense Academy of Japan, states that &quot; The &apos;Tanaka Memorial&apos; never existed, but the Darien conference of that year adopted resolutions that reflected these ideas. &quot; { Haruo Tohmatsu, A Gathering Darkness (2004) SR Books, p. 18 } Leon Trotsky, despite being an opponent of the USSR and Communist Party of China, vouched for the authenticity of the document, in one of his last works. [ Marxists http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1940/01/tanaka.htm 1940 Tanaka Trotsky ] {. } [ Speculation of forgery ] In the summer of 1927 (June 27 – July 7 [ http://bevinalexander.com/china/12-japan-begins-march-to-disaster.htm Japan Begins the March to Disaster Alexander Bevin Bevin Alexander June 26, 2011 ] ), Tanaka convened a ‘Far East Conference’ with members of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Army Ministry, Navy Ministry, and Finance Ministry. However, instead of producing a master plan for world domination, the result of the Conference was a rough consensus that Japan should support the Kuomintang government of China against the Chinese communists, as long as the Japanese could convince General Zhang Zuolin to consolidate his base in a virtually autonomous Manchuria, which would serve as a buffer state, and would fall eventually within Japanese domination. [ Jansen The Making of Modern Japan 525 ] {. } It is alleged that the Tanaka Memorial is a secret report of this Conference. When the Allies searched for incriminating documents to support war crime charges following the surrender of Japan, no drafts or copies of anything corresponding to the Tanaka Memorial appeared among them; a Japanese language &quot; original &quot; has never been produced despite extensive research efforts. The origin of the Memorial is still in question. Because the initial edition of the Memorial was in Chinese, many historians have attributed it to Chinese, most probably Chinese communist sources. There have been claims of forgery by the Soviet Union to encourage war between China and Japan, and so to advance Soviet interests. The two theories are not mutually exclusive, as the Chinese Communist Party was a branch of Comintern under control of the Soviet Union, and Soviet policy from the 1930s was to wage a propaganda war against Japanese expansionism. Also, the first translation of the Memorial into English was done by the Communist Party of America and published in the December 1931 issue of Communist International magazine. It was later re-printed in book format. [ Schecter Shared Secrets 8 ] {. } In 1939, Peter Fleming claimed to have produced an ‘update’ to the Tanaka Memorial, by writing an imaginary report on a secret Allied strategy conference attended by Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-Shek, and having it leaked to the Japanese. This indicates that the Tanaka Memorial was known to be a forgery by the British prior to World War II. [ Holt The Deceivers 298 ] {. } Newspapers and school textbooks in the People&apos;s Republic of China still mention the Tanaka Memorial as factual. However, most Japanese historians contend that the document is a forgery. { Stephan, &quot; The Tanaka Memorial (1927), &quot; p. 740. } In 1995, Vitaliy Pavlov, a retired high-ranking NKVD officer, wrote about the Tanaka Memorial in the Moscow journal Novosti Razvedki I Kontrrazvedki (News of Intelligence and Counterintelligence). Pavlov said the work was a forgery prepared by the Soviet Union in 1931 to sow anti-Japanese feelings in the U.S. and in Europe. { Romerstein and Breindel, 2001, pp. 520–521 } On January 1, 2008, a Japanese newspaper Tokyo Shimbun reported that a Chinese historian group considered the &quot; Tanaka Memorial &quot; to be of dubious authenticity and suggested that the majority of Chinese historians regard the document as a forgery, in a collaborative research meeting held in September 2007.
