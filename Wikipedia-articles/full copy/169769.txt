List of years in American television : 1998 1999 2000   – 2001   – 2002 2003 2004 2001-02 United States network television schedule The following is a list of events affecting American television in 2001. Events listed include television show debuts, finales, cancellations, and channel launches, closures and rebrandings, as well as information about controversies and carriage disputes. [ Events ] [ January ] Date Event 1 MTV sister network M2, owned by Viacom subsidiary MTV Networks, rebrands as MTV2. 4 All of HBO &apos;s childrens programs are moved to its multiplex channel HBO Family. 12 National Geographic Channel debuts in the United States. This was eventually launched in the UK from 1997. [ March ] Date Event 26 WCW Monday Nitro airs its final show from Panama City Beach, Florida with a simulcast with the WWF&apos;s (Now WWE &apos;s) Monday Night RAW television show, officially ending a six year ratings battle in professional wrestling known as the Monday Night Wars. [ April ] [ http://www.triviahalloffame.com/olmstead.aspx Interview: Kevin Olmstead, mega-Millionaire Trivia Hall of Fame 2010-04-18 ] Date Event 10 Kevin Olmstead wins a $2.18 million jackpot on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, making him the biggest winner in American game show history until Ken Jennings&apos; Jeopardy! run three years later. [ June ] Date Event 12 TNT is relaunched as a drama-based cable channel and a new slogan, We Know Drama currently in place. 18 Luke and Laura Spencer, widely regarded as the soap opera pairing that helped coin the term &quot; supercouple &quot;, signed divorce papers on General Hospital, dissolving their fictional two-decade union. [ July ] Date Event 1 HBO &apos;s second multiplex channel HBO Plus is rebranded as HBO 2, which the channel was originally named from its 1991 launch until 1998. [ August ] Date Event 5 RHI Entertainment acquires The Jim Henson Company &apos;s 50% ownership stake in Odyssey Network; the cable channel was later rebranded as Hallmark Channel. [ September ] Date Event 8 Fox airs the final episode of the game show Murder in Small Town X, in which New York City firefighter Ángel Juarbe, Jr. won. Juarbe was killed on Sept. 11 during the collapse of the World Trade Center. 11 Viewers around the world witness a terrorist attack on the United States, and the collapse of the Twin Towers towers in New York City, live on television. Additionally, the ABC and NBC affiliates&apos; broadcast towers are knocked out by the attacks, but New Yorkers can still view them on cable and satellite. Most broadcasters abandon regular programming – American networks for more than a week – and numerous major daily talk show s go off the air for several weeks until their hosts feel comfortable in returning to the airwaves. Although they were first seen in 1952 and used by some television news programs ever since, continually scrolling news headlines along the bottom of the screen become commonplace after the Fox News Channel used it to allow viewers to keep track of the latest developments during the attacks. 17 The game show Card Sharks is revived with host Pat Bullard, but due to its dramatically different gameplay, it disappears after just 13 weeks. WWF Raw Is War/WWF War Zone becomes just WWF Raw due to the terrorist attacks of September 11. 20 Dr. Will Kirby is crowned the winner of Big Brother 2, which was delayed by the attacks of September 11, 2001. Runner-Up Nicole Nilson-Schafrich wins $50,000. 21 All four major US networks air America: A Tribute to Heroes a two-hour telethon to raise money for the families of those killed in the attacks. Also on this date, Alex Trebek, the longtime host of Jeopardy!, appears for the first time without his trademark mustache. 24 The start of the 2001–2002 fall season in the US is delayed as a result of the attacks, with some shows such as The West Wing substituting special episodes dealing with the event in lieu of their originally scheduled season premieres. Some series, such as the military-themed JAG and New York-based Third Watch have to be retooled to encompass the aftermath of the attacks. [ October ] Date Event 3 In addition, several planned series and events were cancelled; most notably, a mini-series planned for spring 2002, which would have united the cast of Law &amp; Order, Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit and Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent, dealing with a terrorist attack on New York City. 20 Concert For New York: A Tribute To Heroes airs on VH1, with performances by Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Billy Joel and others. It raises funds for the families of those killed in the attacks. 22 A new bonus round premieres on Wheel of Fortune, in which a contestant can win up to $100,000. [ November ] Date Event 1 Telemundo relaunches GEMS Television as Mun2, featuring English and Spanish language programming aimed at a young Latino audience. 4 The 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards were handed out by CBS. The original date was postponed 2 months ago when the September 11 attacks occurred. 10 Fox Family Channel changes its name to ABC Family, reflecting its then-recent sale by News Corporation to the corporate parent of the ABC television network, The Walt Disney Company. 26 &apos;&apos; have doubled.
