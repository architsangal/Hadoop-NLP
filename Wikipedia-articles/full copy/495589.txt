{ Open Mic UK 2010, a Battle of the Bands structured music competition } &quot; BOTB &quot; redirects here. It may also stand for British Overseas Trade Board. Battle of Bands is a contest in which two or more bands compete for the title of &quot; best band &quot;. The winner is determined by a panel of judge s, the general response of the audience, or a combination. Traditionally, battles of bands are held at live music events and forums. A popular example includes the yearly Live and Unsigned contest in the United Kingdom. The term is legally trademarked Supernova Entertainment in Canada, but is often used informally, such as when the media coined &quot; Battle of Britpop &quot; to describe the sales battle between Oasis and Blur. [ Format ] Bernie Cochrane enters that The Battle of the Bands first came to major public attention in the United Kingdom when it was launched in 1980, being staged as a nationally held competition with heats held throughout England, Wales, Scotland, Northern and Southern Ireland and where in many cases, the competition was supported and held in conjunction with local radio, television and press. Throughout 1980 to 1983 as the records will show, this UK originating competition received very substantial media coverage and it is felt that as result since then derivatives and use of the title quite often appear. Entrants were asked to submit via sending 3 original songs in on cassette [yes casstte in those days] and from this 6 x local area entrants were chosen to compete. As a competition The BOTB looked for &apos;entrants&apos; to comprise of 2 or more in numbers. Between 1980-1983 the event was held in various types of venue, with in the first year that of major concert venues, the second year &apos;clubs&apos; and the final year Universities.
