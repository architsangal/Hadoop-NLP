He is best known for the song &quot; Gangsta&apos;s Paradise &quot;, and the theme song for Kenan &amp; Kel a Nickelodeon show from 1996 to 2000. [ Music ] [ Late 80s ] He recorded two singles in the late 1980s, titled &quot; Watcha Gonna Do &quot; and &quot; You&apos;re Gonna Miss Me &quot;. Neither single was successful, but Coolio had made connections in the Los Angeles rap scene, and ended up joining the group WC and the Maad Circle in 1991. WC was the group&apos;s lead rapper, but Coolio was another rapper in the group. He had a few verses on the group&apos;s debut album, Ain&apos;t a Damn Thang Changed, including on the single &quot; Dress Code &quot;. The album was regionally successful, but did not make much impact on a national scale. [ Tommy Boy Records and &quot; Fantastic Voyage &quot; ] Three years later in 1994, Coolio signed to Tommy Boy Records and released his debut solo album, It Takes a Thief. The lead single &quot; Fantastic Voyage &quot; was put into heavy rotation on MTV, and peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot; Fantastic Voyage &quot; would become one of the biggest rap singles of the year. The album also contained a few minor hits in &quot; County Line &quot; and &quot; I Remember &quot;. It Takes a Thief eventually peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 200, becoming certified Platinum. { www.riaa.org } The album received praise for bringing a humorous and lighthearted perspective to often violent and profane themes of typical gangsta rap.

In 1995, he made a song for the movie Dangerous Minds, and this song became &quot; Gangsta&apos;s Paradise &quot;. &quot; Gangsta&apos;s Paradise &quot;, which featured R &amp; B singer L.V., would became one of the most successful rap songs of all time, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the #1 single of 1995 for all genres, and was a truly global hit, as it reached #1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that parody artist Weird Al Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of &quot; Gangsta&apos;s Paradise &quot;, titled &quot; Amish Paradise &quot;. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, the song won Coolio a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. Originally &quot; Gangsta&apos;s Paradise &quot; wasn&apos;t meant to be included on one of Coolio&apos;s studio albums, but its extreme success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album, but also making it the title track. The title track sampled the chorus and music of the song &quot; Pastime Paradise &quot; by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly 20 years earlier on Stevie Wonder&apos;s album Songs in the Key of Life. The album Gangsta&apos;s Paradise was released in 1995 and with the mega-hit was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album also contained two other major hits in &quot; 1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin&apos; New) &quot; and &quot; Too Hot &quot; with J.T. Taylor of Kool &amp; the Gang doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio also made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album, Curb Servin&apos;, on the song &quot; In a Twist &quot;. In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song &quot; It&apos;s All the Way Live (Now) &quot; from the soundtrack to the movie Eddie. He was also featured on the song &quot; Hit &apos;em High &quot; from the soundtrack to the movie Space Jam with B-Real, Method Man, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes [ Red Hot Organization, album flop, and Tommy Boy Records dismissal ] In 1996, Coolio appeared on the Red Hot Organization &apos;s compilation CD, America is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as &quot; a masterpiece &quot; by The Source magazine. That same year, he recorded the theme song and appeared in the opening sequence of the Nickelodeon TV series Kenan &amp; Kel which ran for four seasons. After the massive success of the Gangsta&apos;s Paradise album, Coolio had a tough job to make a proper followup. His third solo album, titled My Soul came out in 1996. Although it did contain the major hit &quot; C U When U Get There &quot;, the album was considered a disappointment and failed to reach the success of his previous two albums. Subsequently, Coolio was dropped from Tommy Boy Records and his albums since then, 2001&apos;s Coolio.com, 2003&apos;s El Cool Magnifico, 2006&apos;s The Return of the Gangsta, and 2008&apos;s Steal Hear have not been successful, as none has charted on any &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; chart.
