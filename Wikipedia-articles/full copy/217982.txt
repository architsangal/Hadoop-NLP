It stars Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Michael O&apos;Keefe, and Bill Murray. Doyle-Murray also has a supporting role. This was Ramis&apos; first feature film and was a major boost to Dangerfield&apos;s film career; previously, he was known mostly for his stand-up comedy. Grossing almost $40 million in the U.S. alone (16th highest of the year), it was the first of a series of similar comedies. A sequel, Caddyshack II, followed in 1988, although it was not nearly as successful or well-received. As of 2010, Caddyshack has been televised on the Golf Channel as one of its &quot; Movies That Make The Cut &quot;. [ Plot ] [ December 2010 ] Danny Noonan ( Michael O&apos;Keefe ) works at the upscale Bushwood Country Club as he tries to raise enough money to go to college since his parents cannot afford it and his grades were unremarkable in high school. Danny caddies for Ty Webb ( Chevy Chase ), the free-spirited playboy son of one of Bushwood&apos;s co-founders, as Ty teaches Danny about the finer points in life usually while showing off random trick shots. One day, Danny decides to caddy for Judge Elihu Smails ( Ted Knight ), the country club&apos;s stodgy co-founder, in hopes of earning his favor and the next Caddy Scholarship, a cash award Smails controls. Smails&apos; golfing group includes Dr. Beeper ( Dan Resin ), Bishop Fred Pickering ( Henry Wilcoxon ), and Smails&apos; obnoxious grandson, Spaulding (John F. Barmon Jr.). They are also joined by Smails&apos; sensuous niece, Lacey Underall ( Cindy Morgan ), who is visiting for the summer. Meanwhile, Sandy McFiddish (Thomas A. Carlin), Bushwood&apos;s head greenskeeper, entrusts his assistant Carl Spackler ( Bill Murray ) to remove a gopher digging tunnels underneath the course. During the game, Smails is mocked by Al Czervik ( Rodney Dangerfield ), a flamboyant nouveau riche real estate tycoon. Al loudly wagers $1,000 that Smails will miss his relatively short putt, which draws a crowd of onlookers. Smails misses the putt and flings his putter in a blind rage, striking a woman. Danny takes responsibility for the incident, claiming the grips on the club were worn and Smails was not responsible, finally putting Danny in good standing with the judge. Smails mentions to Danny that the caddy scholarship has become available again, and encourages him to apply. At a Fourth of July banquet, Danny and his girlfriend, Maggie O&apos;Hooligan ( Sarah Holcomb ), work as servers as Danny becomes enamored of Lacey. Maggie informs Danny of Lacey&apos;s sexually promiscuous reputation, but this only encourages him. However, when Ty arrives, he too catches the eye of Lacey. Danny wins the Caddy Day golf tournament and seals the deal for his scholarship. This earns Danny praise from the Judge along with an invitation to a party at the Judge&apos;s upcoming yacht christening. At the yacht club, Lacey and Danny slip away for some private time at the Judge&apos;s house. Czervik literally crashes the party, destroying Smails&apos; tiny wooden sloop with his enormous yacht. The judge and his wife angrily return home and discover Lacey and Danny naked in his bed. The judge chases Danny out of his house with a golf club. The next day, Judge Smails calls Danny into the office. Expecting to be fired, Danny is surprised when the judge offers him the scholarship after Danny promises never to mention the embarrassing incident involving Lacey to anybody. Afterward, Czervik encounters Smails in the club&apos;s private bar and states to him that he wishes to buy the club and build condominiums on the site. To avoid a scuffle, Webb helps the two men to agree to a golf match contest for $20,000. Smails and Dr. Beeper against Czervik and Webb. The match is held the following day. Smails chooses Danny to be his caddy. Suddenly, word spreads of the stakes involved and a crowd builds. With Smails&apos; team ahead at the end of the 9th hole, Czervik decides to double the stakes to $40,000. But Czervik is having his worst game ever, so when a ricocheting ball strikes him, he pretends to be hurt in hopes of having the contest declared null. The club&apos;s manger, Lou ( Brian Doyle-Murray ), standing in as an umpire, tells Czervik his team will forfeit unless they find a substitute. Webb chooses Danny, causing Smails to threaten his scholarship; Danny realizes that award has too many strings for his liking, especially when Smails is tugging on the ends of them, so he teams up with Ty. Czervik promises to Danny that he will make it &quot; worth his while &quot; if he wins. At the final hole, the score is tied. Judge Smails makes his putt, putting the Smails-Beeper team ahead by one shot. Danny must sink his very long putt to force a tie. Czervik raises the stakes to a double-or-nothing $80,000 on Danny making the putt, which Smails accepts. Danny&apos;s putt reaches the edge of the cup and stops, causing Smails and Beeper to begin celebrating. While the match has been going on, Carl Spackler has been escalating his attempts to destroy the gopher, and he has now wired much of the course with plastic explosives shaped to look like small, harmless animals. As Danny&apos;s putt hangs on the edge of the cup, Carl pushes the detonator and explosions shake the whole course. The force of the explosions causes Danny&apos;s ball to drop, so the Webb-Danny-Czervik team wins the $80,000 bet. Smails refuses to pay, which Czervik anticipated; he has a couple of big bruiser types &quot; help the Judge find his check book. &quot; As Smails is chased throughout the course, Czervik then inexplicably shouts, &quot; Hey everybody, we&apos;re all gonna get laid! &quot; receiving thunderous cheers from the spectators. The gopher emerges, unharmed by the explosives, and dances to Kenny Loggins &apos; &quot; I&apos;m Alright &quot; as the credits roll.

His brothers Bill and John Murray (production assistant and a caddy extra), and director Harold Ramis also had worked as caddies when they were teenagers. Many of the characters in the film were based on characters they had encountered through their various experiences at the club, including a young woman upon whom the Maggie character is based and the Haverkampfs, a doddery old couple, John &amp; Ilma, longtime members of the club, who can barely hit the ball out of their shadows ( &quot; That&apos;s a peach, hon &quot; ). The now legendary scene involving a Baby Ruth candy bar being thrown into the swimming pool was based on a real-life incident at Doyle-Murray&apos;s high school.

However, the improvisational atmosphere surrounding the other cast members (specifically Dangerfield, Chase, and Murray) led to Dangerfield&apos;s, Chase&apos;s and Murray&apos;s roles expansion from cameos to starring roles, much to the annoyance of O&apos;Keefe and Colomby. In addition, Ted Knight, who was regarded as a genuinely nice person in real life, became fed up with the constant improvisation. The mistaking-a- chocolate bar -for-a-piece-of- excrement -in-the-pool scene was filmed at Coral Ridge Country Club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. [ September 2008 ]. The dinner and dancing scene was filmed at the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Boca Raton, Florida. { On Location: Caddyshack filming locations. } The film was shot over 11 weeks during the autumn of 1979. Golf scenes were filmed at the Rolling Hills Golf Club (now the Grande Oaks Golf Club) in Davie, Florida. { Grande Oaks Golf Club. } According to Ramis, it was picked because the course did not have any palm trees. He wanted the movie to feel that it was in the Mid-West, not Florida. The explosions that take place during the climax of the film were reported at the nearby Fort Lauderdale airport by an incoming pilot, who suspected a plane had crashed. Also the explosions were not approved by the club owners, who were at the background at all times, in fear of them damaging the course. The movie producers were able to convince the club owners to attend an off site meeting. When they were gone, the crew set off the explosions. The marina scene involving Al Czervik&apos;s boat wreaking havoc upon Judge Smails&apos;s &quot; dinghy &quot; was filmed in Biscayne Bay in Miami, Florida. The famous scene that begins when Ty Webb&apos;s golf ball crashes into Carl Spackler&apos;s ramshackle house was not in the original script. It was added by director Harold Ramis after realizing that two of his biggest stars, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray (who did not get along due to a feud dating back to their days on Saturday Night Live ), did not have a scene together. The three met for lunch and wrote the scene together. This is the only time that Chase and Murray have appeared in a movie together. [ Mark Canton, Chevy Chase, Scott Colomby, Hamilton Mitchell, Cindy Morgan, Jon Peters, Harold Ramis, Ann Ryerson Caddyshack: The 19th Hole, Special Feature DVD Warner Brothers 1999 ] Bill Murray&apos;s famous &quot; Cinderella story &quot; scene was improvised based on two lines of stage direction. Ramis basically gave him direction to act as a kid announcing his own imaginary golf moment. Murray just took it from there. The flowers were his idea. Murray was with the production only six days, and all of his lines were unscripted. In interviews, Cindy Morgan stated that the scene she shared with Chevy Chase, in which he pours massage oil on her, was completely improvised, and her reaction to Chase dousing her back with the massage oil, where she exclaimed &quot; You&apos;re crazy! &quot;, was genuine. Due to the fact she is legally blind without glasses or contacts, as well as afraid of heights, there was concern about the scene where she had to dive into the pool. Morgan climbed the ladder, but the flawless dive was executed by a professional diver.

A simple hand puppet was created by the props department for that scene, with the director&apos;s assistant (Trevor Albert) the delegated puppeteer. After several cuts of the film reduced the original story arc (of Danny&apos;s relationship with the Irish waitress) another through line was required. The producers suggested that the gopher&apos;s battle with Bill Murray&apos;s character be further developed. Therefore, the remaining gopher sequences were written and filmed after the movie was shot. Director Harold Ramis at one point suggested a live animal to play the gopher. Rusty Lemorande, executive in charge of production, and specifically assigned to supervise post production, searched for a suitable creature builder. Companies such as The Henson Company (which became the premiere creature builders in the 80&apos;s) did not yet take outside assignments, so Lemorande contacted friends at Walt Disney Imagineering for advice. One of the Disney theme park creature designers, Jeff Burke, was willing to create the character but only on a moonlight basis. Burke was responsible for the creature&apos;s design and character with input and guidance from Lemorande. The rod puppet sat in Lemorande&apos;s office for weeks. During that time producers Kenny and Peter and Director Ramis would come into the office to play with the creature, all trying to figure out how to integrate it into the film. Simultaneously, an overall deal was made with John Dykstra &apos;s effects company for all the necessary visual effects (including lightning, stormy sky effects, flying golf balls, disappearing greens&apos; flags, etc.) so shooting the gopher puppet became part of the intensely negotiated effects package. Dykstra&apos;s technician&apos;s added extra animation to the existing puppet, including ear movement, and built the tunnels through which he moved. The gopher sounds were the same sounds used by Flipper the dolphin in the 60&apos;s television show of the same name. This was after principal cinematography had been completed and used higher quality film stock in an indoor soundstage resulting in the higher picture quality of these scenes still evident even on the current DVD. { &apos;&apos;Trivia&apos;&apos; from IMDB.com } [ Reception ] Caddyshack was released on July 25, 1980, in 656 theaters, where it grossed $3.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $39,846,344 in North America. The film holds a 75% approval rating at popular review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 38 reviews, with the consensus: &quot; Though unabashedly crude and juvenile, Caddyshack nevertheless scores with its classic slapstick, unforgettable characters, and endlessly quotable dialogue. &quot; { Caddyshack at } { Rotten Tomatoes } Christopher Null gave the film four stars out of five, and wrote, &quot; They don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore... The plot wanders around the golf course and involves a half-dozen elements, but if you simply dig the gopher, the caddy, and the Dangerfield, you&apos;re not going to be doing half bad. &quot; { Caddyshack review at } { Filmcritic.com&apos;s } Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot; Caddyshack feels more like a movie that was written rather loosely, so that when shooting began there was freedom - too much freedom - for it to wander off in all directions in search of comic inspiration &quot;.
