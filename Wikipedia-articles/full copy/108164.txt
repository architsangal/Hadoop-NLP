[ History ] The Europe an settlement of what is now Saratoga occurred in 1848, when William Campbell (father of Benjamin Campbell, the founder of nearby Campbell, California ), constructed a sawmill about [ 2.5 mi km ] southeast of the present downtown area. An early map noted the area as Campbell&apos;s Gap. In 1851 Martin McCarthy, who had leased the mill, built a toll road down to the Santa Clara Valley, and founded what is now Saratoga as McCarthysville. [ California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names Erwin G. Gudde, William T. Bright 2004 University of California Press 351 978-0-520-24217-3 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DKqwt5RlMVBoC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3Dgudde%2Bplace%2Bnames#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dcongress%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 2010-10-30 ] The toll gate was located at the present day intersection of Big Basin Way and 3rd St., giving the town its first widely used name: Toll Gate. In 1867 the town received a post office under the name of McCarthysville. Industry soon sprang up and at its pinnacle the town had a furniture factory, grist mill, tannery, and a paper factory. To commemorate this newfound productivity the town was renamed again in 1863 as Bank Mills. In the 1850s Jud Caldwell discovered spring s which were called Pacific Congress Springs because the water had a mineral content similar to Congress Springs, in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1865 the town received its final name, Saratoga, after the city in New York. At the same time a resort hotel called Congress Hall was constructed at the springs, named after the famous resort Congress Hall at Saratoga Springs, New York. California&apos;s Congress Hall attracted tourists to the area until it burned down in 1903. { State Route 9 (ahead), and Saratoga-Sunnyvale road (to the north) } Saratoga became agricultural, as did much of the rest of the valley; a few vineyard s and orchard s from this period remain today. After World War II the town quickly became urbanized, and it incorporated in 1956 mostly to avoid being annexed to San Jose. A slogan during the campaign to incorporate the city of Saratoga was &quot; Keep it rural, &quot; according to historian Willys I. Peck. Today the city serves as a bedroom community for upper-middle class Silicon Valley tech workers. [ Government ] [ Local ] Saratoga is a general law city under California law, meaning that the organization and powers of the city are established by state law. It has a council-manager form of government. The city council is made up of five members elected by the public. The council appoints a mayor and vice-mayor from its membership, with the vice-mayor serving in the absence of the mayor. The mayor has no veto power, but acts as chairman for council meetings, and serves as a visible head of government. Council members serve four-year terms, with the election of two and three members staggered every two years. The city manager is the administrative head of the government, and also serves as city treasurer. The manager&apos;s duties include preparing financial reports, submitting an annual budget, managing city employees, seeing that city ordinances are enforced, supervising city property, and investigating complaints against the city. The manager also appoints the city clerk. In addition to the council and manager, the city has a number of commissions that serve to advise the council on various issues. Commission members are appointed by the council, and serve a maximum of two four year terms. Currently, the city has commissions for finance, heritage preservation, the library, parks and recreation, planning, and traffic safety. Also, the city has a Youth Commission, which consists of middle and high school students who represent Saratoga youth in government and serve one or two year terms.
