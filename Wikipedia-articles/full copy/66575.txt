Nutrient cycle in the oceans A nutrient is a chemical that an organism needs to live and grow or a substance used in an organism&apos;s metabolism which must be taken in from its environment. { Whitney, Elanor and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition, p 6. Thomson-Wadsworth. } They are used to build and repair tissues, regulate body processes and are converted to and used as energy. Methods for nutrient intake vary, with animals and protist s consuming foods that are digested by an internal digestive system, but most plant s ingest nutrients directly from the soil through their root s or from the atmosphere. Organic nutrients include carbohydrate s, fat s, protein s (or their building blocks, amino acid s ), and vitamin s. Inorganic chemical compounds such as dietary mineral s, water, and oxygen may also be considered nutrients. [ FRANCES SIZER ELLIE WHITNEY NUTRITION: CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES http://books.google.com/books?id%3DmDhMU0Sv6asC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPT26 12 October 2010 12 November 2007 Cengage Learning 978-0-495-39065-7 26– ] A nutrient is said to be &quot; essential &quot; if it must be obtained from an external source, either because the organism cannot synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities. Nutrients needed in very small amounts are micronutrient s and those that are needed in larger quantities are called macronutrients. The effects of nutrients are dose-dependent and shortages are called deficiencies. [ Audrey H. Ensminger Foods &amp; nutrition encyclopedia http://books.google.com/books?id%3DXMA9gYIj-C4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA527 12 October 2010 1994 CRC Press 978-0-8493-8980-1 527– ] See healthy diet for more information on the role of nutrients in human nutrition. [ Types of nutrient ] [ Nutrition ] Macronutrients is defined in several different ways. [ Mark Kern CRC desk reference on sports nutrition http://books.google.com/books?id%3DuOYqeeXWomwC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA117 12 October 2010 12 May 2005 CRC Press 978-0-8493-2273-0 117– ] The chemical element s humans consume in the largest quantities are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur, or CHNOPS. The classes of chemical compound s humans consume in the largest quantities and which provide bulk energy are carbohydrate s, protein s, and fats. Water and atmospheric oxygen also must be consumed in large quantities, but are not always considered &quot; food &quot; or &quot; nutrients &quot;. Calcium, salt ( sodium and chloride ), magnesium, and potassium (along with phosphorus and sulfur) are sometimes added to the list of macronutrients because they are required in large quantities compared to other vitamins and minerals. They are sometimes referred to as the macrominerals. [ Substances that provide energy ] Carbohydrate s are compounds made up of types of sugar s. Carbohydrates are classified by their number of sugar units: monosaccharide s (such as glucose and fructose ), disaccharide s (such as sucrose and lactose ), oligosaccharide s, and polysaccharide s (such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose ). Protein s are organic compound s that consist of the amino acid s joined by peptide bond s. The body cannot manufacture some of the amino acid s (termed essential amino acid s ); the diet must supply these. In nutrition, proteins are broken down through digestion by protease s back into free amino acids. Fat s consist of a glycerin molecule with three fatty acid s attached. Fatty acids are unbranched hydrocarbon chains, connected by single bonds alone ( saturated fatty acids ) or by both double and single bonds ( unsaturated fatty acids ). Fats are needed to keep cell membrane s functioning properly, to insulate body organs against shock, to keep body temperature stable, and to maintain healthy skin and hair. The body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed essential fatty acid s ) and the diet must supply these. Fat has an energy content of 9 kcal/g (~37.7 kJ/g); protein s and carbohydrate s 4 kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g). Ethanol ( grain alcohol ) has an energy content of 7 kcal/g (~29.3 kJ/g). { Coyle EF. 1995. Fat metabolism during exercise. Sports science exchange 8(6):59-65 } [ Substances that support metabolism ] Dietary mineral s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism. Vitamin s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as coenzyme s or cofactors for various proteins in the body. Water is an essential nutrient and is the solvent in which all the chemical reactions of life take place. [ Plant nutrition Fertilizer ] The strip of a green alga (&apos;&apos;Enteromorpha&apos;&apos;) along this shore indicates that there is a nearby source of nutrients (probably nitrates or ammonia from a small estuary). Plants absorb nutrients from the soil or the atmosphere, or from water (mainly aquatic plants) an exception are the carnivorous plant s, which externally digest nutrients from animals, before ingesting them. [ David Sadava H. Craig Heller David M. Hillis May Berenbaum Life: The Science of Biology http://books.google.com/books?id%3DANT8VB14oBUC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA767 12 October 2010 2009 Macmillan 978-1-4292-1962-4 767– ] The chemical elements consumed in the greatest quantities by plants are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These are present in the environment in the form of water and carbon dioxide; energy is provided by sunlight. [ J. Benton Jones Plant nutrition manual http://books.google.com/books?id%3DrNP2exwYMJIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA34 14 October 2010 1998 CRC Press 978-1-884015-31-1 34– ] Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the &quot; Big Six &quot; are the elemental macronutrients for all organisms, { New Link in Chain of Life, } { Wall Street Journal, 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. &quot; Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA. &quot; } often represented by the acronym CHNOPS. { CHNOPS: The Six Most Abundant Elements of Life, } { Pearson BioCoach, 2010, accessed 2010-12-09. &quot; Most biological molecules are made from covalent combinations of six important elements, whose chemical symbols are CHNOPS.... Although more than 25 types of elements can be found in biomolecules, six elements are most common. These are called the CHNOPS elements; the letters stand for the chemical abbreviations of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. &quot; } Usually they are sourced from inorganic (e.g. carbon dioxide, water, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate ) or organic (e.g. carbohydrate s, lipid s, protein s ) compounds, although elemental diatomic molecule s of nitrogen and (especially) oxygen are often used. Other chemical elements are also necessary to carry out various life processes and build structures; see fertilizer and micronutrient for more information. Some of these are considered macronutrients in certain organisms. The mnemonic C. HOPKiN&apos;S CaFe Mg (to be used as C. Hopkins coffee mug) is used by some students to remember the list as: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, sulfur, calcium, iron, and magnesium. Silicon, chloride, sodium, copper, zinc, and molybdenum are sometimes also included, but are in other cases considered micronutrients. [ Essential and non-essential nutrients ] [ Essential nutrient ] Nutrients are frequently categorized as essential or nonessential. Essential nutrient s are unable to be synthesized internally (either at all, or in sufficient quantities), and so must be consumed by an organism from its environment. [ John Griffith Vaughan Catherine Geissler Barbara Nicholson Elisabeth Dowle, Elizabeth Rice The new Oxford book of food plants http://books.google.com/books?id%3DUdKxFcen8zgC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA212 13 October 2010 2009 Oxford University Press US 978-0-19-954946-7 212– ] Nonessential nutrients are those nutrients that can be made by the body, they may often also be absorbed from consumed food. The majority of animals ultimately derive their essential nutrients from plants, though some animals may consume mineral-based soils to supplement their diet. For humans, these include essential fatty acid s, essential amino acid s, vitamin s, and certain dietary mineral s. Oxygen and water are also essential for human survival, but are generally not considered &quot; food &quot; when consumed in isolation. Humans can derive energy from a wide variety of fat s, carbohydrate s, protein s, and ethanol, and can synthesize other needed amino acids from the essential nutrients. Non-essential substances within foods can still have a significant impact on health, whether beneficial or toxic. For example, most dietary fiber is not absorbed by the human digestive tract, but is important in digestion and absorption of otherwise harmful substances. Interest has recently increased in phytochemical s, which include many non-essential substances which may have health benefits. [ Deficiencies and toxicity ] An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including inadequacy in nutrient intake called dietary deficiency, or conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism. [ Audrey H. Ensminger Foods &amp; nutrition encyclopedia http://books.google.com/books?id%3DXMA9gYIj-C4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA527 13 October 2010 1994 CRC Press 978-0-8493-8980-1 527– ] Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion. Nutrient toxicity occurs when an excess of a nutrient does harm to an organism. In plants five types of deficiency or toxicity symptoms are common: { http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/BotanicalSciences/PlantHormones/EssentialPlant/EssentialPlant.htm } Chlorosis - which is the yellowing of plant tissue caused by a shortage of chlorophyll synthesis. Necrosis - which is the death of plant tissue. Accumulation of anthocynanin - which produces a purple or reddish colorization of foliage and/or stems. Lack of new growth. Stunting or reduced growth - where new growth is stunted or reduced. Oversupply of plant nutrients in the environment can cause excessive plant and algae growth. Eutrophication, as this process is called, may cause imbalances in population numbers and other nutrients that can be harmful to certain species. For example, an algal bloom can deplete the oxygen available for fish to breathe. Causes include water pollution from sewage or runoff from farms (carrying excess agricultural fertilizer). Nitrogen and phosphorus are most commonly the limiting factor in growth, and thus the most likely to trigger eutrophication when introduced artificially. [ References ] Donatelle, Rebecca J.2008.
