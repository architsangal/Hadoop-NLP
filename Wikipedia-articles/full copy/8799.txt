[ D. B. Cooper DBCooper.jpg A 1972 F.B.I. composite drawing of D.  B. Cooper Unknown Dan Cooper Hijacking a Boeing 727 on Nov. 24, 1971, and parachuting from the plane mid-flight; has never been captured. ] { s fate unknown) } { All 42 passengers and crew } D. B. Cooper is the name popularly used to refer to an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft in the airspace between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington on November 24, 1971. He extorted $ 200,000 in ransom and parachuted to an uncertain fate. Despite an extensive manhunt and an exhaustive (and ongoing) FBI investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or positively identified. The case remains the only unsolved air piracy in American aviation history. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 135 ] The suspect purchased his airline ticket under the alias Dan Cooper, but due to a news media miscommunication he became known in popular lore as &quot; D. B. Cooper. &quot; Hundreds of leads have been pursued in the ensuing years but no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced regarding Cooper&apos;s true identity or whereabouts, and the bulk of the ransom money has never been recovered. Numerous theories of widely varying plausibility have been proposed by experts, reporters, and amateur enthusiasts. While FBI investigators have insisted from the beginning that Cooper probably did not survive his risky jump, the agency maintains an active case file—which has grown to more than 60 volumes —and continues to solicit creative ideas and new leads from the public. &quot; Maybe a hydrologist can use the latest technology to trace the $5,800 in ransom money found in 1980 to where Cooper landed upstream, &quot; suggested Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigation team since 2006. &quot; Or maybe someone just remembers that odd uncle. &quot; [ Hijacking ] The event began mid-afternoon on Thanksgiving eve, November 24, 1971, at Portland International Airport in Portland, Oregon. A man carrying a black attaché case approached the flight counter of Northwest Orient Airlines. He identified himself as &quot; Dan Cooper &quot; and purchased a one-way ticket on Flight  305, a 30-minute trip to Seattle, Washington. Cooper boarded the aircraft, a Boeing 727–100 ( FAA registration N467US), and took seat 18C (18E by some accounts, { History&apos;s Greatest Unsolved Crimes. Frances Farmer Archive Retrieved February 7, 2011. } 15D by another [ Gunther 1985 32 ] ) in the rear of the passenger cabin. He lit a cigarette and ordered a bourbon and soda. Onboard eyewitnesses recalled a man in his mid-forties, between [ 5 ft 10 in ] and [ 6 ft 0 in ] tall. He wore a black lightweight raincoat, loafers, a dark suit, a neatly pressed white collared shirt, a black necktie, and a mother of pearl tie pin. [ D.B.

Cooper Flight  305, approximately one-third full, took off on schedule at 2:50  pm, local time ( PST ). Cooper passed a note to Florence Schaffner, the flight attendant situated nearest to him in a jumpseat attached to the aft stair door. Schaffner, assuming the note contained a lonely businessman&apos;s phone number, dropped it unopened into her purse. [ Myths and Mysteries of Washington Bragg Lynn E. 2005 Globe Pequot Guilford, Connecticut 2 0-7627-3427-2 ] Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, &quot; Miss, you&apos;d better look at that note.

Cooper cracked open his briefcase long enough for her to glimpse eight red cylinders ( &quot; four on top of four &quot; ) attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. { Transcript of Crew Communications Retrieved February 25, 2011. } After closing the case he dictated his demands: $200,000 in &quot; negotiable American currency &quot;; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 18 ] Schaffner conveyed Cooper&apos;s instructions to the cockpit; when she returned he was wearing dark sunglasses. [ The D.B. Cooper Story: The Crime Krajicek David http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/2.html Crime Library January 3, 2008 ] Flight 305&apos;s pilot, William Scott, contacted Seattle-Tacoma Airport air traffic control, which informed local and Federal authorities. The 36 other passengers were informed that their arrival in Seattle would be delayed due to a &quot; minor mechanical difficulty. &quot; [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 20 ] Northwest Orient&apos;s president, Donald Nyrop, authorized payment of the ransom, and ordered all Northwest employees to cooperate fully with the hijacker. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 19 ] The aircraft circled Puget Sound for approximately two hours to allow Seattle police and the FBI time to collect Cooper’s parachutes and ransom money (and mobilize emergency personnel). Schaffner recalled that Cooper appeared to be familiar with the local terrain; at one point he remarked, &quot; Looks like Tacoma down there, &quot; as the aircraft flew above it. He also mentioned, correctly, that McChord Air Force Base was only a 20-minute drive from Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or &quot; take-me-to-Cuba &quot; political dissidents) popularly associated with air piracy at the time. Tina Mucklow, another flight attendant, agreed. &quot; He wasn&apos;t nervous, &quot; she told investigators later. &quot; He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time. &quot; He ordered a second bourbon and water, paid his drink tab (and insisted Schaffner keep the change), and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 22 ] FBI agents assembled the ransom money from several Seattle-area banks—10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, many with serial numbers beginning with the letter &quot; L &quot; indicating issuance by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, most carrying a &quot; Series 1969-C &quot; designation [ The D.B. Cooper Story: Meeting the Demands Krajicek David http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/4.html Crime Library January 3, 2008 ] —and made a microfilm photograph of each of them. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 25 ] Cooper rejected the military-issue parachutes initially offered by authorities, demanding instead civilian parachutes with manually operated ripcord s. Seattle police obtained them from a local skydiving school. [ Passengers released ] At 4:39  pm Cooper was informed that his demands had been met and the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport at 5:45  pm. [ The D.B. Cooper Story: &apos;Everything Is Ready&apos; Krajicek David http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/5.html Crime Library January 3, 2008 ] Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and extinguish lights in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest&apos;s Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 28 ] Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane. During refueling Cooper outlined his flight plan to the cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum air speed possible without stalling the aircraft (approximately [ 100 kn ] ) at a maximum [ 10000 foot ] altitude. To ensure a minimum speed he specified that the landing gear remain down, in the takeoff/landing position, and the wing flaps be lowered 15  degrees. To ensure a low altitude he ordered that the cabin remain unpressurized. { Rothenberg and Ulvaeus, p. 5. } Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft&apos;s range was limited to approximately [ 1000 mi ] under the specified flight configuration, which meant they would have to refuel once again before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada as the refueling stop. Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest&apos;s home office objected on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase down. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would not argue the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 33–34 ] An FAA official requested a face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied. [ Rothenberg David Marta Ulvaeus The New Earth Reader: The Best of Terra Nova MIT Press 1999 Cambridge, Massachusetts 4 0-262-18195-9 ] The refueling process was delayed, reportedly due to a vapor lock in the fuel tanker truck&apos;s pumping mechanism [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 32 ], and Cooper became suspicious. However, he allowed a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third one after that, when the second ran dry. By the time Cooper finished inspecting the ransom money and parachutes, refueling had been completed. [ Back in the air ] { Boeing 727 with the aft airstair open } At approximately 7:40  pm the 727 took off with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson aboard. Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper&apos;s view. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 36 ] A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 until it ran low on fuel and turned back near the Oregon-California border. [ Gunther 1985 53 ] After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to join the rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow observed Cooper tying something around his waist. [ The D.B. Cooper Story: The Jump Krajicek David http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/scams/DB_Cooper/6.html Crime Library January 9, 2008 ] At approximately 8:00  pm a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew&apos;s offer of assistance via the aircraft&apos;s intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open. At approximately 8:13  pm the aircraft&apos;s tail section sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming to bring the plane back to level flight. { Bragg, p. 4. } At approximately 10:15  pm Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff&apos;s deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it had not yet been determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that he was gone. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 48 ] [ Investigation ] Aboard the airliner FBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints, Cooper&apos;s black clip-on tie and mother of pearl tie clip, and two of the four parachutes, one of which had been opened and two shroud lines cut from its canopy. [ F.B.I. reheats cold case National Post Cowan James January 3, 2008 http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id%3D211616 January 9, 2008 http://web.archive.org/web/20080121231748/http%3A//www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id%3D211616 January 21, 2008 ] Eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all individuals who personally interacted with Cooper, were interrogated. A series of composite sketches was developed. { F.B.I. FOIA file part 1, from F.B.I. FOIA catalogue on the Dan Cooper case, also see } { the actual F.B.I. poster. } Local police and FBI agents immediately began questioning possible suspects. One of the first was an Oregon man with a minor police record named D. B. Cooper, contacted by Portland police on the off-chance that the hijacker had used his real name, or the same alias in a previous crime. His involvement was quickly ruled out; but an inexperienced wire service reporter (Clyde Jabin of UPI by most accounts, { Guzman, Monica (November 27, 2007). Update: Everyone wants a piece of the D. B. Cooper legend. Seattle &apos;&apos;Post-Intelligencer&apos;&apos; archive Retrieved February 25, 2011. } Joe Frazier of AP by others [ Gunther 1985 55 ] ), rushing to meet an imminent deadline, confused the eliminated suspect&apos;s name with the pseudonym used by the hijacker. The mistake was picked up and repeated by numerous other media sources, and the moniker &quot; D. B. Cooper &quot; became lodged in the public&apos;s collective memory. { 727 &apos;s rear airstair, deploying in flight. The gravity-operated apparatus remained open until the aircraft landed. } A precise search area was difficult to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft&apos;s speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper&apos;s projected landing point considerably. An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. [ Gunther 1985 68 ] Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. [ D.B. Cooper legend still up in air 25  years after leap, hijackers prompts strong feelings San Francisco Chronicle Taylor Michael November 24, 1996 ] The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 47 ] An experimental re-creation was conducted using the same aircraft hijacked by Cooper in the same flight configuration, piloted by Scott. FBI agents, pushing a [ 200 lb on ] sled out of the open airstair, were able to reproduce the upward motion of the tail section described by the flight crew at 8:13  pm. Based on this experiment, it was concluded that 8:13  pm was the most likely jump time. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 80–81 ] At that moment the aircraft was flying through a heavy rainstorm over the Lewis River in southwestern Washington. Initial extrapolations placed Cooper&apos;s landing area on the southernmost outreach of Mount St. Helens, a few miles southeast of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River. [ 30 years ago, D.B. Cooper&apos;s night leap began a legend Seattle Post-Intelligencer Skolnik Sam November 22, 2001 http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80264926.html January 9, 2008 ] Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz Counties, encompassing the terrain immediately south and north, respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. { Topographic map, northern half of primary search area Retrieved February 25, 2011. } { Topographic map, southern half of primary search area Retrieved February 25, 2011. } FBI agents and Sheriff&apos;s deputies from those counties searched large areas of the mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door questioning and searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 67–68 ] No trace of Cooper, or any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found. The FBI also coordinated an aerial search, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the Oregon Army National Guard, along the entire flight path (known as Victor 23 in standard aviation terminology [ Aeronautical Information Manual Federal Aviation Administration http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/chap5/aim0503.html 2011-08-10 http://web.archive.org/web/20110721041334/http%3A//www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap5/aim0503.html 2011-07-21 ] but &quot; Vector 23 &quot; in most Cooper literature [ Nuttall 2010 90-91 ] ) from Seattle to Reno. While numerous broken treetops and several pieces of plastic and other objects that, from the air, resembled parachute canopies were sighted and investigated, nothing relevant to the hijacking was found. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 71 ] In early 1972, shortly after the spring thaw, teams of FBI agents aided by some 200 Army soldiers from Fort Lewis, along with Air Force personnel, National Guard troops, and civilian volunteers, conducted another thorough ground search of Clark and Cowlitz Counties for eighteen days in March, and then an additional eighteen days in April.

[ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 86 ] Ultimately, the search operation—arguably the most extensive, and intensive, in U.S. history—uncovered no significant material evidence related to the hijacking. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 87–89 ] [ Later developments ] Subsequent analyses called the original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper&apos;s speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional data from a variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 111–113 ] This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 114–116 ] &quot; I have to confess, &quot; wrote retired FBI chief investigator Ralph Himmelsbach in his 1986 book, &quot; if I [were] going to look for Cooper, I would head for the Washougal. &quot; [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 115 ] The Washougal Valley and its surroundings have been searched by multiple private individuals and groups in subsequent years; to date, nothing directly traceable to the hijacking has been found. [ Search for ransom money ] In late 1971 the FBI distributed lists of the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses routinely conducting significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15  percent of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. [ Crick Rolla J. 1,000 Offered For First $20 Bill The Oregon Journal November 22, 1973 http://foia.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf PDF March 3, 2008 25 ] In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a Newsweek reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker. { FBI files on Fleming case, released via Freedom of Information Act Retrieved February 15, 2011. } In early 1973, with the ransom money still missing, The (Portland) Oregon &apos;&apos;Journal&apos;&apos; republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 to the first person to turn in a ransom bill to the newspaper or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the &apos;&apos;Post-Intelligencer&apos;&apos; made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 95 ] The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving, 1974, and while there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. [ Crick Rolla J. Winner of D.B.

[ Gunther 1985 184 ] [ Statute of limitations ] In 1976 discussion arose over impending expiration of the statute of limitations on the hijacking. Most published legal analysis agreed that it would make little difference, as interpretation of the statute varies considerably from case to case and court to court, and a prosecutor could argue that Cooper had forfeited immunity on any of several valid technical grounds. { CRS Report for Congress: Statutes of Limitation in Federal Criminal Cases: An Overview. FAS.org Retrieved March 6, 2011. } The question was rendered moot in November when a Portland grand jury returned an indictment against &quot; John Doe, aka Dan Cooper &quot; for air piracy and violation of the Hobbs Act. { Denson, Bryan (November 24, 1996). D.B. Cooper legend lives. Oregon Live archive Retrieved March 6, 2011. } In effect the indictment formally initiated prosecution of the hijacker that can be continued, should he be apprehended, at any time in the future. [ Physical evidence ] In the autumn of 1978 a placard containing instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727, later verified to be from the hijacked airliner, was found by a deer hunter near a logging road about 13  miles (21  km) east of Castle Rock, Washington, well north of Lake Merwin but within the basic path of Flight 305. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 108 ] Portion of Brian Ingram&apos;s 1980 discovery In February 1980 an eight-year-old boy named Brian Ingram, vacationing with his family on the Columbia River about 9  miles (15  km) downstream from Vancouver, Washington and 20  miles (32  km) southwest of Ariel, uncovered three packets of the ransom cash, significantly disintegrated but still bundled in rubber bands, as he raked the sandy riverbank to build a campfire.

[ http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, pp. 10–12 PDF 2011-04-23 ] { Associated Press (May 22, 1986). Boy to Split $5,520 of D. B. Cooper&apos;s Loot. &apos;&apos;LA Times&apos;&apos; archive Retrieved March 6, 2011. } The discovery launched multiple new rounds of conjecture, and ultimately raised many more questions than it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An Army Corps of Engineers hydrologist noted that the bills had disintegrated in a &quot; rounded &quot; fashion, and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 110 ] If so, it confirmed that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin, nor in any other part of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from the discovery site; and it lent credence to supplemental speculation (see Later developments ) placing the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 110–111 ] But the &quot; free floating &quot; hypothesis presented its own difficulties: It did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have stayed together after separating from the rest of the money. Himmelsbach observed that bundles floating downstream would have had to wash up on the bank &quot; within a couple of years &quot; of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated. [ http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 PDF 2011-04-23 ] Evidence, however, suggested that the bills arrived at the area of their discovery, a beachfront known as Tina&apos;s Bar, no earlier than 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating not only that the bills could not have been unearthed by the dredge itself, but that they arrived well after dredging had been completed. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 110 ] [ Cash linked to &apos;D.B. Cooper&apos; up for auction http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23889269 MSNBC March 31, 2008 March 31, 2008 ] Multiple alternate theories were advanced. Some surmised that the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. There was also the possibility that the money had been found on the riverbank earlier, perhaps before the dredging, and buried in a superficial sand layer at a later time. { Nuttall, George C. (2010) D.B. Cooper Case Exposed. Vantage Press. ISBN 0-533-16390-0 } The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few of the bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft after he jumped, and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor opined that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, simply dumped it in the river or buried it there (and possibly elsewhere) himself. [ Gunther 1985 203 ] No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence; the means by which the money arrived on the river bank remains unknown. In 1981 a human skull was unearthed along the same riverbank during excavations in search of additional evidence. Forensic pathologists eventually determined that it belonged to a woman, possibly of Native American ancestry. In 1986, after protracted negotiations, the recovered bills were divided equally between Ingram and Northwest Orient&apos;s insurer; the FBI retained 14 examples as evidence. { D.B.

Furthermore, from the two reserve parachutes given him, Cooper selected a &quot; dummy &quot; — an unusable unit with an inoperative ripcord intended for classroom demonstrations, despite the fact that it had clear markings identifying it to any experienced skydiver as non-functional. [ Gunther 1985 40 ] (Cooper cannibalized the other, functional reserve parachute, possibly using its shrouds to tie the money bag shut, and to secure the bag to his body, as witnessed by Mucklow. ) The FBI stressed that inclusion of the dummy reserve parachute, one of four obtained in haste from a Seattle skydiving school, was accidental. The agency also posted previously unreleased composite sketches and fact sheets, along with a request to the general public for information which might lead to Cooper&apos;s positive identification.

The group, now known as the Cooper Research Team, { Cooper Research Team web site } is using technology unavailable in 1971 to reinvestigate important components of the case. Using GPS and satellite imagery, they are attempting to determine if the money found by Ingram floated freely to its discovery location over time, or was found elsewhere and reburied. They have reexamined the 727&apos;s flight path from Seattle to Reno to more precisely estimate Cooper&apos;s landing zone. Using electron microscopy they examined hundreds of particles on Cooper&apos;s tie, identifying Lycopodium spores (likely from a pharmaceutical product), and fragments of bismuth and aluminum. { Cooper Research Team web site } In November 2011 Kaye announced that particles of pure titanium had also been found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, was found at that time only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. { Ingalls, Chris (November 23, 2011). 40 years later, new evidence emerges in D.B.

In all, a total of 15 hijackings similar to Cooper&apos;s were attempted over the course of 1972. Only Cooper, however, has eluded capture or identification. [ Theories and conjectures ] FBI sketch of Cooper, with age progression In the years since the hijacking the FBI has periodically made public some of its working hypotheses and tentative conclusions about the case, drawn from witness testimony and the scarce physical evidence. [ F.B.I. Seeks Help in Solving Skyjacking Mystery National Public Radio Tedford Deborah 2008-01-02 http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId%3D17787290 March 11, 2008 ] The official physical description remains unchanged and is considered reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed separately on the same night in separate cities, and gave nearly identical descriptions: [ 5 ft 10 in ] to [ 6 ft 0 in ] tall, [ 170 to 180 lb ], mid-40s, with close-set piercing brown eyes. Passengers and other eyewitnesses gave very similar descriptions. Agents believe that Cooper was familiar with the Seattle area and may have been an Air Force veteran, based on testimony that he recognized the city of Tacoma from the air as the jet circled Puget Sound, and his accurate comment to flight attendant Mucklow that McChord Air Force Base was approximately 20  minutes&apos; driving time from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport—a detail most civilians would not know, or comment upon. His financial situation was very likely desperate: Extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so, according to experts, because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 96 ] (A minority opinion is that Cooper was &quot; a thrill seeker &quot; who made the jump &quot; just to prove it could be done. &quot; [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 115 ] ) Agents theorize that he took his alias from a popular Belgian comic book series of the 1970s featuring the fictional hero Dan Cooper, a Royal Canadian Air Force test pilot who took part in numerous heroic adventures, including parachuting. (One cover from the series, reproduced on the FBI web site, depicts test pilot Cooper skydiving in full paratrooper regalia. ) Because the Dan Cooper comics were never translated into English nor imported to the US, they speculate that he may have encountered them during a tour of duty in Europe.

FBI-backed team finds Canadian link to famous ’70s plane hijacking Canadian &apos;&apos;National Post&apos;&apos; archive Retrieved December 5, 2011 } They note his specific demand for &quot; negotiable American currency &quot;, [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 18 ] a phrase seldom if ever used by American citizens; since witnesses stated that Cooper had no distinguishable accent, Canada would be his most likely country of origin if he were not an American. { Research Summary. Cooper Research Team web site Retrieved December 7, 2011 } The FBI task force believes that Cooper was a careful and shrewd planner: He asked for four parachutes to encourage the assumption among the authorities that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment. The amount and form of the ransom (if sources are correct that he specified 20-dollar bills ) appear also to have been carefully calculated in advance: 50- or 100-dollar bills would have drawn attention and been too difficult to pass, and a larger quantity of 20-dollar bills would have been too heavy and bulky for his jump. [ Gunther 1985 44 ] Cooper was apparently quite familiar with the 727-100 aircraft: It was the ideal choice at the time, not only for its aft airstair, but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, allowing a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had &quot; single-point fueling &quot; capability, a recent innovation which allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots. [ Gunther 1985 46 ] In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit. [ Gunther 1985 136 ] He may even have known, particularly if he served in Vietnam or had friends who did, that the Central Intelligence Agency had been using 727s to drop agents and supplies behind enemy lines in Vietnam. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 43 ] The Bureau feels strongly, however, that he lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. &quot; We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper, &quot; said Special Agent Carr, the current chief investigator. &quot; We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve &apos;chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked. &quot; He also failed to bring or request a helmet, [ Gunther 1985 15 ] and he chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him. Assuming Cooper was not a paratrooper, and was an Air Force veteran, Carr believes he could have been an aircraft cargo loader. Such an assignment would have given him knowledge and experience in the aviation industry; and because Air Force loaders throw cargo out of flying aircraft, they wear emergency parachutes in case they accidentally fall out. The rudimentary jump training loaders receive would have given Cooper a working knowledge of parachutes—but &quot; not necessarily sufficient knowledge to survive the jump he made. &quot; { In Search of D.B. Cooper: New Developments in the Unsolved Case (March 17, 2009). FBI.gov Retrieved January 31, 2011. } The Bureau has argued from the beginning that Cooper did not survive his jump. &quot; Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his &apos;chute open, &quot; said Carr. Even if he did land safely, agents contend, survival in the mountainous terrain would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point, which would have required a precisely timed jump, necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper had any such help from the crew, nor any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the overcast darkness. { &quot; It&apos;s an Enigma. &quot; JCS-Group.com Recovered 2011-1-31. } [ Suspects ] Since 1971 the FBI has processed over a thousand &quot; serious suspects &quot;, along with assorted publicity seekers, crackpots, and deathbed confessors. Most—but not all—have been definitively ruled out. The following is a compendium of the most prominent and better-known suspects: [ Kenneth Christiansen ] In 2003 a Minnesota resident named Lyle Christiansen, after watching a television documentary about the Cooper hijacking, became convinced that his elder brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book [ Porteous Blevins 2010 ] theorizing that Christiansen was indeed the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer&apos;s Decoded also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case. [ Brad Meltzer&apos;s Decoded D.B. Cooper History January 6, 2011 1 6 ] Christiansen enlisted in the Army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he did make occasional training jumps (for bonus money) while stationed in Japan with occupation forces in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the South Pacific, and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a purser, based in Seattle. Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5  ft. 8 in.), thinner (150 pounds), and lighter-complected than eyewitness descriptions. He was also balder; but his brother claims he wore a toupée routinely prior to the Cooper hijacking, and never wore it again afterward. Another witness, a longtime friend, confirmed that Christiansen ceased wearing his toupée after the hijacking, and claimed (as have proponents of other suspects ) that she recognized the hijacker&apos;s tie clip as one belonging to Christiansen. Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper&apos;s preferred beverage). He was also left-handed. (Evidence photos of Cooper&apos;s black tie show the tie clip applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer. ) Flight attendant Florence Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker’s appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown. (Tina Mucklow, who had the most contact with Cooper, has never granted a press interview. { Into the Blast (March 26, 2010). adventurebooks.newsvine.com Retrieved February 14, 2011. } ) Christiansen reportedly purchased a house with cash a few months after the hijacking. While dying of cancer in 1994, he told Lyle, &quot; There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you. &quot; Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain. After his death family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in his bank accounts. They also found a folder of news clippings about Northwest Orient which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline&apos;s history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story. Despite the publicity generated by Porteous&apos;s book and the 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime suspect. They cite a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions (despite Lyle’s toupée theory), a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.

Illegal flight lands pilot in trouble once again. &apos;&apos;Register-Guard&apos;&apos; archive Retrieved February 24, 2011. } He was suggested repeatedly as a suspect early in the investigation, according to FBI Agent Ralph Himmelsbach, who knew Mayfield from a prior dispute at a local airport. He was ruled out, based partly on the fact that he called Himmelsbach less than two hours after Flight 305 landed in Reno to volunteer advice on standard skydiving practices and possible landing zones. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 51 ] In 2006 two amateur researchers named Daniel Dvorak and Matthew Myers proposed him as a suspect once again, attracting coverage from a Portland television station [ sw6bXxqaq0s D.B. Cooper KOIN segment (2007) ] { Retrieved February 24, 2011. } and the syndicated program Inside Edition. [ Dat-UPEB15M D.B. Cooper Inside Edition segment (2007) ] { Retrieved February 24, 2011. } They claimed they had assembled a convincing circumstantial case that would be presented in detail in a forthcoming book. (Among other things, they theorized that Mayfield called Himmelsbach not to offer advice, but to establish an alibi; and they challenged Himmelsbach&apos;s conclusion that Mayfield could not possibly have found a phone in time to call the FBI less than four hours after jumping into the wilderness at night. ) Mayfield denied any involvement, and repeated a previous assertion that the FBI called him five times while the hijacking was still in progress to ask about skydiving techniques. (Himmelsbach said the FBI never called Mayfield. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 52 ] ) Mayfield further charged that Dvorak and Myers asked him to play along with their theory, and &quot; we&apos;ll all make a lot of money. &quot; (Dvorak and Myers called any inference of collusion a &quot; blatant lie. &quot; ) Dvorak died in 2007, { Websleuths archive (December, 2007) Retrieved February 24, 2011. } and the pair’s investigation and book apparently died with him. The FBI has offered no comment beyond Himmelsbach&apos;s original statement that Mayfield, who still resides in Sheridan, Oregon, was ruled out as a suspect early on. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 51 ] [ Jack Coffelt ] Coffelt was a conman, ex-convict, and purported government informant who claimed to have been the chauffeur and confidante of Abraham Lincoln&apos;s last undisputed descendant, great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith. In 1972, he also began claiming he was D.B. Cooper, and attempted through an intermediary, a former cellmate named James Brown, to sell his story to a Hollywood production company. He said he landed near Mount Hood (about [ 50 mi km ] southeast of Ariel), losing the ransom money and injuring himself in the process. Photos of Coffelt bear a resemblance to the composite drawings, although he was in his mid-fifties in 1971. He was reportedly in Portland on the day of the hijacking, and sustained leg injuries around that time which were consistent with a skydiving mishap. { Has The Mystery of D.B. Cooper Been Solved? (October 6, 2008). InsideEdition.com Retrieved March 8, 2011. } Coffelt&apos;s account was reviewed by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information that had not been made public, and was therefore a fabrication. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 83–84 ] Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 121–122 ] In a 2008 book about Lincoln&apos;s descendants, { Lachman, Charles (2008). The Last Lincolns: The Rise &amp; Fall of a Great American Family.

Cooper Skyjacking Case : The Two-Way : NPR Howard Berkes npr.org 2011 [last update] 1 August 2011 ] In early August, a woman named Marla Cooper came forward as the source of the new information. She claimed that she had proposed her uncle, a leather worker and Korean War veteran named Lynn Doyle Cooper, as the new suspect, and had provided the FBI with evidence—including a photo and a guitar strap her uncle had made—for fingerprint and DNA analysis. { Provano, Joel (August 3, 2011): Woman claims D.B. Cooper was her uncle. AJC.com Retrieved August 3, 2011. } The woman told ABC News that as an 8-year-old she recalled her two uncles planning something &quot; very mischievous &quot;, involving the use of &quot; expensive walkie-talkies &quot;, at her grandmother&apos;s house in Sisters, Oregon, [ 150 mi ] south of Portland. The next day flight 305 was hijacked; and though the uncles ostensibly were turkey hunting, one, L.D. Cooper, came home wearing a bloody shirt—the result, he said, of an auto accident. Later, she said, her parents came to believe that L.D. Cooper was the hijacker. She also recalled that her uncle, who died in 1999, was obsessed with the Canadian comic book hero Dan Cooper (see Theories and conjectures ), and &quot; had one of his comic books thumbtacked to his wall &quot; —although he was not a skydiver or paratrooper. { Thomas, P and Cloherty, J (August 3, 2011): &quot; D.B. Cooper Exclusive: Did Niece Provide Key Evidence? &quot; ABCNews.com Retrieved August 3, 2011. } On August 3 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that no fingerprints had been found on the guitar strap.

Cooper&apos;s DNA did not match the partial DNA profile obtained from the hijacker&apos;s tie; but he acknowledged that the FBI cannot be certain that the hijacker was the source of the organic material obtained from the tie. &quot; The tie had two small DNA samples, and one large sample lifted off in 2000–2001, &quot; he said. &quot; It&apos;s difficult to draw firm conclusions from these samples. &quot; He added that the Bureau &quot; [has not] come up with anything that is inconsistent with [Marla Cooper&apos;s] story &quot;, and will continue its investigation, with a focus on locating a sample of L.D. Cooper&apos;s fingerprints. { Cloherty, Jack (August 9, 2011): D.B. Cooper DNA Results: &quot; Not A Match &quot;. ABCNews.com Retrieved August 9, 2011 } [ Aftermath ] [ Airport security ] The Cooper hijacking marked the beginning of the end of unfettered and uninspected airline travel. Despite initiation of the federal Sky Marshal program the previous year, { Wu, Annie. The History of Airport Security. SavvyTraveler.publicradio.org Retrieved February 14, 2011. } 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972, 19 of them for the specific purpose of extorting money. (Most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba.) { Holden, Robert T. The Contagiousness of Aircraft Hijacking UCF.edu Archive Retrieved February 14, 2011. } In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. { Gladwell, Malcolm. The New Yorker (October 1, 2001): Safety in the Skies. New Yorker Archive Retrieved February 14, 2011. } In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon. [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 120 ] [ Aircraft modifications ] In the wake of multiple &quot; copycat &quot; hijackings in 1972 the FAA required that all Boeing  727 aircraft be fitted with a device, later dubbed the &quot; Cooper vane &quot;, which prevented lowering of the aft airstair during flight. [ D.B. Cooper puzzle: The legend turns 30.

A less-well-known modification mandated as a direct result of the hijacking was the installation of peepholes in all cockpit doors, making it possible for the cockpit crew to observe events in the passenger cabin with the cockpit door closed. [ Gunther 1985 50 ] [ Subsequent history of N467US ] In 1978 the hijacked 727-100 aircraft was sold by Northwest to Piedmont Airlines where it was renumbered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service. { Piedmont Memorable Moments. jetpiedmont.com Retrieved February 11, 2011. } In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct charter company Key Airlines, renumbered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force&apos;s civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between Nellis Air Force Base and the Tonopah Test Range during the top-secret F-117 Nighthawk development program. { Hengi, B.I. Airlines Remembered. Midland (June 10, 2000). ISBN 1-85780-091-5, pp. 56–7. } In 1996 the aircraft was scrapped for parts in a Memphis boneyard. [ Cultural phenomenon ] [ D. B. Cooper in popular culture ] While D.B. Cooper was ineluctably an air pirate and extortionist (Himmelsbach famously called him a &quot; rotten sleazy crook &quot; [ Himmelsbach Worcester 1986 116 ] ) who endangered the lives of 42 people and caused immeasurable inconvenience for many others, his bold, adventurous, unprecedented crime inspired a cult following, expressed through song, film and literature. Cities in the Pacific Northwest sold tourist souvenirs and held celebrations in his memory. He is remembered in Ariel, Washington with a &apos;Cooper Day&apos; event held annually on the weekend after Thanksgiving weekend, and elsewhere with Cooper-themed promotions held by restaurants and bowling alleys. Cooper has also been used in the storylines of such popular TV series as Prison Break, NewsRadio, and Numb3rs, as well as a book called The Vesuvius Prophecy based on The 4400 TV series. [ Richard W.
