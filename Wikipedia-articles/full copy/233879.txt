Alizarin in the commonest usage of the term has a deep red color, but the term is also part of the name for several related non-red dyes, such as Alizarine Cyanine Green and Alizarine Brilliant Blue. A notable use of alizarin in modern times is as a staining agent in biological research because it stains free calcium and certain calcium compounds a red or light purple color. Alizarin continues to be used commercially as a red textile dye, but to a lesser extent than 100 years ago. [ History ] Madder has been cultivated as a dyestuff since antiquity in central Asia and Egypt, where it was grown as early as 1500 BC. Cloth dyed with madder root pigment was found in the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun and in the ruins of Pompeii and ancient Corinth. [ March 2012 ] In the Middle Ages, Charlemagne encouraged madder cultivation. Madder was widely used as a dye in Western Europe in the Late Medieval centuries. { Many examples of the use of the word &quot; madder &quot;, meaning the roots of the plant Rubia tinctorum used as a dye, are given in the &apos;&apos;Middle English Dictionary&apos;&apos;, a dictionary of late medieval English. } In 17th century England, alizarin was used as a red dye for the clothing of the parliamentary New Model Army. The distinctive red color would continue to be worn for centuries (though also produced by other dyes such as cochineal ), giving English and later British soldiers the nickname of &quot; redcoats &quot;. { color } The madder dyestuff is combined with a dye mordant. According to which mordant used, the resulting color may be anywhere from pink through purple to dark brown. In the 18th century the most valued color was a bright red known as &quot; Turkey Red &quot;. The combination of mordants and overall technique used to obtain the Turkey Red originated in the Middle East or Turkey (hence the name). It was a complex and multi-step technique in its Middle Eastern formulation, some parts of which were unnecessary. { &quot; The creation of Color in 18th Century Europe &quot;, by Sarah Lowengard. Additional 18th century history at &quot; Turkey Red Dyeing in Blackley The Delaunay Dyeworks &quot; at ColorantsInHistory.org. } The process was simplified in late 18th century Europe. By 1804, a dye maker George Field in Britain had refined a technique to make lake madder by treating it with alum, and an alkali, { George Field&apos;s notes are held at the Courtauld Institute of Art. See: http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=4107 &amp; inst_id=2 (accessed: 2007/09/05). Winsor Newton&apos;s madder pigment is made according to his process.

Note that Henry Charles Newton, founder of Winsor Newton, was his assistant and friend. } that converts the water-soluble madder extract into a solid, insoluble pigment. This resulting madder lake has a longer-lasting color, and can be used more efficaciously, for example by blending it into a paint. Over the following years, it was found that other metal salts, including those containing iron, tin, and chromium, could be used in place of alum to give madder-based pigments of various other colors. This general method of preparing lakes has been known for centuries { Daniel V. Thompson – The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting – Dover – pp115–124. ISBN 0-486-20327-1 } but was simplified in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1826, the French chemist Pierre-Jean Robiquet found that madder root contained two colorants, the red alizarin and the more rapidly fading purpurin. The alizarin component became the first natural dye to be synthetically duplicated in 1868 when the German chemists Carl Graebe and Carl Liebermann, working for BASF, found a way to produce it from anthracene. About the same time, the English dye chemist William Henry Perkin independently discovered the same synthesis, although the BASF group filed their patent before Perkin by only one day. The subsequent discovery (made by Broenner and Gutzhow in 1871) that anthracene could be abstracted from coal tar further advanced the importance and affordability of alizarin&apos;s artificial synthesis. [ Broenner J Gutzhow, H Process for preparing anthracene from coal-tar pitch, and preparation of dye-stuffs from anthracene Dinglers Polytechnisches Journal 1871 545 ] The synthetic alizarin could be produced for a fraction of the cost of the natural product, and the market for madder collapsed virtually overnight. The principal synthesis entailed oxidation of anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid with sodium nitrate in concentrated sodium hydroxide. Alizarin itself has been in turn largely replaced today by the more light-resistant quinacridone pigments developed at DuPont in 1958. [ Structure and properties ] Alizarin is one of ten dihydroxyanthraquinone isomers. Its molecular structure can be viewed as being derived from anthraquinone by replacement of two neighboring hydrogen atoms (H) by hydroxyl groups (-OH). It is soluble in hexane and chloroform, and can be obtained from the latter as red-purple crystals, m.p.  277–278 °C. Alizarin changes color depending on the pH of the solution it is in, thereby making it a pH indicator. [ Meloan SN Puchtler, H; Valentine, LS Alkaline and acid alizarin red S stains for alkali-soluble and alkali-insoluble calcium deposits Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry 1972 93 190–197 ] [ Applications ] Alizarin Red is used in a biochemical assay to determine, quantitatively by colorimetry, the presence of calcific deposition by cells of an osteogenic lineage. As such it is an early stage marker (days 10–16 of in vitro culture) of matrix mineralization, a crucial step towards the formation of calcified extracellular matrix associated with true bone. [ July 2010 ] Alizarin&apos;s abilities as a biological stain were first noted in 1567, when it was observed that when fed to animals, it stained their teeth and bones red. The chemical is now commonly used in medical studies involving calcium. Free (ionic) calcium forms precipitates with alizarin, and tissue block containing calcium stain red immediately when immersed in alizarin. Thus, both pure calcium and calcium in bones and other tissues can be stained. The process of staining calcium with alizarin works best when conducted in basic solution. [ Puchtler H Meloan, SN; Terry, MS On the history and mechanism of alizarin red s stains for calcium The Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry 1969 17 110–124 ] In clinical practice, it is used to stain synovial fluid to assess for basic calcium phosphate crystals. [ Paul H Reginato AJ, Schumacher HR Alizarin red S staining as a screening test to detect calcium compounds in synovial fluid Arthritis and rheumatism 26 2 191–200 6186260 ] Alizarin has also been used in studies involving bone growth, osteoporosis, bone marrow, calcium deposits in the vascular system, cellular signaling, gene expression, tissue engineering, and mesenchymal stem cells. [ Puchtler H Meloan, SN; Terry, MS On the history and mechanism of alizarin red s stains for calcium The Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry 1969 17 110–124 ] In geology, it is used as a stain to indicate the calcium carbonate minerals, calcite and aragonite.
