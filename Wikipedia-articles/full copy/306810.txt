[ History ] Founded in 1940 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, Iona College is a private, coeducational institution of learning in the tradition of American Catholic higher education. In 1989, Elizabeth Seton College of Yonkers, New York merged with Iona. [ Iona Merges With Elizabeth Seton College http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/nyregion/iona-merges-with-elizabeth-seton-college.html The New York Times February 19, 1989 November 16, 2011 ] Iona College recently completed renovations of their Ryan Library, and the library was fully operational by the beginning of 2009&apos;s fall semester. Iona College opened its doors in 1940, with nine Christian Brothers and six lay faculty greeting the first class. The Christian Brothers named the College after Iona, the island monastery of St. Columba [in Irish: St. Colmcille] located off the west coast of Scotland. Columba founded the monastery in 563 AD. The Congregation of Christian Brothers was itself founded in 1802 by Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice in Waterford, Ireland. In 1940, the idea - and ideal - of the College&apos;s founding community of Brothers was to start a small, affordable college for the sons of New York&apos;s working class. At the time, the Christian Brothers taught in seven high schools in the Archdiocese of New York, including Iona Prep, All Hallows, Rice High School, and Power Memorial. They recognized that many of their graduates could not afford the cost of local universities, and so they started Iona, opening new paths to economic and social advancement. Small it was when it started in September, 1940, and smaller it became after the U.S. entered World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. For example, the fall of 1943 began with 94 students, but the spring term ended with fewer than 40. In spite of this, student groups somehow survived: the school newspaper, the basketball and baseball teams, and the Tara Knights service club were all active during the War Years. Only three members of the entering class went on to receive Bachelor of Arts degrees in August, 1944. Returning veterans, attracted by Iona&apos;s practical majors like Accounting (and their tuition underwritten by the G.I. Bill), soon stretched the College to its limits. Seventy-one men graduated in 1948 and 300 in 1950. Guiding the College through its tenuous start and sudden growth were two gifted Presidents: Br. William Barnabas Cornelia (1885–1955) and Br. Arthur Austin Loftus (1904–1979). One a native of Dublin, the other a native New Yorker, they brought intelligence, tact, shrewdness, humility, and a true love of teaching to the new enterprise. As the College changed from an intimate community nurturing teenagers to an expansive plant educating battle-tested veterans, Br. Cornelia and Br. Loftus maintained a steady course. Ambitious for success and accreditation, they never lost sight of the College&apos;s Mission - to give Iona students the best secular training while educating the &quot; whole person &quot; - mind, heart, and spirit. In 2011, Iona College admitted that the Provost (Warren Rosenberg) reported inflated figures for years about &quot; acceptance rates, SAT scores, graduation rates, and alumni who give annually &quot; in a bid to influence college rankings. { Audit Report Letter, Iona College. November 8, 2011. } { Gaming The College Rankings, The New York Times. January 31, 2012. } [ Mission statement ] According to its mission statement, &quot; Iona College is a diverse community of learners and scholars dedicated to academic excellence in the tradition of the Christian Brothers and American Catholic higher education. We commit ourselves to education within the rich heritage of these legacies, especially intellectual inquiry and the values of justice, peace and service. &quot; { http://www.iona.edu/about/mission.cfm } The school strives to graduate: &quot; ethical and skilled decision-makers and problem solvers motivated to leadership, service and civic responsibility; &quot; &quot; independent thinkers informed and enriched by a liberal arts education; &quot; &quot; lifelong learners skilled in and adaptable to new information and technologies; and &quot; &quot; individuals who integrate the spiritual, intellectual, civic, emotional and physical dimensions of their lives. &quot; [ Academics ] The university is divided into two main academic units: a school of arts and sciences, and a business school. The School of Arts &amp; Sciences is one of the two main schools at Iona College. The current dean is Jeanne Zaino, PhD. Many students choose to obtain degrees in mass communications, journalism, education, and psychology. Iona boasts excellent scholars and teachers among the faculty in liberal arts and sciences. Some distinguished faculty at Iona&apos;s history department include Dr. James T. Carroll, Dr. Michael J. Hughes, Dr. Catherine Stratton, Dr. Daniel E. Thiery, Dr. George Bournoutian and Dr. Eugene Sheehan. The School offers degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting, marketing, and management. The school also has a fast track MBA program, which is geared toward people who want to gain an edge in their chosen field. The Fast Track MBA shaves 10 months off the length of traditional MBA programs by offering courses in a sequence that guarantees a speedy graduation. On the school&apos;s website its mission is stated as &apos;The School’s commitment to Catholic Higher Education in the Christian Brothers’ Tradition coupled with our AACSB – International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) accreditation assures that the student is at the core of everything we do.&apos; Vincent J. Calluzzo, PhD is the current dean at the school. For 2012, Iona was ranked #440 in the nation by Forbes.

The renovation included an expanded print collection and larger spaces for students to study and do research. The project was completed in time for the Fall Semester of 2009. The library is a prominent symbol of Iona College along North Ave. Iona became the first metro-New York college with a completely wireless Internet campus in September 2001. { Iona.edu } In 1998 American Campus Communities was awarded the contract to develop, build, and manage a student housing property at Iona College. { &quot; COMPANY NEWS. &quot; } { Austin American-Statesman.

Loftus features a small computer lab, a weight room, a laundry room, and a quiet meditation room.

North and South are identical buildings, and hold fewer people than Loftus. Both buildings have six floors, with four rooms on each floor: one suite of seven and three suites of 10. Each suite has two bathrooms, a small kitchenette, and a common room/living room type arrangement. North Hall was renamed to Conese Hall at Homecoming 2008, October 4, 2008, to acknowledge a $5 million gift to the college from Anna May and Eugene P. Conese. { http://www.iona.edu/news/releases/0809/0721Conese.cfm } Iona College from North Ave [ Rice Hall ] Rice Hall, nestled in the quiet back corner of Iona&apos;s campus, is primarily a single occupant dorm, though there are suites of varying sizes on the ground floor and a few rooms on the first floor can house two students.

The building is four floors, with laundry services being provided in the basement. Amenities include a game room, TV lounge, kitchen, computer lab, and gym.
