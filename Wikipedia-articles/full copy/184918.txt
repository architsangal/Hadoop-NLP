[ Early life ] Foray was born as June Lucille Forer, the second of three children (the other two were her elder brother Bertram and younger sister Geraldine) to Maurice Forer and Ida E. Robinson in Springfield, Massachusetts, { 1920 U.S. census } on September 18, 1917 (but some sources have incorrectly cited 1918, 1919 and 1920 as her year of birth). { June Foray profile at Film Reference.com } { Profile at www.movieeye.com } There her voice was first broadcast in a local radio drama when she was 12 years old; by age 15, she was doing regular radio voice work. Two years later, she moved to Los Angeles, California, and soon became a popular voice actress on radio, with regular appearances on coast-to-coast broadcasts starring Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope and Danny Thomas. [ Acting career ] In the 1940s, she also began film work, including a few appearances acting in live-action movies, but mostly doing voiceovers for animated cartoons. At [ 4 ft 11 in ], Foray&apos;s diminutive stature somewhat limited her stage and on-camera acting career. For Walt Disney, she played Lucifer the Cat in the feature film Cinderella, Lambert&apos;s mother in Lambert the Sheepish Lion, a mermaid in Peter Pan and her Witch Hazel character; Foray would later be the voice of Grandmother Fa in Mulan in 1998; she also did a variety of voices in Walter Lantz &apos;s Woody Woodpecker cartoons. For Warner Brothers Cartoons, she was Granny (whom she has played, on and off, since 1955, taking over for Bea Benaderet ), owner of Tweety and Sylvester, and, memorably, a series of witches, including Witch Hazel, for Chuck Jones. She voice acted on The Smurfs as Jokey Smurf and Mother Nature, Ursula in George of the Jungle, and on How the Grinch Stole Christmas as Cindy Lou Who, asking &quot; Santa &quot; why he&apos;s taking their tree. She was the voice of the original &quot; Chatty Cathy &quot; doll. She voiced evil characters as well, such as the &quot; Talky Tina &quot; doll in the iconic The Twilight Zone episode ( &quot; Living Doll &quot; ) as well as all of the female roles in Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (1975), including the villainous cobra Nagaina. (Legendary actor and director Orson Welles voiced her husband, the cobra &quot; Nag &quot;.) { IMDb entry for Rikki-Tikki-Tavi } Foray worked for Hanna-Barbera, including The Flintstones, Tom and Jerry, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, The Jetsons and many others. She has done extensive voice acting for Stan Freberg &apos;s commercials, albums and 1957 radio series, memorably as secretary to the werewolf advertising executive. Foray has also appeared in several Rankin/Bass TV specials in the 1960s and 1970s, most notably as the original voice of the young girl, Karen, in the TV special, Frosty the Snowman (although only her singing parts remain in current airings, after Rankin-Bass re-edited the special a few years after it debuted, with Foray&apos;s speaking parts re-dubbed with an uncredited voice). Most recognizable, though, is her work for Jay Ward : she played nearly every female on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, including Natasha Fatale and Nell Fenwick, as well as male lead character Rocket J. Squirrel (a.k.a. Rocky Squirrel). Foray also voiced Magica De Spell and Ma Beagle in the televised cartoon DuckTales. Most significantly in the later part of her career, she had a leading role voicing Grammi Gummi on the television series, Disney&apos;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears, Walt Disney Pictures&apos; first major animated television series, where she worked with her Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle co-star Bill Scott for the final time until his death in 1985.

Foray appeared on camera in a major role only once, in Sabaka as a high priestess of a fire cult. She also appeared on camera in an episode of Green Acres as a Mexican telephone operator. She was often called for ADR voice work for television and feature films some notable works include dubbing the voice for Mary Badham in The Twilight Zone episode &quot; The Bewitchin&apos; Pool &quot; and the voices for Sean and Michael Brody in some scenes of Jaws (film), it was mostly because the children&apos;s voices were difficult to distinguish during windy day filming.In 1991, she provided her voice as the sock-puppet talk-show-host Scary Mary on the television show Married With Children. She played gag cameos in both 1992&apos;s Boris &amp; Natasha and 2000&apos;s The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Another on-camera appearance was in the 1984 TV sitcom The Duck Factory, which starred Jim Carrey. In 2000, Foray reprised her role as Rocky the Flying Squirrel in Universal Pictures &apos; live-action/CGI animated film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, co-starring and produced by Robert DeNiro.
