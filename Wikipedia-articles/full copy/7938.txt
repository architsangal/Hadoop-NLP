The Chemical World Instructor&apos;s Manual 1996 Cengage Learning 12 ] { space-filling model of the diatomic molecule dinitrogen, N 2 } Diatomic molecules are molecules composed only of two atom s, of either the same or different chemical element s. The prefix di- is of Greek origin, meaning 2. Common diatomic molecules are hydrogen (H 2 ), nitrogen (N 2 ), oxygen (O 2 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). Seven elements exist as homonuclear diatomic molecules at room temperature: H 2, N 2, O 2, F 2, Cl 2, Br 2, and I 2. [ Chemistry Whitten, Kenneth W.; Davis, Raymond E.; Peck, M. Larry; Stanley, George G. 2010 Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning 337–338 http://books.google.ca/books?id%3D6Zwu9-qT0qQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA337#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 9th ] Many elements and chemical compound s aside from these form diatomic molecules when evaporated. The noble gases do not form diatomic molecules: this can be explained using molecular orbital theory (see molecular orbital diagram ). [ Occurrence ] Hundreds of diatomic molecules have been characterized [ Huber, K. P. and Herzberg, G. Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure IV. Constants of Diatomic Molecules New York: Van Nostrand: Reinhold 1979 ] in the terrestrial environment, laboratory, and interstellar medium. About 99% of the Earth&apos;s atmosphere is composed of diatomic molecules, specifically oxygen and nitrogen at 21% and 78%, respectively. The natural abundance of hydrogen (H 2 ) in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere is only on the order of parts per million, but H 2 is, in fact, the most abundant diatomic molecule in nature. The interstellar medium is, indeed, dominated by hydrogen atoms. If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as H 2 and O 2, then it is said to be homonuclear, but otherwise it is heteronuclear. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar. In most diatomic molecules, the elements are nonidentical. Prominent examples include carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen chloride, but other important examples include gaseous MgO, SiO, and many other species not normally considered diatomic because they polymerize near room temperature. Elements that consist of diatomic molecules, under typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25 °C, include hydrogen (H 2 ), nitrogen (N 2 ), oxygen (O 2 ), and the halogens (although it is not yet known whether astatine forms diatomic astatine molecules [ Hammond C.R. Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 2012 http://www.hbcpnetbase.com//articles/04_01_91.pdf Section 4: Properties of the Elements and Inorganic Compounds ] ). [ Emsley, J. The Elements Oxford: Clarendon Press 1989 22–23 ] Other elements form homonuclear diatomics when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize at lower temperatures. For example, heating ( &quot; cracking &quot; ) elemental phosphorus gives diphosphorus, P 2. [ Molecular geometry ] [ Molecular geometry ] Diatomic molecules cannot have any geometry but linear, as any two points always lie in a line. This is the simplest spatial arrangement of atoms after the sphericity of single atoms. { &quot; VSEPR - A Summary &quot;. University of Berkeley College of Chemistry. 20 January 2008. http://mc2.cchem.berkeley.edu/VSEPR/ } [ Historical significance ] Diatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. John Dalton &apos;s original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water&apos;s formula was HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century. As early as 1805, Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water&apos;s composition, based on what is now called Avogadro&apos;s law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860. Part of this rejection was due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no chemical affinity towards atoms of the same element, and part was due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro&apos;s law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules. At the 1860 Karlsruhe Congress on atomic weights, Cannizzaro resurrected Avogadro&apos;s ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important pre-requisite for the discovery of the periodic law by Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer. [ Ihde, Aaron J. The Karlsruhe Congress: A centennial retrospective Journal of Chemical Education 1961 38 83–86 http://search.jce.divched.org:8081/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db%3Djceindex.fp5%26amp%3B-lay%3Dwwwform%26amp%3Bcombo%3Dkarlsruhe%26amp%3B-find%3D%26amp%3B-format%3Ddetail.html%26amp%3B-skip%3D0%26amp%3B-max%3D1%26amp%3B-token.2%3D0%26amp%3B-token.3%3D10 2007-08-24 10.1021/ed038p83 2 ] [ Energy levels ] It is convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two point masses (the two atoms) connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories. The translational energies The rotational energies The vibrational energies [ Translational energies ] The translational energy of the molecule is simply given by the kinetic energy expression: E_{trans}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 where m is the mass of the molecule and v is its velocity. [ Rotational energies ] Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is E_{rot} = \frac{L^2}{2 I} \, { where } L \, is the angular momentum I \, is the moment of inertia of the molecule For microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by L^2 = l(l+1) \hbar^2 \, { where l is a non-negative integer and \hbar is the } { reduced Planck constant. } Also, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is I = \mu r_{0}^2 \, { where } \mu \, is the reduced mass of the molecule and r_{0} \, is the average distance between the two atoms in the molecule. So, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into E rot, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by: E_{rot} = \frac{l(l+1) \hbar^2}{2 \mu r_{0}^2} \ \ \ \ \ l=0,1,2,... \, [ Vibrational energies ] Another way a diatomic molecule can move is to have each atom oscillate—or vibrate —along a line (the bond) connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a quantum harmonic oscillator : E_{vib} = \left(n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega \ \ \ \ \ n=0,1,2,.... \, { where } n is an integer \hbar is the reduced Planck constant and \omega is the angular frequency of the vibration. [ Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings ] So the spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between rotational energy levels.
