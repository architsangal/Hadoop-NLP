[ April 2012 ] { Yekaterinburg, Russia } Patrick Leopold Gordon (31 March 1635 – 29 November 1699) was general of the Imperial Russia n army, of Scottish origin. He was descended from a Scottish family of Aberdeenshire, holders of the small estate of Auchleuchries, the family were connected with the house of Haddo. [ Life ] He was raised and remained a lifelong Catholic, at a time when the Catholic Church was being persecuted in Scotland, which had become Calvinist. After completing his education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, he entered, at age fifteen, the Jesuit college at Braunsberg, East Prussia (then belonging to Poland ); however, his character did not tolerate well the strict and somber way of life at the school, and soon decided to return home. He changed his mind, however, before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland, and after journeying on foot in several parts of what is today Germany, he ultimately enlisted at Hamburg in the military of Sweden in 1655. In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both. At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660, Gordon was wounded. { Fedosov, Dmitry “Cock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad” pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 page 6. } Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration, Gordon left Polish service, but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Britain. { Fedosov, Dmitry “Cock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad” pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 page 6. } In 1661, after further experience as a soldier of fortune, he took up service in the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I, and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England. After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turk and Tatar ethnic groups in southern Russia. Gordon disliked Russian service, complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials, which left Gordon in his own words &quot; almost at wits end with vexation &quot;. { Fedosov, Dmitry “Cock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad” pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 page 7. } In recognition of his services he was made major-general in 1678, was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679, and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general. He visited England in 1686. In 1687 and 1689 he took part as quartermaster general in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea, being made full general for his services. On the breaking out of revolution in Moscow in 1689, Gordon with the troops under his command virtually decided events in favour of Tsar Peter I, { Fedosov, Dmitry “Cock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad” pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 page 9. } and against the Regent, tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna. Consequently he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar, who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia. In 1696, Gordon&apos; s &quot; moveable rampart &quot; played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov. { Fedosov, Dmitry “Cock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad” pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 page 9. } { Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Originally buried in } { German Quarter, his remains were reinterred here in 1877. Note that the German inscription names his rank as &apos;&apos;oberst&apos;&apos; ( } { colonel ). } The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the European system; and later raised him to the rank of general-in-chief. At the end of his life the Tsar, who had visited him frequently during his illness, was with him when he died, and with his own hands closed his eyes. He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar&apos;s service; his compatriots Paul Menesius and Alexander Livingston also found themselves in Russia fleeing religious intolerance or seeking adventure. General Gordon left behind him a diary of his life, written in English. This was preserved in manuscript form in the archives of the Imperial Russian foreign office. A complete German translation, edited by Dr Moritz Posselt (Tagebuch des Generals Patrick Gordon) was published, the first volume at Moscow in 1849, the second at St Petersburg in 1851, and the third at St Petersburg in 1853; and Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries (1635–1699), was printed, under the editorship of Joseph Robertson, for the Spalding Club, at Aberdeen, Scotland, 1859. A new version of his diaries in English were printed in 2009 in the UK. His daughter (died 1739) was married firstly to a German colonel Strasburgh, and then from 1699 or 1700 to his friend in Russian service General Alexander Gordon, author of &quot; The History of Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia &quot; book. { (1755) Alexander Gordon: The History of Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia: A short account of the Author&apos;s Life, page 10 } [ References ] Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries 1635-1699, University of Aberdeen website Passages from the diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries : A.D. 1635-A.D. 1699; Aberdeen : 1859 Contacts and Integration: Some Scottish examples, Paul Dukes Fedosov, Dmitry “Cock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad” pages 1–10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy Essays in Honour of John Erickson edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 ISBN 0-297-84913-1.
