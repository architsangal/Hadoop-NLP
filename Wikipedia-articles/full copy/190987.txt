[ Dogman studio King&apos;s X Dogman.jpg January 18, 1994 Hard rock Heavy metal Grunge 59:16 Atlantic Brendan O&apos;Brien King&apos;s X (1992) Dogman(1994) Ear Candy (1996) ] Dogman is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal / hard rock trio King&apos;s X. It marks the band&apos;s second album under Atlantic and their first to be produced by Brendan O&apos;Brien, { According to music historian Brian Smith } who had just come off scoring big hits with Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Black Crowes. Dogman signaled a heavier direction for King&apos;s X and, with strong approval from both critics and fans, is often considered one of their best works. [ Background and recording ] According to frontman Doug Pinnick, while longtime King&apos;s X producer Sam Taylor had a big influence on the band&apos;s sound, he never captured the heaviness of their live performance in the studio. Taylor ended production duties with King&apos;s X after four albums together. When the high profile Brendan O&apos;Brien approached King&apos;s X about creating an album together, the band enthusiastically accepted. Shortly prior to the start of Dogman, guitarist Ty Tabor had started transitioning over to Mesa Boogie s and Marshall amplifier s. In the studio, Tabor and O&apos;Brien spent little time tightening the guitar tone when recording which was also Tabor&apos;s first experience recording with new amps. He later entrusted the tweaking to O&apos;Brien who &quot; brightened them up a bit and made them a little more edgy sounding. &quot; Although, the band actually favored some of the demos over the final songs. These would later be released simply as Dogman Demos in 2005. { Prato, Greg Interview with King&apos;s X Guitarist Ty Tabor Guitar Site (July 8, 2008). Retrieved on 1-16-11. } Nevertheless, working with O&apos;Brien was a satisfying experience for King&apos;s X. In 1999, Pinnick described &quot; Black The Sky &quot; as his new &quot; standard to mix to &quot; due to its &quot; big and fat &quot; sound comparable to the band&apos;s live performance. The track &quot; Human Behavior &quot; was also written and recorded with a 12-string guitar, a rare inclusion to the band&apos;s repertoire. [ Music and lyrics ] Although their previous self-titled effort furthered dark themes and aggressive musicianship, Dogman marked a transitional point in the band&apos;s career with its considerably heavier sound than previous King&apos;s X records. In 1999, five years and two albums into the future, frontman Doug Pinnick reflected, &quot; For me personally, the Dogman record is what King&apos;s X really sounds like. The self-titled record was a step and an eye-opener and after that we could just make our music. &quot; { Kelter, Christopher J. FIFTEEN YEARS WITH KING&apos;S X RoughEdge.com (March 1999). Retrieved on 1-16-11. } In correspondence with a beefier musical approach, Pinnick began writing lyrics that further expressed his building frustration over religion. While early King&apos;s X albums were commonly laced with Christian themes regarding belief and spirituality - mostly in an uplifting manner - Dogman takes a more open and disillusioned approach to religion, as noted by a now agnostic Pinnick in a 2006 interview: &quot;...all of the records are always me questioning &apos;Is this really it?&apos; because I grew up in a religious family all my life and I have always been going: something ain’t right here. So I have always sung about what I thought wasn’t right - my confusion and my disillusion with it. And then finally when Dogman came out I just spewed it all out. I was pissed at that point. Everybody was like: &apos;he’s not Christian anymore.&apos; Everybody got freaked out. &quot; Interview with Doug Pinnick FromOutofNoWhere.com (2006). Retrieved on 1-16-11. [ Touring and promotion ] Dogman was supported with quite a few memorable performances opening for others, including a string of dates with Pearl Jam and the opening night of Woodstock &apos;94. Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder played the song &quot; Cigarettes &quot; after a radio broadcast of a Pearl Jam performance on April 3, 1994 at the Fox Theater in Atlanta; Vedder was assuming the role of a DJ and played some of his favorite tunes. Dogman was released with four color variations of the same cover: red, yellow, green, and blue. The album&apos;s title track served as its primary single which had a music video. According to Doug Pinnick, &quot; Dogman &quot; received strong radio rotation in New York, and the band sold more records there than anywhere. However, the lack of a &quot; major single release &quot; hampered the album&apos;s commercial success. { Doug Pinnick interview from March 1999 SteveLawson.net (March 1999). Retrieved on 1-16-11. } One particularly favorable concert in Dallas, Texas was filmed during the Dogman tour. It would be released in as a two-disc set entitled Live &amp; Live Some More via Molken Music in 2007.

Chuck Eddy of Entertainment Weekly described the heavier sound as &quot; less muddled than its attempts at Beatles -derived psychedelic pop &quot; but showed slight unrest towards Pinnick&apos;s angst approach to lyrics. Giving a 4/5 star rating, Allmusic &apos;s Alex Henderson noted the varied styles despite the album&apos;s heaviness and that King&apos;s X &quot; addresses spiritual concerns without trying to force its beliefs on anyone. &quot; [ Accolades ] [ http://home.rhein-zeitung.de/~tommi.s/vision50.htm#elc Visions - The Eternal Readers Charts 2010-01-18 Visions ] Year Publication Country Accolade Rank 1996 Visions Germany &quot; The Eternal Readers Charts &quot; 31 &quot; * &quot; denotes an unordered list.
