The population was 141 at the 2010 census, a 9 ercent decrease from 155 at the 2000 census. { MuniNet Guide: Burbank, Oklahoma. } [ Geography ] Burbank is located at [ 36 41 46 N 96 43 41 W type:city ] (36.695983, -96.727978) [ 1 ]. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 0.3 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ History ] Burbank was founded in 1903 on the Osage Indian Reservation. The founder was Anthony “Gabe” Carlton, a mixed-blood Osage. He reportedly named the town after a cocklebur covered area nearby. A post office was established in the town in 1907. { “Burbank.” http://digitallibrary.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/B/BU007.html, accessed 31 Oct 2011 } Burbank had about 200 residents and an economy based on farming and ranching until May 1920 when E.W. Marland discovered petroleum northeast of the town. Burbank became a boom town and other towns in the area such as Whizbang sprang up overnight to exploit the rich petroleum resources. The Burbank field was mostly located in Osage County but extended into Kay County. The Burbank field extended over an area about 20 miles long and 10 miles wide. Burbank quickly grew into a town of 3,000 people. { Burbank.” http://digitallibrary.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/B/BU007.html, accessed 31 Oct 2011 } Several major petroleum companies participated in the exploitation of the Burbank Field. Leases of oil land were obtained from the Osage Indians, usually by auction under the “Million Dollar Elm” tree in Pawhuska, the county seat and capital of the Osage Indians. Colonel Ellsworth Walters was the auctioner and more than a million dollars was often bid for the mineral rights to 160 acre (65 ha) tracts in the Burbank Field. Rich and famous oilmen such as Marland, Frank Phillips, L. E. Phillips, Waite Phillips, and William G. Skelly stood in the shade of the Elm tree and bid in the auctions. Oil production in the Burbank field expanded from 134,408 barrels in 1920 to a peak production of 26,206,741 barrels in 1923. Production dropped by one-half in 1926 and by 1930 the boom period was over. Burbank’s population dropped to 372 in 1930. The value of the 160 million barrels the Burbank field produced during its heyday was almost 286 million dollars. { Franks, Kenny A. The Oklahoma Petroleum Industry. Norman:U of OK Press,1980, pp 103-104 } The Osage tribe and its members received $45 million in royalties from the Burbank field in the 1920s. { Franks, p. 104 } The Osage, unlike many tribes, had retained collective ownership of mineral rights on their former reservation. Osage with a full headright (those on the 1906 tribal roll) received up to $15,000 each annually in oil royalties, a sum worth more than 10 times that in 2010 dollars. { ”Osage Oil” http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS00.html, accessed 31 Oct 2011 } The Osage were the “richest people in the world.” { The New York Times, June 25, 1921, page 3 } [ Demographics ] As of the census [ 2 ] of 2000, there were 155 people, 63 households, and 40 families residing in the town.
