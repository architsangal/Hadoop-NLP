Lubbock, governor of Texas during the Civil War. [ http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/hdl4.html Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association ] As early as 1884, a federal post office named Lubbock existed in Yellow House Canyon. However, the town of Lubbock was not founded until 1890, when it was formed from a unique merger arrangement between two smaller towns, &quot; Old Lubbock &quot; and Monterey. The terms of the compromise included keeping the Lubbock name but the Monterey townsite, so the previous Old Lubbock residents relocated south to the Monterey location, including putting Old Lubbock&apos;s Nicolette Hotel on rollers and pulling it across a canyon to its new home. In 1891 Lubbock became the county seat and on March 16, 1909 Lubbock was incorporated. Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University ) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969. Both universities are now overseen by the Texas Tech University System, after it was established in 1996 and based in Lubbock. Lubbock Christian University, founded in 1957, and Sunset International Bible Institute, both affiliated with the Churches of Christ, have their main campuses in the city. South Plains College and Wayland Baptist University operate branch campuses in Lubbock. The city is home to the Lubbock Lake Landmark, part of the Museum of Texas Tech University. The landmark is an archaeological and natural history preserve at the northern edge of the city. It shows evidence of almost twelve thousand years of human occupation in the region. Another part of the museum, the National Ranching Heritage Center, houses historic ranch-related structures from the area. In August 1951, a V-shaped formation of lights was seen over the city. The &quot; Lubbock Lights &quot; series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great UFO cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in Life magazine. Project Blue Book, the US Air Force&apos;s official study of the UFO mystery, did an extensive investigation of the Lubbock Lights. They concluded that the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects. However, they did dismiss the UFOs themselves as being either &quot; night-flying moths &quot; or a type of bird called a plover. The Air Force argued that the underside of the plovers or moths was reflected in the glow of Lubbock&apos;s new street lights at night. However, other researchers have disputed these explanations, and for many the &quot; Lubbock Lights &quot; remain a mystery. On May 11, 1970, the Lubbock Tornado struck the city. Twenty-six people died, and damage was estimated at $125 million.

[ http://www.polobarn.com/events/events2006/march06/032306_nationals.html 2006 Collegiate Polo Championships The Polo Zone ] The football program has been competing since October 3, 1925.

Interstate 27 (the former Avenue H) links the city to Amarillo and Interstate 40, a transcontinental route. I-27 was completed through the city in 1992 (it originally terminated just north of downtown). Other major highways include US 62 and US 82 which run concurrently (except for 4th Street (82) and 19th Street (62)) through the city east-west as the Brownfield Highway (soon to be upgraded to Marsha Sharp Freeway), 19th Street (62 only), 4th Street/Parkway Drive (82 only) and Idalou Highway. US 84 (Avenue Q/ Slaton Highway/ Clovis Road) is also another east-west route running NW/SE diagonally. U.S. Highway 87 runs between San Angelo and Amarillo and follows I-27 concurrently. State Highway 114 runs east-west, following US 62/82 on the east before going its own way. Lubbock is circled by Loop 289, which suffers from traffic congestion despite being a potential bypass around the city, which is the reason behind I-27 and Brownfield Highway being built through the city to have freeway traffic flow effectively inside the loop. The city is set up on a simple grid plan. In the heart of the city, numbered streets run east-west and lettered avenues run north-south — the grid begins at Avenue A in the east and First Street in the north. North of First Street, city planners chose to name streets alphabetically from the south to the north after colleges and universities. The north-south avenues run from A to Y. What would be Avenue Z is actually University Avenue since it runs along the east side of Texas Tech. Beyond that, the A-to-Z convention resumes, using U.S. cities found east of the Mississippi (e.g. Akron Avenue, Boston Avenue, Canton Avenue). Again, the Z name is not used, with Slide Road appearing in its place. [ Rail service ] Lubbock currently does not provide inter-city rail service, although there have been various proposals over the years to remedy this. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas — Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.

It is located on the northeast side of the city. The airport is the 8th busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock Preston Smith Airport also plays host as a major hub to Fedex&apos;s feeder planes that serve cities around Lubbock. [ Intercity bus service ] Greyhound Lines operates the Lubbock Station at 801 Broadway, just east of the Lubbock County Courthouse. { &quot; Lubbock, Texas. &quot; } { Greyhound Lines. Retrieved on June 24, 2010. } [ Public transportation ] [ Citibus (Lubbock) ] Public transportation is provided by Citibus, a bus transit system running Monday through Saturday every week with a transit center hub in downtown. It runs bus routes throughout the city, with the main routes converging at the Downtown Transfer Plaza, which also houses the Greyhound bus terminal. Citibus has been in continual service since 1971 when the city of Lubbock took over public transit operations. The paratransit system is called Citiaccess. Citibus has unveiled six diesel-electric hybrid bus es that have begun service on city routes. Managers hope the buses will use 60 percent of the fuel that their older, larger peers consume running customers across the city. The buses seat 23 passengers, can support full-size wheelchair s and will run on all but two city-based routes. [ Education ] { Texas Tech University } [ Higher education ] [ Texas Tech University ] Lubbock is home to Texas Tech University, which was established on February 10, 1923, as Texas Technological College.
