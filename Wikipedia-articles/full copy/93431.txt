Four federal Congressional District s cover the county, with most of the northern portion of the county in New Jersey&apos;s 5th congressional district, represented by Scott Garrett ( R ) and most of the southern portion of the county in New Jersey&apos;s 8th congressional district, represented by Bill Pascrell ( D ). The borough of Hawthorne is in New Jersey&apos;s 9th congressional district, represented by Steve Rothman ( D ), and a portion of the borough of Bloomingdale is in New Jersey&apos;s 11th congressional district, represented by Rodney Frelinghuysen ( R ). Due to redistricting following the 2010 Census tally, Passaic County&apos;s congressional representation will change. Once again, the 5th District will represent the extreme northern part of the county but will only comprise West Milford and Ringwood. The 8th District was redrawn and will largely represent Hudson County, with the remaining towns in Passaic County divided between the 9th and 11th Districts. Wayne, Woodland Park, Totowa, Little Falls, and Pompton Lakes will join with some of the old 8th district Essex County towns to become part of the new 11th District while Paterson, Clifton, Passaic, Haledon, North Haledon, and Prospect Park will join with Hawthorne in the 9th District. This will require incumbent Congressmen Pascrell and Rothman to run against each other for the Democratic nomination.
