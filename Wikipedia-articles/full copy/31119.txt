It is Britain&apos;s national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the Tate group (together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool, Tate St Ives and Tate Online ). { History and development &apos;&apos;Tate On-line&apos;&apos; } It is the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7 million visitors per year. [ http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article7105032.ece The startling success of Tate Modern 19 October 2010 The Times 24 April 2010 ] It is based in the former Bankside Power Station, in the Bankside area of Central London. [ History ] Main article Bankside Power Station The galleries are housed in the former Bankside Power Station, which was originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Battersea Power Station, and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. The power station closed in 1981. The building was converted by architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron and contractors Carillion, { Tate Modern case study } after which it stood at 99m tall. The history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern. The southern third of the building was retained by the French power company EDF Energy as an electrical substation (in 2006, the company released half of this holding).

The collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and contemporary art dating from 1900 until today. { Tate Modern: About } The Tate Collection is on display on levels three and five of the building, while level four houses large temporary exhibitions and a small exhibition space on level two houses work by contemporary artists. [ Collection exhibitions ] When the gallery opened in 2000, the collections were not displayed in chronological order but were rather arranged thematically into four broad groups: &apos;History/Memory/Society&apos;; &apos;Nude/Action/Body&apos;; &apos;Landscape/Matter/Environment&apos;; and &apos;Still Life/Object/Real Life&apos;. This was ostensibly because a chronological survey of the story of modern art along the lines of the Museum of Modern Art in New York would expose the large gaps in the collections, the result of the Tate&apos;s conservative acquisitions policy for the first half of the 20th century. The first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006. It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art, with further spaces allocated on levels 3 and 5 for shorter exhibitions. The layout was: Level 3 - Material Gestures (now closed) This focuses on abstraction, expressionism and abstract expressionism, featuring work by Claude Monet, Anish Kapoor, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Henri Matisse and Tacita Dean. { Tate Modern | Collection Displays | Level 3: Material es, } { Tate Online, 2006.

Level 5 - Structure and Clarity Focussing on abstract art, replacing States of Flux. { Structure and Clarity } Level 5 - Setting the Scene A smaller section covering installations with theatrical or fictional themes. { Setting the Scene } Level 5 - Energy and Process As above. The rest of Level 3 is currently being used for the Damien Hirst exhibition. It has not been announced whether it will return to showing the collection or whether it will continue to be used for temporary exhibitions. It has not been announced whether the current rehang will eventually replace all four of the sections introduced in the first rehang. [ Temporary exhibitions ] [ Level 1 - The Turbine Hall ] The Turbine Hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace.

This series was planned to last the gallery&apos;s first five years, but the popularity of the series has led to its extension until at least 2012.

Most recently it has been used to display Damien Hirst &apos;s For The Love Of God. [ Level 2 - The Level 2 Gallery ] The Level 2 Gallery is a smaller gallery located on the north side of the building which houses exhibitions of cutting edge contemporary art. Its exhibitions normally run for 2 – 3 months. { Tate: Level 2 Gallery } [ Level 4 - Major temporary exhibitions ] As with levels 3 and 5, level 4 is broken into two large exhibition areas. This is used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. The two exhibition areas can be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the Gilbert and George retrospective due to the size and number of the works. { Tate Modern: Gilbert &amp; George Exhibition } [ Other areas ] Small temporary exhibition spaces are also located in the space between the two galleries on levels 3 and 5. These are sometimes used to display recent acquisitions. Works are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members&apos; room. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 2 and the north facinging exterior of the building. { Tate Modern: Street Art } [ Access and environs ] The closest station is Blackfriars via its new south entrance. Other nearby stations include Southwark, as well as St Paul&apos;s and Mansion House north of the river which can be reached via the Millennium Bridge. The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route. There is also a riverboat pier just outside the gallery called Bankside Pier, with connections to the Docklands and Greenwich via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain. To the west of Tate Modern lie the sleek stone and glass Ludgate House, the former headquarters of Express Newspapers and Sampson House, a massive late Brutalist office building. [ Extension for 2012 ] Tate Modern has attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it have been in preparation for some time. These plans have focused on three areas for expansion all to the south of the building: The area no longer required by EDF Energy. Three large, disused, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station. A major new extension building to be built above the oil tanks. The design of the new extension building, also designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, has been controversial. It was originally designed as a glass stepped pyramid, or zigurat, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick (to match the original power-station building) { Tate Modern extension redesigned } after the feedback on the original design was unfavourable. [ November 2008 ] The extension will include galleries dedicated to photography, video, exhibitions and the community. { Tate modern | Transforming Tate Modern, } { Tate Online, 2006. URL accessed on 30 March 2007. } This project was initially costed at £215  million and the first phase, centred on the oil tanks, is scheduled to open in July 2012, in time for the 2012 Olympic Games being held in the city, while construction of the extension building continues. { Tanks } { Tate Modern&apos;s chaotic pyramid, } { The Times, 26 July 2006. URL accessed on 26 July 2006. } Of the money raised, 50 million pounds is coming from the U.K. government; 7 million pounds from the London Development Agency; 5 million pounds from philanthropist John Studzinski; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and Elisabeth Murdoch. { Farah Nayeri (April 20, 2012), Murdoch’s Daughter Elisabeth Gives Tate at Least $1.6 Mln } { Bloomberg. } Additionally, the Tate Britain will be undergoing refurbishment.
