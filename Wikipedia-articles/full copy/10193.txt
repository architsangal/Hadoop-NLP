This was Bruce Lee&apos;s final film appearance before his death on July 20, 1973. Six days after Lee&apos;s death, the film was released on July 26, 1973 in Hong Kong. In 2004, Enter the Dragon was deemed &quot; culturally significant &quot; in the United States and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. [ http://www.filmsite.org/filmreg.html National Film Registry Titles of the U.S. Library of Congress (1989-2009) AMC FilmSite.org May 21, 2010 ] Enter the Dragon was the first Chinese martial arts film to have been produced by a major Hollywood studio – Warner Bros. and was produced in association with Golden Harvest and Lee&apos;s Concord Production Company. The film is largely set in Hong Kong. Among the stuntmen for the film were members of the Seven Little Fortunes, including Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. This was arguably instrumental in Chan and Hung&apos;s further association with Golden Harvest studios, which later launched their careers. The portly Hung is shown fighting Lee in the opening sequence of the movie and Chan shows up as a henchman when Lee is discovered inside Han&apos;s underground lair. The finished version of the film was significantly different from the original screenplay drafts as Bruce Lee revised much of the script himself, including having written and directed the film&apos;s opening Shaolin Monastery fight sequence. Lee wanted to use the film as a vehicle for expressing what he saw as the beauty of his Chinese culture, rather than it being just another action film. [ Plot ] Lee ( Bruce Lee ) is a Shaolin martial artist from Hong Kong who possesses great philosophical insight into martial arts as well as physical prowess. He receives an invitation to a martial arts competition on an island organised by the mysterious Han ( Shih Kien ). Lee learns from his Sifu (teacher) that Han was also once a Shaolin student, but had been expelled from their order for abusing their code of conduct. A man named Braithwaite (Geoffrey Weeks) from British Intelligence approaches Lee and asks for his help in an undercover mission. Han is suspected to be involved in drug trafficking and prostitution. However, since Han&apos;s island is only partly in their jurisdiction, they are unable to conduct any formal investigations - Han will not allow firearms on the island, both to impede assassination attempts and to prevent the international authorities from gaining a justification to launch a raid. Han runs a martial arts school to protect his drug operations, as well as holding his tournament every three years to recruit international talent to expand his criminal business. Before leaving, Lee learns from his teacher that Han&apos;s bodyguard O&apos;Hara ( Robert Wall ) had been involved in the death of his sister, Su Lin ( Angela Mao ), years ago, when she committed suicide to save herself from dishonour after being cornered by O&apos;Hara and a collection of Han&apos;s thugs. During the incident, O&apos;Hara received a facial scar when Lee&apos;s father slashed him with a knife. Lee arrives on Han&apos;s island and receives a warm reception. Joining him are other competitors including Roper ( John Saxon ), a down-on-his-luck white American playboy - gambler on the run from the mob, and Williams ( Jim Kelly ), an African-American activist on the run after defending himself against two racist white policemen in Los Angeles. Roper and Williams are revealed to be old friends, having served in Vietnam together. They defeat their respective opponents in the competition held the following morning, after arranging for some crooked side-betting on Roper&apos;s fight. That night, the competitors are all offered prostitutes of their choice by Han&apos;s assistant, Tania ( Ahna Capri ). Williams chooses several women, while Roper cunningly chooses Tania (as a mutual attraction is apparent between them). Lee asks for a girl (Betty Chung) whom Braithwaite has placed on the island to gather intelligence, but as she has been kept strictly observed, is unable to gain much information from her. That night, Lee begins searching the island for evidence and finds a secret entrance to an underground base, where drugs are being manufactured and tested on unwitting prisoners. He runs into Han&apos;s guards but manages to take them down before they can identify him. He is seen by Williams, who is outside for some fresh air and practice. The next day, Han warns the competitors about wandering out of their rooms at night. He punishes his guards for failure in their duties and the guards meet their horrible ends at the hands of the sadistic Bolo ( Bolo Yeung ), Han&apos;s chief bodyguard. Moments later, Lee is called to his first match and his opponent turns out to be O&apos;Hara, who is clearly outclassed and eventually attacks Lee with broken bottles. Lee defeats O&apos;Hara and kills his adversary as an act of revenge for his involvement in his sister&apos;s suicide. Announcing that O&apos;Hara&apos;s dishonourable attack has caused him to lose face very badly, Han ends the day&apos;s matches. Later, Han summons Williams and accuses him of attacking the guards the previous night (the &apos;spy&apos; Lee was with did not mention anything to Han). Williams indignantly denies this, and announces his intention to leave the island. Han doesn&apos;t give him permission to leave the island, Williams mocks Han, the guards arrive, Williams takes them out and Williams starts to fight with Han and he gets pushed into a secret club where there is women laughing at him. As Williams gets weaker, Han brutally beats him to death with a conceald iron hand. Han takes Roper on a tour of his underground base and invites him to be his representative for his heroin smuggling operations in the United States. When questioned, Han shows Roper the mutilated corpse of Williams, hinting that Roper will face the same fate if he refuses to cooperate. The same night, Lee breaks into the underground base, avoiding a booby trap set for him, and gathers sufficient evidence to warrant Han&apos;s arrest, but sets off an alarm while using the radio transmitter to contact Braithwaite. After a spectacular fight with dozens of Han&apos;s guards he is eventually lured into a trap and captured. The next morning, Han asks Roper to fight Lee as a test of his loyalty. Roper refuses and Han sends him to fight Bolo instead. When Roper emerges victorious, the infuriated Han orders his men to kill both Lee and Roper. Despite being hopelessly outnumbered, Lee and Roper manage to hold off the enemy until the captives in Han&apos;s underground prison break free and join their side to even the odds. Amidst the chaos, Han attempts to sneak away, only to have Lee follow him. Lee tells Han, &quot; You have offended my family and you have offended the Shaolin Temple. &quot; After a spectacular fight in a room full of mirrors, Han is defeated by Lee and impaled on his own spear. When Lee returns to Roper, he finds that most of Han&apos;s men have been defeated and rounded up but in a bittersweet moment, Roper also finds Tania&apos;s lifeless body lying amongst the wreckage. Lee and Roper exchange a weary thumbs-up just as military helicopters arrive in response to the distress call.

He also performed several stunts for the film, including the scene where Lee&apos;s character quickly climbs a rooftop at night.
