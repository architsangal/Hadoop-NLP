By March 22, 1891, when the Alto Branch of the LDS Church was organized, the town had a schoolhouse that was used for social gatherings and church meetings. In 1916, the Amalgamated Sugar Company agreed to build a factory in town to process sugar beets, and the town name became Amalga. [ Van Cott John W.

The factory, built by Dyer Construction Company, was built by the 1917 season for $900,000. Coinciding with the organization of the city, the Amalga Ward of the LDS Church was established on March 10, 1918, choosing its name from the Amalgamated Sugar Company. The factory was shut down in 1929 due to the sugar beet blight. The equipment was dismantled and reassembled in Sacramento, California. The hotel was torn down, as were the workers&apos; houses. The railroad was also removed, and sugar beets were shipped by truck to Smithfield, then taken to a factory in Lewiston for processing. The warehouse and land was sold to the &quot; Tueller brothers &quot; in late 1937. In 1941, the Cache Valley Dairy Association purchased the former sugar beet plant to allow the co-op to process their own milk into Swiss cheese. The co-op hired Edwin Gossner to produce the cheese, which he did from 1942 until 1966, when he left to form Gossner Foods in west Logan.
