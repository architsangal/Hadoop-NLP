Polywater was a hypothetical polymer ized form of water that was the subject of much scientific controversy during the late 1960s. By 1969 the popular press had taken notice, and by 1970 doubts about its authenticity were being circulated. [ Polywater http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res%3DFA0E10FA345E1B7493C0AB1782D85F4D8685F9 Water is so essential, so abundant, so simple in composition and so intensively studied over the centuries that it seems a most unlikely substance to provide a major scientific surprise. Nevertheless, this is precisely what has recently occurred. American chemists have confirmed that there is a form of water with properties quite different from that of the fluid everyone takes for granted. Polywater as this substance has been named is an organized aggregate or polymer of ordinary water molecules but it has very different properties from its...

The results, which were published in the journal, showed that Deryagin&apos;s polywater was badly contaminated by organic compounds, including lipids and phospholipids, which are ingredients of human perspiration.

[ Background ] The Soviet physicist Nikolai Fedyakin, working at a small government research lab in Kostroma, Russia, had performed measurements on the properties of water that had been condensed in, or repeatedly forced through, narrow quartz capillary tubes. Some of these experiments resulted in what was seemingly a new form of water with a higher boiling point, lower freezing point, and much higher viscosity than ordinary water, about that of a syrup. Boris Derjaguin, director of the laboratory for surface physics at the Institute for Physical Chemistry in Moscow, heard about Fedyakin&apos;s experiments. He improved on the method to produce the new water, and though he still produced very small quantities of this mysterious material, he did so substantially faster than Fedyakin did. Investigations of the material properties showed a substantially lower freezing point of &amp; minus;40  °C or less, a boiling point of 150  °C or greater, a density of approx. 1.1 to 1.2  g/cm³, and increased expansion with increasing temperature. The results were published in Soviet science journals, and short summaries were published in Chemical Abstracts in English, but Western scientists took no notice of the work. In 1966, Derjaguin travelled to England for the &quot; Discussions of the Faraday Society &quot; in Nottingham. There he presented the work again, and this time English scientists took note of what he referred to as anomalous water. English scientists then started researching the effect as well, and by 1968 it was also under study in the United States. By 1969 the concept had spread to newspapers and magazines. [ Unnatural Water http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C941747%2C00.html#ixzz193cs9DeB Western scientists were frankly skeptical. Russian Chemists N. Fedyakin and Boris Deryagin claimed to have produced a mysterious new substance, a form of water that was so stable it boiled only at about 1,000°F., or five times the boiling temperature of natural water. It did not evaporate. It did not freeze—though at —40°F., with little or no expansion, it hardened into a glassy substance quite unlike ice. Time magazine December 19, 1969 2010-12-24 ] There was fear by the United States military that there was a polywater gap with the Soviet Union.

Wall Street Journal June 30, 1969 2010-12-24 ] A scientific furor followed. Some experimentalists were able to reproduce Derjaguin&apos;s findings, while others failed. Several theories were advanced to explain the phenomenon. Some proposed that it was the cause for increasing resistance on trans-Atlantic phone cables, while others predicted that if polywater were to contact ordinary water, it would convert that water into polywater, echoing the doomsday scenario in Kurt Vonnegut &apos;s novel Cat&apos;s Cradle. By the 1970s, polywater was well known in the general population. [ Christian P. A. Berka, L. H.

The main concern was contamination of the water, but the papers went to great lengths to note the care taken to avoid this. Denis Rousseau and Sergio Porto of Bell Labs carried out infrared spectrum analysis which showed polywater was made mostly of chlorine and sodium. [ Rousseau Denis L. Porto Sergio P. S. March 27, 1970 Polywater: Polymer or Artifact?

He then published a paper suggesting that polywater was nothing more than water with small amounts of biological impurities. [ Rousseau Denis L. January 15, 1971 &quot; Polywater &quot; and Sweat: Similarities between the Infrared Spectra Science 171 3967 170–172 10.1126/science.171.3967.170 August 13, 2011 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/171/3967/170.abstract?sid%3D68de19c4-686a-45e9-84bd-ed9cd65f9196 1971Sci...171..170R ] Another wave of research followed, this time more tightly controlled. Invariably the polywater could no longer be made. Chemical analysis found that samples of polywater were contaminated with other substances (explaining the changes in melting and boiling points), and examination of polywater via electron microscopy showed that it also contained small particles of various solids from silicon to phospholipid s, explaining its greater viscosity. When the experiments that had produced polywater were repeated with thoroughly cleaned glassware, the anomalous properties of the resulting water vanished, and even the scientists who had originally advanced the case for polywater agreed that it did not exist. This took a few years longer in the Soviet Union, where scientists still clung to the idea. Denis Rousseau used polywater as a classic example of pathological science, and has since written on other examples as well. [ Rousseau, Denis L. Case Studies in Pathological Science American Scientist 1992 January–February 1992 80 1 54–63 1992AmSci..80...54R ] It has been suggested that polywater should have been dismissed on theoretical grounds. The laws of thermodynamics predicted that, since polywater had a higher boiling point than ordinary water, it meant that it was more stable, and the whole column of ordinary water should have turned spontaneously into polywater, instead of just part of it. Richard Feynman remarked that, if such a material existed, then there would exist an animal that would not need food. That animal would just ingest water and excrete polywater, using the energy released on the process to survive.

Myers using the surname Dr. Dolittle appeared in the February, 1971 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact. It features an animal composed entirely of polywater, with the metabolism described by Richard Feynman. Polywater is the central idea of the 1972 espionage/thriller novel A Report from Group 17 by Robert C. O&apos;Brien. The story revolves around the use of a type of polywater to make people controllable and incapable of independent thought or action. The Star Trek episode &quot; The Naked Time &quot; features polywater that is capable of infecting and spreading like a virus. Infected victims start sweating profusely at first, then lose their inhibitions, acting as though as they&apos;re drunk. This plotline was later revisited in the spinoff series Star Trek: The Next Generation in the episode &quot; The Naked Now. &quot; [ See also ] Hyle Ice-nine Penta Water Water memory [ References ] [ Further reading ] Franks, F., Polywater MIT Press, 1981 ISBN 0-262-06073-6 Category:Discovery and invention controversies Category:Forms of water Category:Liquid water Category:Pathological science Category:Scientific controversies de:Polywasser fr:Eau polymérisée nl:Polywater ja:ポリウォーター pl:Poliwoda ru:Поливода sr:Поливода sh:Polivoda zh:聚合水
