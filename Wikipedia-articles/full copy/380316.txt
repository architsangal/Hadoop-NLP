He attended Valdese High School, then Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., where he studied chemistry. He began his PhD studies in chemistry at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but left before completing his PhD for financial reasons. His thesis resulted in a paper, co-authored in 1967 with Harry B. Mark, his adviser. The New York Times wrote that it pioneered a way to measure the spectra of chemical reactions on the surface of an electrode. He decided to finish his PhD in England at the University of Southampton, where in 1975 he met Martin Fleischmann. Pons was a student in Professor Alan Bewick&apos;s group; he earned his PhD in 1978. [ Career ] On March 23, 1989, while Pons was the chairman of the chemistry department at the University of Utah, [ Brilliance and Recklessness Seen in Fusion Collaboration William J.

After the claims were found to be unreproducible, the scientific community determined the claims were incomplete, and inaccurate. [ Science, Reason, and Rhetoric Henry Krips, J. E.

He found a Q value of 31MeV/atom. The difference from the expected 23.8MeV/atom is most likely due to retained He in the palladium.
