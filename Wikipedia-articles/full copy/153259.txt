The uncertainty has arisen because the Anglo-Saxon Chroniclesometimes began in September, meaning that an event that took place in November 869 (according to the modern calendar) would have been recorded by the Anglo-Saxons as having taken place in 870. Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. xv. note ] was king of East Anglia from about 855 until his death. Almost nothing is known of Edmund. He is thought to be of East Anglian origin and was first mentioned in an annal of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written some years after his death. His kingdom was devastated by the Vikings, who destroyed any contemporary evidence of his reign. Later writers produced fictitious accounts of his life, asserting that he was born in 841, the son of Æthelweard, an obscure East Anglian king, whom it was said he succeeded when he was fourteen (or alternatively that he was the youngest son of a Germanic king named &apos;Alcmund&apos;). Later versions of his life relate that he was crowned on 25 December 855 at Burna, an unidentified location, and that he became a model king. In 869, the Great Heathen Army advanced on East Anglia and killed Edmund. He may have been slain by the Danes in battle, but by tradition he met his death at an unidentified place known as Haegelisdun, after he refused the Danes&apos; demand that he renounce Christ: the Danes beat him, shot him with arrows and then beheaded him, on the orders of Ivar the Boneless and his brother Ubbe Ragnarsson. According to one legend, his head was then thrown into the forest, but was found safe by searchers after following the cries of a wolf that was calling, &quot; Hic, Hic, Hic &quot; – &apos;Here, Here, Here&apos;. Commentators have noted how Edmund&apos;s death bears resemblances to the fate suffered by Saint Sebastian, St Denis and St Mary of Egypt. A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted from around the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote of his life and martyrdom. The saint&apos;s remains were temporarily moved from Bury to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. The mediaeval manuscripts and other works of art relating to Edmund that have survived include Abbo&apos;s Passio Santi Eadmundi, John Lydgate &apos;s 14th century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings. [ King of the East Angles ] [ Accession and rule ] Edmund is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle annal for 870, which was compiled twenty years after his death. { Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 61. } By tradition, Edmund is thought to have been born in 841 and to have acceded to the East Anglian throne in around 855. { Ridyard, &apos;The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 61. } Nothing is known of his life or reign, as no contemporary East Anglian documents from this period have survived. The devastation in East Anglia that was caused by the Vikings is thought to have destroyed any books or charters that referred to Edmund { Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 58. } and the lack of contemporary evidence means that it is not known for certain when his reign began, or his age when he became king. Later mediaeval chroniclers have provided dubious accounts of his life, in the absence of any real details. Edmund cannot be placed within any ruling dynasty. Numismatic evidence suggests he succeeded Æthelweard. According to the historian Susan Ridyard, Abbo of Fleury&apos;s statement that Edmund was &apos;ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus&apos; can be taken to mean that he was descended from a noble and ancient race. { Ridyard, &apos;The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 217. } It is known that a variety of different coins were minted by Edmund&apos;s moneyers during his reign. The letters AN, standing for &apos;Anglia&apos;, only appear on the coins of Edmund and Æthelstan of East Anglia : they appear on Edmund&apos;s coins as part of the phrase + EADMUND REX AN. Later specimens read + EADMUND REX and so it is possible for his coins to be divided chronologically. { Grierson and Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage, p. 294. } Otherwise, no chronology for his coins has been confirmed. { Grierson and Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage, p.588. } [ Death ] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which generally described few matters relating to the East Angles and their rulers, is the only source for a description of the events for the year 869 that led to the defeat of Edmund&apos;s army at the hands of the Danes. It relates that &quot; Her rad se here ofer Mierce innan East Engle and wiñt setl namon. æt Đeodforda. And þy wint&apos; Eadmund cying him wiþ feaht. and þa Deniscan sige naman þone cyning ofslogon. and þæt lond all ge eodon. &quot; - &apos;here the army rode across Mercia into East Anglia, and took winter-quarters at Thetford; and that winter King Edmund fought against them, and the Danish took the victory, and killed the king and conquered all that land&apos;. { Earle, Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel, pp. 72, 74. } { Swanton, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 70. } By tradition the leaders who slew the king were Hingwar and his brother Hubba. Along with other forces, the Great Heathen Army then invaded Wessex, perhaps in December 870 (within a few weeks of killing Edmund) or after having spent a year pillaging and consolidating their position in East Anglia, before proceeding to attack Mercia and Northumbria. { Yorke, Wessex in the Early Middle Ages, p. 109. } { Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 211. } [ Memorial coinage ] A St Edmund memorial penny. Edmund&apos;s body was buried in a wooden chapel near to where he was killed, but was later transferred to Beadoriceworth, where in 925 Athelstan founded a community devoted to the new cult. { Farmer, The Oxford Dictionary of Saints: Edmund } Thirty years after Edmund&apos;s death, he was venerated by the Vikings of East Anglia, who produced a coinage to commemorate him. { Grierson and Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage, p. 305. } The coinage was minted from around 895 to 915 (close to the time when East Anglia was conquered by Edward the Elder of Wessex ) and was based on the design of coins produced during Edmund&apos;s reign. All the pennies and (more rarely) half-pennies that were produced read SCE EADMVND REX —&apos;O St Edmund the king!&apos;. Some of them have a legend that provides evidence that the Vikings experimented with their initial design. { Grierson and Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage, p. 320. } The St. Edmund memorial coins were minted in great quantities by a group of more than 70 moneyers, many of whom appear to have originated from the continent: over 1800 individual specimens were found when the great Cuerdale Hoard was discovered in 1840. { Grierson and Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage, p. 319. } The coins would have been widely used within the Danelaw and many single items have mainly been found in the east of England, but the exact locations of the mints where they were made are not known with certainty: scholars have assumed that they were made in East Anglia. { Grierson and Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage, p. 320. } [ Veneration ] [ Saint Edmund the Martyr 20 November crowned and robed as a king; holding a scepter, orb, arrow, or a sword kings, pandemics, the Roman Catholic diocese of East Anglia, Douai Abbey Bury St Edmunds, destroyed ] [ Cult at Bury St Edmunds ] A depiction of St Edmund&apos;s shrine, which was destroyed in 1539 During the 11th century a stone church was built in Bury, which was replaced by a larger church in 1095, into which Edmund&apos;s relics were translated. The abbey&apos;s power grew upon being given jurisdiction over the growing town in 1028 and the creation in 1044, of the geographical and political area of the Liberty of St Edmund, established by Edward the Confessor, which remained a separate jurisdiction under the control of the abbot of Bury St Edmunds Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries. The shrine at Bury St Edmunds soon became one of the most famous and wealthy pilgrimage locations in England. In 1010, Edmund&apos;s remains were translated to London to protect them from the Vikings, where they were kept for three years before being returned to Bury. For centuries the shrine was visited by various kings of England, many of whom gave generously to the abbey: Sweyn&apos;s son, King Canute, converted to Christianity and rebuilt the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. In 1020, he made a pilgrimage and offered his own crown upon the shrine as atonement for the sins of his forefathers. King John is said to have given a great sapphire and a precious stone set in gold, which he was permitted to keep upon the condition that it was returned to the abbey when he died. { Yates, History and Antiquities of the Abbey of St Edmunds Bury, part II p. 40. } The town arose as the wealth and fame of the abbey grew. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the abbot planned out over 300 new houses within a grid-iron pattern at a location that was close to the abbey precincts. { Cantor, The English Medieval Landscape, p. 176. } Edmund&apos;s cult was promoted and flourished, but it declined in subsequent years and the saint did not reappear in any liturgical calendars until the appearance of Abbo of Fleury&apos;s Passio Santi Eadmundi in the 12th century. { Gransden, Legends, Traditions and History in Medieval England, pp. 82-83. } Edmund&apos;s shrine was destroyed in 1539, during the English Reformation. According to a letter (which now belongs to the Cotton Collection in the British Library ), the shrine was defaced, and silver and gold to the value of over 5000 marks was taken away. On 4 November 1539 the abbot and his monks were expelled and the abbey was dissolved. { Yates, History and Antiquities of the Abbey of St Edmunds Bury, part I, pp. 232-235. } [ Cult at Toulouse ] After the Battle of Lincoln (1217), it was traditionally claimed that Edmund&apos;s body was stolen by Count of Melun and subsequently donated to Basilica of Saint-Sernin in the French city of Toulouse by the Dauphin (later Louis XIII of France ). [ Gransden, Antonia A Scientific Examination of the Relics of St Edmund at Arundel Castle Gem, Richard Bury St Edmunds: Medieval Art, Architecture, Archaeology and Economy 1998 45–59 British Archaeological Association Confirmed Transactions XX ] The first record of this is a relic list for Saint-Sernin of around 1425, which included St Edmund among the basilica&apos;s relics. After the city was saved from the plague in the years from 1628 to 1631 — by the saint&apos;s intercessions — the city built, in 1644, a new shrine for his relics in gratitude for its deliverance: his cult flourished there for over two centuries. Edmund&apos;s shrine was of silver and adorned with solid silver statues and when his relics were translated to it, the population came for eight days to honour the saint. { Catholic World, pp. 104-105. } [ Relics at Arundel Castle ] In 1901, the Archbishop of Westminster, Herbert Vaughan, received some relics from the basilica of Saint-Sernin. The relics, believed at the time to be those of St Edmund, were intended for the high altar of London&apos;s Westminster Cathedral, which was then under construction. The acceptance of the relics required the intercession of Pope Leo XIII, after a initial refusal by the church in France. [ Saint Edmund King and Martyr 1970 78 900963182 ] Upon their arrival in England, they were housed in the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle, prior to their translation to Westminster. Although the relics had been verified and catalogued in 1644 for interment in the new shrine and in 1874 when two pieces were given to Cardinal Manning, concerns were raised by Dr. Montague James and Dr Charles Biggs about their validity in The Times newspaper. They remained at Arundel under the care of the Duke of Norfolk, whilst a historical commission was set up by Cardinal Vaughan and Archbishop Germain of Saint-Sernin. They remain to this day at Arundel. [ Saint Edmund King and Martyr 1970 79 900963182 ] In 1966, three teeth from the collection of relics from France were donated to Douai Abbey. [ The Passio Santi Eadmundi ] Edmund&apos;s cult re-emerged in the 10th century and the site of his burial grew wealthy as a result of receiving grants of land from royally connected benefactors. In about 986, the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint&apos;s life and early cult. { Gransden, Legends, Traditions and History in Medieval England, pp. 45-46. } The story of Edmund&apos;s martyrdom came to him by way of St Dunstan, who heard it from the lips of Edmund&apos;s own sword-bearer. { Abbo of Fleury, Life of St. Edmund. } According to Abbo, Edmund came &quot; ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus &quot;. { Mawer, Encyclopedia Britannica, volume 8, pp. 947-948. } This statement has confused later translators into thinking that Edmund was of continental Old Saxon origin, but according to the historian Steven Plunkett, he originated from East Anglia, which was a country settled by &apos;Saxons&apos;. { Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 202-212. } In Abbo&apos;s version of events, the king refused to meet the Danes in battle, preferring to die a martyr&apos;s death. The historian Susan Ridyard maintains that Edmund&apos;s martyrdom cannot be proved and the nature of his fate — whether he died fighting or was cruelly murdered in the battle&apos;s aftermath — cannot be read from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. She notes that the story that Edmund had an armour-bearer implies that he would have been a warrior king who was prepared to fight the Vikings on the battlefield, but she acknowledges the possibility that later accounts belong to &quot; the realm of hagiographical fantasy &quot;. { Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England. pp.66-67. } [ 50% Edmund&apos;s death, according to Abbo of Fleury BlanchedAlmond SaddleBrown Cornsilk right left &quot; King Edmund stood within his hall of the mindful Healer with Hinguar, who then came, and discarded his weapons. He willed to imitate Christ&apos;s example, which forbade Peter to fight against the fierce Jews with weapons. Lo! to the dishonorable man Edmund then submitted and was scoffed at and beaten by cudgels. Thus the heathens led the faithful king to a tree firmly rooted in Earth, tightened him thereto with sturdy bonds, and again scourged him for a long time with straps. He always called between the blows with belief in truth to Christ the Saviour. The heathens then became brutally angry because of his beliefs, because he called Christ to himself to help. They shot then with missiles, as if to amuse themselves, until he was all covered with their missiles as with bristles of a hedgehog, just as Sebastian was. Then Hinguar, the dishonorable Viking, saw that the noble king did not desire to renounce Christ, and with resolute faith always called to him; Hinguar then commanded to behead the king and the heathens thus did. While this was happening, Edmund called to Christ still. Then the heathens dragged the holy man to slaughter, and with a stroke struck the head from him. His soul set forth, blessed, to Christ. &quot; ] Abbo named one of Edmund&apos;s killers as Hinguar, who can probably be identified with Ivarr inn beinlausi (Ivar the Boneless), son of Ragnar Lodbrok. { Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England. p. 67. } After describing the horrific manner of Edmund&apos;s death, the Passio continued the story. His severed head was thrown into the wood. As Edmund&apos;s followers went seeking, calling out &quot; Where are you, friend? &quot; the head answered, &quot; Here, here, here, &quot; until at last they found it, clasped between a wolf&apos;s paws, protected from other animals and uneaten. After The villagers then praised God and the wolf that served him. It walked tamely beside them, before vanishing back into the forest. The body was buried in a coffin and later translated to Beodericsworth, but Abbo failed to date either events, { Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England. p. 213. } although from the text it can be seen that he believed that the relics had been taken to Beodericsworth by the time that Theodred became Bishop of London in around 926. { Ridyard, The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England. p. 231. } Upon exhumation of the body, a miracle was discovered. All the arrow wounds upon Edmund&apos;s corpse had healed and his head was reattached. The only evidence of decapitation was a line around his neck and his skin was still soft and fresh, as if he had been sleeping. [ These details induced the writers of the British Museum&apos;s account of the bog body called Lindow Man to suggest that the body of St Edmund recovered in the fens &quot; was in fact a prehistoric bog body, and that in trying to find their murdered king, his people had recovered the remains of a sacred king of the old religion still bearing the marks of his ritual strangulation &quot;. Stead et al, Lindow Man: The Body in the Bog, p. 175. note ] The last recorded inspection of the body whilst at Bury St Edmunds was in 1198. [ Saint Edmund King and Martyr 1970 51 900963182 ] The resemblance between the deaths of Saint Sebastian and St Edmund was remarked upon by Abbo: both saints were attacked by archers, although only Edmund is supposed to have been decapitated. His death bears somes resemblance to the fate suffered by other saints: St Denis was whip ped and beheaded and the body of Mary of Egypt was said to have been guarded by a lion. { Gransden, Legends, Traditions and History in Medieval England, p.87. } Gransden describes Abbo&apos;s Passio as &quot; little more that a hotch-potch of hagiographical commonplaces &quot; and argues that Abbo&apos;s ignorance of what actually happened to Edmund would have led him to use aspects of the Lives of well known saints such as Sebastian and Denis as models for his version of Edmund&apos;s martydom. Gransden acknowledges that there are some aspects of the story —such as the appearance of the wolf that guards Edmund&apos;s head —that do not have exact parallels elsewhere. { Gransden, Legends, Traditions and History in Medieval England, pp. 86-87. } [ Mediaeval hagiographies and legends ] Edmund being crowned by angels De Infantia Sancti Edmundi, a fictitious 12th century hagiography of Edmund&apos;s early life by Geoffrey of Wells, represented him as the youngest son of &apos;Alcmund&apos;, a Saxon king of Germanic descent. &apos;Alcmund&apos; may never have existed. { Catholic Encylopedia, p. 295. } Edmund&apos;s fictitious continental origins were later expanded into legends which spoke of his parentage, his birth at Nuremberg, his adoption by Offa of Mercia, his nomination as successor to the king and his landing at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk coast to claim his kingdom. Other accounts state that his father was the king he succeeded, Æthelweard of East Anglia, who died in 854, apparently when Edmund was a boy of fourteen. He was said to have been crowned by St Humbert (Bishop Humbert of Elmham) on 25 December 855, at a location known as Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk) which at that time functioned as the royal capital. [ Saint Edmund King and Martyr 1970 19 900963182 ] Later versions of his life recorded that he was a model king who treated all his subjects with equal justice and who was unbending to flatterers. It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter, so that he could recite it from memory. [ Saint Edmund King and Martyr 1970 16 900963182 ] Edmund may have been killed at Hoxne, in Suffolk. { Warner, Origins of Suffolk, p. 219. } His martyrdom is mentioned in a charter that was written when the church and chapel at Hoxne were granted to Norwich Priory in 1101. Place-name evidence has been used to link the name of Hoxne with Haegelisdun, named by Abbo of Fleury as the site of Edmund&apos;s martyrdom, but this evidence is dismissed by the historian Peter Warner. { Warner, Origins of Suffolk, pp. 139, 141. } The association of Edmund&apos;s cult with the village has continued to the present day. [ Until 1849, an old tree stood in Hoxne Park that was believed to be where Edmund had been martyred. In the heart of the tree, an arrow head was found. A piece of the tree was used to form part of an altar of a church dedicated to Edmund. Another legend relates that after being routed in battle, Edmund hid under the Goldbrook bridge at Hoxne, but his hiding place was revealed to a wedding party, who gave him away his enemies. &apos;Saint Edmund: England&apos;s Original Patron Saint&apos;, at Hoxne&apos;s website. note ] Dernford, Cambridgeshire [ Do you know where King Edmund died in 869 AD? The Good Grid Guide Scarle R.D Cambridge Archaeology ] and Bradfield St Clare [ Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History Volume 35 part 3 1983 223 ] (near Bury St Edmunds ) are other possible sites for where Edmund was martyred. The ancient wooden church of St Andrew, Greensted-juxta-Ongar, is said to have been a resting place for his body on the way to Bury St Edmunds in 1013 { Jennifer Westwood, Albion: a Guide to Legendary Britain, Book Club Associates (1986) ISBN 978-0881621280 (p.152) } [ Banner ] The three crowns of St Edmund In Bernard Burke &apos;s Vicissitudes of Families, published in 1869, Burke proposed that Edmund&apos;s banner was among those borne during the Norman invasion of Ireland, after which the three crowns on a blue background became the standard for Ireland during the Plantagenet era. Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, Robert Fitz-Stephen and Raymond le Gros who all featured prominently in the Anglo-Norman invasion, dedicated a chapel of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin to Edmund. { Kennedy, The Arms of Ireland: Medieval and Modern, notes 2 and 3. } When the Scottish castle at Caevlerlock was taken by Edward I of England in 1300, the banners of Edmund, St George and Edward the Confessor were displayed by the victorious English from the castle battlements, as &quot; powerful, unifying symbols of the holy guardians and supporters of their cause &quot;. { Altmann, The Court Reconvenes, p. 15. } According to the antiquarian Sir Harris Nicolas &apos; account of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, five banners were flown on the English side, one of which was probably that of St Edmund. { Nicolas, History of the Battle of Agincourt, p. 115. } In a preface to the Life of the saint written by the poet John Lydgate, in which Edmund&apos;s banners are described, [ See the British Library image of the three crowns banner from Lydgate&apos;s book. British Library online Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts:, Harley 2278 f.3v (Arms of Bury). note ] { Frantzen, Bloody Good, pp. 68-69. } the three crowns are said to represent Edmund&apos;s martyrdom, virginity and kingship. { Preble, Origin and History of the American Flag, p. 123 } [ Patronages ] Edmund is the patron saint of pandemics and as well as of kings, { Ball, Encyclopaedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices, p. 276. } the Roman Catholic diocese of East Anglia, { Roman Catholic diocese of East Anglia website. } and Douai Abbey in Berkshire. { English Benedictine Congregation - Douai Abbey. } Churches dedicated to his memory are to be found all over England, including St Edmund the King and Martyr &apos;s Church in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren during the 1670s. During the Middle Ages, St George replaced Edmund as the patron saint of England when Edward III associated George with the Order of the Garter. In 2006, a group that included BBC Radio Suffolk and the East Anglian Daily Times failed in their campaign to reinstore Edmund.

The beautifully illustrated Passio Santi Eadmundi was written by Abbo of Fleury in Bury St Edmunds in around 1130: a surviving copy of the Passio is now kept at the Morgan Library in New York. John Lydgate&apos;s 14th century Life, which was presented to Henry VI, is in the British Library. { John Lydgate&apos;s &apos;&apos;Metrical Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund&apos;&apos;, in the copy presented to Henry VI of England, can be viewed at the British Library&apos;s Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts website. } The Wilton Diptych was painted during the reign of Richard II of England and is the most famous representation of Edmund in art. Painted on oak panels, it shows Richard kneeling in front of three saints —one of whom is Edmund —as they present the young king to the Virgin and Child. { http://www.history.ac.uk/richardII/wilton.html &apos;The Wilton Diptych&apos;, in the Richard II&apos;s Treasure website. } The 15th century poet John Lydgate, who lived all his life in Bury St Edmunds, presented his twelve-year-old king Henry VI of England with a long poem (now known as Metrical Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund) when Henry came to the town in 1433 and stayed at the abbey for four months. { Frantzen, Bloody Good, pp. 66-67. } The book is now kept by the British Library in London.
