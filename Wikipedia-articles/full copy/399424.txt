[ Old Persian Ancient Iran Ancestor of Middle Persian Indo-European Indo-Iranian Iranian Old Persian cuneiform peo peo IPA ] The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan ). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablet s, and seal s of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt { Roland G. Kent, Old Persian, 1953 } the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). { &quot; Everyday text shows that Old Persian was probably more commonly used than previously thought &quot; accessed September 2010 from } This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display. [ Origin and overview ] As a written language, Old Persian is attested in royal Achaemenid inscriptions. It is an Iranian language and as such a member of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the Behistun Inscription s. Old Persian is one of the oldest Indo-European languages which is attested in original texts. [ Skjærvø 2006 vi(2). Documentation. Old Persian. ] The oldest date of use of Old Persian as a spoken language is not precisely known. According to certain historical assumptions about the early history and origin of ancient Persians in south-western Iran (where Achaemenids hailed from), Old Persian was originally spoken by a tribe called Parsuwash who arrived in the Iranian Plateau early in the 1st millennium BCE and finally migrated down into the area of present day Fārs province and their language, i.e. Old Persian, became the official language of the Achaemenid kings. Assyrian records, which in fact provide the earliest evidence for ancient Iranians (Persian and Median) presence on the Iranian Plateau, give a good chronology but only an approximate geographical indication of ancient Persians. In these records of the 9th century BCE, Parsuwash (along with Matai of Median) are first mentioned in the area of Lake Urmia in the records of Shalmaneser III. [ Skjærvø 2006 vi(1). Earliest Evidence ] The exact identity of the Parsuwash is yet to be determined but from a linguistic viewpoint the word matches Old Persian pārsa itself coming directly from the older word *pārćwa. Also as Old Persian contains many words from another extinct Iranian language, Median, according to P. O. Skjærvø it is probable that Old Persian had already been spoken before formation of the Achaemenid Empire and during most of the first half of the first millennium BCE. [ Classification ] [ Iranian_languages#Proto-Iranian_and_Old_Iranian_languages Old Iranian languages ] Old Persian belongs to the Iranian language family which is a branch of the Indo-Iranian language family, and is sibling to another branch called Indic languages. Indo-Iranian languages is itself within the large family of Indo-European languages. The common ancestors of Indo-Iranians came from Central Asia sometime in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The extinct and unattested Median language is another Old Iranian language related to Old Persian (e.g. both are classified as Western Iranian languages and many Median names appeared in Old Persian texts) [ Schmitt 2008 76 ] The group of Old Iranian languages was presumably a large group; however our knowledge of it is restricted mainly to Old Persian, Avestan and Median. The former are the only languages in that group which have left written original texts while Median is known mostly from loanword s in Old Persian. [ (Skjærvø 2006 ] [ Language evolution ] By the 4th century, the late Achaemenid period, the inscriptions of Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III differ enough from the language of Darius&apos; inscriptions to be called a &quot; pre-Middle Persian, &quot; or &quot; post-Old Persian. &quot; [ Skjærvø Prods Oktor An Introduction to Old Persian 2nd Cambridge 2005 Harvard http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/OldPersian/opcomplete.pdf ] Old Persian subsequently evolved into Middle Persian, which is in turn the genetic ancestor of New Persian.Professor Gilbert Lazard, a famous Iranologist and the author of the book Persian Grammar states: { (Lazard, Gilbert 1975, “The Rise of the New Persian Language” in Frye, R. N., The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 4, pp. 595-632, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. } The language known as New Persian, which usually is called at this period (early Islamic times) by the name of Parsi-Dari, can be classified linguistically as a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of Sassanian Iran, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids. Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as Avestan, Parthia n, Soghdian, Kurdish, Pashto, etc., Old, Middle and New Persian represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in Fars and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran&apos;&apos;. Middle Persian, also sometimes called Pahlavi is a direct continuation of old Persian, and was used as the written official language of the country. { Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J. Mattheier, Peter Trudgill, &quot; Sociolinguistics Hsk 3/3 Series Volume 3 of Sociolinguistics: An International Handbook of the Science of Language and Society &quot;, Walter de Gruyter, 2006. 2nd edition. pg 1912: &quot; Middle Persian, also called Pahlavi is a direct continuation of old Persian, and was used as the written official language of the country. &quot; &quot; However, after the Moslem conquest and the collapse of the Sassanids, Arabic became the dominant language of the country and Pahlavi lost its importance, and was gradually replaced by Dari, a variety of Middle Persian, with considerable loan elements from Arabic and Parthian. &quot; } { Bo Utas, &quot; Semitic on Iranian &quot;, in &quot; Linguistic convergence and areal diffusion: case studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic &quot; editors (Éva Ágnes Csató, Bo Isaksson, Carina Jahani),Routledge, 2005. pg 71: &quot; As already mentioned, it is not likely that the scribes of Sassanian chanceries had any idea about the Old Persian cuneiform writing and the language couched in it. Still, the Middle Persian language that appeared in the third century AD may be seen as a continuation of Old Persian } Comparison of the evolution at each stage of the language shows great simplification in grammar and syntax. However, New Persian is a direct descendent of Middle and Old Persian. [ Iran, vi. Iranian languages and scripts Prods Oktor Skjærvø Encyclopaedia Iranica 2006 13 Skjaervo2006. ] [ Substrates ] Old Persian &quot; presumably &quot; has a Median language substrate. The Median element is readily identifiable because it did not share in the developments that were peculiar to Old Persian. Median forms &quot; are found only in personal or geographical names [...] and some are typically from religious vocabulary and so could in principle also be influenced by Avestan. &quot; &quot; Sometimes, both Median and Old Persian forms are found, which gave Old Persian a somewhat confusing and inconsistent look: &apos;horse,&apos; for instance, is [attested in Old Persian as] both asa (OPers.) and aspa (Med.). &quot; [ Script ] [ Old Persian cuneiform ] Old Persian texts were written from left to right in the syllabic Old Persian cuneiform script and had 36 phonetic characters and 8 logograms. The usage of such characters are not obligatory. [ Schmitt 2008 78 ] The script was surprisingly [ Schmitt 2008 78 ] { Excerpt: &quot; It remains unclear why the } { Persians did not take over the } { Mesopotamian system in earlier times, as the Elamites and other peoplesof the Near East had, and, for that matter, why the Persians did not adopt the Aramaic consonantal script.. &quot; } not a result of evolution of the script used in the nearby civilisation of Mesopotamia. [ Schmitt 2008 77 ] Despite the fact that Old Persian was written in cuneiform script, the script was not a direct continuation of Mesopotamian tradition and in fact, according to Schmitt, was a &quot; deliberate creation of the sixth century BCE &quot;. The origin of the Old Persian cuneiform script and the identification of the date and process of introduction is a matter of discussion among Iranian scholars without general agreement being reached. The factors making the decision difficult are, among others, the difficult passage DB (IV lines 88–92) from Darius the Great who speaks of a new “form of writing” being made by himself which is said to be “in Aryan ”, and analysis of certain Old Persian inscriptions that are &quot; supposed or claimed &quot; to predate Darius the Great. Although it is true that the oldest attested OP inscriptions are from Behistun monument from Darius, the creation of this &quot; new type of writing &quot; is seemingly, according to Schmitt, &quot; to have begun already under Cyrus the Great &quot;. [ Schmitt 2008 80–1 ] The script shows a few changes in the shape of characters during the period it was used. This can be seen as a standardization of the heights of wedges which in the beginning (i.e. in DB ) took only half the height of a line. [ Schmitt 2008 79 ] [ Phonology ] The following phonemes are expressed in the Old Persian script: Vowels [ /aː/ /iː/ /uː/ ] [ /a/ /i/ /u/ ] Long: Short: Consonants [ /p/ ] [ /b/ ] [ /t/ ] [ /d/ ] [ /c/ ] [ /ɟ/ ] [ /k/ ] [ /ɡ/ ] [ /m/ ] [ /n/ ] [ /f/ ] [ /θ/ ] [ /ç/ ] [ /x/ ] [ /h/ ] [ /s/ ] [ /z/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] [ /r/ ] [ /l/ ] [ /ʋ/ ] [ /j/ ]   Labial Dental / Alveolar Palatal Velar Glottal Plosive p b t d c j k g     Nasal   m   n             Fricative f   θ   ç x   h   Sibilant     s z š           Rhotic       r             Lateral       l             Approximant   v       y         [ Grammar ] [ Nouns ] Old Persian stems: a-stems (-a, -am, -ā) i-stems (-iš, iy) u- (and au-) stems (-uš, -uv) consonantal stems (n, r, h) -a -am -ā Singular Dual Plural Singular Dual Plural Singular Dual Plural Nominative -a -ā -ā, -āha -am -ā -ā -ā -ā -ā Vocative -ā -ā Accusative -am -ām Instrumental/ Ablative -ā -aibiyā -aibiš Dative -ahyā, -ahya -ahyā, -ahya Genitive -āyā -ānām -āyā -ānām -āyā -ānām Locative -aiy -aišuvā -aiy -aišuvā -āšuvā -iš -iy -uš -uv Singular Dual Plural Singular Dual Plural Singular Dual Plural Singular Dual Plural Nominative -iš -īy -iya -iy -in -īn -uš -ūv -uva -uv -un -ūn Vocative -i -u Accusative -im -iš -um -ūn Instrumental/ Ablative -auš -ībiyā -ībiš -auš -ībiyā -ībiš -auv -ūbiyā -ūbiš -auv -ūbiyā -ūbiš Dative -aiš -aiš -auš -auš Genitive -īyā -īnām -īyā -īnām -ūvā -ūnām -ūvā -ūnām Locative -auv -išuvā -auv -išuvā -āvā -ušuvā -āvā -ušuvā Adjectives are declinable in similar way.
