Stephanopoulos rose to early prominence as a quick-witted communications director for the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign of Bill Clinton { http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/interviews/stephanopoulos.html }, subsequently becoming White House Communications Director then Senior Advisor for Policy and Strategy before departing in December 1996. Today he is chief political correspondent for ABC News, co- anchor of ABC News&apos; Good Morning America (GMA), host of ABC&apos;s Sunday morning This Week, { Stephanopoulos back to replace Amanpour at ABC’s ‘This Week,’ will remain host of ‘GMA’ } and primary substitute for ABC network anchor Diane Sawyer on ABC World News. { Allen, Mike (October 18, 2009). &quot; George Stephanopoulos Role Grows at ABC &quot;. } { The Politico. Retrieved December 21, 2009. } In recent years he has co-hosted ABC News&apos; special live coverage of political events with Sawyer and Charles Gibson and launched an ABCNews.com blog, George&apos;s Bottom Line. Stephanopoulos is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. { http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=S } [ Early life and education ] Stephanopoulos was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, to Greek immigrants, Robert George and Nickolitsa ( &quot; Nikki &quot; ) Gloria (née Chafos) Stephanopoulos. His father is a Greek Orthodox priest and Dean Emeritus of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York City { Staff writer (undated). &quot; Fr. Robert George Stephanopoulos &quot;. } { Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Retrieved December 20, 2009. }, and his mother was for many years director of the national news service of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Young George also became a follower of his parents&apos; faith and long considered entering the priesthood himself. Following some time in Purchase, New York, Stephanopoulos attended suburban Cleveland, Ohio &apos;s Orange High School, where he wrestled competitively. In 1982, he received his bachelor of arts degree in political science from Columbia University in New York, where he was a sports broadcaster for WKCR-FM, the university&apos;s radio station. Stephanopoulos was the salutatorian of his class and was also awarded a Harry S. Truman Scholarship. { |Meet Our 1980 Truman Scholars. } { Virginia Tech in March 2006 } Stephanopoulos&apos;s father always wanted his son to become a lawyer, if not a priest. Promising him he would attend law school eventually, George took a job as an aide to Cleveland congressman Ed Feighan in Washington, D.C.. Though he rose to Feighan&apos;s chief of staff, Stephanopoulos agreed to cede to his father&apos;s wishes and attend law school if he succeeded in a second attempt to earn a Rhodes Scholarship after having been rejected for the Rhodes Scholarship during his senior year at Columbia. He earned a M.A. in Theology at Balliol College. He maintains he spent much of his time trying to root his political leanings in the deeper philosophies that he studied there. [ Early career ] In 1988, Stephanopoulos worked on the Michael Dukakis 1988 U.S. presidential campaign. He has noted that one of his attractions to this campaign was that Dukakis was a Greek-American liberal from Massachusetts. { Stephanopoulos, George, All Too Human  – A Political Education, p. 21. } After this campaign, Stephanopoulos became the &quot; floor man &quot; for Dick Gephardt, U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader; he held this position until he joined the Clinton campaign. [ Clinton Administration ] Stephanopoulos was, along with David Wilhelm and James Carville, a leading member of Clinton&apos;s 1992 U.S. presidential campaign. His role on the campaign is portrayed in the documentary film The War Room (1993). At the outset of Clinton&apos;s presidency, Stephanopoulos served as the de facto press secretary, briefing the press even though Dee Dee Myers was officially the White House Press Secretary. Later, he was moved to Senior Advisor on Policy and Strategy, when Myers began personally conducting the briefings (following several verbal missteps by Stephanopoulos) and David Gergen was brought in as the new White House Communications Director. The move was largely viewed as a rebuke to Stephanopoulos&apos;s handling of public relations during the first six months of the Clinton administration. On February 25, 1994, Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes had a conference call with Roger Altman to discuss the Resolution Trust Corporation &apos;s choice of Republican lawyer Jay Stephens to head the Madison Guaranty investigation, that later turned into the Whitewater controversy. { Staff writer (undated). &quot; Timeline &quot;. } { AllPolitics (via } { CNN ).

Retrieved December 19, 2009. } His memoir, All Too Human: A Political Education (1999), was published after he left the White House during Clinton&apos;s second term. It quickly became a number-one bestseller on The New York Times Best Seller list. [ Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/28/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html May 14, 2011 The New York Times March 28, 1999 ] In the book, Stephanopoulos spoke of his depression and how his face broke out into hives due to the pressures of conveying the Clinton White House message. Clinton referred to the book in his autobiography, My Life, apologizing for what he felt in retrospect to be excessive demands placed on the young staffer. Stephanopoulos&apos;s book covers his time with Clinton from the day he met him in September 1991 to the day Stephanopoulos left the White House in December 1996, through two presidential campaigns and four years in the White House. Stephanopoulos describes Clinton in the book as a &quot; complicated man responding to the pressures and pleasures of public life in ways I found both awesome and appalling. &quot; { Stephanopoulos, George, All Too Human – A Political Education, p. 5. } [ Real Estate Loan Controversy ] In 1994, columnist Jack Anderson reported that Stephanopoulos sealed an $835,000 commercial real estate deal consisting of a two-story apartment including an eyeware retailer with a below-market loan rate from a bank owned by Hugh McColl who had been called by President Clinton &quot; the most enlightened banker in America. &quot; A NationsBank commercial loan officer said that this loan did &quot; not fit our product matrix &quot; as banks typically only offer such loans for customers with deep pockets and on a short-term adjustable rate basis. Stephanopoulos&apos; real estate agent explained that &quot; nobody making $125,000 could qualify for the property without the commercial property (lease). &quot; One former senior bank regulator told Anderson that, &quot; If his name were George Smith, and he didn&apos;t work in the White House, this loan wouldn&apos;t have gotten made. &quot; [ Did Stephanopoulos Make Out Like A Bandit? Jack Anderson Jack Anderson Standard-Democrat Sikeston, Missouri July 28, 1994 ] Regarding the controversy, NationsBank stated, &quot; The loan described by Jack Anderson as a commercial loan to George Stephanopoulos was, in fact, a residential mortgage loan. At the time the loan commitment was made, Mr. Anderson (or his imaginary &apos;George Smith&apos; who &apos;doesn&apos;t work in the White House&apos;) could have walked into any NationsBanc Mortgage Company office in the DC area and received the same excellent rate and term for the same deal. &quot; [ NationsBank Responds to Jack Anderson Column PR Newswire http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NATIONSBANK%2BRESPONDS%2BTO%2BJACK%2BANDERSON%2BCOLUMN-a015602064 July 21, 1994 ] However, Stephanopoulos&apos; realtor states that he would not have qualified for the loan without the commercial property rent. One NationsBank source states that the issuance of a residential loan on mixed-use properties is such a rarity that it wasn&apos;t even addressed in the &quot; NationsBanc Mortgage Corporation&apos;s Program Summary &quot; or its &quot; Credit Policy Manual. &quot; A NationsBanc underwriting memo revealed that one of the three restrictions for mixed-use properties is that &quot; the borrower must be the owner of the business entity. &quot; The source claims that NationsBanc told the listing agent that, &quot; We&apos;re not (interested in mixed-use properties), but we do have an appetite for this particular loan. &quot; NationsBank&apos;s primary regulator at the time was Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, a Rhodes scholar who attended Yale Law School will President Clinton, and who had been asked to investigate NationsBank by Democratic congressmen Henry B. Gonzalez and John Dingell.

[ This Week host ] In September 2002, Stephanopoulos became host of This Week, and ABC News officially named him &quot; Chief Washington Correspondent &quot; in December 2005. { Staff writer (December 10, 2009). &quot; George Stephanopoulos&apos; Biography – Anchor, &apos;&apos;Good Morning America&apos;&apos;; Chief Political Correspondent; Anchor, &apos;&apos;This Week&apos;&apos; &quot;. Retrieved December 19, 2009. } The program&apos;s title added the new host&apos;s name. When named to the position, Stephanopoulos was a relative newcomer to the show, usurping longtime panelists and short-term co-hosts Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts who, for a few years, briefly replaced the long-term original host, David Brinkley. Opinion columnist and part-time ABC News commentator George Will is the only remaining member of the original This Week panel from the Brinkley days to participate consistently in the weekly show; Donaldson and Roberts still appear on the program on a very limited basis. Fareed Zakaria was a weekly panelist during the first two years of Stephanopoulos&apos;s tenure, broadening the show with his perspective on world and Middle Eastern issues. [ This Week ratings ] ABC News executives reportedly offered Ted Koppel, former Nightline anchor, the This Week host job in 2005 after the program&apos;s ratings had become a regular third-, fourth-, and sometimes fifth-place finish after competitors NBC, CBS, Fox and syndicated programs. { Steinberg, Jacques (April 1, 2005).

Retrieved December 19, 2009. } In February 2009, the gap between NBC&apos;s Meet the Press and its competitors – CBS&apos;s Face the Nation and ABC&apos;s This Week – began closing. Meet the Press posted its lowest ratings since NBC&apos;s David Gregory became moderator in early February, with the show airing Sunday, February 1, averaging just 3.9  million viewers. Face the Nation averaged 3.33  million total viewers, while This Week came in just behind with 3.32  million total viewers. [ 2008 U.S. presidential debate ] On April 16, 2008, Stephanopoulos co-moderated, with Charles Gibson, the twenty-first, and ultimately final, Democratic Party presidential debate between Illinois Senator Barack Obama and New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for the 2008 election cycle. While the debate received record ratings, the co-moderators were heavily criticized for focusing most of the first hour of the debate on controversies that occurred during the campaign rather than issues such as the economy and the Iraq War. Stephanopoulos acknowledged the legitimacy of the concerns over the order of the questions, [ Abcarian Robin Stephanopoulos Defends His Questions to Obama April 17, 2008 December 19, 2009 Los Angeles Times http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/04/stephanopoulos.html ] but said they were issues in the campaign that had not been covered in previous debates.

Stephanopoulos accepted the new position and started on December 14, 2009. Stephanopoulos announced on January 10, 2010, that that would be his last broadcast as the permanent host of This Week. He is now the co-host of Good Morning America. It was announced that he would return as host of This Week in December 2011. [ World News Tonight ] Stephanopoulos substitutes for Sawyer on nights when she is away on assignment or unavailable. On May 1, 2011, Stephanopoulos broke into regular programming at approximately 10:15  p.m. to provide coverage of a special U.S. presidential address, which ended up being that Osama Bin Laden had been killed. He hosted coverage along with Christiane Amanpour, David Muir and Brian Ross through 1:00  a.m. [ Criticism ] Stephanopoulos was quoted in a January 27, 2009, article &quot; Power, Politics, Gossip on a Daily Call &quot; by John F. Harris in The Politico. The article was about a daily call Stephanopoulos participates in with his friends Carville, Rahm Emanuel, and Paul Begala. Harris describes the call as &quot; a street-corner bull session between four old friends who suddenly find themselves standing once more at the busiest intersection of politics and media in Washington. &quot; { Harris, John F. (January 27, 2009). &quot; Power, Politics, Gossip on Daily Call &quot;. } { The Politico. Retrieved December 19, 2009. } In the article, Stephanopoulos says he does not surrender his reputation as an independent journalist during the daily information-sharing calls. &quot; We are all good friends, &quot; Stephanopoulos is quoted as saying. &quot; We just like talking to each other, and I learn a lot from it... and that&apos;s why we have been doing it for so long. &quot; After the article ran, conservative media critic Brent Bozell and some conservative bloggers launched a campaign against Stephanopoulos: &quot; Will Stephanopoulos be critical of the White House’s plans when he spends every morning helping to craft them? Not likely. He must from this point forward recuse himself from any reporting involving the Obama administration, &quot; Bozell said in a press release. Conservatives deluged ABC with emails and calls on the topic. { Smith, Ben (January 30, 2009). &quot; George&apos;s Calls &quot; } { The Politico.

To my mind, he established his journalistic bona fides more than a decade ago, even as the Clinton administration was still underway, when he showed his willingness to report aggressively on Democrats as well as Republicans.&apos; &quot; [ Online ] During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Stephanopoulos launched a blog George&apos;s Bottom Line on the website of ABC News. { Sweet, Lynn (October 20, 2008). &quot; ABC&apos;s George Stephanopoulos Launches New Political Blog  – Welcome to the Neighborhood &quot;. } { Chicago Sun-Times.

Fox &apos;s character, Lewis Rothschild, in the film The American President (1995), written by Aaron Sorkin was modeled after Stephanopoulos. He was also used by Sorkin as the model for Rob Lowe &apos;s character, Sam Seaborn, on the television drama series The West Wing. Fox based his portrayal on Stephanopoulos as well.
