{ Romanino, &apos;&apos;Scene of a cat castration&apos;&apos;, 1531–32, } { Castello del Buonconsiglio, } { Trento } Neutering, from the Latin neuter (of neither sex { University of Notre Dame online Latin dictionary } ), is the removal of an animal&apos;s reproductive organ, either all of it or a considerably large part. The process is often used in reference to males whereas spaying is often reserved for females. Colloquially, both terms are often referred to as fixing. While technically called castration for males, in male horses, the process is referred to as gelding. Neutering is the most common sterilizing method in animals. In the United States, most humane societies, animal shelter s and rescue group s urge pet owners to have their pets spayed or neutered to prevent the births of unwanted litters, contributing to the overpopulation of unwanted animals in the rescue system. [ Health and behavioral effects ] [ Advantages ] Besides being a birth control method, and being convenient to many owners, neutering/spaying has the following health benefits: [ Morrison, Wallace B. Cancer in Dogs and Cats (1st ed.)

This is especially significant in male cats due to the extreme undesirability of male cat sexual behavior for many pet owners. Prevention of mammary tumor s : Female cats and dogs are about seven times less likely to develop mammary tumors if they are spayed before their first heat cycle. Mammary neoplasia, or breast cancer, is a very common disorder of female dogs, with a reported incidence of 3.4%. Of female dogs with mammary tumors, 50.9% have malignant tumors. Female dogs that have been spayed before their first heat have a lifetime chance of developing mammary tumors of about 99.5% less than that of intact females. If allowed to go through their first heat before spaying, then their risk is close to 92% less. Also, spaying female dogs more than two years before the removal of mammary tumors increases the dog&apos;s survival odds by 45%. Without its ability to reproduce, a female animal effectively has a zero risk of pregnancy complications, such as spotting and false pregnancies, the latter of which can occur in more than 50% of unspayed female dogs.

These risks are relatively low in routine spaying and neutering; however, they may be increased for some animals due to other pre-existing health factors. In one study the risk of anesthetic-related death (not limited to neutering procedures) was estimated at 0.05% for healthy dogs and 0.11% for healthy cats. The risk for sick dogs and cats were 1.33% and 1.40% respectively. Spaying and neutering cats may increase the risk of obesity. In cats, a decrease in sex hormone levels seems to be associated with an increase in food intake. In dogs, the effects of neutering as a risk factor for obesity vary between breeds. Neutered dogs of both sexes are at a twofold excess risk to develop osteosarcoma as compared to intact dogs. The risk of osteosarcoma increases with increasing breed size and especially height. Studies of cardiac tumors in dogs showed that there was a 5 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma, one of the three most common cancers in dogs, in spayed females than intact females and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in neutered dogs as compared to intact males. Spaying and neutering is associated with an increase in urinary tract cancers in dogs. Neutered dogs of both sexes have a 27% to 38% increased risk of adverse reactions to vaccinations. The incidence of adverse reactions for neutered and intact dogs combined is 0.32%. Neutered dogs have also been known to develop hormone-responsive alopecia (hair loss). A 2004 study found that spayed and neutered dogs had a higher incidence of CCL rupture, a form of ACL injury. Slauterbeck JR, Pankratz K, Xu KT, Bozeman SC, Hardy DM.

The evidence is most conclusive for Bouviers. In a study of 29 intact male dogs and 47 castrated males aged 11–14, the neutered males were significantly more likely to progress from one geriatric cognitive impairment condition (out of the four conditions – disorientation in the house or outdoors, changes in social interactions with human family members, loss of house training, and changes in the sleep-wake cycle) to two or more conditions. Testosterone in intact males is thought to slow the progression of cognitive impairment, at least in dogs that already have mild impairment. As compared to intact males, male neutered cats are at an increased risk for certain problems associated with feline lower urinary tract disease, including the presence of stone s or a plug in the urethra and urethral blockage. Neutering also has been associated with an increased likelihood of urethral sphincter incontinence in males. Aaron A, Eggleton K, Power C, Holt PE.

Alternatively, it is also possible to remove only the ovaries ( oophorectomy ), which is mainly done in cats and young dogs. Spaying is performed commonly on household pets (such as cat s and dog s ), as a method of birth control. It is performed less commonly on livestock, as a method of birth control or for other reasons. In mare s, these other reasons include behavior modification. [ Hooper RN, Taylor TS, Varner DD, Blanchard TL Effects of bilateral ovariectomy via colpotomy in mares: 23 cases (1984–1990) J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 203 7 1043–6 1993 October 8226251 ] Surgical incision site of a female cat The surgery can be performed using a traditional open approach or by laparoscopic &quot; keyhole &quot; surgery. Open surgery is more widely available as laparoscopic surgical equipment costs are expensive. Traditional open surgery is usually performed through a ventral midline incision below the umbilicus. The incision size varies depending upon the surgeon and the size of the animal. The uterine horns are identified and the ovaries are found by following the horns to their ends. There is a ligament that attaches the ovaries to the 13th rib which may need to be broken so the ovaries can be identified. The ovarian arteries are then ligated with resorbable suture material and then the arteries transected. The uterine body (which is very short in litter bearing species) and related arteries are also tied off just in front of the cervix (leaving the cervix as a natural barrier). The entire uterus and ovaries are then removed. The abdomen is checked for bleeding and then closed with a 3 layer closure. The linea alba and then the subcutaneous layer are closed with resorbable suture material. The skin is then stapled, sutured, or glued closed. Laparoscopic surgery is performed using a camera and instruments placed through small incisions (ports) in the body wall. The patient is under anaesthesia and lying on their back. The incisions are between 5mm and 10mm and the number varies according the equipment and technique used. The surgeon watches on a screen during the operation. The first port is made just behind the umbilicus and the camera inserted. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to create a space to operate in. A second port is introduced a few centimeters in front of the navel and a long grasping instrument called a Babcock forceps is inserted. The surgeon finds the ovary with the instrument and uses it to suspend the ovary from a needle placed through the abdominal wall. This lifts the ovary and uterus safely away from other organs. The surgeon then removes the grasping instrument and replaces it with an instrument that cauterizes and cuts tissue. This instrument uses electricity to heat the blood vessels to seal them and to cut them. No sutures are placed inside. The ovary is separated from the uterus and round ligament. The cautery instrument is removed and replaced by the grasping instrument which is used to pull the ovary out through the small abdominal incision (port). This is repeated on the other side and the small holes are closed with a few sutures. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery are less pain, faster recovery, smaller wounds to heal. A study has shown that patients are 70% more active in the first three days post surgery compared to open surgery. The reason open surgery is more painful is that larger incisions are required, and the ovary needs to be pulled out of the body which stretches and tears tissue in the abdomen (it is not uncommon for patients to react under anaesthesia by breathing faster at this point). Spaying in female dogs removes the production of progesterone, which is a natural calming hormone and a serotonin uplifter. Spaying may therefore escalate any observable aggressive behaviour, either to humans or other dogs. The risk of infections, bleeding, ruptures, inflammation and even reactions to the drugs given to the animal as part of the procedure are all possibilities that should be considered. [ Males (castration) ] In male animals, castration involves the removal of the testes, and is commonly practiced on both household pets (for birth control and behaviour modification) and on livestock (for birth control, as well as to improve commercial value).

It is used mainly in animal sheltering and rescue where puppies and kittens can be neutered before being adopted out, eliminating non-compliance with sterilisation agreement, which is typically above 40%.

Two studies showed an increased risk of canine parvovirus infection, which one of the study attributed to the increased susceptibility of young dogs rather than long term immune suppression. In terms of behavior in dogs, separation anxiety, aggression, escape behavior and inappropriate elimination are reduced while noise phobia and sexual behavior was increased. In males with aggression issues, earlier neutering may increase barking. In cats, asthma, gingivitis, and hyperactivity were decreased, while shyness was increased.
