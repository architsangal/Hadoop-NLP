[ September 2011 ] [ http://www.webcitation.org/5lRyCSu4c Parish Population Statistics for Sedgemoor ONS Census 2001 Somerset County Council 17 December 2009 ] { Sedgemoor } { Somerset } { South West England } { Wells } { AXBRIDGE } { BS26 } { BS } { 01934 } { ST431545 } Axbridge is a town in Somerset, England, situated in the Sedgemoor district on the River Axe, near the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The town population according to the 2001 census was 2,024. [ History ] Axanbrcyg is suggested as the source of the name, meaning a bridge over the River Axe, in the early 9th century. [ Room Adrian Dictionary of Place Names in the British Isles 1988 Bloombury London 0-7475-0170-X ] Early inhabitants of the area almost certainly include the Romans (who are known to have mined lead on the top of the Mendips) and earlier still, prehistoric man, (who lived in the local caves) whose flint tools have been found on the slopes of the local hills. The history of Axbridge can be traced back to the reign of King Alfred when it was part of the Saxons &apos; defence system for Wessex against the Vikings. In the Burghal Hidage, a list of burbs compiled in 910 it was listed as Axanbrycg.

Axbridge grew in the Tudor period as a centre for cloth manufacture, This was reflected in its early royal charters allowing it to hold markets, fairs and become a royal borough. It even had its own mint, with coins showing the town&apos;s symbol: the Lamb and Flag. [ Axbridge visitors information http://www.axbridge-tc.gov.uk/visitor/index.html 25 August 2006 ] Trade was possible as the River Axe was navigable to wharves at Axbridge. [ Toulson Shirley The Mendip Hills: A Threatened Landscape 1984 Victor Gollancz London 0-575-03453-X ] Later the town&apos;s importance declined which led to stagnation and the preservation of many historic buildings in the town centre. These include King John&apos;s Hunting Lodge (actually a Tudor building) which is now used as a museum. Axbridge is a very old borough and sent members to parliament in the reigns of Edward I and Edward III.

[ Governance ] The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council&apos;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. Each year members of the town council elect a mayor for the town.

Sedding, who contributed the fine parclose screens. [ Village or town? ] In contrast to the much larger settlement of Cheddar immediately to the south east that remains a village, Axbridge is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places in historic times. While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacture in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed dairy-farming village until the advent of tourism and the arrival of the railway in the Victorian era. This situation is unlikely to change in the near future, with the residents of both Axbridge and Cheddar proud of their settlement&apos;s respective status and the inevitable friendly local rivalry between the two. [ Workhouse ] The Axbridge Union workhouse was erected in 1837 at the south side of West Street in Axbridge. The Poor Law Commissioners authorised an expenditure of £4,496.17s.6d on construction of the building which was intended to accommodate 250 inmates. It was designed by Samuel T Welch who was also the architect of workhouses at Wells and Clifton. By 1929 the workhouse had become officially known as Axbridge Poor Law Institution.
