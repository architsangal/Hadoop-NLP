[ one of the Greek mythological figures, the wife of Ceyx ] { Herbert James Draper, &apos;&apos;Halcyone&apos;&apos;, 1915. } { Parlington Hall, Aberford, removed to Lotherton Hall sometime after 1905. } In Greek mythology, Alcyone ( [ grc Ἁλκυόνη ], Halkyónē) was the daughter of Aeolus, either by Enarete or Aegiale. She married Ceyx, son of Eosphorus, the Morning Star. They were very happy together in Trachis, and according to Pseudo-Apollodorus&apos;s account, often sacrilegiously called each other &quot; Zeus &quot; and &quot; Hera &quot;. { Hesiod, } { Catalogue of Women fr. 15; } { Apollodorus i. 7. 3 - 4 ) } This angered Zeus, so while Ceyx was at sea (going to consult an oracle according to Ovid&apos;s account), the god threw a thunderbolt at his ship. Soon after, Morpheus (God of Dreams) disguised as Ceyx appeared to Alcyone as an apparition to tell her of his fate, and she threw herself into the sea in her grief. Out of compassion, the gods changed them both into halcyon bird s, named after her. Ovid { Ovid } { Metamorphoses XI, 410ff.-748 (also here ) } and Hyginus { Hyginus Fabulae 65 } both also recount the metamorphosis of the pair in and after Ceyx&apos;s loss in a terrible storm, though they both omit Ceyx and Alcyone calling each other Zeus and Hera (and Zeus&apos;s resulting anger) as a reason for it. Ovid also adds the detail of her seeing his body washed up onshore before her attempted suicide. Ovid and Hyginus both also make the metamorphosis the origin of the etymology for &quot; halcyon days, &quot; the seven days in winter when storms never occur. They state that these were originally the seven days each year (either side of the shortest day of the year ) during which Alcyone (as a kingfisher ) laid her eggs and made her nest on the beach and during which her father Aeolus, god of the winds, restrained the winds and calmed the waves so she could do so in safety. The phrase has since become a term used to describe a peaceful time generally. Its proper meaning, however, is that of a lucky break, or a bright interval set in the midst of adversity; just as the days of calm and mild weather are set in the height of winter for the sake of the kingfishers&apos; egglaying. The myth is also briefly referred to by Virgil, again without reference to Zeus&apos;s anger. { Virgil } { Georgics i. 399 - &quot; [At that time] not to the sun&apos;s warmth then upon the shore / Do halcyons dear to } { Thetis ope their wings &quot; } [ Legacy ] The genus Ceyx (within the River kingfishers family ) is named after him The kingfisher family Halcyonidae ( Tree Kingfisher s ) is named after his wife, as is the genus Halcyon. The Belted Kingfisher &apos;s Latin species name (Megaceryle alcyon) also references her name. { Their story features in } { The Book of the Duchess. } { Their story is the basis for the opera } { Alcyone by the French composer } { Marin Marais } { A collection of Canada&apos;s celebrated nature poet, } { Archibald Lampman, Alcyone, his final set of poetry published posthumously in 1899, highlights both Lampman&apos;s apocalyptic and utopian visions of the future. } { TS Eliot draws from this myth in } { The Dry Salvages : &quot; And the ragged rock in the restless waters,/Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;/On a } { halcyon day it is merely a monument,/In navigable weather it is always a seamark/To lay a course by: but in the sombre season/Or the sudden fury, is what it always was. &quot; } [ Classical sources ] [ Other sources ] [ Ceyx and Alcyone ] { Category:Greek mythology } Category:Women in Greek mythology Category:Shapeshifting Category:Aeolides ca:Alcíone (filla d&apos;Èol) cs:Alkyoné de:Alkyone (Trachis) el:Αλκυόνη (μυθολογία) es:Alcíone eo:Alkiono gl:Alcione id:Halkione it:Alcione (mitologia) ka:ალკიონე lt:Alkionė nl:Alkyone ja:アルキュオネー pl:Alkione (córka Eola) pt:Alcíone ru:Алкиона (дочь Эола) sk:Alkyoné (dcéra Aiola) sl:Alkione fi:Alkyone th:อัลซิโอเน่
