{ Hindi } Bandini ( Hindi : बन्दिनी, Urdu : بندِنی, translation : Imprisoned) is a 1963 Hindi film directed and produced by Bimal Roy, the man who directed classics like Do Bigha Zameen and Devdas. Bandini stars Nutan giving one of her career&apos;s finest performances, along with Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra as leads, and explores the human conflicts of love and hate intertwined in the mind of Kalyani ( Nutan ). The movie tells the story of Kalyani, the all suffering, selfless, sacrificing, and strong yet weak Indian woman. She must make a choice between two very different men, Devendra (Dharmendra), the loving prison doctor, and Bikash (Ashok Kumar), a man from her past. { Nutan Encyclopaedia of Hindi cinema, by Gulzar, Govind Nihalani, Saibal Chatterjee (Encyclopaedia Britannica (India)).

Bandini was the tenth highest grosser of the year and was declared a &apos;Semi Hit&apos; at the Indian Box Office, { Box Office 1963 Box Office India. } though it received not just critical acclaim but also sweeped that year&apos;s Filmfare Award s, winning six awards in all including the top awards of Best Film and Best Director, as well as Best Actress, and is still considered a landmark movie of the 1960s, especially being last directorial venture of Bimal Roy, a master of realism.

It is also the only film to have depicted the sacrifice made by ordinary rural women during the Indian independence struggle. [ Cinema and the Indian freedom struggle: covering the subcontinent Gautam Kaul Sterling Publishers 1998 81-207-2116-0 64 ] This was Bimal Roy&apos;s final feature as a director, and regarded by many as his crowning achievement. After casting her, in his previous women-centric film, Sujata (1959), now the key laid in persuading Nutan out of her post-nuptial retirement to play the strictly raised, poetry-loving village girl, Kalyani. Nutan is strongly supported by Ashok Kumar and Dharmendra, just beginning to make an impact in the film industry and directed by award winning director Bimal Roy, who ventures into the life of a convict and reveals his/her humanity and the circumstances that often force an ordinary person to commit a crime. This deep social concern is however conveyed subtly without being didactic, through the predicament of the main protagonist, Kalyani lodged in the prison through majority of the film and her longing for freedom. The film also highlights the spirit of sacrifice in the youth during the freedom struggle when a youth would even sacrifice his future wife, at his party&apos;s command. Despite having a dramatic turn of events throughout the film, the melodrama never overpowers the narrative, the pace remains engrossing yet easy, and cinematography highlights the stillness and vacuum of a prison life. Nutan remains understated through the film, and the director employs irony and symbolism throughout the film to make his statement instead. { Bandini Review planetbollywood. } The lead female role was offered to one of Roy&apos;s favorite actress Vyjayanthimala who earlier worked with Roy in Devdas and Madhumati.

Jyoti Sharma DailyPost.com 24 Mar 2012 ] S D Burman composed the songs for the film, at the height of his musical career and even chose to sing one himself, &apos;O Re Majhi&apos;. The movie has songs such as &quot; Mora Gora Ang Lai Le &quot; by Lata and the haunting and brilliant &quot; O Jaanewale Ho Sake To Laut Ke Aana &quot; by Mukesh. The film is brilliantly photographed in Black and white by Kamal Bose with its rich tonal quality and evocative framing, especially in the stark prison scenes, winning him the Filmfare Award for the year. [ Plot ] Kalyani is in a prison in pre-Independence India for committing a murder, and we learn the circumstances of her crime in flashback as she divulges it to the jailor. The film is set in Bengal in the 1930s, during the British Raj, where Kalyani ( Nutan ) is the daughter of the postmaster (Raja Paranjpe) of the village, who falls in love with a freedom fighter, Bikash ( Ashok Kumar ), who later leaves her in the village promising to come back but never does. The society treats them harshly. Broken by her father&apos;s misery and that of her own, Kalyani moves to the city, to the singing of the &quot; O Jaanewale Ho Sake To Laut Ke Aana &quot;. In the city she works as a caretaker of an obnoxious and mentally unstable woman, who turns out to be the wife of Bikash. Kalyani learns that her father came to the city looking for her and died in an accident. That prompts her to poison her lover&apos;s wife, identifying her as the cause of her miseries in a moment of insane rage. Director Bimalda captures her emotions as she resolves to commit the crime, with light and darkness falling on her face due to a welder&apos;s torch and the thumping of Iron in the background, and the ambient sounds as she inches towards the decision, pumping vigorously into a kerosene stove, without uttering a single word through it all. And subsequently confesses to the crime with equal passion. Back from the flashback in the jail Deven ( Dharmendra ) the jail doctor falls in love with her. Kalyani is not ready for it and starts to stay away from him. They are always shown with a partition in between after Deven proposes her. Another symbolism used in the movie is the occasional shouting of &quot; All is well &quot; by the prison guard when nothing in the movie is; and just as Kalyani is leaving prison for good, she receives yet another ironic message from a jail official, “Ab ghar grihasthi ki jail mein qaid rahogi!” Now you will be imprisoned in the jail of household! In the end she finds Bikash at a ship harbour where she finds him in an ill condition. She then decides to take care of Bikash and her love is again reborn. The lines &quot; Main Bandini Piya ki, Main Sangini Hoon Saajan ki &quot; in the end score of the movie tells us that Kalyani is imprisoned by her love, thus revealing the title of the film. &quot; Mere saajan hain us paar &quot; is sung by the musician S D Burman himself, this climactic song, beautifully expresses Kalyani&apos;s dilemma of having to choose between Bikash and Deven. Thus the character of Kalyani gets lifted from that of a woman who is a prisoner of destiny to one who defines her own freedom. { Story synopsis } { Bandini: Bandini, Bimal Roy&apos;s ode to purity Let&apos;s talk about Bollywood!. } [ Cast ] Ashok Kumar - Bikash Ghosh Nutan Behl - Kalyani Dharmendra - Devendra (Prison Doctor) Raja Paranjpe - Kalyani&apos;s Father Tarun Bose - Mahesh Chandra Asit Sen - Shambu Chandrima Bhaduri Moni Chatterjee - Inspector Raj Verma Satyendra Kapoor [ Crew ] Assistant director: Mukul Dutt, Gulzar, Raghunath Jhalani, Debabrata Sengupta Art Direction: Sudhendu Roy Set Decoration: Shanker Kurade Sound recordist: Dinshaw Billimoria Music assistant: Rahul Dev Burman Costumes: Kishan B Damania [ Music ] [ Bandini Soundtrack S.D.
