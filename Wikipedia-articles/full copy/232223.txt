[ Deuteronomy 6:9 HE ] { and } [ Deuteronomy 11:20 HE ] { Shabbat 32a, Yoma 11a, Menachot 33a, } { Menachot 3:7 } { Tefillin, Mezuzah, veSefer Torah ch 5-6 } { Yoreh De&apos;ah 285-291 } A mezuzah ( [ מְזוּזָה ] &quot; doorpost &quot;; plural: מְזוּזוֹת mezuzot) is a piece of parchment (often contained in a decorative case) inscribed with specified Hebrew verses from the Torah ( [ Deuteronomy 6:4-9 HE ] and [ Deuteronomy 11:13-21 HE ] ). These verses comprise the Jewish prayer &quot; Shema Yisrael &quot;, beginning with the phrase: &quot; Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is One &quot; A mezuzah is affixed to the doorframe in Jewish homes to fulfill the mitzvah (Biblical commandment) to inscribe the words of the Shema &quot; on the doorposts of your house &quot; ( [ Deuteronomy 6:9 HE ] ). Some interpret Jewish law to require a mezuzah on every doorway in the home apart from bathrooms, and closets too small to qualify as rooms. [ http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID%3D225406 Which Rooms Require a Mezuzah? Dovid Zaklikowski ] The parchment is prepared by a qualified scribe (a &quot; sofer stam &quot; ) who has undergone many years of meticulous training, and the verses are written in black indelible ink with a special quill pen. The parchment is then rolled up and placed inside the case. [ Affixing the mezuzah ] According to halakha, the mezuzah should be placed on the right side of the door or doorpost, in the upper third of the doorpost (i.e., approximately shoulder height), { Beit Yosef YD 289; and see Nekudot Hakesef ad loc } within approximately [ 3 in cm 0 ] of the doorway opening. [ December 2008 ] Care should be taken to not tear or damage the parchment or the wording on it, as this will invalidate the mezuzah, which is considered Torah. Generally, halakha requires that mezuzot be affixed within 30 days of moving into a rented house or apartment. This applies to Jews living in the Diaspora (i.e., outside of the Land of Israel ). For a purchased home or apartment in the Diaspora, or a residence in Israel (owned or rented), the mezuzah is affixed immediately upon moving in. The reason for this difference is that there is an assumption that when a Jew lives in Israel, Israel shall remain his/her permanent residence, whereas a home in the diaspora is temporary. Mezuzah affixed to a door frame on South Street in Philadelphia. Where the doorway is wide enough, Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah so that the top slants toward the room into which the door opens. This is done to accommodate the variant opinions of the medieval Rabbi s Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam as to whether it should be placed horizontally or vertically, and also to imply that God and the Torah (which the mezuzah symbolizes) are entering the room. Most Sephardi, Mizrahi and other non-Ashkenazi Jews affix the mezuzah vertically, [ http://ohr.edu/ask/ask059.htm Mezuzah - Which Way is UP?? ] though Spanish and Portuguese Jews living in countries where the majority of Jews are Ashkenazim usually place it slanting. The procedure is to hold the mezuzah against the spot upon which it will be affixed, then recite a blessing: [ בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יי אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשַׁנוּ בְּמִצְו‌ֹתָיו וְצִוָּנוּ לִקְבּוֹעַ מְזוּזָה ] Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu melekh ha‘olam, asher kideshanu bemitzvotav vetzivanu likboa‘ mezuzah. &lt; /b &gt; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His mitzvot, and commanded us to affix a mezuzah. Any Jew can recite the blessing provided he or she is old enough to understand the significance of the mitzvah. After the blessing, the mezuzah is attached. When affixing several mezuzot, it is sufficient to recite the blessing once, before affixing the first one. [ Checking the parchment ] Many observant Jews from all Jewish denominations have a qualified scribe check the mezuzot parchments for defects (such as small tears or faded lettering) at least twice every seven years. { Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 11a } { Shulchan Aruch (291:1) } [ Mezuzah cases ] A metal mezuzah case. { marquetry mezuzah case. } The commandment to affix a mezuzah is widely followed in the Jewish world, even by Jews who are not religiously observant. While the important part of the mezuzah is the klaf, or parchment, and not the case itself, designing and producing mezuzah cases has been elevated to an art form over the ages. Mezuzah cases are produced from a wide variety of materials, from silver and precious metals, to wood, stone, ceramics, pewter, and even polymer clay. Some dealers of mezuzah cases will provide or offer for sale a copy of the text that has been photocopied onto paper; this is not a Kosher (valid) mezuzah, which must be handwritten onto a piece of parchment by a qualified scribe. [ Additional inscriptions ] It is very customary to write two inscriptions on the back of the parchment: [ שדי ] [ &quot; כוזו במוכסז כוזו &quot; ] the Hebrew word (Shaddai) the phrase Shaddai, one of the biblical names of God, also serves here as an acronym for Shomer Daltot Yisrael, &quot; Guardian of Israel&apos;s doors &quot;. Many mezuzah cases are also marked with the Hebrew letter ש (Shin), for Shaddai. [ &quot; כוזו במוכסז כוזו &quot; ] is a Caesar cipher — a one letter shift — of the third, fourth, and fifth words of the Shema, &quot; Adonai, Eloheinu, Adonai &quot;, &quot; The Lord, our God, the Lord &quot;; it is written on the back of the case, opposite the corresponding words on the front. { Alexander Poltorak The Mysterious Name } This inscription dates from the 11th century and is found amongst the &apos;&apos;Hasidei Ashkenaz&apos;&apos; (medieval German Jewish mystics). According to the Sephardic custom ( minhag ), the phrase [ &quot; כוזו במוכסז כוזו &quot; ] is prohibited, and only the Hebrew word [ שדי ] (Shaddai) is to be written on the back of the mezuzah. This practice is supported by the Shulchan Aruch and the writings of the Rambam. The Ashkenazi custom of writing both phrases, however, was supported in the writings of the Remo. [ April 2009 ] [ Legal battles in the U.S. ] The widely-popular Jewish practice of affixing a mezuzah to the entranceway of a residential unit { In 1993, 98 percent of Israelis placed a mezuzah on at least the front door to their dwelling, making it the “commandment most widely observed” ( } { Jerusalem Post, December 20, 1993); a 1999 survey in Florida found that in Palm Beach County 89 percent of Jewish residents affix a mezuzah on a doorpost and 87 percent attend a seder ( } { Jewish Telegraphic Agency, December 15, 1999). } has been rarely challenged in the United States or Canada, { Toronto: League for Human Rights of B’nai Brith Canada, 2000 Annual Audit of Antisemtic Incidents (Ontario Report); Connecticut: Doft v. Washington Mews Condominium Association (2003). } and there was until recently no case law precedent on the subject. [ Illinois ] In Chicago in 2001, the condominium association at the 378-unit Shoreline Towers adopted a rule banning “mats, boots, shoes, carts or objects of any sort… outside unit entrance doors”, { “Condo revises mezuzah rule,” Chicago Jewish Star, September 16, 2005, p. 1. } which by board vote in 2004 was interpreted to be absolute. { Douglas Wertheimer, “Not On Our Doorposts: Chicago condo bans mezuzahs,” Chicago Jewish Star, July 15, 2005, p. 2. } Relying on the Association rule, during 2004 Shoreline Towers management removed the hallway mezuzot of condominium tenants, resulting in letters from Jewish groups which unsuccessfully protested the rule. Complaints by Shoreline Towers tenants were subsequently filed with the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, Illinois Attorney General, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging housing discrimination on the basis of religion { “More mezuzah bans,” Chicago Jewish Star, August 5, 2005, p. 2. } and seeking damages. Meanwhile, a newspaper report indicated that Shoreline Towers was not the sole condominium association in Chicago with such a restriction, although one of them soon agreed to modify its rule. { “Ordinance to stop ban on mezuzahs; one condo concedes,” Chicago Jewish Star, August 19, 2005, p. 1. } On reading a news report of the mezuzah dispute at Shoreline Towers, Chicago alderman Burton Natarus, like other Jewish observers of the development, { Howard Dakoff, “Why I Opposed the Mezuzah Ban,” Chicago Jewish Star, November 4, 2005, p. 4. } was upset by the ban. He sat down and drafted an amendment to the city’s Municipal Code which made it illegal for a renter or owner of an apartment, house, or condo to be prohibited from &quot; placing or affixing a religious sign, symbol or relic on the door, door post or entrance. &quot; { Municipal Code of Chicago, Unfair Housing Practices (5-8-030/h); Mark Fitzgerald, “Mezuzah muckraking gains legal huzzahs,” } { Editor &amp; Publisher, October 2005, p. 13; “Chicago Law Inspired by ‘Jewish Star’ Articles May Go State-wide,” Editor &amp; Publisher, January 26, 2006. } Although there was opposition to such a move, { Editorial, “Give peacemaking a chance,” } { Chicago Sun-Times, September 2, 2005. } it became law in Chicago that December. { Gary Washburn, “Ethics class eyed for city workers,” } { Chicago Tribune, December 14, 2005. } The first such legislation in North America, it included a maximum $500 fine for its violation. Notwithstanding this legislation, court action continued concerning separate complaints against Shoreline Towers for its rule affecting mezuzot. In 2006, a federal court judge determined that the condominium association’s rule did not violate the Federal Fair Housing Act; { Ruth Eglash, “The case of the confiscated mezuzah,” Jerusalem Post, June 8, 2006; Editorial, “Judge: Jews Not Welcome,” Chicago Jewish Star, September 8, 2006, p. 4. } the district court upheld the opinion on appeal in 2008; { Josh Gerstein, “Court: No Federal Right to Mezuzot at Condominiums,” } { New York Sun, July 11–13, 2008, p.4; Dan Slater, “Mezuzah Suit Sparks Ruckus, Impassioned 7th Cir.

Meanwhile during the dispute, records of the Chicago Jewish Star (which had been reporting on the case) were unsuccessfully subpoenaed, { ”Jewish Star objects to subpoena,” Chicago Jewish Star, July 27, 2007, p. 1. } and for the first time Illinois’ anti- SLAPP legislation was applied. { Debbie L.

In 2006, a woman in a 16-story condo building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was instructed to remove the mezuzah from her hallway unit and threatened with a fine. After a lengthy legal battle, the condo association was found guilty of discrimination. In 2008, House Bill 995, an amendment to the Florida Condominium Act modeled on the Illinois state legislation, became law. { Joe Kollin, ”Lauderdale condo bans religious symbol on doorposts,” } { South Florida Sun-Sentinel, February 3, 2007; “Florida condo bans mezuzahs,” Chicago Jewish Star, February 9, 2007; “Florida mezuzah ban ends,” Chicago Jewish Star, April 20, 2007; Steve Lipman, “Mezuzah Standoff in Ft.

Subsequently the couple turned to Texas House of Representatives member Garnet F. Coleman. His bill introduced in 2009 was not adopted, but in June 2011 a slightly revised version (HB1278) was signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry. { ”Texas gets a mezuzah law,” Chicago Jewish Star, May 27, 2011, p. 1; Kate Shellnutt, “New Texas law defends residents’ religious displays,” } { Houston Chronicle, June 20, 2011; “Perry signs mezuzah bill,” Chicago Jewish Star, June 24, 2011, p. 1; Texas House of Representatives, HB 1278. } [ Nationwide ] A federal law to prevent mezuzah bans nationwide was proposed in 2008 by U.S. Congressman Jerrold Nadler (H.R. 6932). It never became law. { New York Sun, September 19–21, 2008, p. 4; “Congress to trump court on mezuzah issue,” Chicago Jewish Star, September 26, 2008, p. 1; Chicago Jewish Star, April 3, 2009, p. 13; H.R. 6932: Freedom of Religious Expression in the Home Act of 2008. } [ References ] [ Bibliography ] [ http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID%3D310306 A Light unto My Path: A Mezuzah Anthology Alexander Poltorak ] [ http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID%3D224708 Mezuzah Handbook Dovid Zaklikowski ] [ http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/mezuzah.htm Internet Encyclopaedia of Religion ] { Category:Doors } Category:Jewish ritual objects Category:Hebrew words and phrases Category:Hebrew calligraphy * cs:Mezuza da:Mezuzah de:Mesusa es:Mezuzá fr:Mezouzah it:Mezuzah he:מזוזה lad:Mezuzá lt:Mezuza hu:Mezuza nl:Mezoeza ja:メズーザー no:Mezuza oc:Mezozà pl:Mezuza pt:Mezuzá ru:Мезуза sk:Mezuza sr:Mezuza fi:Mezuza sv:Mezuza tl:Mesusa tr:Mezuza yi:מזוזה
