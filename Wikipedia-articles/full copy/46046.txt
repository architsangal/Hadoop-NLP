[ psychedelics psychedelic drug ] [ article April 2009 ] [ Psychedelia ] [ Psychedelia ] The term psychedelic is derived from the Ancient Greek words psuchē (ψυχή - psyche, &quot; soul &quot; ) and dēlōsē (δήλωση - &quot; manifest &quot; ), translating to &quot; soul-manifesting &quot;. A psychedelic experience is characterized by the striking perception of aspects of one&apos;s mind previously unknown, or by the creative exuberance of the mind liberated from its ostensibly ordinary fetters. Psychedelic states are an array of experiences including changes of perception such as hallucination s, synesthesia, altered states of awareness or focused consciousness, variation in thought patterns, trance or hypnotic states, mystical states, and other mind alterations. These processes can lead some people to experience changes in mental operation defining their self identity (whether in momentary acuity or chronic development) different enough from their previous normal state that it can excite feelings of newly formed understanding ranging from revelation &amp; enlightenment to the opposing polarity of confusion &amp; psychosis. Psychedelic states may be elicited by various techniques, such as meditation, sensory stimulation { Psychedelic sensory stimulation exemplified by &quot; The Holotope Experience &quot; utilized by Bashar. Explained in YT video titled &quot; About The Holotope Experience &quot;. } or deprivation, and most commonly by the use of psychedelic substance s. When these psychoactive substances are used for religious, shamanic, or spiritual purposes, they are termed entheogens. [ Etymology ] The term was first coined as a noun in 1957 by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond as an alternative descriptor for hallucinogenic drug s in the context of psychedelic psychotherapy. { Nicholas Murray, Aldous Huxley: A Biography, 419. } Seeking a name for the experience induced by LSD, Osmond contacted Aldous Huxley, a personal acquaintance and advocate for the therapeutic use of the substance. Huxley coined the term &quot; phanerothyme, &quot; from the Greek terms for &quot; manifest &quot; (φανερός) and &quot; spirit &quot; (θυμός). In a letter to Osmond, he wrote: To make this mundane world sublime, Take half a gram of phanerothyme To which Osmond responded: To fathom Hell or soar angelic, Just take a pinch of psychedelic [ 381240 Humphry Osmond Janice Hopkins Tanne ] It was on this term that Osmond eventually settled, because it was &quot; clear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations. &quot; [ Douglas Martin Humphry Osmond, 86, Who Sought Medicinal Value in Psychedelic Drugs, Dies http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/us/humphry-osmond-86-who-sought-medicinal-value-in-psychedelic-drugs-dies.html?pagewanted%3D2 New York Times 2004-02-22 4 December 2010 ] [ History ] Timothy Leary was a well-known proponent of the use of psychedelics, as was Aldous Huxley. However, both advanced widely different opinions on the broad use of psychedelics by state and civil society. Leary promulgated the idea of such substances as a panacea, while Huxley suggested that only the cultural and intellectual elite should partake of entheogens systematically. The use of psychedelic drugs became widespread in the modern West in the mid-1960s. The movement is credited to Michael Hollingshed who arrived in America from London in 1965. He was sent to the U.S. by other members of the Psychedelic movement to get their ideas exposure.

In objection to this new meaning, and to what some [ June 2011 ] consider pejorative meanings of other synonyms such as &quot; hallucinogen &quot; and &quot; psychotomimetic &quot;, the term &quot; entheogen &quot; was proposed and is seeing increasing use. However, many consider the term &quot; entheogen &quot; best reserved for religious and spiritual usage, such as certain Native American churches do with the peyote sacrament, and &quot; psychedelic &quot; left to describe those who are using these drugs for recreation, psychotherapy, physical healing, or creative problem solving. In science, hallucinogen remains the standard term.

One example of this experimentation is seen in Mati Klarwein &apos;s painting Annunciation, which was used as the cover art for Santana &apos;s Abraxas. The cover of Pink Floyd &apos;s 1968 album A Saucerful of Secrets is also of this type. The cover of Oasis &apos; 2008 album, Dig Out Your Soul, also has a psychedelic album cover, with a slightly muted color scheme.

Psychedelic festivals have been described as &quot; temporary communities reproduced via personal and collective acts of transgression...through the routine expenditure of excess energy, and through self-sacrifice in acts of abandonment involving ecstatic dancing often fuelled by chemical cocktails. &quot; { St John, Graham. &quot; Neotrance and the Psychedelic Festival. &quot; Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture, Vol 1, No 1 (2009). Accessed on July 22, 2011. } These festivals often emphasize the ideals of peace, love, unity, and respect. Notable psychedelic festivals include the biennial Boom Festival in Portugal, as well as Nevada&apos;s Burning Man { Griffith, Martin. &quot; Psychedelic Festival to Attract 24,000 Fans. &quot; The Albany Herald, September 1, 2001. Accessed on July 22, 2011 from Google News Archive. } and California&apos;s Symbiosis Gathering in the United States. { Querner, Pascal. &quot; Capturing the Vision at California’s Symbiosis Festival. &quot; Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture, Vol 1, No 2 (2010). Accessed on July 22, 2011. } [ In music ] { Are you Experienced } [ Psychedelic music ] The fashion for psychedelic drugs gave its name to the style of psychedelia, a term describing a category of rock music known as psychedelic rock, as well as visual art, fashion, and culture that is associated originally with the high 1960s, hippie s, and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, California. { M. Campbell, Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on (Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), ISBN 0-495-50530-7, pp. 212-3. } One of the first uses of the word in the music scene of this time was in the 1964 recording of &quot; Hesitation Blues &quot; by folk group the Holy Modal Rounders. { M. Hicks, Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions (Chicago IL: University of Illinois Press, 2000), ISBN 0-252-06915-3, pp. 59-60. } The term was introduced to rock music and popularized by the 13th Floor Elevators 1966 album The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. Psychedelia truly took off in 1967 with the Summer of Love and, although associated with San Francisco, the style soon spread across the US, and worldwide. { V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1322-3. } The counterculture of the 1960s had a strong influence on the popular culture of the early 1970s. It later became linked to a style of electronic dance music commonly known as psychedelic trance. [ See also ] [ 3 ] Entheogen God in a Pill?
