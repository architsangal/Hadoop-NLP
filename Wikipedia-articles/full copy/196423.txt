[ October 2008 October 2008 October 2008 ] Dennis Bernstein is an American producer and co-host of the radio news program, Flashpoints Radio on Pacifica Radio. [ April 2012 ] Flashpoints originates from Pacifica Radio&apos;s flagship radio station, KPFA, listener-sponsored, noncommercial FM radio that is also carried on the Internet. [ Stopping the sale of two radio stations ] Bernstein was arrested on July 13, 1999 after airing a report on Flashpoints revealing that a new board had been considering the sale of KPFA and Pacifica&apos;s sister station WBAI in New York City. Four hours after the broadcast, and after a talk with then Berkeley Chief of Police, Butler Yeats, Bernstein was arrested. It is unclear what Bernstein was charged with and what was the outcome of that case. Cynthia Cotts, the media reporter at the Village Voice described the dispute with Mary Frances Berry who then chaired the Pacifica national board.
