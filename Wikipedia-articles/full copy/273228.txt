[ September 2009 ] [ August 2010 ] [ August 2010 ] [ González Márquez ] [ 1942 3 5 y ] { Seville, } { Spain } { Spanish Socialist Workers&apos; Party } { María del Carmen Julia Romero y López } { 3 } { University of Seville } { Signature of Felipe González.png } Felipe González Márquez (born 5 March 1942) is a Spanish socialist politician. He was the General Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Workers&apos; Party (PSOE) from 1974 to 1997. To date, he remains the longest-serving Prime Minister of Spain, after having served four successive mandates from 1982 to 1996. [ Early life ] Felipe was born in Seville, son of a farmer who had a small dairy. He has a sister named Lola González y Márquez, married to Francisco Germán Palomino y Romera, by whom she has two sons, Felipe and Germán Palomino y González. { Felipe González Marquez – GeneAll.net } He studied Law at Seville University and started his career as attorney specialising in labour. While at the University he met members of the socialist trade union Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) that was clandestine at the time. He also contacted members of the PSOE and started taking part in the party&apos;s clandestine activity. During that time he adopted the nom de guerre Isidoro and moved to Madrid. He was elected Secretary General of the Party at the Suresnes Congress, in France. When Franco died, González became the prominent head of the opposing movement to the remnants of the dictatorship, and was capital, along with then serving prime minister Adolfo Suárez, in the Spanish transition to democracy. During the Suárez government, General and vice president Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado asked González to not raise the debate of the Civil War and Franquism repression until the death of those of his generation. { González, Felipe and } { Cebrián, Juan Luis (2001) El futuro no es lo que era } { Luis Díez (2010) Las listas de los esclavos del franquismo, published in } { Cuarto Poder, 10.3.2010 } In the first democratic general election after Franco&apos;s death, held in 1977, the PSOE became the second most voted party, and this served González to appear as a young, active and promising leader. However, he did not win the 1979 election and had to wait for 1982 and the debacle of the UCD party to come into office. [ Prime minister ] In the 1982 general election held on 28 October 1982, the PSOE gained 48.3% of the vote and 202 deputies (out of 350). On 2 December González became the prime minister, with Alfonso Guerra as his deputy. His election was met with tremendous expectation of change amongst Spaniards. Under his government education was made universal and free until the age of 16, university education was expanded, the social security system was established and a partial legalisation of abortion became law for the first time, despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. González pushed for liberal reforms and a restructuring of the economy. On 23 February 1983, the Government passed a law nationalising Rumasa, a private business that included merchant banking interests, on the grounds that it was at the point of bankruptcy and the government needed to protect the savings of depositors and the jobs of its 60,000 employees, a decision that aroused considerable criticism and a judicial conflict over the law that was only resolved, in favour of the government, in December 1986. Having promised in the election to create 800,000 new jobs his government&apos;s restructuring of the steel industry actually resulted in job lay offs. When they tried to similarly tackle the debt problems in the dock industry in 1984 the dockers went on strike. The UGT, or Workers&apos; General Union, called a general strike on 20 June 1985 in protest against social security reforms. The same year his government began a massive privatisation both partial or full, of the 200 state owned companies, as well as the hundreds of affiliates dependent on these companies. In the 1986 general election held on 22 June 1986, the PSOE gained 44.1% of the vote and 184 deputies in Parliament. González was elected prime minister for the second time. During this second term, Spain joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986. González supported Spain remaining in NATO that same year in a referendum reversing his and the party&apos;s earlier anti-NATO position. A general strike on 14 December 1988 completely paralysed the country and caused the Unions and the PSOE left wing to describe González as moving to the right. { Felipe Gonzalez with } { Mikhail Gorbachev, 1990. } On 29 October 1989, he won the 1989 general election with 39.6% of the vote and 175 seats, { Spain&apos;s Ministry of the Interior: Official election results } his third successive mandate. In the First Gulf War in 1991, González supported the USA. From 1991, the PSOE started losing its urban vote in favour of the reformed People&apos;s Party. On the other side, events like the 1992 Olympic Games held in Barcelona or the Universal Exposition in Seville helped consolidating Spain&apos;s international image as a modern, affluent country. On 6 June 1993, González won the 1993 general election with 38.8% of the vote and 159 deputies. His fourth victory was marred by the fact he was forced to form a pact with nationalist political parties from Catalonia and Basque country in order to form a new government. Towards the end of 1995 there was a debate about whether González should lead the PSOE in the forthcoming general elections. The People&apos;s Party intensified its campaign to associate his period in office with a poor economic situation (although unemployment had begun to decline and the economic reforms of the previous decade initiated a lasting period of economic growth { http://www.ine.es/daco/daco42/cne00/pib.xls#Tabla_2!A1 } and with accusations of corruption ) and state terrorism scandals, including allegations of waging a dirty war against the terrorist group ETA by means of the GAL. There was speculation in the press about Javier Solana as a possible replacement, but Solana was appointed Secretary General of NATO in December 1995. Left with no other suitable candidate, the party was again led by González and in the 1996 general election held on 3 March 1996, they gained 37.4% of the vote and 141 deputies. They lost the election to the People&apos;s Party whose leader José María Aznar replaced González as prime minister ( &quot; presidente &quot; in Spanish, but not to be confused with the English use of the term) on 4 or 5 May 1996. The legacy of Felipe González&apos;s long mandate left a bittersweet taste: on the one hand, under his tenure, Spain initiated a period of thorough modernisation; on the other hand the scandals that monopolised the news in his last years still preclude a dispassionate consideration of his tenure. [ May 2011 ] His Ministers of Economy and Finance (notably Miguel Boyer, Carlos Solchaga and Pedro Solbes ) implemented a vigorous program of economic reforms that included privatisation of public companies such as Telefónica or ENDESA, liberalisation and deregulation of the economy and restructuring of whole industry sectors such as steel or mining which left many people unemployed and created resentment among the working classes and the trade unions. This situation was worsened by the massive influx of women baby boomers into the labour market, which further increased the unemployment rates. His cabinets, on the other hand, paved the way to a long period of declining interest rates, low budget deficits and stronger economic growth than the European average [ January 2008 ]. Spain was a founding member of the transition to the single currency (Euro) based on the measures of his last government [ January 2008 ]. Other reforms had also a deep impact on the Spanish economy, such as the extension of a network of highways, airports and the creation of new infrastructures, including the high speed train. Gonzalez-led cabinets were the first to implement a national, comprehensive infrastructure program that included not only public works but theatres, museums, secondary schools. In addition, a comprehensive welfare state was established, { http://en.thinkingheads.com/speakers/felipe-gonzalez } { http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/1526/1/dt-0212e.pdf } while improvements were made to social programmes such as pensions and unemployment benefits. { http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/2025/1/dt-9704.pdf } A 40-hour workweek was introduced, while entitlement to paid holidays was extended to up to 30 days per year. Pension funds were also established, together with provision for social tourism. In addition, the school-leaving age was raised from 11 to 14, while the number of educational grants was multiplied by eight. { Spain: From Dictatorship to Democracy by Javier Tusell } Unemployment protection was expanded (although it was later reduced in the Nineties) { http://www.ces.fas.harvard.edu/conferences/nordic/papers/aguillen.pdf } and a national education system for children under the age of six was established. Cash benefits in social housing, health care and education were introduced, along with earnings-based benefits for widowhood, sickness, disability, and retirement. A Ministry of Social Affairs was also set up, allowing for social services to be decentralised in the early Nineties and to be available to all citizens instead of only to those with social security. The pension system was extended to needy people, universal public schooling was introduced for all children under the age of 16, and new universities were established. Healthcare was reformed, creating the National Health Service and the development of primary care medicine based on &quot; health centres &quot; where integral primary care for adults, pregnant women and paediatric patients was provided. When he left office, Spain had the best prepared young generation in history and women had stated coping leadership roles as never before. State run Television Española reached a high level of quality under the direction of Pilar Miro. Private television chains were also permitted in 1990, ending the state monopoly. Felipe González also secured Spain&apos;s entry into the EEC, which the country joined in 1986 and consolidated democratic government. Together with François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, they gave an injection of new life to Europe&apos;s public face. He was the sole support of Kohl&apos;s drive to a united Germany, counteracting British and French hostility. He also started diplomatic relations with Israel, that had never been stablished by Franco as a solidarity with Arab countries. Due to his prestige, Spain also housed peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis in 1990, that were presided over by G. Bush Sr. and M. Gorbachev. In the fight against terrorism, an intense police campaign secured several victories that left the terrorist organisation ETA severely debilitated. In his earlier years ETA killings totalled dozens per year (the Hipercor 1987 Hipercor bombing attack in Barcelona alone killed more than 10 people), while in his latter years ETA killed far fewer. During his time as Prime Minister a group called GAL was active as a gangster-style force targeted against ETA. Several innocent people were killed and the subsequent investigations ended with some police officers and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jose Barrionuevo, condemned to jail. The Constitutional Court later ratified the sentence. Among successful operations were the capture of the ETA central arsenal and archives in Sokoa (France) and the capture of the organisation&apos;s ruling body in 1992. However in the final years of his mandate several cases of corruption, the most notable of which were the scandals involving Civil Guard Director Roldán, further eroded popular support for the PSOE. Nonetheless González and most of his ministers generally managed to leave office with their reputation intact although there had been some singularly unfortunate choices made in the case of some of the lower ranking public servants, according to María Antonia Iglesias (La memoria recuperada. Lo que nunca han contado Felipe González y los dirigentes socialistas, 2003); this author is very close, though, to the PSOE official line, as served as head of the public TV broadcast Televisión Española after appointment to the post by one of Gonzalez&apos;s cabinets. Lately, his role as a decisive statesman in the latter part of the 20th century has been recognised. One of his most bitter adversaries, Luis Maria Anson, at the time director of the right wing newspaper ABC and later of the hard right La Razón has stated that Gonzalez &quot; was the best president that Spain had in the XX century &quot;. He also stated that he and many others (mainly newspaper owners and media pundits) started a witch hunt against him, in support of the Popular Party, out of fear that Gonzalez&apos;s leadership might last several decades.

Since September 1996 he has headed the Madrid-based Global Progress Foundation (FPG). At the beginning of the 34th PSOE National Congress on 20 June 1997 he surprisingly resigned as leader of the party. He also resigned from the federal executive committee, though retaining his seat in the Congress. With no clear successor he continued to exert an enormous influence over the party. He was only replaced at the 35th party Congress in July 2000 when José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero became the leader. In 1997 he was considered a leading candidate to take over the position of President of the European Commission after Jacques Santer.
