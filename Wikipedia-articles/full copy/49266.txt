[ Buchenwald ] [ 51 01 20 N 11 14 53 E region:DE-TH_type:landmark title ] Watchtower at the memorial site Buchenwald, 1983 Buchenwald concentration camp (German: Konzentrationslager (KZ) Buchenwald, [ ˈbuːxənvalt IPA ] ) was a German Nazi concentration camp established on the Ettersberg (Etter Mountain) near Weimar, Germany, in July 1937, one of the first and the largest of the concentration camps on German soil. Camp prisoners from all over Europe and Russia— Jew s, non-Jewish Poles and Slovenes, religious and political prisoners, Roma and Sinti, Freemasons, Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses, criminals, homosexuals, and prisoners of war— worked primarily as forced labor in local armament factories. { The History of Buchenwald Memorial. } From 1945 to 1950, the camp was used by the Soviet occupation authorities as an internment camp, known as NKVD special camp number 2. [ History ] { Jedem das Seine &apos;&apos; (literally, &quot; to each his own &quot;, but figuratively &quot; everyone gets what he deserves &quot; ). The slogan is legible only from inside the camp. } In 1937, the Nazis constructed Buchenwald concentration camp, near Weimar, Germany. Embedded in the camp&apos;s main entrance gate is the slogan Jedem das Seine (literally &quot; to each his own &quot;, but figuratively &quot; everyone gets what he deserves”). The camp was operational until its liberation in 1945. Between 1945 and 1950 the former camp was used by the Soviet Union as an NKVD special camp for Nazis. On 6 January 1950, the Soviets handed over Buchenwald to the East German Ministry of Internal Affairs. Originally the camp was named after the hill Ettersberg but it was later renamed to Buchenwald (German for beech forest).

One estimate places the number of deaths in Buchenwald at 56,000. During an American bombing raid on August 24, 1944 that was directed at a nearby armament factory, several bombs, including incendiaries, also fell on the camp, resulting in heavy casualties amongst the prisoners { The Buchenwald Report by David A Hackett Language: English ISBN 0-8133-3363-6 ISBN 978-0813333632 } and damage to the Goethe Eiche. [ People ] [ Camp commandants ] { Hermann Pister } SS-Sturmbannführer : Jacob Weiseborn (1937-1939) SS-Obersturmbannführer : Karl Otto Koch (1939–1942) SS-Standartenführer : Hermann Pister (1942–1945) Buchenwald’s second commandant was Karl Otto Koch, who ran the camp from 1937 to 1941. His second wife, Ilse Koch, became notorious as Die Hexe von Buchenwald ( &quot; the witch of Buchenwald &quot; ) for her cruelty and brutality. Koch had a zoo built by the prisoners in the camp, with a bear pit (Bärenzwinger) [ http://www.buchenwald.de/fotoarchive/buchenwald/print.php?inventarnr%3D3796 Bärenzwinger. Zoo Buchenwald. 1939 28 April 2009 ] facing the Appellplatz, the assembly square where prisoner &quot; roll-calls &quot; were conducted. Koch was eventually himself imprisoned at Buchenwald by the Nazi authorities for incitement to murder. The charges were lodged by Prince Waldeck and Dr. Morgen against Koch, to which were later added charges of corruption, embezzlement, black market dealings, and his exploitation of camp workers for personal gain. { &apos;The Buchenwald Report&apos; by David A Hackett, pp. 341 } Other camp officials were charged, including Koch&apos;s wife. The trial resulted in Koch being sentenced to death for disgracing both himself and the SS. Koch was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945, one week before American allied troops arrived to liberate the camp. Ilse was sentenced to a term of four years imprisonment after the war. Her sentence was reduced to two years and she was set free. Later, she was arrested again and sentenced to life imprisonment by the post-war German authorities; she committed suicide in a Bavaria n prison cell in September 1967. [ April 2012 ] The third and last commandant of the camp was Hermann Pister (1942–1945). He was tried in 1947 ( Dachau Trials ) and sentenced to death, but died in September 1948 of a heart condition before sentence could be carried out. [ Female prisoners and overseers ] Dead German female guard from the Ohrdruf concentration camp. She was either killed by Allied forces or by the prisoners. The number of women held in Buchenwald was somewhere between 500 and 1,000. The first female inmates were twenty political prisoners who were accompanied by a female SS guard (&apos;&apos;Aufseherin&apos;&apos;); these women were brought to Buchenwald from Ravensbrück in 1941 and forced into prostitution at the camp&apos;s brothel. Later the SS fired the SS woman on duty in the brothel for corruption, and her position was taken over by “brothel mothers” as ordered by SS chief Heinrich Himmler. The majority of women prisoners, however, arrived in 1944 and 1945 from other camps, mainly Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, and Bergen Belsen. Only one barrack was set aside for them; this was overseen by the female block leader (Blockführerin) Franziska Hoengesberg, who came from Essen when it was evacuated. All the women prisoners were later shipped out to one of Buchenwald&apos;s many female satellite camps in Sömmerda, Buttelstedt, Mühlhausen, Gotha, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Lippstadt, Weimar, Magdeburg, and Penig, to name a few. No female guards were permanently stationed at Buchenwald. When the Buchenwald camp was evacuated, the SS sent the male prisoners to other camps, and the five-hundred remaining women (including one of the secret annexe members who lived with Anne Frank, &quot; Mrs. van Daan &quot;, real name Auguste van Pels ) were taken by train and on foot to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and ghetto in Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Many, including van Pels, died sometime between April 1945 and May 1945. Because the female prisoner population at Buchenwald was comparatively small, the SS only trained female overseers at the camp and &quot; assigned &quot; them to one of the female subcamps. Twenty-two known female guards have personnel files at the camp, but it is unlikely that any of them stayed at Buchenwald for longer than a few days. Ilse Koch served as head supervisor (Oberaufseherin) of 22 other female guards and hundreds of women prisoners in the main camp. Eventually, more than 530 women served as guards in the vast Buchenwald system of subcamps and external commands across Germany. Only 22 women served/trained in Buchenwald, compared to over 15,500 men. { Buchenwald concentration camp 1937–1945: a guide to the permanent historical.

They all arrived at Buchenwald on August 20, 1944. { National Museum of the USAF: &quot; Allied Victims of the Holocaust &quot; Accessed 16 May 2007. } { Eyewitness accounts of Art Kinnis, president of KLB (Konzentrationslager Buchenwald), and 2nd Lt. Joseph Moser, one of the surviving pilots, at http://buchenwaldflyboy.wordpress.com. } All these airmen were in planes that had crashed in occupied France. Two explanations are given for them being sent to a concentration camp: first, that they had managed to make contact with the French Resistance, some were disguised as civilians, and they were carrying false papers when caught; they were therefore categorized by the Germans as spies, which meant their rights under the Geneva Convention were not respected. The second explanation is that they had been categorised as Terrorflieger ( &quot; terror aviators &quot; ). The aviators were initially held in Gestapo prisons and headquarters in France. In April or August 1944, they and other Gestapo prisoners were packed into covered goods wagon s (US: boxcars) and sent to Buchenwald. The journey took five days, during which they received very little food or water. One aviator recalled their arrival at Buchenwald: [ As we got close to the camp and saw what was inside... a terrible, terrible fear and horror entered our hearts. We thought, what is this? Where are we going? Why are we here? And as you got closer to the camp and started to enter the camp and saw these human skeletons walking around—old men, young men, boys, just skin and bone, we thought, what are we getting into? 20px 20px A Canadian airman&apos;s recollection of his arrival at Buchenwald. From The Lucky Ones: Allied Airmen and Buchenwald (1994 film, directed by Michael Allder), cited by Veterans Affairs Canada, 2006: &quot; Prisoners of War in the Second World War &quot; Accessed 16 May 2007. ] They were subjected to the same treatment and abuse as other Buchenwald prisoners until October 1944, when a change in policy saw the aviators dispatched to Stalag Luft III, a regular prisoner-of-war camp (POW) camp; nevertheless, two airmen died at Buchenwald. { National Museum of the USAF, Ibid. } Those classed as terrorflieger had been scheduled for execution after October 24; their rescue was effected by Luftwaffe officers who visited Buchenwald and, on their return to Berlin, demanded the airmen&apos;s release. Buchenwald was also the main imprisonment for a number of Norwegian university students from 1943 until the end of the war. The students, being Norwegian, got better treatment than most, but had to resist Nazi schooling for months. They became remembered for resisting forced labor in a minefield, as the Nazis wished to use them as cannon fodder. An incident connected to this is remembered as the Strike at Burkheim. The Norwegian students in Buchenwald lived in a warmer, stone-construction house and had their own clothes. { Redlich, Carl Aage: 19. September, 1945. p. 55. } [ Death toll at Buchenwald ] [ Causes of death ] Bodies of Buchenwald prisoners, April 1945 Corpses piled up behind the crematorium in Buchenwald concentration camp, April 1945 Although Buchenwald was technically not an extermination camp, it was a site of an extraordinary number of deaths. A primary cause of death was illness due to harsh camp conditions, with starvation—and its consequent illnesses—prevalent. Malnourished and suffering from disease, many were literally &quot; worked to death &quot; under the Vernichtung durch Arbeit policy ( extermination through labor ), as inmates had only the choice between slave labour or inevitable execution. Many inmates died as a result of human experimentation or fell victim to arbitrary acts perpetrated by the SS guards. Other prisoners were simply murdered, primarily by shooting and hanging. Walter Gerhard Martin Sommer was an SS Hauptscharführer (master sergeant) who served as a guard at the concentration camps of Dachau and Buchenwald. Known as the &quot; Hangman of Buchenwald &quot;, he was considered a depraved sadist who reportedly ordered Otto Neururer and Mathias Spannlang, two Austrian priests, crucified upside-down. Sommer was especially infamous for hanging prisoners from trees with their wrists behind their backs in the &quot; singing forest &quot;, so named because of the screams which emanated from this wooded area. { The resistance in Austria, 1938–1945 By Radomír Luža Publisher: University of Minnesota Press (April 9, 1984) ISBN 0-8166-1226-9 } { Harry Stein, Gedenkstätte Buchenwald: Buchenwald concentration camp 1937–1945: A Guide to the Permanent Historical Exhibition p. 302, Wallstein (2005) ISBN 3-89244-695-4 } Summary execution s of Soviet POWs were also carried out at Buchenwald. At least 1,000 Soviet POWs were selected in 1941–2 by a task force of three Dresden Gestapo officers and sent to the camp for immediate liquidation by a gunshot to the back of the neck, the infamous Genickschuss. The camp was also a site of large-scale trials for vaccine s against epidemic typhus in 1942 and 1943. In all 729 inmates were used as test subjects, of whom 154 died. { Spitz, Vivien. Doctors from Hell. 2005, page 199 } Other &quot; experimentation &quot; occurred at Buchenwald on a smaller scale. One such experiment aimed at determining the precise fatal dose of a poison of the alkaloid group; according to the testimony of one doctor, four Russian POWs were administered the poison, and when it proved not to be fatal they were &quot; strangled in the crematorium &quot; and subsequently &quot; dissected &quot;. { Spitz, Vivien. Doctors from Hell. 2005, page 209-10 } Among various other experiments was one which, in order to test the effectiveness of a balm for wounds from incendiary bombs, involved inflicting &quot; very severe &quot; phosphorus burns on inmates. { Spitz, Vivien. Doctors from Hell. 2005, page 213-14 } When challenged at trial over the nature of this testing, and particularly over the fact that the testing was designed in some cases to cause death and only to measure the time which elapsed until death was caused, one Nazi doctor&apos;s defence was that, though a doctor, he was &quot; legally appointed executioner &quot;. { Spitz, Vivien.

Barkley later became } { Vice President of the United States under } { Harry S. Truman. } The SS left behind accounts of the number of prisoners and people coming to and leaving the camp, categorizing those leaving them by release, transfer, or death. These accounts are one of the sources of estimates for the number of deaths in Buchenwald. According to SS documents, 33,462 died in Buchenwald. These documents were not, however, necessarily accurate: Among those executed before 1944 many were listed as &quot; transferred to the Gestapo &quot;. Furthermore, from 1941 Soviet POWs were executed in mass killings. Arriving prisoners selected for execution were not entered into the camp register and therefore were not among the 33,462 dead listed in SS documents. { Bartel, Walter: Buchenwald—Mahnung und Verpflichtung: Dokumente und Berichte (Buchenwald: Warnings and our obligation [to future generations]—Documents and reports), Kongress-Verlag, 1960. p. 64, lines 12–23.. } One former Buchenwald prisoner, Armin Walter, calculated the number of executions by shooting in the back of the head. His job at Buchenwald was to set up and care for a radio installation at the facility where people were executed; he counted the numbers, which arrived by telex, and hid the information. He says that 8,483 Soviet prisoners of war were shot in this manner. { Bartel, Walter: Buchenwald—Mahnung und Verpflichtung: Dokumente und Berichte (Buchenwald: Warnings and our obligation to future generation—Documents and reports), Kongress-Verlag, 1960. p. 203, lines 18–38. } According to the same source, the total number of deaths at Buchenwald is estimated at 56,545. { Podcast with one of 2000 Danish policemen in Buchenwald. Episode 6 is about statistics for the number of deaths at Buchenwald. } This number is the sum of: Deaths according to material left behind by SS: 33,462 Includes male deaths in satellite camps.

On April 8 at noon Damazyn and Russian prisoner Konstantin Ivanovich Leonov sent the Morse code message prepared by leaders of prisoners&apos; underground resistance (supposedly Walter Bartel and Harry Kuhn): [ To the Allies. To the army of General Patton. This is the Buchenwald concentration camp. SOS. We request help. They want to evacuate us. The SS wants to destroy us. ] The text was repeated several times in English, German, and Russian. Damazyn sent the English and German transmissions, while Leonov sent the Russian transmissions. Three minutes after the last transmission sent by Damazyn, the headquarters of the US Third Army responded: [ KZ Bu. Hold out. Rushing to your aid. Staff of Third Army. ] According to Teofil Witek, a fellow Polish prisoner who witnessed the transmissions, Damazyn fainted after receiving the message.

Murrow, whose radio report of his arrival and reception was broadcast on CBS and became one of his most famous: [ I asked to see one of the barracks. It happened to be occupied by Czechoslovaks. When I entered, men crowded around, tried to lift me to their shoulders. They were too weak. Many of them could not get out of bed. I was told that this building had once stabled 80 horses.
