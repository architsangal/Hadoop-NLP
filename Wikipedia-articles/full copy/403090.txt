[ yes 1946 1 23 ] { Managua, } { Nicaragua } { Constitutionalist Liberal Party } José Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo (born 23 January 1946) was the 81st President of Nicaragua from 10 January 1997 to 10 January 2002. [ Biography ] Alemán was born in Managua and received his early education at the La Salle institute in Managua. In 1967 he graduated with a law degree from the National Autonomous University of León with specializations in regional economic integration and financial law. Between 1968 and 1979, he worked as a lawyer in the commercial and banking world. He became an official in the government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. In 1980 he was arrested by the Sandinista junta, had some of his property seized and spent 9 months in prison. The period of his arrest coincided with the death of his father. This kept him from attending his father&apos;s funeral. { Nicaragua Actual Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo, Biografia. } After he was released from prison, he spent some time in the United States. Upon his return to Nicaragua, Alemán became heavily involved in business, political, and academic activities. He was a member of the Consejo Superior de la Empresa Privada (COSEP, 1988–1990), vice-president of the Unión de Productores Agropecuarios de Nicaragua (UPANIC, 1986–1990). He was president of the Asociación de Cafetaleros de Managua (1983–1990); the Unión de Cafetaleros de Nicaragua (UNCAFENIC, 1986–1990); the Federación de Municipios de América Central (1992–1993) and of the Federación Municipal de Ciudades de Centroamérica (1993–1995). He also imparted conferences at Tulane University and at Florida International University in the United States. In the early 1990s he became Mayor of Managua after serving for two months as a councillor in Managua. He was popular due to his urban renewal projects which helped spruce up the city, severely damaged and never rebuilt after a 1972 earthquake. He became known as &quot; El Gordo &quot; ( &quot; The Fat Man &quot; ). Alemán became President of the Liberal Alliance and helped to resurrect it. Besides the PLC, other members of this alliance were the Partidos Neoliberal (PALI), Liberal Independiente de Unidad Nacional (PLIUN) and the Liberal Nacionalista (PLN). On 1 September 1995 he resigned as Mayor in order to be able, under Nicaraguan Law, to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election. In 1996 he campaigned for president as the Liberal Alliance&apos;s candidate under a strong anti-Sandinista platform. It is reported that unidentified individuals attempted to shoot Alemán, killing one of his bodyguards in the process.

Many claimed widespread election fraud and Ortega refused to concede. Alemán was successful in promoting economic recovery with reduced inflation and growth of GDP. Foreign investment grew during his administration, which helped to improve Nicaragua&apos;s infrastructure. Under his slogan of &quot; Obras, no palabras! (Actions, not words) &quot;, Alemán directed a comprehensive reconstruction of the roadway system throughout Nicaragua. During the 1980s, roads throughout the country had deteriorated to the point that many were little more than sparsely paved dirt trails. Alemán also created a program to build schools throughout Nicaragua in some of the poorest regions. He has participated in international conferences and some awards given to him include the Orden Nacional al Mérito of the Colombina Government and the Orden de Isabel la Católica of the Spanish government. His first wife, Maria Dolores Cardenal Vargas died of cancer in 1989. Alemán has two sons and two daughters by his first wife. On 23 October 1999, nine years after the death of his first wife, he married Maria Fernanda Flores Lanzas, with whom he has two daughters and a son.

Allegations emerged that Alemán was concealing massive corruption in his administration. At the end of his presidency, public information about alleged corruption committed under his government became available.

The scheme was reported to have involved several members of Arnoldo Alemán&apos;s closest family, including a brother and sister. Ex–ministers and close friends were also charged, some of whom fled the country. However, one of the central figures in the corruption complot, the former Chief of Department of Taxes Byron Jeréz, was imprisoned on the basis of another charge of corruption. All in all, fourteen persons were charged. &quot; { MS Central America - Ex-president Alemán charged with corruption } { Global Integrity - 2004 Country Report } Several foreign governments froze Alemán&apos;s bank accounts in their countries and threatened to confiscate the funds. In such cases, his defense has been to claim that the funds were not stolen, but that they came from his coffee plantations. { Arnoldo Alemán apelará en Atlanta confiscación fondos familiares Noticias Mundo } Alemán was formally charged in December 2002, and on 7 December 2003 he was sentenced to a 20-year prison term for a string of crimes including money laundering, embezzlement and corruption.

There are those who claim that the main purpose of this agreement, which led to a constitutional reform, was to distribute the institutions of the state in proportion to the power managed by the two main political parties of the country. { Global Integrity - 2004 Country Report } On 16 January 2009, Nicaragua’s Supreme Court overturned the 20-year corruption sentence against former President Arnoldo Alemán. The decision generated some controversy: &quot; stunned opposition lawmakers immediately suspected a secret deal between Mr. Alemán, ranked one of the world’s 10 most corrupt leaders ever by Transparency International, and Daniel Ortega, President of Nicaragua and leader of the Sandinista Party, who wields considerable influence and control over the courts. “He’s handing over the National Assembly in exchange for his personal liberty,” said Congressman Enrique Saenz. Mr. Alemán, who denies the allegation, said, “Justice has finally been served.” &quot; [ http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/world/americas/17briefs-EXLEADERSSEN_BRF.html The New York Times Nicaragua: Ex-Leader’s Sentence Lifted Blake Schmidt 17 January 2009 31 March 2010 ] [ Electoral history of José Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo ] [ Elections for Mayor of Managua 1990, February 25, 2008 ] Managua Mayor elected by acclamation of the Managua City Council April 26, 1990.
