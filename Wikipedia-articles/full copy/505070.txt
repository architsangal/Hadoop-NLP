The band&apos;s earliest albums were noted for their indie and noise rock influences, though their sound evolved by the early 2000s with the releases of Misery is a Butterfly (2004) and 23 (2007), which both incorporated elements of dream pop, shoegaze and other genres.

[ History ] Amedeo and Simone Pace were born in Milan, Italy, grew up in Montreal ( Saint-Léonard ), but later moved to Boston to study jazz. After earning Bachelor&apos;s degree s, they entered the New York City underground music scene. Named after a song with the same title by DNA, a no wave band from New York, the band formed in New York in 1993 with Japanese musician Kazu Makino. Blonde Redhead&apos;s self-titled debut album was released in 1995. Shortly afterward, 4th member Maki Takahashi left the band and was replaced by her friend Toko Yasuda as bassist who also was only in the band for a short time. The band continued as a trio. On their third album, Fake Can Be Just as Good, they were joined by Vern Rumsey of Unwound, who filled the role of guest bassist. On their more recent albums, Skúli Sverrisson, who the twins knew from their time in Boston, has been playing bass. He sometimes joins them for live performances. On their fourth album, In an Expression of the Inexpressible, Guy Picciotto of Fugazi was hired as producer. Picciotto also contributed in the construction to the song &quot; Futurism vs. Passéism Part 2 &quot; as well as lending it his vocals. Picciotto also produced with Ryan Hadlock at Bear Creek Studio the band&apos;s records Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons and Misery Is a Butterfly. Alan Moulder ( My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails, U2, Smashing Pumpkins ) mixed 23 and Penny Sparkle which was released on 4AD, respectively in April 2007 and September 2010. Blonde Redhead made extensive use of Teisco guitars early in their career, including the uncommon Teisco six-string bass. The large span of time between Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons and Misery Is a Butterfly is attributed to Makino&apos;s recovery time after being trampled by a horse.

The song &quot; Spring and by Summer Fall &quot; from 23 was recently used in the introduction to an October 2007 episode of the CBS series Numb3rs. &quot; 23 &quot; also appears on the internet and television commercials for the 2009 Pontiac promotion entitled &quot; Experience Pontiac. &quot; Their song &quot; Elephant Woman &quot; was also used as the ending theme for the David Slade film Hard Candy. This song was also used on the Billabong Girls website in February 2008. The track &quot; 23 &quot; was also used in a trailer for the British TV series Skins in February 2008, an ad for Crystal Geyser in May 2008 in Japan, and an episode of Grey&apos;s Anatomy. In summer 2008, they wrote and recorded over 15 tracks for the score of the documentary feature film The Dungeon Masters. The documentary premiered at the Toronto International Film festival and was released on February 12, 2010; a soundtrack album is expected in fall 2010.
