Whittingdale said: &quot; There are some very big questions. What I find [most] worrying is the apparent unwillingness of the police, who had the evidence and chose to do nothing with it. That&apos;s something that needs to be looked into. &quot; { &apos;&apos;The Guardian&apos;&apos; report on hacking, 13 April 2011 } With just one out of three of the senior executives agreeing to appear before the committee session on 19 July, Whittingdale took the rarely used step of issuing a summons to compel the Murdochs to attend. { Rupert and James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks to give evidence to Parliament } Whittingdale said select committees had taken such steps against individuals in the past and they had complied and continued &quot; I hope very much that the Murdochs will respond similarly. &quot; { &apos;&apos;The Guardian&apos;&apos; report on hacking scandal, 14 July 2011. } They both did, on 19 July, in what one paper described as the most important select committee hearing in parliament&apos;s history.
