VII, § 5 } and the commander-in-chief of its military forces. { UT Const. art. VII, § 4 } The governor has a duty to enforce state laws as well as the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Utah Legislature. { UT Const. art. VII, § 8 } The governor may also convene the legislature on &quot; extraordinary occasions &quot;. { UT Const. art. VII, § 6 } The self-proclaimed State of Deseret, precursor to the organization of the Utah Territory, had only one governor, Brigham Young. Utah Territory had 15   territorial governors from its organization in 1850 until the formation of the state of Utah in 1896, appointed by the President of the United States. John W. Dawson had the shortest term of only three weeks and Brigham Young, the first territorial governor, had the longest term at seven years. There have been 17  governors of the State of Utah, with the longest serving being Calvin L. Rampton, who served three terms from 1965 to 1977. Olene S. Walker served the shortest term, the remaining 14 months of Mike Leavitt &apos;s term upon Leavitt&apos;s resignation to become head of the Environmental Protection Agency. At the age of 36, Heber Manning Wells was the youngest person to become governor. At the age of 70, Simon Bamberger became the oldest person to be elected, while Olene Walker, at age 72, was the oldest person to succeed to the office. The current governor is Gary Herbert, who took office on August 11, 2009, upon the resignation of Jon Huntsman, Jr., to become United States Ambassador to China. Governor Herbert was elected to fill the remainder of Huntsman&apos;s term in November 2010, and his current term will expire on January 7, 2013. There is an official seal of the Governor of Utah. Borrowing most of the same symbolism from the State Seal, the Governor&apos;s seal includes roman numerals at the bottom, which represent the Governor himself, and this changes with every new Governor. Each Governor therefore has a seal unique to themselves and their administration. The roman numerals are currently &quot; XVII &quot;, representing Gary Herbert, who is the 17th governor of Utah since Statehood.
