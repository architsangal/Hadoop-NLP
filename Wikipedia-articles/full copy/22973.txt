[ the language game the programming language Pig (programming language) ] [ October 2008 ] [ October 2008 ] [ Pig Latin Igpay Atinlay lightpink United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Singapore Pig Latin English ] Pig Latin is a language game of alterations played in English. To form the Pig Latin form of an English word the first consonant (or consonant cluster ) is moved to the end of the word and an ay is affix ed (for example, pig yields igpay and computer yields omputercay or truancy yields uancytray). The object is to conceal the meaning of the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer, as it is simply a form of jargon, used only for its English connotations as a &quot; strange and foreign-sounding language. &quot; [ Origins ] The origins of Pig Latin are unknown. One early mention of the name was in Putnam&apos;s Magazine in May 1869: &quot; I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. &apos;Hoggibus, piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,&apos; and all that sort of thing, &quot; although the language cited is not modern Pig Latin, but rather what would be called today Dog Latin. The Atlantic January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: &quot; They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known &apos;pig Latin&apos; that all sorts of children like to play with. &quot; Thomas Jefferson wrote letters to friends in Pig Latin. (see Hailman in the references below) [ Use ] { Pig Latin is mostly used by people for amusement or to converse in perceived privacy from other persons. A few Pig Latin words, such as } { ixnay } [ http://www.allwords.com/query.php?SearchType%3D3%26amp%3BKeyword%3Dixnay%26amp%3Bgoquery%3DFind%2Bit%21%26amp%3BLanguage%3DENG Definition of ixnay Allwords.com 2011-06-18 ] { ( } { nix ), } { amscray } [ http://www.allwords.com/word-amscray.html Definition of amscray Allwords.com 2007-04-04 2011-06-18 ] { ( } { scram ), and upidstay ( } { stupid ), have been incorporated into American English } { slang. } [ Rules and variations ] The usual rules for changing standard English into Pig Latin are as follows: happy → appy-hay question → estion-quay { In words that begin with } { vowel sounds or } { silent consonants, the syllable &quot; way &quot; is simply added to the end of the word. In some variants, the syllable &quot; ay &quot; is added, without the &quot; w &quot; in front. Sometimes the vowel will be moved and followed by the syllable &quot; hay. &quot; } another→ another-way, another-ay, nother-ahay about→ about-way, about-ay, bout-ahay { # In } { compound word s or words with two distinct syllables, each component word or syllable is sometimes transcribed separately. For example: birdhouse would be ird-bay-ouse-hay. } Transcription varies. A hyphen or apostrophe is sometimes used to facilitate translation back into English. Ayspray, for instance, is ambiguous, but ay-spray means &quot; spray &quot; whereas ays-pray means &quot; prays. &quot; [ Similar language games ] [ February 2012 ] [ Language games ] [ In English ] Similar languages to Pig Latin are Opish, in which &quot; op &quot; is added to each consonant (thus, &quot; cat &quot; becomes &quot; copatop &quot; ); Turkey Irish, in which &quot; ab &quot; is added before each vowel (thus, &quot; run &quot; becomes &quot; rabun &quot; ), and Double Dutch, in which each consonant is replaced with a different consonant cluster (thus, &quot; how are you &quot; becomes &quot; hutchowash aruge yubou &quot; ) { Herbert S. Zim, Codes and Secret Writing (Morrow, 1948), pages 109-111. } [ In other languages ] { In } { Bernese German, a variety of Pig Latin called } { Mattenenglisch was used in the Matte, the traditional } { working class neighborhood. Though it has fallen out of use since mid 20th century, it is still cultivated by } { voluntary association s. A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by i, in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ee. } The Swedish equivalent of Pig Latin is Allspråket, which uses the same or similar rules but with the suffix &quot; -all. &quot; Additionally, the Swedish language game Fikonspråket ( &quot; Fig language &quot; ) is similar to Pig Latin. French has the loucherbem (or louchébem) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (boucher in French). [ August 2008 ] In loucherbem, the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and replaced by an l, and then a suffix is added at the end of the word (-oche, -em, -oque, depending on the word). ex: fou (crazy) = loufoque. Similar coded languages are largonji, { &apos;&apos; Definition of largonji (in French) Definition of louchébem (in French) } verlan and langue de feu [ Notes ] [ References ] [ 2 ] [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3D7bIfz0aP0cYC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA12%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA12%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22thomas%2Bjefferson%22%2B%22pig%2Blatin%22 Thomas Jefferson on wine 2011-06-18 ] Barlow, Jessica. 2001. &quot; Individual differences in the production of initial consonant sequences in Pig Latin. &quot; Lingua 111:667-696.
