[ the unfolding of an organism or the theory that plants and animals (including humans) develop in this way epigenesis (biology) epigenetics in robotics developmental robotics ] In biology, and specifically genetics, epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence – hence the name epi- (Greek: επί- over, above, outer) - genetics. It refers to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification, both of which serve to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes may remain through cell division s for the remainder of the cell&apos;s life and may also last for multiple generations. However, there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism; [ Bird A Perceptions of epigenetics Nature 447 7143 396–8 2007 May 17522671 10.1038/nature05913 ] instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism&apos;s genes to behave (or &quot; express themselves &quot; ) differently. { Special report: &apos;What genes remember&apos; by Philip Hunter | Prospect Magazine May 2008 issue 146 } One example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell line s of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell – the zygote – changes into the many cell types including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, endothelium of blood vessels, etc. as it continues to divide. It does so by activating some genes while inhibiting others. [ Reik W Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development Nature 447 7143 425–32 2007 May 17522676 10.1038/nature05918 ] In 2011, it was demonstrated that the methylation of mRNA has a critical role in human energy homeostasis. Obesity associated FTO gene is shown to be able to demethylate N6-methyladenosine in RNA. This opened the related field of RNA epigenetics.

H. Waddington in 1942 as a portmanteau of the words genetics and epigenesis. [ Waddington CH The epigenotype Endeavour 1 18–20 1942 ] Epigenesis is an old { According to the } { Oxford English Dictionary : } [ The word is used by W. Harvey, Exercitationes1651, p. 148, and in the English Anatomical Exercitations1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’. ] { It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., &quot; The formation of an organic germ as a new product &quot; ): } [ theory of epigenesis: the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the ‘theory of evolution’; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the ‘theory of preformation’, sometimes as that of ‘encasement’ or ‘emboîtement’. ] word that has more recently been used (see preformationism for historical background) to describe the differentiation of cells from their initial totipotent state in embryonic development. When Waddington coined the term the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a phenotype. Robin Holliday defined epigenetics as &quot; the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms. &quot; [ Holliday R Mechanisms for the control of gene activity during development Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc 65 4 431–71 1990 November 2265224 ] Thus epigenetic can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism. The modern usage of the word in scientific discourse is more narrow, referring to heritable traits (over rounds of cell division and sometimes transgenerationally) that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. [ Riggs AD, Russo VEA, Martienssen RA Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Plainview, N.Y 1996 0-87969-490-4 ] The Greek prefix epi- in epigenetics implies features that are &quot; on top of &quot; or &quot; in addition to &quot; genetics; thus epigenetic traits exist on top of or in addition to the traditional molecular basis for inheritance. The similarity of the word to &quot; genetics &quot; has generated many parallel usages. The &quot; epigenome &quot; is a parallel to the word &quot; genome &quot;, and refers to the overall epigenetic state of a cell. The phrase &quot; genetic code &quot; has also been adapted—the &quot; epigenetic code &quot; has been used to describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the &quot; epigenetic code &quot; could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an epigenomic map, a diagrammatic representation of the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the histone code or DNA methylation patterns. The psychologist Erik Erikson used the term epigenetic [ February 2011 ] in his theory of psychosocial development. That usage, however, is of primarily historical interest. [ http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Epigenetics Epigenetics Bio-Medicine.org 2011-05-21 ] [ Molecular basis of epigenetics ] The molecular basis of epigenetics is complex. It involves modifications of the activation of certain genes, but not the basic structure of DNA. Additionally, the chromatin proteins associated with DNA may be activated or silenced. This accounts for why the differentiated cells in a multi-cellular organism express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism&apos;s lifetime, but, if a mutation in the DNA has been caused in sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, then some epigenetic changes are inherited from one generation to the next. [ Chandler VL Paramutation: from maize to mice Cell 128 4 641–5 2007 February 17320501 10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007 ] This raises the question of whether or not epigenetic changes in an organism can alter the basic structure of its DNA (see Evolution, below ), a form of Lamarckism. Specific epigenetic processes include paramutation, bookmarking, imprinting, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, position effect, reprogramming, transvection, maternal effect s, the progress of carcinogenesis, many effects of teratogen s, regulation of histone modifications and heterochromatin, and technical limitations affecting parthenogenesis and cloning. Epigenetic research uses a wide range of molecular biologic techniques to further our understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (together with its large-scale variants ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-Seq ), fluorescent in situ hybridization, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, DNA adenine methyltransferase identification ( DamID ) and bisulfite sequencing. Furthermore, the use of bioinformatic methods is playing an increasing role ( computational epigenetics ). [ Mechanisms ] Several types of epigenetic inheritance systems may play a role in what has become known as cell memory: [ Jablonka E, Lamb MJ, Lachmann M Evidence, mechanisms and models for the inheritance of acquired characteristics J. Theoret. Biol. 1992 September 158 2 245–268 10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80722-2 ] [ DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling ] DNA associates with histone proteins to form chromatin. Because the phenotype of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable transcription states can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of gene expression. One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the histone proteins with which it associates. Histone proteins are little spheres that DNA wraps around. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms: The first way is post translational modification of the amino acids that make up histone proteins. Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone sphere might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during replication. It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA. Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner. By altering the shape of the histones around it, these modified histones would ensure that a differentiated cell would stay differentiated, and not convert back into being a stem cell. The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at CpG site s, to convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing up with a guanine. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from this parent ( genetic imprinting ). The way that the cells stay differentiated in the case of DNA methylation is clearer to us than it is in the case of histone shape. Basically, certain enzymes (such as DNMT1 ) have a higher affinity for the methylated cytosine. If this enzyme reaches a &quot; hemimethylated &quot; portion of DNA (where methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half. Although histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation and sumoylation. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysine s of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally correlated with transcriptional competence. One mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with &quot; active &quot; transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like SWI/SNF and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the &quot; cis &quot; model of epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself. Another model of epigenetic function is the &quot; trans &quot; model. In this model changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin modifying enzymes (and basal transcription machinery as well). This Chromatin Remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin. Indeed, the bromodomain — a protein segment (domain) that specifically binds acetyl-lysine — is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the SWI/SNF complex (on the protein polybromo). It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation. The idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by histone methylation as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive heterochromatin ). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein HP1 recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for acetylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail. It has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 &amp; H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone. [ Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 54 1 80–93 1998 January 9487389 10.1007/s000180050127 ] Differing histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently than acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the nucleosome. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the histone code. DNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of &apos; transposable elements &apos;: [ Slotkin RK, Martienssen R Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome Nat. Rev. Genet. 8 4 272–85 2007 April 17363976 10.1038/nrg2072 ] Because 5-methylcytosine can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to thymidine, CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at CpG islands where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus have the potential to direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. DNA methylation patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent DNA methyltransferase s, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice.

This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC). The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it. JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.

Epigenetic control is often associated with alternative covalent modification s of histones. [ Rosenfeld JA, Wang Z, Schones DE, Zhao K, DeSalle R, Zhang MQ Determination of enriched histone modifications in non-genic portions of the human genome BMC Genomics 10 143 2009 19335899 2667539 10.1186/1471-2164-10-143 ] The stability and heritability of states of larger chromosomal regions are often thought to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. A simplified stochastic model for this type of epigenetics is found here. { Epigenetic cell memory } [ Dodd IB, Micheelsen MA, Sneppen K, Thon G Theoretical analysis of epigenetic cell memory by nucleosome modification Cell 129 4 813–22 2007 May 17512413 10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.053 ] Because DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling play such a central role in many types of epigenic inheritance, the word &quot; epigenetics &quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling. [ Ptashne M On the use of the word &apos;epigenetic&apos; Curr. Biol. 17 7 R233–6 2007 April 17407749 10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.030 ] It has been suggested that the histone code could be mediated by the effect of small RNAs. The recent discovery and characterization of a vast array of small (21- to 26-nt), non-coding RNAs suggests that there is an RNA component, possibly involved in epigenetic gene regulation. Small interfering RNA s can modulate transcriptional gene expression via epigenetic modulation of targeted promoter s. [ Morris KL RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression Caister Academic Press Norfolk, England 2008 1-904455-25-5 ] [ RNA transcripts and their encoded proteins ] Sometimes a gene, after being turned on, transcribes a product that (either directly or indirectly) maintains the activity of that gene. For example, Hnf4 and MyoD enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the transcription factor activity of the proteins they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development. [ Mattick JS, Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mehler MF RNA regulation of epigenetic processes BioEssays 31 1 51–9 2009 January 19154003 10.1002/bies.080099 ] Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of different splice forms of RNA, or by formation of double-stranded RNA ( RNAi ). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are most often turned on or off by signal transduction, although in some systems where syncytia or gap junctions are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by diffusion. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the zygote by the mother during oogenesis or via nurse cell s, resulting in maternal effect phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring. [ Choi CQ The Scientist: RNA can be hereditary molecule The Scientist http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/23494 2006-05-25 2006 ] [ Prions ] [ Prions ] Prion s are infectious forms of protein s. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state known as a prion. Although often viewed in the context of infectious disease, prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state. It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome. [ Epigenetic inheritance and prions Yool A, Edmunds WJ Journal of Evolutionary Biology 1998 241–242 11 10.1007/s000360050085 2 ] Fungal prion s are considered epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome. PSI+ and URE3, discovered in yeast in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion.

Bacteriol. 106 2 519–22 1971 May 5573734 285125 ] Prions can have a phenotypic effect through the sequestration of protein in aggregates, thereby reducing that protein&apos;s activity. In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop codon s, an effect that results in suppression of nonsense mutation s in other genes. [ Liebman SW, Sherman F Extrachromosomal psi+ determinant suppresses nonsense mutations in yeast J. Bacteriol. 139 3 1068–71 1979 September 225301 218059 ] The ability of Sup35 to form prions may be a conserved trait. It could confer an adaptive advantage by giving cells the ability to switch into a PSI+ state and express dormant genetic features normally terminated by premature stop codon mutations.

Experimentally altered patterns can be transmitted to daughter cells. It seems existing structures act as templates for new structures. The mechanisms of such inheritance are unclear, but reasons exist to assume that multicellular organisms also use existing cell structures to assemble new ones. [ Sapp J Concepts of organization.

The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, morphogen s activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a &quot; memory &quot;. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only stem cells retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ( &quot; totipotency &quot; and &quot; multipotency &quot; ). In mammal s, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodeling, it has been hypothesised that plant cells do not have &quot; memories &quot;, resetting their gene expression patterns at each cell division using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.

[ Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, Roa S The multidimensional nature of epigenetic information and its role in disease Discov Med 11 58 233–43 2011 March 21447282 ] Congenital genetic disease is well understood, and it is also clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially hemizygous because of genomic imprinting, and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out. [ 105830 ] [ Evolution ] Epigenetic mechanisms were a necessary part of the evolutionary origin of cell differentiation. [ Hoekstra RF Evolution: an introduction Oxford University Press Oxford [Oxfordshire] 2000 285 0-19-854968-7 ] Although epigenetics in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation, with epigenetic patterns &quot; reset &quot; when organisms reproduce, there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (e.g., the phenomenon of paramutation observed in maize ). Although most of these multigenerational epigenetic traits are gradually lost over several generations, the possibility remains that multigenerational epigenetics could be another aspect to evolution and adaptation. A sequestered germ line or Weismann barrier is specific to animals, and epigenetic inheritance is expected to be far more common in plants and microbes. These effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the modern evolutionary synthesis.

The modification of epigenetic features associated with a region of DNA allows organisms, on a multigenerational time scale, to switch between phenotypes that express and repress that particular gene. [ Rando OJ, Verstrepen KJ Timescales of genetic and epigenetic inheritance Cell 128 4 655–68 2007 February 17320504 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.023 ] When the DNA sequence of the region is not mutated, this change is reversible. It has also been speculated that organisms may take advantage of differential mutation rates associated with epigenetic features to control the mutation rates of particular genes. Interestingly, recent analysis have suggested that members of the APOBEC/AID family of cytosine deaminases are capable of simultaneously mediating genetic and epigenetic inheritance using similar molecular mechanisms.

Predetermined epigenesis is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA to the functional maturation of the protein. Predetermined meaning that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic epigenesis on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is also associated with genomic imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.

In announcing the funding, government officials noted that epigenetics has the potential to explain mechanisms of aging, human development, and the origins of cancer, heart disease, mental illness, as well as several other conditions. Some investigators, like Randy Jirtle, PhD, of Duke University Medical Center, think epigenetics may ultimately turn out to have a greater role in disease than genetics.

DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been associated with a large number of human malignancies and found in two distinct forms: hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue. Hypermethylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that repress transcription via promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. [ Wong NC, Craig JM Epigenetics: A Reference Manual Caister Academic Press Norfolk, England 2011 1-904455-88-3 ] [ Variant histones H2A in cancer ] The histone variants of the H2A family are highly conserved in mammals, playing critical roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering chromatin structure. One of the key H2A variants, H2A.X, marks DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to restore genomic integrity. Another variant, H2A.Z, plays an important role in both gene activation and repression. A high level of H2A.Z expression is ubiquitously detected in many cancers and is significantly associated with cellular proliferation and genomic instability. [ Cancer treatment ] Current research has shown that epigenetic pharmaceuticals could be a putative replacement or adjuvant therapy for currently accepted treatment methods such as radiation and chemotherapy, or could enhance the effects of these current treatments.

Drug development has focused mainly on Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC), including the introduction of the new pharmaceutical Vorinostat, a HDAC inhibitor, to the market.

Bacteria make use of DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.

This can provide a survival advantage under adverse conditions. This is an example of epigenetic regulation enabling unicellular organisms to respond rapidly to environmental stress. Prions can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without modification of the genome.
