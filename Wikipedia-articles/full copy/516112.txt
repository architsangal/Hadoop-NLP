[ Miranda Salvador Hans Hermann Groër http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-g.htm#Groer The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church 19 April 2010 ] [ Biography ] Groër was born in Vienna to Sudeten-German parents, with whom he moved in 1929 to Czechoslovakia, where they remained for the next decade. He attended seminaries in Hollabrunn and Vienna (where he received his doctorate in theology ) before being ordained to the priesthood on 12 April 1942 by Cardinal Theodor Innitzer. Groër then served as a chaplain in Petronell and Bad Vöslau until 1946, when he began work as Prefect of Studies at the minor seminary of Hollabrunn. He entered the Order of Saint Benedict in 1974 and took the name Hermann upon his solemn profession of vows on 8 September 1980. The same year saw Groër named as the spiritual director of the Legion of Mary for Austria. On 15 July 1986, he was appointed the fifteenth Archbishop of Vienna, succeeding Cardinal Franz König. Groër received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 September from Cardinal König, with Archbishop Karl Berg and Bishop Stefan László serving as co-consecrators. He was created Cardinal Priest of Santi Gioacchino ed Anna al Tuscolano by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 28 June 1988. [ Sexual abuse of children ] In 1995, a former student of Groër&apos;s accused him of sexual molestation, followed, shortly thereafter, by a number of other former students and monks who emerged to make similar allegations. The Holy See then elevated Christoph Schönborn, OP, an auxiliary bishop of Vienna, to Coadjutor archbishop on 13 April 1995. Groër retired as Archbishop of Vienna later in 1995 (the Pope having accepted the resignation Groër had been required to submit on 13 October 1994 upon turning 75), and was succeeded by his coadjutor. Groër then moved to the Roggendorf monastery, where he served as prior until 1998. His time at the monastery ended after the emergence of further allegations, at which point Groër withdrew from public life. He continued to work as a confessor in women&apos;s monasteries, received visitors and said Mass. Suffering from cancer, his health declined rapidly. { Gerhard Heger, Hans Hermann Groër, Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon 26 (2006), pp. 529-534. } [ Corley Felix 27 March 2003 Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer: Disgraced Archbishop of Vienna The Independent London, UK http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cardinal-hans-hermann-groer-592499.html 17 April 2010 ] Austria&apos;s statute of limitations meant that it was not possible to prosecute Groër, although the Church did choose to investigate the case in 1998.

Groër continued to deny the allegations until his death. [ Death and Burial Services ] { Ex-voto tablet. } Groër died on 24 March 2003 of pneumonia at a hospital in Sankt Pölten, about 40 miles west of Vienna, where he had been treated for cancer. Cardinal Schönborn presided at the requiem Mass in St. Stephan&apos;s Cathedral and in his sermon honored his predecessor&apos;s accomplishments in strengthening Marian devotions in the Archdiocese as well as fostering priestly and monastic vocations. On the next day, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne and Member of the Curia&apos;s Congregation for Bishops, presided at the Mass of Christian Burial and said in his sermon that he regretted not having stood as firmly behind Groër as he should have. Cardinal Franz König was also in attendance. Meisner said: &quot; I was ashamed and disturbed, because I did not at all feel like I had stood by him firmly enough. &quot; { http://www.gottgeweiht.at/gg401predigtkardinalmeisner.html Transcript of Meisner&apos;s sermon in German } The deceased Archbishop of Vienna was buried in the cemetery of the Cistercian women&apos;s monastery of Marienfeld, Austria, which he had been instrumental in founding in 1974. { Gerhard Heger, Hans Hermann Groër, Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon 26 (2006), pp. 529-534. } [ References ] [ External links ] The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church Catholic-Hierarchy [ ca ] [ Franz König ] [ Archbishop of Vienna 1986–1995 ] [ Christoph Schönborn ] [ Inaugural appointment ] [ Cardinal Priest of Santi Gioacchino ed Anna al Tuscolano 1988–2003 ] [ Keith Michael Patrick O&apos;Brien ] [ Groer, Hans Hermann Catholic cardinal 13 October 1919 Vienna, Austria 24 March 2003 Sankt Pölten, Austria ] Category:1919 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Archbishops and bishops of Vienna Category:Austrian cardinals Category:Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in Austria Category:Austrian people of Sudeten-German descent Category:People from Vienna Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:Sudeten-German people de:Hans Hermann Groër fr:Hans Hermann Groër it:Hans Hermann Groër la:Ioannes Arminius Groër nl:Hans Hermann Groër no:Hans Hermann Groër pl:Hans Hermann Groër ru:Гроэр, Ганс Герман sl:Hans Hermann Groër
