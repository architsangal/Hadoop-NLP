[ In the Annuario Pontificio, the list of popes does not assign numbers to the positions in its listing. nb ] The office of the pope is known as the papacy. His ecclesiastical jurisdiction is often called the &quot; Holy See &quot; (Sancta Sedes in Latin), or the &quot; Apostolic See &quot; based upon the Church tradition that the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul were martyr ed in Rome.

Over the centuries, papal claims of spiritual authority have been ever more clearly expressed, culminating in 1870 with the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for rare occasions when the pope speaks ex cathedra —literally &quot; from the chair (of St. Peter ) &quot; —to issue a formal definition of faith or morals. The first explicit such occasion (after the proclamation), and so far the last, was in 1950, with the definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary. [ History ] [ History of the papacy ] [ Title and etymology ] The word pope derives from Greek πάππας meaning &quot; Father &quot;.

Bestowing the title on Rome&apos;s Pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria&apos;s, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this ecclesiastical fact. Indeed, even in the west, where in the 6th century the title began to be used particularly of the Bishop of Rome, it was only in 1075 that Pope Gregory VII issued a declaration that has been widely interpreted as stating this by then established convention.

[ John O&apos;Grady The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature 143 0-8091-3740-2 ] The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus personally appointed Peter as leader of the Church and in its dogmatic constitution Lumen Gentium makes a clear distinction between apostles and bishops, presenting the latter as the successors of the former, with the pope as successor of Peter in that he is head of the bishops as Peter was head of the apostles.

Gradually, episcopacies were established in metropolitan areas. [ John O&apos;Grady The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature 140 0-8091-3740-2 ] Antioch may have developed such a structure before Rome. In Rome there were many who claimed to be the rightful bishop though again Irenaeus stressed the validity of one line of bishops from the time of St. Peter up to his contemporary Pope Victor I and listed them. [ J Stevenson A New Eusebius 114–115 0-281-00802-7 ] Some [ November 2010 ] writers claim that the emergence of a single bishop in Rome probably did not occur until the middle of the 2nd century. In their view, Linus, Cletus and Clement were possibly prominent presbyter-bishops but not necessarily monarchical bishops. In the 1st century and early 2nd century the Holy See had pre-eminence and prominence in the Church as a whole. { &quot; From an historical perspective, there is no conclusive documentary evidence from the first century or the early decades of the second of the exercise of, or even the claim to, a primacy of the Roman bishop or to a connection with Peter, although documents from this period accord the church at Rome some kind of pre‑eminence &quot; ( Emmanuel Clapsis, Papal Primacy, extract from Orthodoxy in Conversation (2000), p. 110); and &quot; The see of Rome, whose prominence was associated with the deaths of Peter and Paul, became the principle center in matters concerning the universal Church &quot; (Clapsis, p. 102). The same writer quotes with approval the words of } { Joseph Ratzinger : &quot; In Phanar, on 25 July 1976, when } { Patriarch Athenegoras addressed } { the visiting pope as Peter&apos;s successor, the first in honor among us, and the presider over charity, this great church leader was expressing the essential content of the declarations of the primacy of the first millennium &quot; (Clapsis, p. 113). } [ Early Christianity (c. 30–325) ] It seems that at first the terms &quot; episcopos &quot; and &quot; presbyter &quot; were used interchangeably. { Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1997 edition revised 2005, page 211: &quot; It seems that at first the terms &apos;episcopos&apos; and &apos;presbyter&apos; were used interchangeably... &quot; } The consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the 1st and 2nd centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable. { Cambridge History of Christianity, volume 1, 2006, &quot; The general consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the first and second centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable. &quot; } There was probably no single &quot; monarchical &quot; bishop in Rome before the middle of the 2nd century...and likely later. &quot; { Cambridge History of Christianity, volume 1, 2006, page 418: &quot; Probably there was no single &apos;monarchical&apos; bishop in Rome before the middle of the second century...and likely later. } Other scholars and historians disagree, citing the historical records of St. Ignatius of Antioch and St. Irenaeus who recorded the linear succession of Bishops of Rome (the popes) up until their own times. They also cite the importance accorded to the popes in the ecumenical councils, including the early ones. [ http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9101fea2.asp PAPAL AUTHORITY AT THE EARLIEST COUNCILS (This Rock: January 1991) Catholic.com 2011-11-21 ] In the early Christian era, Rome and a few other cities had claims on the leadership of worldwide Church. James the Just, known as &quot; the brother of the Lord &quot;, served as head of the Jerusalem church, which is still honored as the &quot; Mother Church &quot; in Orthodox tradition. Alexandria had been a center of Jewish learning and became a center of Christian learning. Rome had a large congregation early in the apostolic period whom Paul the Apostle addressed in his Epistle to the Romans, and according to tradition Paul was martyred there. During the 1st century of the Church (ca. 30–130), the Roman capital became recognized as a Christian center of exceptional importance. Clement I at the end of the 1st century wrote an epistle to the Church in Corinth intervening in a major dispute, and apologizing for not having taken action earlier. { Chadwick, Henry, Oxford History of Christianity, OUP, quote: &quot; Towards the latter part of the 1st century, Rome&apos;s presiding cleric named Clement wrote on behalf of his church to remonstrate with the Corinthian Christians who had ejected clergy without either financial or charismatic endowment in favor of a fresh lot; Clement apologized not for intervening but for not having acted sooner. Moreover, during the second century the Roman community&apos;s leadership was evident in its generous alms to poorer churches. About 165 they erected monuments to their martyred apostles, to Peter in a necropolis on the Vatican Hill, to Paul on the road to Ostia, at the traditional sites of their burial. Roman bishops were already conscious of being custodians of the authentic tradition of true interpretation of the apostolic writings. In the conflict with Gnosticism Rome played a decisive role, and likewise in the deep division in Asia Minor created by the claims of the Montanist prophets. &quot; } However, there are only a few other references of that time to recognition of the authoritative primacy of the Roman See outside of Rome. In the Ravenna Document of 13 October 2007, theologians chosen by the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches stated: &quot; 41. Both sides agree...that Rome, as the Church that &apos;presides in love&apos; according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch ( &apos;&apos;To the Romans&apos;&apos;, Prologue), occupied the first place in the taxis, and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the protos among the patriarchs. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the Bishop of Rome as protos, a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium. &quot; In the late 2nd century AD, there were more manifestations of Roman authority over other churches. In 189, assertion of the primacy of the Church of Rome may be indicated in Irenaeus of Lyons &apos;s Against Heresies (3:3:2): &quot; With [the Church of Rome], because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree...and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition. &quot; In AD 195, Victor I, in what is seen as an exercise of Roman authority over other churches, excommunicated the Quartodecimans for observing Easter on the 14th of Nisan, the date of the Jewish Passover, a tradition handed down by John the Evangelist (see Easter controversy ). Celebration of Easter on a Sunday, as insisted on by the pope, is the system that has prevailed (see computus ).

In 325, the First Council of Nicaea condemned Arianism, declaring trinitarianism dogmatic, and in its sixth canon recognized the special role of the sees of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch. { &quot; Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria has jurisdiction over them all, since a similar arrangement is the custom for the Bishop of Rome.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, barbarian tribes were converted to Arian Christianity or Catholicism; { Le Goff, Jacques (2000). Medieval Civilization. Barnes &amp; Noble. p. 14, 21. ISBN 0-631-17566-0. } Clovis I, king of the Franks, was the first important barbarian ruler to convert to Catholicism rather than Arianism, allying himself with the papacy. Other tribes, such as the Visigoths, later abandoned Arianism in favour of Catholicism. [ Medieval Age ] { Carlo Saraceni, c. 1610, Rome. } After the fall of Rome, the pope served as a source of authority and continuity. Gregory the Great (c 540–604) administered the church with strict reform. From an ancient senatorial family, Gregory worked with the stern judgement and discipline typical of ancient Roman rule. Theologically, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook; his popular writings are full of dramatic miracles, potent relics, demons, angels, ghosts, and the approaching end of the world. Gregory&apos;s successors were largely dominated by the Exarch of Ravenna, the Byzantine emperor&apos;s representative in Italy. These humiliations, the weakening of the empire in the face of Muslim expansion, and the inability of the emperor to protect the papal estates against the Lombards, made Pope Stephen II turn from Emperor Constantine V. He appealed to the Franks to protect his lands. Pepin the Short subdued the Lombards and donated Italian land to the papacy. When Leo III crowned Charlemagne (800), he established the precedent that, in the West, no man would be emperor without anointment by a pope. { Durant, Will. The Age of Faith. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972. Chapter XXI: Christianity in Conflict 529-1085. p. 517–551 } From the seventh century it became common for European monarchies and nobility to found churches and perform investiture or deposition of clergy in their states and fiefdoms, their personal interests causing corruption among the clergy. { História Global Brasil e Geral.

ISBN 978-85-02-05256-7 } { MOVIMENTOS DE RENOVAÇÃO E REFORMA. 2009-10-01. } This practice had become common because often the prelates and secular rulers were also participants in public life. { Feudalismo } To combat this and other practices that had corrupted the Church between the years 900 and 1050, centres emerged promoting ecclesiastical reform, the most important being the Abbey of Cluny, which spread its ideals throughout Europe. This reform movement gained strength with the election of Pope Gregory VII in 1073, who adopted a series of measures in the movement known as the Gregorian Reform, in order to fight strongly against simony and the abuse of civil power and try to restore ecclesiastical discipline, including celibacy. The conflict between popes and secular autocratic rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Henry I of England, known as the question of investiture, was only resolved in 1122, by the Concordat of Worms, in which the pope decreed that clerics were to be invested by clerical leaders, and temporal rulers by lay investiture. Soon after, Pope Alexander III began reforms that would lead to the establishment of canon law. Since the beginning of the seventh century the Islamic Caliphate had conquered much of the southern Mediterranean, and represented a threat to Christianity. { Vidmar, John (2005). The Catholic Church Through the Ages. Paulist Press. p. 94.

A Concise History of the Catholic Church. Doubleday. pp. 140-141, 192. ISBN 0-385-50584-1. } The low point of the papacy was 867–1049. The papacy came under the control of vying political factions. Popes were variously imprisoned, starved, killed, and deposed by force. The family of a certain papal official made and unmade popes for fifty years. The official&apos;s great-grandson, Pope John XII, held orgies of debauchery in the Lateran palace. Emperor Otto I of Germany had John accused in an ecclesiastical court, which deposed him and elected a layman as Pope Leo VIII. John mutilated the Imperial representatives in Rome and had himself reinstated as pope. Conflict between the Emperor and the papacy continued, and eventually dukes in league with the emperor were buying bishops and popes almost openly. In 1049, Leo IX became pope, at last a pope with the character to face the papacy&apos;s problems. He traveled to the major cities of Europe to deal with the church&apos;s moral problems firsthand, notably simony and clerical marriage and concubinage. With his long journey, he restored the prestige of the papacy in the north. [ East–West Schism to Reformation (1054–1517) ] { Western Schism lasted from 1378 to 1417. } The East and West churches split definitively in 1054. This fracture was caused more by political events than by slight diversities of creed. Popes had galled the emperors by siding with the king of the Franks, crowning a rival Roman emperor, appropriating the Exarchate of Ravenna, and driving into Greek Italy. { Durant, Will. The Age of Faith. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972 } In the Middle Ages, popes struggled with monarchs over power. From 1309 to 1377, the pope resided not in Rome but in Avignon. The Avignon Papacy was notorious for greed and corruption. [ Will Durant Durant Will The Reformation New York Simon and Schuster 1957 I. The Roman Catholic Church. 1300–1517 3–25 ] During this period, the pope was effectively an ally of France, alienating France&apos;s enemies, such as England. [ Will Durant Durant Will The Reformation New York Simon and Schuster 1957 II. England: Wyclif, Chaucer, and the Great Revolt. 1308–1400 26–57 ] The pope was understood to have the power to draw on the &quot; treasury &quot; of merit built up by the saints and by Christ, so that he could grant indulgences, reducing one&apos;s time in purgatory. The concept that a monetary fine or donation accompanied contrition, confession, and prayer eventually gave way to the common assumption that indulgences depended on a simple monetary contribution. The popes condemned misunderstandings and abuses, but were too pressed for income to exercise effective control over indulgences. Popes also contended with the cardinals, who sometimes attempted to assert the authority of councils over the pope&apos;s. Conciliar theory holds that the supreme authority of the church lies with a General Council, not with the pope. Its foundations were laid early in the 13th century, and it culminated in the 15th century. The failure of the conciliar theory to gain broad acceptance after the 15th century is taken as a factor in the Protestant Reformation. { &quot; Conciliar theory. &quot; Cross, FL, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. } Various anti-popes challenged papal authority, especially during the Western Schism (1378–1417). In this schism, the papacy had returned to Rome from Avignon, but an anti-pope was installed in Avignon, as if to extend the papacy there. The Eastern Church continued to decline with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, undercutting Constantinople&apos;s claim to equality with Rome. Twice an Eastern Emperor tried to force the Eastern Church to reunify with the West. Papal claims of superiority were a sticking point in reunification, which failed in any event. In the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople. [ Reformation to present (1517 to today) ] { Pope Paul III (1534–49) initiated the } { Council of Trent (1545–63), which established the triumph of the papacy over those who sought to reconcile with Protestants or oppose Papal claims. } Protestant Reformers criticized the papacy as corrupt and characterized the pope as the antichrist. Popes instituted a Catholic Reformation (1560–1648), which addressed the challenges of the Protestant Reformation and instituted internal reforms. Pope Paul III initiated the Council of Trent, whose definitions of doctrine and whose reforms sealed the triumph of the papacy over elements in the church that sought conciliation with Protestants and opposed papal claims. { &quot; Counter-Reformation. &quot; Cross, FL, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 } Gradually forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues. In 1870, the First Vatican Council proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility for those rare occasions the pope speaks ex cathedra when issuing a solemn definition of faith or morals. { Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt &amp; co. 1994. } Later the same year, Victor Emmanuel II seized Rome from the pope&apos;s control and substantially completed the unification of Italy. In 1929, the Lateran Treaty between Italy and Pope Pius XI established the Vatican City State, guaranteeing papal independence from secular rule. In 1950, the pope defined the Assumption of Mary as dogma, the only time that a pope has spoken ex cathedra since papal infallibility was explicitly declared. The Petrine Doctrine is still controversial as an issue of doctrine that continues to divide the eastern and western churches and separate Protestants from Rome. [ Saint Peter and the origin of the office ] [ Primacy of Simon Peter ] The dogma s and traditions of the Roman Catholic Church teach that the institution of the papacy was first mandated by interpretations of several Biblical passages, mainly Matthew 16:13–19: { Also Isaiah 22:20–22, John 21:15–17, Luke 12:41, and Luke 22:31–32. } [ When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? …And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. ] Catholics believe that this passage shows Jesus establishing his church on the shoulders of Simon son of John (Peter). The Catholic scholarly community agrees with the church&apos;s interpretation that the &quot; rock &quot; Jesus refers to in this passage is Peter, an interpretation that some other scholars agree with. [ Daniel William O&apos;Connor Saint Peter the Apostle Encyclopædia Britannica 27 November 2009 http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453832/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle the consensus of the great majority of scholars today ] Since the Protestant reformation, Protestant scholars have asserted that the &quot; rock &quot; Jesus referred to was Jesus himself, or Peter&apos;s faith. The argument follows that, when Jesus says, &quot; You are Peter ( [ Πέτροζ ] (Petros), small stone as a pebble), and upon this rock [ πέτρα ] (petra), a large stone edifice as a cliff or ledge) I will build my Church &quot;, Jesus is pointing to something much larger than Peter, based on the clear distinction in the Greek of a small stone and a large rock cliff as well as the Greek grammatical structure, as the basis for his kingdom, not making a pope of Peter as Catholics claim.

And it is certain, that as he is spoken of in Scripture, as the only foundation of the Church, so this is that which the apostles and evangelists laid in their preaching.

If Christ be not the Son of God, Christianity is a cheat, and the church is a mere chimera; our preaching is vain, your faith is vain, and you are yet in your sins, 1 Corinthians 15:14-17. If Jesus be not the Christ, those that own him are not of the church, but deceivers and deceived. 2.

[ Election, death and resignation ] [ Election ] [ Papal conclave ] { Pietro Perugino (1492) } The pope was originally chosen by those senior clergy men resident in and near Rome. In 1059 the electorate was restricted to the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, and the individual votes of all Cardinal Electors were made equal in 1179. Pope Urban VI, elected 1378, was the last pope who was not already a cardinal at his election. Canon law requires that if a layman or non-bishop is elected, he receives episcopal consecration from the Dean of the College of Cardinals before assuming the Pontificate. Under present canon law, the pope is elected by the cardinal electors, comprising those cardinals who are under the age of 80. The Second Council of Lyons was convened on 7 May 1274, to regulate the election of the pope. This Council decreed that the cardinal electors must meet within ten days of the pope&apos;s death, and that they must remain in seclusion until a pope has been elected; this was prompted by the three-year Sede Vacante following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. By the mid-16th century, the electoral process had evolved into its present form, allowing for variation in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors. Traditionally, the vote was conducted by acclamation, by selection (by committee), or by plenary vote. Acclamation was the simplest procedure, consisting entirely of a voice vote, and was last used in 1621. Pope John Paul II abolished vote by acclamation and by selection by committee, and henceforth election will be by full vote by ballot of the Sacred College of Cardinals. { Konstanz where } { Pope Martin V was elected } The election of the pope almost always takes place in the Sistine Chapel, in a sequestered meeting called a &quot; conclave &quot; (so called because the cardinal electors are theoretically locked in, cum clave, i.e., with key, until they elect a new pope). Three cardinals are chosen by lot to collect the votes of absent cardinal electors (by reason of illness), three are chosen by lot to count the votes, and three are chosen by lot to review the count of the votes. The ballots are distributed and each cardinal elector writes the name of his choice on it and pledges aloud that he is voting for &quot; one whom under God I think ought to be elected &quot; before folding and depositing his vote on a plate atop a large chalice placed on the altar (in the 2005 conclave, a special urn was used for this purpose instead of a chalice and plate). The plate is then used to drop the ballot into the chalice, making it difficult for electors to insert multiple ballots. Before being read, the ballots are counted while still folded; if the number of ballots does not match the number of electors, the ballots are burned unopened and a new vote is held. Otherwise, each ballot is read aloud by the presiding Cardinal, who pierces the ballot with a needle and thread, stringing all the ballots together and tying the ends of the thread to ensure accuracy and honesty. Balloting continues until someone is elected by a two-thirds majority. { With the promulgation of } { Universi Dominici Gregis in 1996, a simple majority after a deadlock of twelve days was allowed, but this was revoked by Pope } { Benedict XVI by } { motu proprio in 2007. } { Habemus Papam &quot; after the election of Pope Martin V } One of the most prominent aspects of the papal election process is the means by which the results of a ballot are announced to the world. Once the ballots are counted and bound together, they are burned in a special stove erected in the Sistine Chapel, with the smoke escaping through a small chimney visible from St. Peter&apos;s Square. The ballots from an unsuccessful vote are burned along with a chemical compound to create black smoke, or fumata nera. (Traditionally, wet straw was used to produce the black smoke, but this was not completely reliable. The chemical compound is more reliable than the straw.) When a vote is successful, the ballots are burned alone, sending white smoke (fumata bianca) through the chimney and announcing to the world the election of a new pope. At the end of the conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI, church bells were also rung to signal that a new pope had been chosen. The Dean of the College of Cardinals then asks two solemn questions of the cardinal who has been elected. First he asks, &quot; Do you freely accept your election? &quot; If he replies with the word &quot; Accepto &quot;, his reign begins at that instant, not at the inauguration ceremony several days afterward. The Dean then asks, &quot; By what name shall you be called? &quot; The new pope then announces the regnal name he has chosen. (If the Dean is elected pope, the Vice Dean performs this task.) The new pope is led through the &quot; Door of Tears &quot; to a dressing room where three sets of white papal vestments (immantatio) await: small, medium, and large. Donning the appropriate vestments and reemerging into the Sistine Chapel, the new pope is given the &quot; Fisherman&apos;s Ring &quot; by the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, whom he first either reconfirms or reappoints. The pope then assumes a place of honor as the rest of the cardinals wait in turn to offer their first &quot; obedience &quot; (adoratio) and to receive his blessing. The Senior Cardinal Deacon then announces from a balcony over St. Peter&apos;s Square the following proclamation : Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum! Habemus Papam! ( &quot; I announce to you a great joy! We have a pope! &quot; ). He then announces the new pope&apos;s Christian name along with his newly chosen regnal name. Until 1978 the pope&apos;s election was followed in a few days by the Papal Coronation. A procession with great pomp and circumstance formed from the Sistine Chapel to St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, with the newly elected pope borne in the sedia gestatoria. There, after a solemn Papal Mass, the new pope was crowned with the triregnum (papal tiara) and he gave for the first time as pope the famous blessing Urbi et Orbi ( &quot; to the City [Rome] and to the World &quot; ). Another renowned part of the coronation was the lighting of a bundle of flax at the top of a gilded pole, which would flare brightly for a moment and then promptly extinguish, with the admonition Sic transit gloria mundi ( &quot; Thus passes worldly glory &quot; ). A similar warning against papal hubris made on this occasion was the traditional exclamation &quot; Annos Petri non videbis &quot;, reminding the newly crowned pope that he would not live to see his rule lasting as long as that of St. Peter, who according to tradition headed the church for 35 years and has thus far been the longest reigning pope in the history of the Catholic Church. { St } { Augustine, speaking of the honours paid to bishops in his time, mentions the absides gradatae (apses with steps, a reference to the seating arrangement for the presbyters in the apse of the church, with the bishop in the middle ( William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, &apos;&apos;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, &quot; elevated stalls &quot; in the Sparrow-Simpson translation (p. 83), and appearing as &quot; thrones ascended by flights of steps &quot; in the Cunningham translation ), and } { cathedra e velatae (canopied thrones, appearing as &quot; canopied pulpits &quot; in both those translations) - Letter 203 in the old arrangement, 23 in the chronological rearrangement } A traditionalist Catholic belief claims the existence of a Papal Oath sworn, at their coronation, by all popes from Pope Agatho to Pope Paul VI, but which since the abolition of the coronation ceremony is no longer used. There is no reliable authority for this claim. The Latin term sede vacante ( &quot; while the see is vacant &quot; ) { Ablative absolute, equivalent to a temporal clause } refers to a papal interregnum, the period between the death of a pope and the election of his successor. From this term is derived the term sedevacantism, which designates a category of dissident Catholics who maintain that there is no canonically and legitimately elected pope, and that there is therefore a Sede Vacante. One of the most common reasons for holding this belief is the idea that the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and especially the replacement of the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Paul VI are heretical, and that those responsible for initiating and maintaining these changes are heretics and not true popes. [ http://www.cmri.org/theolog.htm Theological Position: Sede Vacante Cmri.org 2011-11-21 ] { &quot; Pope Michael I &quot; } [ http://www.novusordowatch.org/benedict.htm Exposing the Vatican II Pseudo-Catholic Church Novusordowatch.org 2011-11-21 ] Sedevacantist s are considered to be schismatics by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church. For centuries, from 1378 on, those elected to the papacy were predominantly Italians. Prior to the election of the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla as Pope John Paul II in 1978, the last non-Italian was Pope Adrian VI of the Netherlands, elected in 1522. John Paul II was followed by the German-born Benedict XVI, leading some to believe that, although Rome is in Italy, Italian domination of the papacy is over. [ Death ] { Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 2005, presided over by Cardinal Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI } The current regulations regarding a papal interregnum —that is, a sede vacante ( &quot; vacant seat &quot; )—were promulgated by John Paul II in his 1996 document Universi Dominici Gregis. During the &quot; Sede Vacante &quot;, the Sacred College of Cardinals, composed of the pope&apos;s principal advisors and assistants, is collectively responsible for the government of the Church and of the Vatican itself, under the direction of the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church; however, canon law specifically forbids the cardinals from introducing any innovation in the government of the Church during the vacancy of the Holy See. Any decision that requires the assent of the pope has to wait until the new pope has been elected and accepts office. In recent centuries it was traditional, when a pope was judged to have died, for the Cardinal Chamberlain to confirm the death ceremonially by gently tapping the pope&apos;s head thrice with a silver hammer, calling his birth name each time. This custom was not followed at the death of Pope John Paul I { Sullivan, George E. Pope John Paul II: The People&apos;s Pope. Boston: Walker &amp; Company, 1984. } and was not revived upon the death of Pope John Paul II.

The Pope&apos;s seals are defaced, to keep them from ever being used again, and his personal apartment is sealed. The body then lies in state for several days before being interred in the crypt of a leading church or cathedral; all who have died in the 20th and 21st centuries have been interred in St. Peter&apos;s Basilica. A nine-day period of mourning (novendialis) follows the interment. [ Resignation ] [ Papal resignation ] The Code of Canon Law 332 §2 states, &quot; If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone. &quot; [ Titles ] [ The Pope His Holiness Your Holiness Holy Father NA ] [ Official list of titles ] The official list of titles of the Pope, in the order in which they are given in the Annuario Pontificio, is: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City, Servant of the Servants of God. { Annuario Pontificio, published annually by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, p. 23*.

Pope Marcellinus (d. 304) is the first Bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title &quot; Pope &quot; used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome. From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century, when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome. In Eastern Christianity, where the title &quot; Pope &quot; is used also of the Bishop of Alexandria, the Bishop of Rome is often referred to as the &quot; Pope of Rome &quot;, regardless of whether the speaker or writer is in communion with Rome or not. [ Vicar of Jesus Christ ] &quot; Vicar of Jesus Christ &quot; (Vicarius Iesu Christi) is one of the official titles of the Pope given in the Annuario Pontificio. It is commonly used in the slightly abbreviated form &quot; Vicar of Christ &quot; (Vicarius Christi). While it is only one of the terms with which the Pope is referred to as &quot; Vicar &quot;, it is &quot; more expressive of his supreme headship of the Church on earth, which he bears in virtue of the commission of Christ and with vicarial power derived from him &quot;, a vicarial power believed to have been conferred on Saint Peter when Christ said to him: &quot; Feed my lambs...Feed my sheep &quot; ( [ John 21:16-17 ] ). [ http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm Vicar of Christ 27 January 2010 Catholic Encyclopedia; New Advent ] The first record of the application of this title to a Bishop of Rome appears in a synod of 495 with reference to Pope Gelasius I. { McBrien, Richard P.

Pontifex Maximus, similar in meaning to Summus Pontifex, is a title commonly found in inscriptions on papal buildings, paintings, statues and coins, usually abbreviated as &quot; Pont.

It was not reserved for the pope until the 13th century. The documents of the Second Vatican Council reinforced the understanding of this title as a reference to the pope&apos;s role as a function of collegial authority, in which the Bishop of Rome serves the world&apos;s bishops. [ Patriarch of the West ] From 1863 until 2005, the Annuario Pontificio included also the title &quot; Patriarch of the West &quot;. This title was first used by Pope Theodore I in 642, and was only used occasionally. Indeed, it did not begin to appear in the pontifical yearbook until 1863. On 22 March 2006, the Vatican released a statement explaining this omission on the grounds of expressing a &quot; historical and theological reality &quot; and of &quot; being useful to ecumenical dialogue &quot;. The title Patriarch of the West symbolized the pope&apos;s special relationship with, and jurisdiction over, the Latin Church—and the omission of the title neither symbolizes in any way a change in this relationship, nor distorts the relationship between the Holy See and the Eastern Churches, as solemnly proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council.

In Spanish and Italian, &quot; Beatísimo/Beatissimo Padre &quot; (Most Blessed Father) is often used in preference to &quot; Santísimo/Santissimo Padre &quot; (Most Holy Father). In the medieval period, &quot; Dominus Apostolicus &quot; ( &quot; the Apostolic Lord &quot; ) was also used. [ Signature ] As indicated above, the Pope normally signs documents using the title &quot; Papa &quot; in the abbreviated form &quot; PP. &quot; and with the numeral, as in &quot; Benedictus PP. XVI &quot; (Pope Benedict  XVI). Exceptions are bulls of canonization and decrees of ecumenical councils, which the Pope signs with the formula, &quot; Ego N. Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae &quot;, without the numeral, as in &quot; Ego Benedictus Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae &quot; (I, Benedict, Bishop of the catholic/universal Church). [ http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Curia_Romana Classic Encyclopedia: &apos; &amp; #39;Curia Romana&apos; &amp; #39; 1911encyclopedia.org 2006-10-06 2010-08-11 ] The Pope&apos;s signature is followed, in bulls of canonization, by those of all the cardinals resident in Rome, and in decrees of ecumenical councils, by the signatures of the other bishops participating in the council, each signing as Bishop of a particular see. Papal bull s are headed N. Episcopus Servus Servorum Dei ( &quot; Name, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God &quot; ). In general, they are not signed by the Pope, but Pope John Paul  II introduced in the mid-1980s the custom by which the Pope signs not only bulls of canonization but also, using his normal signature, such as &quot; Benedictus PP. XVI &quot;, bulls of nomination of bishops. [ Regalia and insignia ] [ Papal regalia and insignia ] &quot; Triregnum &quot;, also called the &quot; tiara &quot; or &quot; triple crown &quot;, represents the pope&apos;s three functions as &quot; supreme pastor &quot;, &quot; supreme teacher &quot; and &quot; supreme priest &quot;. Recent popes have not, however, worn the triregnum, though it remains the symbol of the papacy and has not been abolished. In liturgical ceremonies the Pope wear an episcopal mitre (an erect cloth hat). Pastoral Staff topped by a crucifix, a custom established before the 13th century (see papal cross ). Pallium, or pall, a circular band of fabric worn around the neck over the chasuble. It forms a yoke about the neck, breast and shoulders and has two pendants hanging down in front and behind, and is ornamented with six crosses. Previously, the pallium worn by the Pope was identical to those he granted to the primates, but in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI began to use a distinct papal pallium that is larger than the primatial, and was adorned with red crosses instead of black. &quot; Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven &quot;, the image of two keys, one gold and one silver. The silver key symbolizes the power to bind and loose on Earth, and the gold key the power to bind and loose in Heaven. Ring of the Fisherman, a gold ring decorated with a depiction of St. Peter in a boat casting his net, with the Pope&apos;s name around it. Umbraculum (better known in the Italian form ombrellino) is a canopy or umbrella consisting of alternating red and gold stripes, which used to be carried above the pope in processions. Sedia gestatoria, a mobile throne carried by twelve footmen (palafrenieri) in red uniforms, accompanied by two attendants bearing flabella (fans made of white ostrich feathers), and sometimes a large canopy, carried by eight attendants. The use of the flabella was discontinued by Pope John Paul I. The use of the sedia gestatoria was discontinued by Pope John Paul II. { coat of arms of the Holy See. That of the State of Vatican City is the same except that the positions of the gold and silver keys are interchanged. } [ http://www.fotw.net/flags/va%29.html Vatican City (Holy See) - The Keys and Coat of Arms Fotw.net 2010-08-11 ] In heraldry, each pope has his own Papal Coat of Arms. Though unique for each pope, the arms are always surmounted by the two keys in saltire (i.e., crossed over one another so as to form an X) behind the escutcheon (shield) (one silver key and one gold key, tied with a red cord), and above them a silver triregnum with three gold crowns and red infulae ( lappet s —two strips of fabric hanging from the back of the triregnum which fall over the neck and shoulders when worn). This is blazon ed : &quot; two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or &quot; ). With the recent election of Benedict XVI in 2005, his personal coat of arms eliminated the papal tiara; a mitre with three horizontal lines is used in its place, with the pallium, a papal symbol of authority more ancient than the tiara, the use of which is also granted to metropolitan archbishops as a sign of communion with the See of Rome, was added underneath of the shield. The distinctive feature of the crossed keys behind the shield was maintained. The omission of the tiara in the Pope&apos;s personal coat of arms, however, did not mean the disappearance of it from papal heraldry, since the coat of arms of the Holy See was kept unaltered. The flag most frequently associated with the pope is the yellow and white flag of Vatican City, with the arms of the Holy See (blazoned: &quot; Gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or &quot; ) on the right-hand side (the &quot; fly &quot; ) in the white half of the flag (the left-hand side—the &quot; hoist &quot; —is yellow). The pope&apos;s escucheon does not appear on the flag. This flag was first adopted in 1808, whereas the previous flag had been red and gold, the traditional colors of the papacy. Although Pope Benedict XVI replaced the triregnum with a mitre on his personal coat of arms, it has been retained on the flag.

In its Dogmatic Constitution of the Church of Christ, the Council established the following canons: { The texts of these canons are given in } { Denzinger, Latin original; English translation } &quot; If anyone says that the blessed Apostle Peter was not established by the Lord Christ as the chief of all the apostles, and the visible head of the whole militant Church, or, that the same received great honour but did not receive from the same our Lord Jesus Christ directly and immediately the primacy in true and proper jurisdiction: let him be anathema. { Denzinger 3055 (old numbering, 1823) } If anyone says that it is not from the institution of Christ the Lord Himself, or by divine right that the blessed Peter has perpetual successors in the primacy over the universal Church, or that the Roman Pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in the same primacy, let him be anathema. { Denzinger 3058 (old numbering, 1825) } If anyone thus speaks, that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the universal Church, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the Church spread over the whole world; or, that he possesses only the more important parts, but not the whole plenitude of this supreme power; or that this power of his is not ordinary and immediate, or over the churches altogether and individually, and over the pastors and the faithful altogether and individually: let him be anathema. { Denzinger 3064 (old numbering, 1831) } We, adhering faithfully to the tradition received from the beginning of the Christian faith, to the glory of God, our Saviour, the elevation of the Catholic religion and the salvation of Christian peoples, with the approbation of the sacred Council, teach and explain that the dogma has been divinely revealed: that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when carrying out the duty of the pastor and teacher of all Christians by his supreme apostolic authority he defines a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the universal Church, through the divine assistance promised him in blessed Peter, operates with that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer wished that His church be instructed in defining doctrine on faith and morals; and so such definitions of the Roman Pontiff from himself, but not from the consensus of the Church, are unalterable. But if anyone presumes to contradict this definition of Ours, which may God forbid: let him be anathema. &quot; { Denzinger 3073–3075 (old numbering, 1839–1840) } [ Second Vatican Council ] { Pope Pius XII, wearing the traditional 1877 } { Papal Tiara, is carried through St Peter&apos;s Basilica on a &apos;&apos; } { sedia gestatoria &apos;&apos; c. 1955. } In its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (1964), the Second Vatican Council declared: &quot; Among the principal duties of bishops the preaching of the Gospel occupies an eminent place. For bishops are preachers of the faith, who lead new disciples to Christ, and they are authentic teachers, that is, teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who preach to the people committed to them the faith they must believe and put into practice, and by the light of the Holy Spirit illustrate that faith. They bring forth from the treasury of Revelation new things and old, making it bear fruit and vigilantly warding off any errors that threaten their flock. Bishops, teaching in communion with the Roman Pontiff, are to be respected by all as witnesses to divine and Catholic truth. In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown so that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.... this infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer willed His Church to be endowed in defining doctrine of faith and morals, extends as far as the deposit of Revelation extends, which must be religiously guarded and faithfully expounded. And this is the infallibility which the Roman Pontiff, the head of the college of bishops, enjoys in virtue of his office, when, as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful, who confirms his brethren in their faith, by a definitive act he proclaims a doctrine of faith or morals. And therefore his definitions, of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, are justly styled irreformable, since they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, promised to him in blessed Peter, and therefore they need no approval of others, nor do they allow an appeal to any other judgment. For then the Roman Pontiff is not pronouncing judgment as a private person, but as the supreme teacher of the universal Church, in whom the charism of infallibility of the Church itself is individually present, he is expounding or defending a doctrine of Catholic faith. The infallibility promised to the Church resides also in the body of Bishops, when that body exercises the supreme magisterium with the successor of Peter. To these definitions the assent of the Church can never be wanting, on account of the activity of that same Holy Spirit, by which the whole flock of Christ is preserved and progresses in unity of faith. &quot; [ http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html &apos; &amp; #39;Lumen gentium&apos; &amp; #39;, 25 Vatican.va 2010-08-11 ] [ Politics of the Holy See ] { Pope Pius VII, bishop of Rome, next to } { Cardinal Caprara.

He also possesses a summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, situated on the site of the ancient city of Alba Longa. Until the time of the Avignon Papacy, the residence of the Pope was the Lateran Palace, donated by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. The Pope&apos;s ecclesiastical jurisdiction (the Holy See ) is distinct from his secular jurisdiction (Vatican City). It is the Holy See that conducts international relations; for hundreds of years, the papal court (the Roman Curia ) has functioned as the government of the Catholic Church. The names &quot; Holy See &quot; and &quot; Apostolic See &quot; are ecclesiastical terminology for the ordinary jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome (including the Roman Curia); the pope&apos;s various honors, powers, and privileges within the Catholic Church and the international community derive from his Episcopate of Rome in lineal succession from the Apostle Saint Peter (see Apostolic Succession ). Consequently, Rome has traditionally occupied a central position in the Catholic Church, although this is not necessarily so. The Pope derives his pontificate from being Bishop of Rome but is not required to live there; according to the Latin formula ubi Papa, ibi Curia, wherever the Pope resides is the central government of the Church, provided that the pope is Bishop of Rome. As such, between 1309 and 1378, the popes lived in Avignon, France (see Avignon Papacy ), a period often called the Babylonian Captivity in allusion to the Biblical exile of Israel. Though the Pope is the diocesan Bishop of the Diocese of Rome, he delegates most of the day-to-day work of leading the diocese to the Cardinal Vicar, who assures direct episcopal oversight of the diocese&apos;s pastoral needs, not in his own name but in that of the Pope. The current Cardinal Vicar is Agostino Vallini, who was appointed to the office in June 2008.

This status as a secular and civil ruler was vividly displayed by Pope Leo I &apos;s confrontation with Attila in 452. The first expansion of papal rule outside of Rome came in 728 with the Donation of Sutri, which in turn was substantially increased in 754, when the Frankish ruler Pippin the Younger gave to the pope the land from his conquest of the Lombards. The pope may have utilized the forged Donation of Constantine to gain this land, which formed the core of the Papal States. This document, accepted as genuine until the 15th century, states that Constantine I placed the entire Western Empire of Rome under papal rule. In 800 Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish ruler Charlemagne as Roman Emperor, a major step toward establishing what later became known as the Holy Roman Empire; from that date onward the popes claimed the prerogative to crown the Emperor, though the right fell into disuse after the coronation of Charles V in 1530. Pope Pius VII was present at the coronation of Napoleon I in 1804, but did not actually perform the crowning. As mentioned above, the pope&apos;s sovereignty over the Papal States ended in 1870 with their annexation by Italy. Popes like Alexander VI, an ambitious if spectacularly corrupt politician, and Pope Julius II, a formidable general and statesman, were not afraid to use power to achieve their own ends, which included increasing the power of the papacy. This political and temporal authority was demonstrated through the papal role in the Holy Roman Empire (especially prominent during periods of contention with the Emperors, such as during the Pontificates of Pope Gregory VII and Pope Alexander III ). Papal bull s, interdict, and excommunication (or the threat thereof) have been used many times to increase papal power. The Bull Laudabiliter in 1155 authorized Henry II of England to invade Ireland. In 1207, Innocent III placed England under interdict until King John made his kingdom a fiefdom to the Pope, complete with yearly tribute, saying, &quot; we offer and freely yield...to our lord Pope Innocent III and his catholic successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom of Ireland with all their rights and appurtenences for the remission of our sins &quot;. { Quoted from the Medieval Sourcebook } The Bull Inter caetera in 1493 led to the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which divided the world into areas of Spanish and Portuguese rule. The Bull Regnans in Excelsis in 1570 excommunicated Elizabeth I of England and declared that all her subjects were released from all allegiance to her. The Bull Inter Gravissimas in 1582 established the Gregorian Calendar. { See selection from &apos;&apos;Concordia Cyclopedia&apos;&apos;: Roman Catholic Church, History of } [ International position ] Under international law, a serving head of state has sovereign immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of other countries, though not from that of international tribunals.

International law treats the Holy See, essentially the central government of the Roman Catholic Church, as the juridical equal of a state. It is distinct from the state of Vatican City, existing for many centuries before the foundation of the latter. (It is common, however, for publications to use &quot; Holy See &quot;, &quot; Vatican/Vatican City &quot;, and even &quot; Rome &quot; interchangeably, and incorrectly.) Most countries of the world maintain the same form of diplomatic relations with the Holy See that they entertain with other states. Even countries without those diplomatic relations participate in international organizations of which the Holy See is a full member. It is as head of the Holy See, not of Vatican City, that the U.S. Justice Department ruled that the Pope enjoys head-of-state immunity.

It was in relation to the latter that, in November 2008, the United States Court of Appeals in Cincinnati decided that a case over sexual abuse by Catholic priests could proceed, provided the plaintiffs could prove that the bishops accused of negligent supervision were acting as employees or agents of the Holy See and were following official Holy See policy. { Allen, John L.

The reasons for these objections differ from denomination to denomination. [ Orthodox, Anglican and Old Catholic churches ] Other traditional Christian churches ( Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Independent Catholic Churches, etc.) accept the doctrine of Apostolic Succession and, to varying extents, papal claims to a primacy of honour while generally rejecting that the pope is the successor to Peter in any unique sense not true of any other bishop. Primacy is regarded as a consequence of the pope&apos;s position as bishop of the original capital city of the Roman Empire, a definition explicitly spelled out in the 28th canon of the Council of Chalcedon. These churches see no foundation to papal claims of universal immediate jurisdiction, or to claims of papal infallibility. Several of these churches refer to such claims as ultramontanism. [ Protestant denominations ] [ Historicism (Christian eschatology) ] Many Christian denominations reject the claims of Petrine primacy of honor, Petrine primacy of jurisdiction, and papal infallibility. These denominations vary from simply not accepting the Pope&apos;s claim to authority as legitimate and valid, to believing that the Pope is the Antichrist { &apos;Therefore on the basis of a renewed study of the pertinent Scriptures we reaffirm the statement of the Lutheran Confessions, that &quot; the Pope is the very Antichrist &quot; &apos; from Statement on the Antichrist, from the } { Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, also The Pope is the Antichrist } from 1 John 2:18, [ http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID%3D579 Brief Statement Lcms.org 2010-08-11 ] the Man of Sin from 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12, { See Kretzmann&apos;s &apos;&apos;Popular Commentary&apos;&apos;, 2 Thessalonians chapter two and An Exegesis of 2 Thessalonians 2:1-10 } [ November 2010 ] { by Mark Jeske } and the Beast out of the Earth from Revelation 13:11-18. { See See Kretzmann&apos;s &apos;&apos;Popular Commentary&apos;&apos;, Revelation Chapter 13 } The sweeping rejection includes some denominations of Lutherans: Confessional Lutheran s hold that the pope is the Antichrist, stating that this article of faith is part of a quia rather than quatenus subscription to the Book of Concord. In 1932, the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (LCMS) adopted A Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod, which a small number of Lutheran church bodies now hold. { The } { Lutheran Churches of the Reformation } [ November 2010 ] {, the } { Concordia Lutheran Conference } [ November 2010 ] {, the } { Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Illinois Lutheran Conference all hold to Brief Statement, which the LCMS adopted in 1932 and places in the LCMS.org website } Statement 43, Of the Antichrist: { Online at Of the Antichrist } &apos;&apos;Christus&apos;&apos;, by Lucas Cranach. This woodcut of John 13:14–17 is from &apos;&apos;Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist&apos;&apos;. Cranach shows Jesus kissing Peter&apos;s foot during the footwashing. This stands in contrast to the opposing woodcut, where the Pope demands others kiss his feet. { Lucas Cranach the Elder. This woodcut of the traditional practice of kissing the Pope&apos;s toe is from &apos;&apos;Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist&apos;&apos;. The two fingers the Pope is holding up symbolizes his claim to be the Church&apos;s substitute for Christ&apos;s earthly presence. } 43. As to the Antichrist we teach that the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures concerning the Antichrist, 2 Thess. 2:3-12; 1 John 2:18, have been fulfilled in the Pope of Rome and his dominion. All the features of the Antichrist as drawn in these prophecies, including the most abominable and horrible ones, for example, that the Antichrist &quot; as God sitteth in the temple of God &quot;, 2 Thess. 2:4; that he anathematizes the very heart of the Gospel of Christ, that is, the doctrine of the forgiveness of sins by grace alone, for Christ&apos;s sake alone, through faith alone, without any merit or worthiness in man ( Rom. 3:20-28; Gal. 2:16 ); that he recognizes only those as members of the Christian Church who bow to his authority; and that, like a deluge, he had inundated the whole Church with his antichristian doctrines till God revealed him through the Reformation—these very features are the outstanding characteristics of the Papacy. (Cf. Smalcald Articles, Triglot, p. 515, Paragraphs 39-41; p. 401, Paragraph 45; M. pp. 336, 258. ) Hence we subscribe to the statement of our Confessions that the Pope is &quot; the very Antichrist. &quot; ( Smalcald Articles, Triglot, p. 475, Paragraph 10; M., p. 308. ) The claim of temporal power over all secular governments, including territorial claims in Italy, raises objection. { See the Baltimore Catechism on the temporal power of the pope over governments and Innocent III&apos;s Letter to the prefect Acerbius and the nobles of Tuscany. For objection to this, see the Concordia Cyclopedia, p.564 and 750 } The papacy&apos;s complex relationship with secular states such as the Roman and Byzantine Empires are also objections. Some disapprove of the autocratic character of the papal office. { See Luther, Smalcald Articles, Article four } In Western Christianity these objections both contributed to and are products of the Protestant Reformation. [ Antipopes ] [ Antipope Western Schism ] Groups sometimes form around antipope s, who claim the Pontificate without being canonically and properly elected to it. Traditionally, this term was reserved for claimants with a significant following of cardinals or other clergy. The existence of an antipope is usually due either to doctrinal controversy within the Church ( heresy ) or to confusion as to who is the legitimate pope at the time (see schism). Briefly in the 15th century, three separate lines of popes claimed authenticity (see Papal Schism ). Even Catholics don&apos;t all agree whether certain historical figures were popes or antipopes. Though antipope movements were significant at one time, they are now overwhelmingly minor fringe causes. [ Other uses of the title &quot; pope &quot; ] In the earlier centuries of Christianity, the title &quot; Pope &quot;, meaning &quot; father &quot;, had been used by all bishops. Some popes used the term and others didn&apos;t. Eventually, the title became associated especially with the Bishop of Rome. In a few cases, the term is used for other Christian clerical authorities. [ In the Roman Catholic Church ] The &quot; Black Pope &quot; is a name that was popularly, but unofficially, given to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus due to the Jesuits&apos; importance within the Church. This name, based on the black colour of his cassock, was used to suggest a parallel between him and the &quot; White Pope &quot; (since the time of Pope Pius V the Popes dresses in white) and the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (formerly called the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), whose red cardinal&apos;s cassock gave him the name of the &quot; Red Pope &quot; in view of the authority over all territories that were not considered in some way Catholic. In the present time this cardinal has power over mission territories for Catholicism, essentially the Churches of Africa and Asia, { Sandro Magister, Espresso Online. } but in the past his competence extended also to all lands where Protestants or Eastern Christianity was dominant. Some remnants of this situation remain, with the result that, for instance, New Zealand is still in the care of this Congregation. [ In the Eastern Churches ] Since the papacy of Heraclas in the 3rd century, the Bishop of the Alexandria in both the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria continue to be called &quot; Pope &quot;, the former being called &quot; Coptic Pope &quot; or, more properly, &quot; Pope and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Orthodox and Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle &quot; and the last called &quot; Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa &quot;. In the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church and Serbian Orthodox Church, it is not unusual for a village priest to be called a &quot; pope &quot; ( &quot; поп &quot; pop). However, this should be differentiated from the words used for the head of the Catholic Church (Bulgarian &quot; папа &quot; papa, Russian &quot; папа римский &quot; papa rimskiy). [ In New Religious Movements ] Some New Religious Movements, especially those that have disassociated themselves from the Catholic Church yet retain a Catholic hierarchical framework, will use the designation &quot; pope &quot; for a movement&apos;s founder or current leader. One example in Africa is the Legio Maria Church of Africa. Another example is Cao Dai, a Vietnamese faith that duplicates the Catholic hierarchy, which is declared legitimate by religious authorities in Cao Dai due to the fact that, according to them, God created both Catholicism and Cao Dai. [ Lengths of papal reign ] [ Longest-reigning popes ] { Pope Pius IX, the longest-reigning pope excluding Saint Peter } Although the average reign of the pope from the Middle Ages was a decade, a number of those whose reign lengths can be determined from contemporary historical data are the following: Pius IX (1846–1878): 31 years, 7 months and 23 days (11,560 days). John Paul II (1978–2005): 26 years, 5 months and 18 days (9,665 days). Leo XIII (1878–1903): 25 years, 5 months and 1 day (9,281 days). Pius VI (1775–1799): 24 years, 6 months and 15 days (8,962 days). Adrian I (772–795): 23 years, 10 months and 25 days (8,729 days). Pius VII (1800–1823): 23 years, 5 months and 7 days (8,560 days). Alexander III (1159–1181): 21 years, 11 months and 24 days (8,029 days). St. Sylvester I (314–335): 21 years, 11 months and 1 day (8,005 days). St. Leo I (440–461): 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days. (7,713 days). Urban VIII (1623–1644): 20 years, 11 months and 24 days (7,664 days). Saint Peter is thought to have reigned for over 30 years (AD 29 – 64?/67?), but the exact length is not reliably known. [ Shortest-reigning popes ] { Pope Urban VII, the shortest-reigning pope } Conversely, there have been a number of popes whose reign lasted less than a month. In the following list the number of calendar days includes partial days. Thus, for example, if a pope&apos;s reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days. Urban VII (15–27 September 1590): reigned for 13 calendar days, died before coronation. Boniface VI (April 896): reigned for 16 calendar days Celestine IV (25 October  – 10 November 1241): reigned for 17 calendar days, died before consecration. Theodore II (December 897): reigned for 20 calendar days Sisinnius (15 January  – 4 February 708): reigned for 21 calendar days Marcellus II (9 April  – 1 May 1555): reigned for 22 calendar days Damasus II (17 July  – 9 August 1048): reigned for 24 calendar days Pius III (22 September  – 18 October 1503): reigned for 27 calendar days Leo XI (1–27 April 1605): reigned for 27 calendar days Benedict V (22 May  – 23 June 964): reigned for 33 calendar days &lt; li value= &quot; 10 &quot; &gt; John Paul I (26 August  – 28 September 1978): reigned for 33 calendar days. Stephen (23–26 March 752), died of apoplexy three days after his election, and before his consecration as a bishop. He is not recognized as a valid pope, but was added to the lists of popes in the 15th century as Stephen II, causing difficulties in enumerating later popes named Stephen. He was removed in 1961 from the Vatican&apos;s list.
