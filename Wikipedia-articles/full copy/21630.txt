A Saudi, Nawaf and childhood friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, left their homes in 1995 to fight in the Bosnian War. Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight among the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. After fighting in Chechnya in 1998, he returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999. Already long time affiliates of Al-Qaeda, Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden as respected jihadists due to their extensive fighting experience for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States. Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999. Hazmi trained in an Al-Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999. He then traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al-Qaeda Summit. Nawaf arrived in the United States from Bangkok, Thailand, on January 15, 2000, with Khalid al-Mihdhar in Los Angeles. The two stayed at Parkwood Apartments in San Diego until May 2000. The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego. Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar&apos;s poor English skills, they did not perform well during their flight lessons and were regarded as suspicious by their flight instructor. Mihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000 and they both traveled to Phoenix, Arizona. They later moved to Falls Church, Virginia in 2001 where the rest of the muscle hijackers began to join them. Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001. The CIA reportedly received Hazmi&apos;s name as part of a list of 19 names that were planning an attack in the near future. Hazmi was one of the four names on the list that were known for certain. A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but the search was not very aggressive and they were not located until after the attacks. On September 10, 2001, Hazmi along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. The next morning, Nawaf al-Hazmi, along with four other terrorists, boarded American Airlines Flight 77 and hijacked the plane so that Hani Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Hazmi was initially dismissed as a &quot; muscle hijacker &quot; following the attacks, but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed. { Los Angeles Times, Document links al Qaeda paymaster, 9/11 plotter, September 27, 2002 } His younger brother, Salem al-Hazmi, was another hijacker aboard the same flight. [ Background ] [ February 2011 ] Nawaf was born in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer. He traveled to Afghanistan as a teenager in 1993. CNN &apos;s preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed &quot; He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never told me why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm &quot;, and claimed that his older brother was a police chief in Jizan. In 1995, he and his childhood friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, joined a group that went to fight alongside Bosnian Muslim s in the Bosnian War.

In Afghanistan, they fought alongside the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance, and joined up with Al-Qaeda. Nawaf al-Hazmi also fought alongside Chechnya ns sometime around 1998, [ February 2011 ] possibly with his brother and Mihdhar, and returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999. [ Selected for the 9/11 plot ] Osama bin Laden held Hazmi and Mihdhar in high respect, with their experience fighting during the 1990s in Bosnia and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda later referred to Hazmi as Mihdhar&apos;s &quot; Second-in-command &quot;. { Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others } When Bin Laden committed to the &quot; planes operation &quot; plot in spring 1999, Bin Laden personally selected Hazmi and Mihdhar to be involved in the plot as pilot hijackers. In addition to Hazmi and Mihdhar, two Yemenis were selected for a southeast Asia component of the plot, which was later scrapped for being too difficult to coordinate with the operations in the United States. Known as Rabi&apos;ah al-Makki during the preparations, Hazmi had been so eager to participate in operations within the United States, he already had a US visa when Bin Laden selected him. Hazmi obtained a B-1/B-2 tourist visa on April 3, 1999 from the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using a new passport he acquired a few weeks earlier. Hazmi&apos;s passport did have indicators of Al-Qaeda association, but immigration inspectors were not trained to look for those.

Hazmi went with the two Yemenis, Tawfiq bin Attash (Khallad) and Abu Bara al Yemeni, to Karachi, Pakistan where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the plot&apos;s coordinator, instructed him on western culture, travel, as well as taught some basic English phrases. Mihdhar did not go with him to Karachi, but instead left for Yemen. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed then sent Hazmi and the other men to Malaysia for a meeting. Before leaving for Malaysia, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed doctored Hazmi&apos;s Saudi passport in order to conceal his travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make it appear that Hazmi had come to Malaysia from Saudi Arabia via Dubai. After the attacks, the Associated Press would re-publish a &quot; bizarre &quot; story by the Cody Enterprise that quoted witnesses stating that Nawaf entered the United States during the autumn of 1999, crossing along the Canadian border as one of two men delivering skylights to the local high school in Cody, Wyoming.

Authorities also became aware of Hazmi, as a friend and associate of Mihdhar. Saudi Intelligence was also aware that Hazmi was associated with Al-Qaeda, and associated with the 1998 African embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997.

The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali for the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit, during which key details of the attacks may have been arranged. At this time, there was an East Asia component to the September 11 attacks plot, but Bin Laden later canceled it for being too difficult to coordinate with operations in the United States.

Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed at the meeting by Malaysian authorities, who provided surveillance at the request of the CIA. Malaysian authorities reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with Tawfiq bin Attash, one of the Yemenis, and others who were later involved in the USS Cole bombing. Hazmi and Mihdhar also met with Fahd al-Quso, who was later involved in the USS Cole bombing.
