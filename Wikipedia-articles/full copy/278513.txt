[ Career ] [ Early roles ] Later, while living in Hawaii, West landed a role as the sidekick on a children&apos;s show called El Kini Popo Show, which featured a chimp. West later took over as star of the show. [ 0001842 Adam West ] In 1959, the actor moved to Hollywood and took the stage name Adam West. In his autobiography Back to the Batcave he explains that he chose &apos;Adam&apos; simply because he liked the way it looked and sounded with &apos;West&apos;, his mother&apos;s maiden name. His close friends and family still call him &quot; Bill &quot;. He appeared in the film The Young Philadelphians with Paul Newman, and guest-starred in a number of television Westerns. He guest starred on Edmond O&apos;Brien &apos;s syndicated crime drama Johnny Midnight and soon snagged a supporting role as police Sergeant Steve Nelson in the crime drama, The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor. He portrayed Wild Bill Hickok in the episode &quot; Westbound Stage &quot; of the 1960 NBC western series Overland Trail, with William Bendix and Doug McClure. He starred in an episode of the original Outer Limits television series titled &quot; The Invisible Enemy &quot;.

In 1965, he starred in the comedy western The Outlaws Is Coming, the last feature film starring The Three Stooges. He played the character Christopher Rolf in the episode of the Rifleman &quot; Stopover &quot; originally aired on April 25, 1961. [ Batman ] [ Batman (TV series) Batman (1966 film) ] Producer William Dozier cast West as Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman, in the television series Batman, in part after seeing West perform as the James Bond -like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik television ad. West was in competition with Lyle Waggoner for the Batman role. The popular campy show ran on ABC from 1966 to 1968; a film version was released in 1966. In conjunction with the premiere, Jean Boone of Austin CBS affiliate station KTBC interviewed the film&apos;s cast, including West.

West declined, later stating in his autobiography that he believed the role should always be played by someone British (despite the fact that an Australian had already played him). [ Post-Batman career ] { 41st Primetime Emmy Awards. } After his high-profile role, West, along with Burt Ward and Yvonne Craig (who played crimefighting sidekicks Robin and Batgirl ), was severely typecast. West&apos;s first post-Caped Crusader role was in the film The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1969). His lead performance against type as cynical tough guy Johnny Cain did not erode his Batman image; the movie was a box office disappointment. For a time, West made a living doing personal appearances as Batman. In 1972, when Ward and Craig reprised their Batman roles for a TV public-service announcement about equal pay for women, West was absent. Instead, Dick Gautier filled in as Batman. One of his more memorable Batman appearances post-series was when he made an appearance in the Memphis, Tennessee based United States Wrestling Association to engage in a war of words with Jerry &quot; The King &quot; Lawler while wearing the cowl and a track suit and even name-dropping Spider-Man, though he is a Marvel Comics hero. { Pro Wrestling Insider: Youtube Video Classic – &quot; Batman &quot; Adam West vs. Jerry Lawler } West subsequently appeared in the theatrical films The Marriage of a Young Stockbrocker (1971), The Curse of the Moon Child (1972), The Specialist (1975), Hardcore (1977), Hooper (as himself; 1978), The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980) and One Dark Night (1983). West also appeared in such television films as The Eyes of Charles Sand (1972), Poor Devil (1973), Nevada Smith (1975), For the Love of It (1980) and I Take These Men (1983). He did guest shots on the TV shows Love, American Style, The Big Valley, Night Gallery, Alias Smith and Jones, Mannix, Emergency!, Alice, Police Woman, Operation Petticoat, The American Girls, Vega$, Big Shamus Little Shamus, Laverne &amp; Shirley, Bewitched, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat, Hart to Hart, Zorro, King of Queens, and George Lopez. West was also in an episode of Bonanza that supposedly never aired until reruns were shown. West also made several guest appearances as himself on Family Feud. [ Return to Batman ] West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series, The New Adventures of Batman, and in other shows such as Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians (succeeding Olan Soule in the role). In 1979, West once again put on the Batsuit for the live-action TV special Legends of the Superheroes. In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company&apos;s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Batman series. [ Marx, Barry Cavalieri, Joey and Hill, Thomas Petruccio, Steven Marx, Barry Adam West Batman Makes Prime Time Fifty Who Made DC Great 1985 DC Comics 34 ] West made an appearance in a 1992 episode of Batman: The Animated Series on Fox, but not as Batman (as the role of Batman was already being played by Kevin Conroy ). Instead, he portrayed Simon Trent, a washed-up actor who used to play a superhero in a TV series called The Gray Ghost and who now has difficulty finding work (which was essentially a mirror story of West&apos;s own career at the time). West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series The Batman. The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI animated short film Batman: New Times. He co-starred with Mark Hamill, who vocally portrayed The Joker and had originally played the role on Batman: The Animated Series. West also voiced Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne&apos;s father, in an episode of the animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold. In the same series, he played Batman&apos;s prototype robot, aptly named &quot; Protobot &quot;, or &quot; Proto &quot; for short. FLOSS Magazine has reported that Adam West has been spotted around the set of The Dark Knight Rises for a cameo appearance.

The pilot, written by Conan O&apos;Brien and Robert Smigel in their pre- Late Night period, aired on NBC that summer but was not picked up as a series. { Conan O&apos;Brien bio at TVGuide.com. } It was later broadcast on the Trio channel, under the &quot; Brilliant But Cancelled &quot; bloc. { Wilonsky, Robert. &quot; 12, 2002/culture/end-of-the-road/full End of the Road &quot;, the } { Miami New Times, published December 12, 2002.

The boy hero is a comic book geek whose favorite superhero, Galloping Gazelle (West&apos;s character), is portrayed as fading and on the verge of retirement. Towards the end, the boy is shocked to learn that the Gazelle is real, though he must save the day by himself. In 1994, West, with Jeff Rovin, wrote his autobiography, Back to the Batcave published by Berkeley Books. He also appeared as a guest in the animated talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast in an episode titled &quot; Batmantis, &quot; where he displayed his book. In 2003, West and Burt Ward starred in the TV-movie Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt, alongside Frank Gorshin, Julie Newmar, and Lee Meriwether. Jack Brewer portrayed West in flashbacks to the production of Batman. In 2005, West appeared in the CBS show The King of Queens. In the episode, Spence first asks Lou Ferrigno to go to a sci-fi convention. But when Spence meets West (playing himself), he leaves Ferrigno and asks West to come with him. West appears prominently in the 2006 video for California band STEFY &apos;s song &quot; Chelsea &quot; as &quot; Judge Adam West &quot;, presiding over the courtroom scene. In 2007, Adam West portrayed a defense attorney for Benny on the show George Lopez, and starred as &quot; The Boss &quot; in the movie comedy Sexina: Popstar PI.

In 2009, West played himself in the episode &quot; Apollo, Apollo &quot; of 30 Rock. [ Voice-over work ] Having a distinctive voice, West built a career doing voice-over work on a number of animated series (often as himself), including appearances on The Simpsons, Rugrats, The Critic, The Boondocks, Histeria!, Kim Possible, Johnny Bravo and even in an episode of Batman: The Animated Series called Beware the Gray Ghost, where he voiced the Gray Ghost. He also appeared in five episodes of Nickelodeon&apos;s cartoon, The Fairly OddParents, as a cat-obsessed version of himself who is famous for playing a superhero called Catman, and who actually believes he is Catman. Catman is a parody of his earlier character as Batman. A later appearance of Adam West in The Fairly OddParents world was a parody of himself, hired to play the role of the Crimson Chin in the movie of the same name. Yet another appearance on the show had him as himself in a Fairy-sponsored video about how to cope with losing ones fairy godparents. Since 2000, West has made regular appearances on the animated series Family Guy, on which he plays Mayor Adam West, the lunatic mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island. His role has given him a new wave of popularity since Batman { See main article at } { Adam West (Family Guy) }, and lead writer Seth MacFarlane claims to have gone out of his way to avoid typecasting West by deliberately not making any references to Batman. Some of his latest voice-over performances were playing the role of Uncle Art in the Disney film Meet the Robinsons, and voicing the young Mermaid Man (along with Burt Ward, who voiced the young Barnacle Boy ) in the cartoon show SpongeBob SquarePants. West also played the voice of General Carrington in the video game XIII, and has voiced other video games like Marc Ecko&apos;s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, Chicken Little: Ace in Action, Scooby Doo! Unmasked and Goosebumps: Attack of the Mutant. For the online game Champions Online, his voice is used in one of the website&apos;s videos.
