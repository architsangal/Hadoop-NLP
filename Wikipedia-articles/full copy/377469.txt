[ 1989–1992 World Cup 150px 5 Australia 7 21 300059 835 AUS Mal Meninga (70) AUS Mal Meninga (7) Rugby League World Cup 1985–1988 1995 ] The 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup was the tenth staging of the Rugby League World Cup, and continued to use the three-year format, stretching across the years 1989 to 1992. As with the 1985–1988 World Cup, teams played each other on a home and away basis. These matches were fitted into the normal international programme of three-match test series between the nations, with a pre-designated match from each series counting as the World Cup fixture. The matches went strictly to form, with Australia undefeated and certain to claim a world cup final berth as early as 1991. France and Papua New Guinea were uncompetitive, leading to a straight fight between New Zealand and Great Britain for the right to meet the Kangaroos in the final. In the event the Lions were able to just edge out the Kiwis on points difference. The final, at Wembley, was a surprisingly close affair, with Great Britain leading with only 12 minutes to go. The game&apos;s only try was then scored by Steve Renouf and Australia were able to claim victory in front of a Rugby League World Cup record crowd of 73,631.

The rain started pouring in the second half and Australia was able to hold Great Britain out and maintain their lead until the final siren. Australia&apos;s World Cup triumph ended a mini-hoodoo for them at London&apos;s Wembley Stadium. The Kangaroos had previously left the arena 21-12 losers in 1973 and the 1990 tourists were outplayed by Great Britain 19-12, but when it mattered most this time around Australia proved themselves as worthy World Cup champions to retain the crown they had won against New Zealand in 1988. This match also set a new attendance record for a rugby league international in the United Kingdom.
