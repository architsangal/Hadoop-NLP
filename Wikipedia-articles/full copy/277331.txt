He was instrumental in the early stages of the unified University of London. [ Life ] Carpenter was born on 29 Oct 1813 in Exeter, the eldest son of Dr Lant Carpenter and his wife, Anna Carpenter (née Penn). His father was an important Unitarian preacher who influenced a &quot; rising generation of Unitarian intellectuals, including James Martineau and the Westminster Review&apos;s John Bowring. &quot; [ Desmond Adrian Adrian Desmond 1989 The Politics of Evolution: Morphology, Medicine, and Reform in Radical London University of Chicago Press Chicago 0-226-14346-5 Chapter 5: Accommodation and Domestication: Dealing with Geoffroy&apos;s Anatomy - W. B. Carpenter and Lawful Morphology 210 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DwA8_tm1UnXwC%26amp%3Bpg%3Dpa210 ] From his father, Carpenter inherited a belief in the essential lawfulness of the creation: this meant that natural causes were the explanation of the world as we find it. William embraced this &quot; naturalistic cosmogeny &quot; as his starting point. Carpenter was apprenticed to the eye surgeon John Bishop Estlin, who was also the son of a Unitarian minister, and accompanied him to the West Indies in 1833. He attended medical classes at University College London (1834–35), and then went to the University of Edinburgh (1835–39), where he received his MD in 1839. Later, in 1861, he also received an LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. On his resignation in 1879, Carpenter was appointed CB in recognition of his services to education. He died on 19 Nov 1885 in London, from burn injuries occasioned by the accidental upsetting of the fire heating a vapour bath he was taking. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery.

His appointment as Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution in 1845 enabled him to exhibit his powers as a teacher and lecturer. His gift of ready speech and luminous interpretation placing him in the front rank of exponents, at a time when the popularization of science was in its infancy.

He worked hard as investigator, author, editor, demonstrator and lecturer throughout his life; but it was his researches in marine zoology, notably in the &quot; lower &quot; organisms, as Foraminifera and Crinoid s, that were most valuable. { Carpenter W.B. 1845. Zoology: being a systematic account of the general structure, habits, instincts and uses of the principal families of the animal kingdom. 2 vols: Orr, London. } These researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration, an outcome of which was in 1868 the oceanographic survey with HMS &apos;&apos;Lightning&apos;&apos; and later the more famous &apos;&apos;Challenger&apos;&apos; Expedition. He took a keen and laborious interest in the evidence adduced by Canadian geologist s as to the organic nature of the so-called Eozoon canadense, discovered in the Laurentian strata, also called the North American craton, and at the time of his death had nearly finished a monograph on the subject, defending the now discredited theory of its animal origin. He was an adept in the use of the microscope, and his popular treatise on it stimulated many to explore this new aid. { Carpenter W.B. 1856. The microscope and its revelations. } He was awarded the Royal Medal in 1861. Carpenter&apos;s most famous work is the 1853 Use and Abuse of Alcoholic Liquors which was one of the first temperance books (Washingtonian Movement) to promote the fact that alcoholism is a disease. In 1856 Carpenter became Registrar of the University of London, and held the office for twenty-three years. Carpenter gave qualified support to Darwin but he had reservations as to the application of evolution to man&apos;s intellectual and spiritual nature. { Desmond A. 1989. The politics of evolution p419. Chicago. } [ Adaptive unconscious ] Carpenter is considered as one of the founders of the modern theory of the adaptive unconscious. Together with William Hamilton and Thomas Laycock they provided the foundations on which adaptive unconscious is based today. They observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations have been made by Hermann Helmholtz. Because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were largely neglected, until the cognitive revolution of the 1950s. in 1874 Carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. He noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious. He also noticed that emotional reactions can occur outside of conscious until attention is drawn to them: &quot; Our feelings towards persons and objects may undergo most important changes, without our being in the least degree aware, until we have our attention directed to our own mental state, of the alteration which has taken place in them. &quot; Carpenter W.B. 1875. Principles of mental physiology. 2nd ed. King, London. p24-8, 516-7, 519-20, 539-41. He also asserted both the freedom of the will and the existence of the Ego.
