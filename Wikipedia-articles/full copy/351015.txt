There are vegetarian, meat or fish mezes. Groups of dishes arrive at the table about 4 or 5 at a time (usually between five and ten different groups). There is a set pattern to the dishes, typically olives, tahini, salad and yoghurt will be followed by dishes with vegetables and eggs, then small meat or fish dishes alongside special accompaniments, and finally more substantial dishes such as whole fish or meat stews and grills. Different establishments will offer different dishes, their own specialities, but the pattern remains the same. Naturally the dishes served will reflect the seasons, for example in late autumn, snail s will be prominent. As so much food is offered, it is not expected that every dish be finished, but rather shared at will and served at ease. Eating a Cypriot meze is a social event. In Serbia, meze can include cheese, kajmak (clotted cream), salami, smoked ham, kulen (flavoured sausage), various bread types, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, meze normally includes hard and creamy cheeses, smetana sour cream, (locally known as kajmak or pavlaka), suho meso (dried salted, smoked beef), pickles and sudžuk (dry, spicy sausage). Albanian-style meze platters typically include prosciutto ham, salami and brined cheese, accompanied with roasted bell peppers (Capsicum) and/or green olives marinated in olive oil with garlic. In Bulgaria, popular mezes are lukanka, a spicy sausage, soujouk, a dry and spicy sausage, sirene a white brine cheese, and Shopska salad, made with tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, roasted peppers and sirene. In Romania, mezelic means quick appetizer and include Zacuscă, different type of cheese and salami, often accompanied by Țuică. [ Alcoholic accompaniment ] In Turkey meze is served with rakı, an anise-flavored apéritif. In Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, arak liquor is served. Cyprus Brandy (served neat, over ice) is a favourite drink to accompany meze in Cyprus although lager or wine are also popular with some. It is important to note that these are Muslim countries therefore the majority of households would not be using an alcoholic accompaniment. [ Serving traditions ] In Bulgaria, meze is served primarily at consumption of wine, but also as an appetizer for rakia and mastika.In Greece, meze is served in restaurants called mezedopoleíon and tsipourádiko or ouzerí, a type of café that serves ouzo or tsipouro. A tavérna (tavern) or estiatório (restaurant) also offer a mezé as an orektikó (appetiser). Many restaurants offer their house poikilía ( &quot; variety &quot; ), a platter with a smorgasbord of various mezedhes that can be served immediately to customers looking for a quick and/or light meal. Hosts commonly serve mezédhes to their guests at informal or impromptu get-togethers, as they are easy to prepare on short notice. Krasomezédhes (literally &quot; wine-meze &quot; ) is a meze that goes well with wine; ouzomezédhes are meze that goes with ouzo.
