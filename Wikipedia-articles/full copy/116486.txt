[ 1 ] for geographical seismology reasons. According to the United States Census Bureau, the North Bethesda CDP has a total area of [ 8.9 sqmi km2 ]. Significant through-roads in North Bethesda include Interstates 270 and 495 and Maryland State Highways 187 (Old Georgetown Road), 355 (Rockville Pike), and 547 (Strathmore Avenue). The Twinbrook, White Flint, and Grosvenor-Strathmore Washington Metro stations all serve the area, as does the Ride On bus system.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Paleo, Archaic, and Woodland Native Americans lived nearby, along the banks of the Potomac River. These peoples traveled along an ancient route known as the Seneca Trail (which is today approximately followed in North Bethesda by Old Georgetown Road). Like many ancient roads, the Seneca Trail followed a ridge line – in this case, the high ground between the Potomac River and Rock Creek. Much later, development would spring up along this route. The recorded history of the area commences with the colonial era. Settlements formed along Rock Creek and the Seneca Trail in the 17th Century, with recorded land grants in this area known originally as “Dan” and “Leeke Forest.” The Riley plantation house and kitchen, located in the Tilden Woods neighborhood on Old Georgetown Road In the early 19th century, much of the area was part of a [ 3700 acre km2 on ] tobacco plantation owned by a slaveowning family with the surname of Riley. One of the Rileys&apos; slaves, Josiah Henson, is thought by historians to be the inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe &apos;s Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin. In 1806, the Washington Turnpike Company was chartered to improve the old Seneca route, by then known as the Georgetown-Frederick Road. The road was opened in 1828, but had nearly washed away by 1848. The Riley plantation house was located on this road, and the plantation house&apos;s kitchen (in which Henson is known to have slept) still stands near the course of this road. By the late 19th century, the area was privileged with stops along a train route, and by the early 20th century with its own trolley tracks on the line connecting Georgetown and Rockville (along current-day Fleming Avenue). During this time, development bloomed around train and trolley stops, and a number of wealthy families, including those of Captain James Frederick Oyster and Charles I. Corby (who developed methods that revolutionized the baking industry), lived or summered in the area. Nonetheless, the area remained sparsely populated through the 1920s. The arrival of the automobile eventually transformed the area into a commuter suburb of Washington, D.C. By the 1950s, the area had sprouted a number of developer-conceived neighborhoods with tract houses for the middle-class. Today, the area remains largely a commuter suburb, with most residents traveling an average of 29 minutes to their workplace.

Unlike other Washington, D.C. suburbs, Montgomery County engages in master planning for all development. The White Flint Master Plan is designed to alleviate negative aspects of future high-density development in North Bethesda.
