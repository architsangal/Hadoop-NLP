It has probably originally belonged to a farm located at the base of the prominent mountain of Kolsås.

The first mention of the name is from the saga of Sverre of Norway, from about 1200. There are ruins of stone churches from the 12th century at Haslum and Tanum. [ Tor Chr. Bakken Asker og Bærum-leksikon 2008 Kunnskapsforlaget Oslo Norwegian 978-82-573-1534-4 ] View of most of Bærum from Holmenkollen in Oslo The pilgrim road to Trondheim that was established after 1030 went through Bærum, and there is evidence that lime kiln s were in use in the area in 850. There were shipping ports for the quicklime at Slependen and Sandvika. The lime kiln is the main motif for the municipality&apos;s coat of arms. In the 17th century, iron ore was discovered in Bærum and the ironworks at Bærums Verk were founded. Industries such as paper mill s, nail factories, sawmill s, glasswork s, and brickworks were established along the rivers Lysakerelven and Sandvikselva in the following centuries. There were orchard s and other agricultural concerns throughout the area, remnants of which still exist today. A number of artists established themselves in Bærum, particularly around the art school run by Johan Fredrik Eckersberg. Among the artists who did much of their work in Bærum are Frits Thaulow, Christian Skredsvig, Harriet Backer, Kitty Lange Kielland, Otto Sinding, Eilif Pettersen, Gerhardt Munthe, and Erik Werenskiold. Starting in the mid-20th century, Bærum&apos;s agricultural base gradually gave way to residential construction. Still, only a third of the area, [ 64 km² mi2 1 ], is built up for residential use; over half is productive forestry; and nearly [ 17 km² mi2 1 ] is still agricultural.
