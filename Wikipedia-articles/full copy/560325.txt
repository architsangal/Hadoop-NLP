The escalator ride from the common room at the north entrance to the mezzanine level takes roughly a minute and a half. To enable Metro to perform train turnarounds south of Grosvenor-Strathmore, a diamond crossover exists just north of the station. Occasionally, during rush hours, trains terminate here for schedule adjustments. When trains occasionally terminate here during rush hours or other instances such as track maintenance, trains offload their passengers on the Shady Grove bound track, exit the station, switch direction just north of the interlocking, and then run through the interlocking to the Glenmont (downtown) track. [ Station layout ] This station uses the four-coffer arch design found at most underground stations on the western side of the Red line. Unlike its many counterparts such as Van Ness-UDC and Tenleytown-AU, the station&apos;s walls are rounder than most stations using the four-coffer arch design. This is also the only four-coffer arch designed station in the system that has a mezzanine at both ends of the platform. Two of its five exits sit on the Maryland side of Western Avenue whereas the other three exit into the District. At the Western Avenue entrance, four separate street entrances come together in a common room, allowing riders to access a set of three escalators that go to the platform. One entrance is located at a side entrance to the lobby of an entrance to the C-level of Mazza Gallerie that has access to Western Avenue. Another entrance offers direct access to Chevy Chase Pavilion. The newest entrance, located off Wisconsin Avenue next to The Shops at Wisconsin Place opened in 2011 replacing an earlier entrance that led directly into a Hecht&apos;s. The new entrance is located across Wisconsin Avenue from the station&apos;s main entrance, which surfaces in a large bus depot underneath the Chevy Chase Metro Building. A second entrance, at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Jenifer Street NW, is elevator-only, with four elevators servicing the station&apos;s south mezzanine.
