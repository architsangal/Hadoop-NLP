[ #4B0082 ] [ #000000 ] [ #C0C0C0 ] { Ron Meyer } The Chicago Enforcers were a short-lived American football team based in Chicago, Illinois at Soldier Field. This team was part of the failed XFL begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. NBC dropped the XFL concept after the first season in 2001 due to dismal ratings, and the dissolution of the league was announced shortly afterwards. The team name references mob enforcer s, alluding to Chicago&apos;s history of mafia influence (see, for instance, Al Capone ) and continuing a theme of naming teams with themes of evil, insanity, or criminal activity ( &quot; Enforcers &quot; falling into the last of these categories). Originally, rumors swirled that former Chicago Bears defensive coordinator and Philadelphia Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan would be hired as the team&apos;s coach { &quot; XFL May Bring Buddyball to Soldier Field &quot;; Greg Couch, Chicago Sun-Times; June 13, 2000 }; ultimately, Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus was hired for the position. However, just before the season started, he resigned to take a position in the XFL office. He was replaced by coaching veteran Ron Meyer. Among their players was former NFL running back LeShon Johnson, who had played for the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and the New York Giants. He was starting tailback for the Cardinals for most of 1996. He led the Enforcers with 6 rushing touchdowns, which was second in the league. They also had former NFL running back John Avery who played for the Miami Dolphins. Their wide receiver/kick returner Roell Preston (who previously played for the Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers, and Tennessee Titans ) held the distinction of being the only former Pro Bowl er (1998 as a Packer) to play in the XFL. The team&apos;s starting right guard, Bennie Anderson, went on to be a starter for the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills, and last played professional football in 2006 for the Miami Dolphins. The Enforcers got off to a slow start, losing their first four games with Tim Lester, who prior to joining the XFL was (as frequently noted) a math teacher, at starting quarterback. In week 5, the team replaced Lester with the former Notre Dame Quatrerback Kevin McDougal and the team went 5-1 in the rest of the season (winning their last four in a row), coming from behind to make the XFL playoffs at 2nd place in the Eastern Division. In addition to their potent rushing attack led by league leading running back John Avery, they were also known for their hard hitting defense. They lost to eventual XFL champion Los Angeles Xtreme in the crossover semifinals. The Enforcers were part of the Eastern Division with the Orlando Rage, New York/New Jersey Hitmen and the Birmingham Thunderbolts. Their radio flagship station was WMVP, ESPN Radio 1000.
