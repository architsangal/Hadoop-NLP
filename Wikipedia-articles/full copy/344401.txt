[ April 2009 ] 200px Religious symbolism is the use of symbol s, including archetypes, acts, artwork, events, or natural phenomena, by a religion. Religions view religious texts, ritual s, and works of art as symbols of compelling ideas or ideals. Symbols help create a resonant mythos expressing the moral values of the society or the teachings of the religion, foster solidarity among adherents, and bring adherents closer to their object of worship. The study of religious symbolism is either universalist, as a component of comparative religion and mythology, or in localized scope, within the confines of a religion&apos;s limits and boundaries. Religious symbolism is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. The choice of suitable acts and objects for symbolism is narrow enough that it would not be easy to avoid the appearance of an imitation of other traditions, even if there had been a deliberate attempt to invent an entirely new ritual.
