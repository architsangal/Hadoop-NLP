[ Interstellar ] { ionized hydrogen (known by astronomers as H  II from old spectroscopic terminology) in the parts of the Galactic interstellar medium visible from the Earth&apos;s northern hemisphere as observed with the Wisconsin Hα Mapper } [ Haffner Reynolds Tufte Madsen 2003 ] {. } In astronomy, the interstellar medium (or ISM) is the matter that exists in the space between the star system s in a galaxy. This matter includes gas in ion ic, atom ic, and molecular form, dust, and cosmic ray s. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic space. The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of electromagnetic radiation, is the interstellar radiation field. The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases, distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The thermal pressures of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. Magnetic field s and turbulent motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are typically more important dynamically than the thermal pressure is. In all phases, the interstellar medium is extremely dilute by terrestrial standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in molecular form, and reaches number densities of 10 6 molecules cm −3. In hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the density may be as low as 10 −4 ions cm −3. Compare this with a number density of roughly 10 22 cm −3 for liquid water. By mass, 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust. [ Boulanger, F.; Cox, P.; and Jones, A. P. Course 7: Dust in the Interstellar Medium Infrared Space Astronomy, Today and Tomorrow 2000 F. Casoli, J. Lequeux, &amp; F. David 251 2000isat.conf..251B ] Of the gas in the ISM, 89% of atoms are hydrogen and 9% are helium, with 2% of atoms being elements heavier than hydrogen or helium, which are called &quot; metals &quot; in astronomical parlance. The hydrogen and helium are a result of primordial nucleosynthesis, while the heavier elements in the ISM are a result of enrichment in the process of stellar evolution. The ISM plays a crucial role in astrophysics precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, molecular cloud s, and replenish the ISM with matter and energy through planetary nebula e, stellar winds, and supernova e. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation. [ Interstellar matter ] Table 1 shows a breakdown of the properties of the components of the ISM of the Milky Way.

Their modeled ISM consisted of a cold dense phase (T   &lt;  300   K ), consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (T  ~  10 4   K ), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. [ McKee Ostriker 1977 ] added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (T  ~  10 6   K ) gas which had been shock heated by supernova e and constituted most of the volume of the ISM.These phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past three decades. However, the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known. [ Structures ] The ISM is turbulent and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales. Stars are born deep inside large complexes of molecular clouds, typically a few parsec s in size. During their lives and deaths, star s interact physically with the ISM. Stellar wind s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant HII region s surrounding them) and shock wave s created by supernova e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures – of varying sizes – can be observed, such as stellar wind bubble s and superbubble s of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in radio telescope maps. The Sun is currently traveling through the Local Interstellar Cloud, a denser region in the low-density Local Bubble. [ Interaction with interplanetary medium ] { IBEX&apos;s interstellar matter observations. } The interstellar medium begins where the interplanetary medium of the Solar System ends. The solar wind slows to subsonic velocities at the termination shock, 90—100 astronomical unit s from the Sun. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the heliosheath, interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind. Voyager 1, the furthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998 { Voyager: Fast Facts } ), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and may eventually enter interstellar space, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM [ Stone Cummings McDonald Heikkila 2005 ]. [ Interstellar extinction ] The ISM is also responsible for extinction and reddening, the decreasing light intensity and shift in the dominant observable wavelength s of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of photon s and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky. The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the Milky Way — a uniform disk of stars— are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years of Earth. Far ultraviolet light is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of the ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen. [ Heating and cooling ] The ISM is usually far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Collisions establish a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities, and the &apos;temperature&apos; normally used to describe interstellar gas is the &apos;kinetic temperature&apos;, which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly that of an A star (surface temperature of ~10,000 K ) highly diluted. Therefore, bound levels within an atom or molecule in the ISM are rarely populated according to the Boltzmann formula [ Spitzer 1978 &amp; sect; 2.4 ]. Depending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the gas. [ Heating mechanisms ] Heating by low-energy cosmic ray s The first mechanism proposed for heating the ISM was heating by low-energy cosmic rays. Cosmic ray s are an efficient heating source able to penetrate in the depths of molecular clouds. Cosmic ray s transfer energy to gas through both ionization and excitation and to free electron s through Coulomb interactions. Low-energy cosmic ray s (a few MeV ) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy cosmic ray s. Photoelectric heating in grains The ultraviolet radiation emitted by hot star s can remove electron s from dust grains. The photon hits the dust grain, and some of its energy is used in overcoming the potential energy barrier (due to the possible positive charge of the grain) to remove the electron from the grain. The remainder of the photon&apos;s energy heats the grain and gives the ejected electron kinetic energy. Since the size distribution of dust grains is n(r) \propto r^{-3.5}, where r is the size of the dust particle, the grain area distribution is r^2 n \propto r^{-1.5}. This indicates that the smallest dust grains dominate this method of heating. Photoionization When an electron is freed from an atom (typically from absorption of a UV photon ) it carries kinetic energy away of the order: E_{photon} - E_{ionization}. This heating mechanism dominates in HII regions, but is negligible in the diffuse ISM due to the relative lack of neutral carbon atom s. X-ray heating X-ray s remove electron s from atom s and ion s, and those photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is often low, this heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic medium (as the column density is small). For example in molecular clouds only hard x-ray s can penetrate and x-ray heating can be ignored. This is assuming the region is not near an x-ray source such as a supernova remnant. Chemical heating Molecular hydrogen ( H_2 ) can be formed on the surface of dust grains when two H atoms (which can travel over the grain) meet. This process yields 4.48 eV of energy distributed over the rotational and vibrational modes, kinetic energy of the H_2 molecule, as well as heating the dust grain. This kinetic energy, as well as the energy transferred from de-excitation of the hydrogen molecule through collisions, heats the gas. Grain-gas heating Collisions at high densities between gas atoms and molecules with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is not important in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities. Grain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high. Gas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds (especially at high densities). Far infrared radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient: \alpha = \frac{T_2 - T}{T_d - T} where T is the gas temperature, T_d the dust temperature, and T_2 the post-collision temperature of the gas atom/molecule. This coefficient was measured by [ Burke Hollenbach 1983 ] as \alpha = 0.35. Other heating mechanisms A variety of macroscopic heating mechanisms are present including: Gravitational collapse of a cloud Supernova explosions Stellar wind s Expansion of H  II regions Magnetohydrodynamic waves created by supernova remnants [ Cooling mechanisms ] Fine structure cooling The process of fine structure cooling is dominant in most regions of the Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot gas and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant atom s having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: CII and OI in the neutral medium and OII, OIII, NII, NIII, NeII and NeIII in HII regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which will carry the energy out of the region. Cooling by permitted lines At higher temperatures, more levels than fine structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example, collisional excitation of the n=2 level of hydrogen will release a Ly \alpha photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational lines of CO is important. Once a molecule is excited, it eventually returns to a lower energy state, emitting a photon which can leave the region, cooling the cloud. [ The history of knowledge of interstellar space ] The nature of the interstellar medium has received the attention of astronomers and scientists over the centuries, and understanding of the ISM has developed. However, they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of &quot; interstellar &quot; space. The term appears to have been first used in print by [ Bacon 1626 &amp; sect; 354–5 ] : &quot; The Interstellar Skie.. hath.. so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the Starre. &quot; Later, natural philosopher [ Robert Boyle 1674 yes Robert Boyle ] discussed &quot; The inter-stellar part of heaven, which several of the modern Epicureans would have to be empty. &quot; Before modern electromagnetic theory, early physicist s postulated that an invisible luminiferous aether existed as a medium to carry lightwaves. It was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space, as [ Patterson 1862 ] wrote, &quot; this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the ether which fills the interstellar spaces. &quot; The advent of deep photographic imaging allowed Edward Barnard to produce the first images of dark nebula e silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy, while the first actual detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by Johannes Hartmann in 1904 [ March 2012 ] through the use of absorption line spectroscopy. In his historic study of the spectrum and orbit of Delta Orionis, Hartmann observed the light coming from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed before it reached the Earth. Hartmann reported that absorption from the &quot; K &quot; line of calcium appeared &quot; extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp &quot; and also reported the &quot; quite surprising result that the calcium line at 393.4  nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the spectroscopic binary star &quot;. The stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of Delta Orionis, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star. This discovery launched the study of the Interstellar Medium. In the series of investigations, Viktor Ambartsumian introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds. [ To Victor Ambartsumian on his 80th birthday S. Chandrasekhar Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy 18 3 10.1007/BF01005852 1988Ap.....29..408C ] Following Hartmann&apos;s identification of interstellar calcium absorption, interstellar sodium was detected by [ Heger 1919 ] through the observation of stationary absorption from the atom&apos;s &quot; D &quot; lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nanometres towards Delta Orionis and Beta Scorpii. Subsequent observations of the &quot; H &quot; and &quot; K &quot; lines of calcium by [ Beals 1936 ] revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of Epsilon and Zeta Orionis. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards Orion. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the &quot; K &quot; line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different radial velocities. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either Blue-shifted or Red-shifted (respectively) from the lines&apos; rest wavelength, through the Doppler Effect. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM. The growing evidence for interstellar material led [ Pickering 1912 ] to comment that &quot; While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by Kapteyn, is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecule s are certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the Sun and star s. &quot; The same year Victor Hess &apos;s discovery of cosmic rays, highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year the Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland wrote: &quot; It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ion s of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar [sic] systems or nebula e, but in &apos;empty&apos; space &quot; [ Birkeland 1913 ]. [ Thorndike 1930 ] noted that &quot; it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void. Terrestrial aurorae are not improbably excited by charged particles from the Sun emitted by the Sun. If the millions of other star s are also ejecting ion s, as is undoubtedly true, no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy. &quot; [ See also ] [ Astronomy Solar System Space ] Diffuse interstellar band Fossil stellar magnetic field Heliosphere Interstellar masers List of molecules in interstellar space Photodissociation region List of plasma (physics) articles [ Notes ] [ References ] [ Bacon Francis Francis Bacon 1626 Sylva 354–5 ] [ Beals C.
