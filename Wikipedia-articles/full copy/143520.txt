[ 55.9411 -4.3180 type:landmark_region:GB inline West Highland Way, Milngavie trailhead ] { Fort William } [ 56.8215 -5.0941 type:landmark_region:GB inline West Highland Way, Fort William trailhead ] { Hiking } { Moderate } { All year } { Weather } The West Highland Way ( Scottish Gaelic : Slighe na Gàidhealtachd an Iar) is a linear long distance footpath in Scotland, with the official status of Long Distance Route. It is 154.5km (96  miles) long, running from Milngavie north of Glasgow to Fort William in the Scottish Highlands, with an element of hill walking in the route. It is managed by the West Highland Way Management Group(WHWMG) consisting of West Dunbartonshire Council, Stirling Council, Argyll &amp; Bute Council, Highland Council and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority. About 85,000 people use the path every year, of whom over 30,000 walk the entire route. [ History ] The trail was approved for development in 1974 and was completed and opened on October 6, 1980 by Lord Mansfield so becoming the first officially designated long distance footpath in Scotland. { The West Highland Way, Terry Marsh 2003 ISBN 1-85284-369-1 Cicerone } In June 2010, the West Highland Way was co-designated as part of the International Appalachian Trail. [ http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId%3D128148071 Hiking The Appalachian Trail -- To Morocco 2010-07-26 2010-06-27 ] [ The route ] WHW route marker The path uses many ancient roads, including drovers&apos; road s, military roads and old coaching roads and is traditionally walked from south to north. As well as increasing the sense of adventure, taking the route in this direction keeps the sun from one&apos;s eyes. The route is commonly walked in seven to eight days, although fitter and more experienced walkers do it in five or six. The route can be covered in considerably less time than this, but less hurried progress is the choice of the majority of walkers, allowing for appreciation of the countryside along the Way. Indeed, enjoyment of the natural surroundings of the walk is the primary motivating factor for many people following the route. The path officially starts in Milngavie town centre (approx 25 minutes by train from Glasgow Central Station), where a granite obelisk is located. Most walkers arrive at the railway station located close by. Milngavie is a town located on the northern fringe of the conurbation of Glasgow, and the path quickly enters open countryside. It proceeds by way of country roads, an abandoned railway, the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park and scenic Conic Hill on the Highland Boundary Fault, to reach Balmaha on Loch Lomond. From here, the route follows the isolated, wooded, eastern shores of the loch via Rowardennan and Inversnaid to Inverarnan. Rowardennan is the furthest north road access which is available on the east shore of the loch from the south. There is road access to Inversnaid from the east, via Aberfoyle. The Devil&apos;s Staircase The Way follows Glen Falloch northward to Crianlarich then north west along Strathfillan to Tyndrum. North of Tyndrum the Way enters Glen Orchy before crossing the desolate yet beautiful Rannoch Moor and descending into Glen Coe. From here, the route climbs the Devil&apos;s Staircase before a great descent to sea level at Kinlochleven. The final stage skirts the Mamore Mountains on an old military road and descends into Glen Nevis before finishing in Fort William. The last stage passes the foot of Ben Nevis and many walkers crown their achievement by climbing the highest mountain in Britain. Due to the large number of walkers being constrained to a single track, some parts of the Way have become badly eroded. However a considerable amount of work is undertaken to maintain the route. Walkers seeking solitude should consider starting their journey away from the weekends. When deciding the time of year to attempt the Way, it is good to know that midges (biting flies) and mosquitoes begin swarming in May and last well into August, some years even September. Also, Scottish weather can be particularly rugged and must be respected with proper forecasting and gear. A walk along the Way is often broken up into sections or stages, each of which will typically be walked in a day. One pattern of sections, travelling from south to north, is as follows { The West Highland Way, Terry Marsh } : [ Milngavie to Drymen ] The path officially starts in Milngavie town centre, where a granite obelisk is located. Most walkers arrive at the railway station located close by. Milngavie is a town located on the northern fringe of the conurbation of Glasgow. The path passes Mugdock Castle and Mugdock Country Park before emerging into open countryside and the Campsie Fells can be seen. This affords an opportunity to explore adjacents hills such as Dumgoyne (541837; 427m) or the small but heavily wooded Dumgoyach (531810;108m). Historically, both of these hills are associated with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall via Alice Keppel. Finally the Way reaches the village of Drymen. Milngavie to Carbeth - 5 miles Carbeth to Drymen - 7 miles This section is approximately [ 19 km ] in length. { The West Highland Way, Terry Marsh } [ Drymen to Balmaha ] After leaving Drymen the path enters Garadhban Forest before reaching the first major summit of the route, Conic Hill (a site of special scientific interest [ SNH SiteLink http://gateway.snh.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid%3D53%2C910305%2C53_910314%26amp%3B_dad%3Dportal%26amp%3B_schema%3DPORTAL%26amp%3BPA_CODE%3D397%26amp%3BNEW_WINDOW%3Dfalse 2009-04-03 ] ) at [ 358 m ]. The village of Balmaha on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond is the next settlement reached. Drymen to Balmaha - 8 miles This section is approximately [ 13 km 0 ] in length. [ Balmaha to Rowardennan ] The path heads in a northerly direction alongside the eastern shore of Loch Lomond passing through Rowardennan Forest before reaching the village Rowardennan. Balmaha to Rowardennan - 7 miles This section is approximately [ 11 km 0 ] in length. [ Rowardennan to Crianlarich ] The path leaves Rowardennan and heads in a northerly direction alongside the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, passing a cavern known as Rob Roy &apos;s cave, before reaching the village of Crianlarich. Rowardennan to Inversnaid - 7 miles Inversnaid to Inverarnan - 7 miles Inverarnan to Crianlarich - 6 miles This section is approximately [ 32 km ] in length. [ Crianlarich to Tyndrum ] Crianlarich to Tyndrum - 6 miles This section is approximately [ 10 km ] in length. [ Tyndrum to Glencoe ] Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy - 7 miles Bridge of Orchy to Inveroran - 2 miles Inveroran to Kingshouse - 10 miles This section is approximately [ 30 km ] in length. [ Glencoe to Kinlochleven ] Glen Coe (Gleann Comhann in Gaelic ) is often considered one of the most spectacular and beautiful places in Scotland, and is a part of the designated National Scenic Area of Ben Nevis and Glencoe. The narrow glen shows a dramatically grim grandeur, shut in on both sides by wild and precipitous mountains. Towards Invercoe the landscape acquires a softer beauty. Kingshouse to Kinlochleven - 9 miles This stage is approximately [ 14 km ] in length. [ Kinlochleven to Fort William ] Kinlochleven to Fort William - 15miles This section is approximately [ 24 km ] in length. [ Ultramarathons on the West Highland Way ] Jez Bragg setting a new West Highland Way Race record of 15:44:50 on 24 June 2006 There are several ultramarathon s held on the West Highland Way. The Highland Fling Race is an annual [ 53 mi km 0 ] race from Milngavie to Tyndrum. [ http://www.highlandflingrace.org/ Highland Fling Race ] The West Highland Way Race is an annual [ 95 mi km 0 ] race along the full south–north distance of the West Highland Way. [ West Highland Way Race ] The race has been run in its current form since 1991. The race starts at 1 am on the Saturday nearest to the Summer Solstice. { Race web site } Bobby Shields (Clydesdale Harriers) and Duncan Watson (Lochaber) initiated the idea of racing over Scotland&apos;s most popular long distance footpath. On 22 June 1985 the two set out from Milngavie. Their route differed in many ways from the route of today: it was shorter, at 85 miles (not 95), and had 10–12 miles more on tarmac, with around 2000  ft less of climbing. After around 60 miles, as they started over Rannoch Moor, they decided to cease competing against each other and ran together. They set a time of 17 hours 48 minutes 30 seconds. In 1986 Shields and Watson opened up an invitation to some fellow runners to race in the opposite direction, Fort William - Milngavie. 1987 saw a return to the established direction of running, South - North. Of eleven starters seven arrived in Fort William. Jim Stewart took over the organisation of the event in 1991, as the footpath was now complete, the course was changed, increasing the distance to 153  km with only 15  km on road and more climbing was introduced. With this increased difficulty runners were likely to be out longer and now a bigger percentage may be out a second night. Dario Melaragni, who had completed the race himself three times, took over as race director in 1999. { &apos;&apos;Dario Melaragni&apos;&apos; -Herald Scotland 31 July 2009 } He developed the format of the race by involving local mountain rescue teams who provided emergency response during the event. He also inaugurated and developed the race website, which has become a prime source of information for runners wishing to attempt the race. The race has gained status [ October 2009 ] in recent years and entries fill within a few weeks of opening. [ October 2009 ] In July 2009, whilst out running with friends, Melaragni suffered a suspected heart attack and died near the summit of Lochnagar in the Cairngorms. { &apos;&apos;Race Daddy&apos; drops dead on hills&apos;&apos; -Herald Scotland 15 July 2009 } His funeral was attended by many people wearing West Highland Way Race clothing. 122 runners finished in 2009 and 109 finished in 2010. 514 have now completed the challenge. Jim Drummond has 14 finishes. The race record holder is Jez Bragg from Solihull with a time of 15:44:50, set on 24 June 2006. The female record holder is Lucy Colquhoun of North Berwick with a time of 17:16:20, set in 2007.
