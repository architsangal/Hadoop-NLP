The population was 315 at the 2010 census. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 0.3 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. Minnesota State Highway 13 serves as a main route in the community. It is a very small town but fun to live in. There are a few things to do there. You can walk around town, eat at the cafe, or watch the trains go by. One good thing about living in Hartland is that it is quiet. Traffic is almost non-existent. The town of Hartland was founded in 1878, after large scale land dispute with other farming communities. During this time county lines were not well marked, often leading to farmers claiming the same land. No where was this a greater problem than in the northernmost part of Freeborn County. In one spot, 6 different farmers claimed to own the same area of ground. Since there was little legal help available, people took matters into their own hands. As tensions rose, factions began to develop. Those living in northern Freeborn County, who were mostly immigrants that had recently purchased supposedly &quot; vacant &quot; land, insisted that since the land was in their county, it should be theirs. The residents of neighboring Waseca and Steele counties, who had lived and farmed there longer, felt that Freeborn county&apos;s border should be moved away from the contested land. The farmers of lower Waseca and Steel counties formed an uneasy alliance that allowed them to keep the fertile land area for themselves. Tensions burst when a Freeborn farmer intentionally stole crops from a field controlled by the farmers of Waseca county. The Freeborn resident justified his act saying that if he had paid for the land, he deserved its harvest. His theft sparked what would become a large scale riot, even by modern standards. Both sides knew that a confrontation was inevitable. The Waseca and Steele county farmers recruited men from the existing towns of New Richland and Ellendale, forming a rowdy mob. On the evening of November 10, 1877 the mob began the 6 mile march to where the Freeborn farmer who stole the crops lived. The mob was intercepted by a smaller Freeborn assembly formed to protect the farmer. What started as a trading of insults soon became violent. The melee that ensued lasted until it was too dark to see one side from the other. When both sides withdrew, they found that the local preacher, Simon Hart, was dead. Hart had tried to stop the two mobs from fighting, but was beaten and trampled to death in the confusion of battle that followed. Accounts of his death vary. Men on both sides swore they saw those on the other side kill him. It was apparent to both sides, however, that the dispute could never be solved through violence. It was decided that the land would be split equally between farmers of all three counties. The following year, residents of Freeborn county decided to form a small community near by the previously contested land. They named the town &quot; Hartland &quot; in honor of Hart&apos;s selfless bravery and tragic death. One of Hartland&apos;s claims to fame is its prestigious college: The Hartland University. Founded in 1899 by Jimmy McMillon, the esteemed school has attracted brilliant minds from all over the country.
