[ 1181 8 30 y ] { (aged 76–81) } { Civita Castellana, } { Papal States, } { Holy Roman Empire } { Alexander } Pope Alexander III (c. 1100/1105 – 30 August 1181), born Rolando (or Orlando) of Siena, was Pope from 1159 to 1181. He is noted in history for laying the foundation stone for the Notre Dame de Paris. [ Church career ] He was born in Siena. From 14th century he is referred to as a member of the aristocratic family of Bandinelli, but this is not proven.

Later he became cardinal priest with the Title of St Mark. In 1153, he became papal chancellor and was the leader of the cardinals opposed to German Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. He negotiated the Treaty of Benevento, which restored peaceful relations between Rome and the Kingdom of Sicily. [ Election as Pope and disputed authority ] [ Papal election, 1159 ] On 7 September 1159, he was chosen the successor of Pope Adrian IV. A minority of the cardinals, however, elected the cardinal priest Octavian, who assumed the name of Victor IV and became the German Emperor&apos;s antipope. The situation was critical for Alexander III, because according to many chronicles of the time (perhaps exaggerating), Barbarossa&apos;s antipope received the approval of most of the kingdoms of Europe, with the exception of the kingdoms of Portugal, Sicily and Spain. However, in 1161, King Géza II of Hungary signed an agreement and recognised Alexander III as the rightful pope and declared that the supreme spiritual leader was the only one who could exercise the rite of investiture. { Bodri Ferenc: Lukács érsek és kora. Kossuth, 2003 } This meant that Alexander&apos;s legitimacy was gaining strength, as soon proved by the fact that other monarchs, such as the king of France and King Henry II of England, recognized his authority. However, the dispute between Alexander III, Antipope Victor IV and his successors Antipope Paschal III and Antipope Calixtus III (who had the German imperial support) continued until Frederick Barbarossa&apos;s defeat at the Legnano in 1176, after which Barbarossa finally (in the Peace of Venice of 1177) recognized Alexander III as pope. On 12 March 1178 Alexander III returned to Rome, which he had been compelled to leave twice: the first time between 1162 and 23 November 1165, when he was sent into exile in Campania by Oddone Frangipane following his brief arrest and detainment, and again in 1167. The first period he spent in France, the latter chiefly in Gaeta, Benevento, Anagni, and Venice. [ Political aspects of Alexander&apos;s papacy ] { Frederick Barbarossa submits to the authority of Pope Alexander III ( } { fresco in the Palazzo Pubblico in } { Siena, by } { Spinello Aretino ). } Alexander III was the first pope known to have paid direct attention to missionary activities east of the Baltic Sea. In 1165, his close friend Eskil, Archbishop of Lund, appointed a Benedictine monk Fulco as a bishop in Estonia. In 1171, Alexander became the first pope to address the situation of the Church in Finland, with Finns allegedly harassing priests and only relying on God in time of war. { Letter by Pope Alexander III to the Archbishop of Uppsala. In Latin. Hosted by the National Archive of Finland. See and Diplomatarium Fennicum from the menu. } In March 1179, Alexander III held the Third Council of the Lateran, one of the most important mediaeval church councils, reckoned by the Roman Church as the eleventh ecumenical council. Its acts embodied several of the Pope&apos;s proposals for the betterment of the condition of the Church, among them the law requiring that no one could be elected pope without the votes of two-thirds of the cardinals. The rule was altered slightly in 1996, but was restored in 2007. This synod marked the summit of Alexander III&apos;s power. Besides checkmating Barbarossa, Alexander humbled King Henry II of England for the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170, to whom he was unusually close. Nonetheless, he confirmed the position of Henry as Lord of Ireland in 1172. Through the Papal bull Manifestis Probatum, issued on May 23 rd, 1179, he also recognized the right of Afonso I to proclaim himself King of Portugal – an important step in the process of Portugal becoming a recognized independent Kingdom. Even as a fugitive, Alexander enjoyed the favour and protection of Louis VII of France. Nevertheless, soon after the close of the synod, the Roman Republic forced Alexander III to leave the city, which he never re-entered, and on 29 September 1179, some nobles set up the Antipope Innocent III. By the judicious use of money, however, Alexander III got him into his power, so that he was deposed in January 1180. In 1181, Alexander III excommunicated King William I of Scotland and put the kingdom under an interdict. He died at Civita Castellana on 30 August 1181. [ In popular culture ] [ November 2010 ] Alexander is a character in Jean Anouilh &apos;s play Becket. In the 1964 film adaptation he was portrayed by Italian actor Paolo Stoppa. Alexander III is mentioned in Umberto Eco &apos;s book Baudolino.
