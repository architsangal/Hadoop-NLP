A member of the Irgun as a teenager, Avnery sat in the Knesset from 1965–74 and 1979–81. { Uri Avnery Knesset activities Knesset website } He was also the owner of HaOlam HaZeh, an Israeli news magazine, from 1950 until it closed in 1993. He is famous for crossing the lines during the Siege of Beirut to meet Yassir Arafat on 3 July 1982, the first time the Palestinian leader ever met with an Israeli. Avnery is the author of several books about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including 1948: A Soldier’s Tale, the Bloody Road to Jerusalem (2008); Israel’s Vicious Circle (2008); and My Friend, the Enemy (1986). [ Biography ] Avnery was born in Beckum, Germany as Helmut Ostermann, to a well-established German Jewish family. Avnery and his family emigrated to Palestine in 1933, following Adolf Hitler &apos;s rise to power. { Uri Avnery biography, } { Knesset website. } He attended school in Nahalal and then in Tel Aviv, leaving after 7th grade, at age 14, in order to help his parents. He started work as a clerk for a lawyer, a job he held for about five years. He joined the Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary group, in 1938 [ http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/avneri_eng.htm Uri Avnery (Ostermann) Knesset.gov.il 20 December 1966 27 August 2011 ] and wrote for some of their internal publications. At one point he edited the internal Revisionist journal Ba-Ma&apos;avak ( &quot; in the Struggle &quot; ). { Shavit 138 } He started writing for independent publications at the age of 17. He left the Irgun in 1942 after becoming disenchanted with their tactics, stating in a 2003 interview that, &quot; I didn&apos;t like the methods of terror applied by the Irgun at the time &quot;, noting he did not back killing people in retaliation for similar acts by the Arabs. [ Violence is a symptom; the occupation is the disease Jon Elmer 14 September 2003 http://www.fromoccupiedpalestine.org/node/764 ] In 1947 Avnery started his own small group, Eretz Yisrael Hatze&apos;ira ( &quot; Young Land of Israel &quot; ), which published the journal Ma&apos;avak ( &quot; Struggle &quot; ). { Shavit 139 } Avnery&apos;s early political thought was influenced by Canaanism; in 1947 he proposed a union of the countries in the &quot; Semitic region &quot; : Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. { Shavit 141 } During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Avnery fought on the southern front in the Givati Brigade as a squad commander, and later in the Samson&apos;s Foxes commando unit (and also wrote its anthem). { Bar-On, Mordechai (2001), The Beginning of the Israeli Historiography of the 1948 War; Ministry of Defense Publishing; ISBN 965-05-1126-1 } He wrote dispatches from the front line which were published in Haaretz and later as a book, In the Fields of Philistia ( [ בשדות פלשת ], Bi-Sdot Pleshet).

After briefly working at Haaretz, in 1950, Avnery (with Shalom Cohen and two others) bought the failing magazine HaOlam HaZeh ( &quot; This World &quot; ). Avnery edited the weekly magazine during the 1950s and the 1960s Avnery, turning it into an anti-establishment tabloid known for many sensational scoop s and for featuring nudes on its back cover. The formula seemed to work, as for many years it was Israel&apos;s leading alternative-media publication. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 Avnery used his editorials in HaOlam HaZeh to call for a preventive war against Egypt, arguing that &quot; the reactionary Arab regimes &quot; would attack Israel &quot; the minute Arab superiority in weapons over Israel is great enough. &quot; { Shavit 144–45 } He began to revise his views after the 1956 Suez Crisis, which ended in Israeli withdrawal and strengthened Nasser. { Shavit 145 } In June 1957 Avnery suggested that Israel aid Palestinians in overthrowing the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan (a &quot; product of imperialism &quot; ); Israel would then form a federation with the new Palestinian Jordanian state. In the late 1950s Avnery was among the founders of the group Semitic Action, which argued for a regional federation of Israel and its neighbors.

Diamond Tikkun 5, No.2 106–110 ] In 1965 Avnery created a political party bearing the name of his and Cohen&apos;s magazine, HaOlam HaZeh – Koah Hadash, and was elected to the Knesset in the 1965 election. Although he retained his seat in the 1969 election, the party disintegrated and Avnery renamed it Meri. Although it failed to win any seats in the 1973 elections, Avnery returned to the Knesset as a member of the Left Camp of Israel after the 1977 election, but did not retain his seat in the 1981 election. He was later involved in the Progressive List for Peace. In late 1975 Avnery was among the founders of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace.

In her will, Hilda wrote &quot; I do not leave a penny to my son Uri, who instead of taking care of me went off to visit that murderer Yasser Arafat &quot;. { http://www.haaretz.com/culture/books/politics-the-third-side-of-the-coin-1.344000 } He later turned to left-wing peace activism and founded the Gush Shalom movement in 1993, which he continues to lead as of 2009. He is a secularist and strongly opposed to the Orthodox influence in religious and political life. { Hadash rally against the } { 2006 Lebanon War } In 2001, Avnery and his wife Rachel Avnery were honoured with the Right Livelihood Award, sometimes called the &quot; Alternative Nobel Prize &quot;, &quot; … for their unwavering conviction, in the midst of violence, that peace can only be achieved through justice and reconciliation &quot;.
