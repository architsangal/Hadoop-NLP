[ January 2012 ] [ Senate investigation ] On November 6, 2007, United States Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa announced an investigation of several ministries by the United States Senate Committee on Finance. Grassley asked for financial information to determine whether Dollar made any personal profit from financial donations and requested that Dollar&apos;s ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. The investigation also asked for information from five other televangelists: Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Eddie L. Long, Joyce Meyer, and Paula White.

Dollar has contested the probe, arguing that the proper governmental entity to examine religious groups is the IRS, not the Committee on Finance. { http://www.creflodollarministries.org/About/documents/LegalResponse03032008.pdf } The Wittenburg Door writes, 11/8/2007, &quot; Creflo Dollar is one of six televangelists who has gotten letters from the Senate Finance Committee asking them to send in detailed accounting statements proving they are not converting church money to their personal use. Creflo Dollar is the pastor of World Changers Church International of College Park, Georgia. Presumably he chose that name himself, completely free of fear that it would be soon be better known as Money Changers Church International by the 30,000 members who weekly enrich its coffers and make it possible for Creflo to maintain the two jets—one Gulfstream 3 and one Lear—that he uses to shuttle back and forth between Madison Square Garden (where he does a Saturday night service for an audience of 6,000) and Atlanta (where he does a Sunday morning service), not to mention occasional visits to his offices in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and Nigeria.Creflo&apos;s wife Taffi Dollar—and here we remind you once again that we are not lapsing into fiction at any point during the creation of this article—Taffi Dollar is responsible for the household budget at the $3 million Dollar mansion in Atlanta, and the more modest $2.44 million Dollar condo overlooking Central Park in Manhattan. Asked about the Dollar dollars by CBS News yesterday, Dollar said it was untrue that he had two Rolls-Royces; he claimed that he only had one Rolls-Royce and it was given to him by his congregation as a surprise. He also said he did not give $500,000 of church funds to fellow prosperity gospel evangelist Kenneth Copeland on the occasion of Copeland&apos;s 40th wedding anniversary. Accordingly, Dollar&apos;s annual budget for his operation was estimated at &quot; about 80 million &quot; (citation needed).
