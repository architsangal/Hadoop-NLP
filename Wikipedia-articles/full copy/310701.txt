Today, the majority of Adria Airways business is in scheduled flights. Adria operates to 21 scheduled destinations throughout Europe this summer and offers connections to South East Europe. It is a Star Alliance member since 2004 and a Lufthansa partner since 1996. IOSA Registration was received among the first airlines in the world. The company’s head office is Ljubljana Airport in Zgornji Brnik, Cerklje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia, near Ljubljana. The company also representative offices in Ljubljana and at Ljubljana Airport, Brussels, Paris, Moscow, Frankfurt, Zagreb, Zurich and sales agents in almost all European countries. Adria Airways operates charter flights for the most part seasonally, and most frequently to destinations in the Mediterranean. Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada in Egypt are currently the only charter destinations served by Adria Airways all year round. Ad hoc charter flights are also provided. Its fleet of 13 planes is one of the most modern fleets in Europe, and is both environment-friendly and economical. [ History ] [ 1960s: Early years ] { Douglas DC-6 B at } { Le Bourget Airport (1971). } The airline was founded in March 1961 as Adria Aviopromet (Adria Airways). In August that year the company purchased two used DC-6B aircraft from KLM and the same month flew their first commercial flight with a Dutch crew. At the same time, the first Adria crew and technical teams were trained by JAT and the air force. Adria carried out its first flight with a domestic crew in December 1961. At the same time all other activities necessary for the company were set up and organised, from the commercial to the accounting department. { Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p31 } { Adria Airways history page } During the following years Adria gradually acquired a market with tourist flights from Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia to airports on the Adriatic coast. In 1964 flights to the United States and Canada were added in order to meet the needs of ex-patriot organisations. Adria also carried out a considerable number of flights for the United Nations. With the opening of the new airport in Ljubljana in 1964, Adria relocated its base from its previous headquarters in Zagreb. The DC-6B aircraft gradually became non-competitive on the market. The company fell into a serious crisis in 1967, which ended with a bankruptcy procedure at the start of 1968. After a compulsory settlement, Adria continued its operations largely thanks to the efforts of the president of the Slovenian Chamber of the Commerce and Industry of the time. In December 1968 Adria merged with the company InterExport and changed its name from Adria Aviopromet to Inex-Adria Aviopromet (Inex-Adria Airways). The fleet renewal began. Inex-Adria Caravelle in 1972. [ 1970s: Jetliner introduction ] In 1969 the first jet aircraft was purchased, a DC-9-30 with 115 seats. Thus began a period of modernisation of the fleet, which allowed Adria to increase its share on the tourist flights market. In September 1969 the first scheduled service was established on the Ljubljana - Belgrade -Ljubljana route. In March 1970, Adria had four Douglas DC-6B and one Douglas DC-9-30 with one more on order. { Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p33 } { Frankfurt Airport in 1976. } Business saw a considerable increase. Adria, in addition to expanding the number of its own aircraft, occasionally also leased aircraft ( Caravelle, DC-8, BAC 1-11 ). In 1972 Adria renewed its transatlantic flights to the United States and Canada with Douglas DC-8-55 aircraft. However, it withdrew from that service the following year. Later in 70s, Adria was awarded as most punctual carrier on the charter flight market. The greatest commercial successes of that period were achieved on the German market which was also the largest at that time, in a productive partnership with Grimex Company. The number of flights to Great Britain, France, Spain and Scandinavia also increased. During that period, Adria also introduced flights within Yugoslavia.The company paid a great deal of attention to education. It founded a professional education centre and assisted in setting up an aviation course at the engineering faculty in Ljubljana. Special emphasis was given to the development of safety awareness, as three accidents occurred during the last decade. [ 1980s: Modernisation ] Inex-Adria Aviopromet (Inex-Adria Airways) entered the 1980s as a respectable company with confirmed success on the tourist market and scheduled internal flights. { Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p35 } In May 1981 Adria purchased three new McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. Unafortunately, after just few months of operation, one of them crashed into a mountain in Corsica in December the same year, killing all aboard. The next year, Adria got a new leadership which focused on the education of the flight crews, technical staff and other professional personnel as well as on ensuring safety. In that period, the business remained focused on charter flights to the Adriatic. Flights for guest worker s in Germany and Switzerland, which were connected to internal flights, became an important part of the business. At the end of 1984 the first scheduled international flights was also established on the Ljubljana - Belgrade - Larnaca route. Prospects for the development of air traffic were very good, so in 1984 Adria signed a contract for the purchase of five Airbus A320 aircraft. { &quot; Mitterrand backs A320 &quot; Flight International 14 January 1984 p52 } { Flight International December 1987 } Also two new Dash-7 aircraft were bought for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. { Flight International February 1984 } { Stuttgart Airport in 1989. } Fleet became very big, in December 1985 Adria had four DC-9-30, two DC-9-50, one MD-81, three MD-82 and two Dash-7 aircraft. One year later another MD-82 joined the fleet. { Flight International December 1985 } { Flight International December 1987 } Due to a commercial law restructuring programme, in 1986 Adria left the Inex group, becoming an independent company and changing its name to Adria Airways. Later, Adria became a member of IATA.In 1989, the first new Airbus A320 arrived. It was 43rd A320 made by the Airbus and the first one to be powered by the new IAE Engines. [ 1990s: Becoming a scheduled airline ] As Yugoslavia began to break up, the tourist industry on the Adriatic slumped, which was also felt by the air carriers. In September 1990, another two new Airbus A320 arrived. The last two were expected to arrive the in June, 1991. In December 1990, a referendum on the independence of Slovenia was held in which the overwhelming majority of Slovenian residents (around 89%) voted for the independence of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. Independence was declared on 25 June 1991. Following that, Adria was facing an entirely new set of circumstances. On 28 June 1991, Yugoslav Federal Air Force attacked Adria’s hangar, causing serious damage to four aircraft, building and vehicles. One Airbus A320, not even a year old, was heavily damaged and was flown to Toulouse later that year for almost a year of repairs. In addition, two Dash-7 and one DC-9-30 were damaged as well, while other planes escaped damage after being flown just hours earlier to the nearest airport of Klagenfurt. Adria was very handicapped that year because of the insurance and registration issues. { Adria Airways In-Flight Magazine p37 } { Airbus A320-231, S5-AAB, at } { Frankfurt Airport. (September 2003) } In 1991 Adria had 13 aircraft; three Airbus A320, four MD-82, one MD-81, three DC-9-30 and two Dash-7. An additional two Airbus A320 that had been ordered to be delivered in June 1991, were sold to other airlines. Flights began in January 1992, when Adria Airways re-established its activities on a truncated market. The majority of charter destinations from Western Europe to the Adriatic coast had become inaccessible as they were now situated on the territory of other countries. The fleet was too big, so many aircraft were leased out across the globe. Adria Airways became Slovenia’s national air carrier and its operational structure changed. From being largely a charter airline it transformed itself into a scheduled operator. Adria began to set up a network of scheduled flights around Europe to serve the needs of an independent Slovenia. Later in 1992 the company joined the Amadeus global travel distribution system. A period of restructuring and rehabilitation of the company began. In the next years, Airbus A320s were mainly leased out, as well as MD-82s. One MD-81 and one MD-82 were sold till 1994. The other three MD-82 and one DC-9-30 were sold till the end of 1995.As a part of the ownership restructuring of Adria Airways, in February 1996 the Government of Slovenia obtained a 100% share in the company. In 1996, in line with administration’s rescue programme, a rehabilitation procedure was started the aim of which was to enable the company to run on market principles. The main emphasis was on the rationalization and modernization of the operations and the adaptation of the fleet to market requirements. The number of employees has been reduced from 931 to around 618. In 1996, fleet consisted three Airbus A320 with 168 seats (at least two were leased out most of the time), two DC-9-30 with 105 seats and two Dash-7 with 46 seats. Adria started a corporation with the Lufthansa later in 1996. { Bombardier CRJ100LR, S5-AAH, landing at } { Frankfurt Airport. (June 2010) } In April 1997 Adria ordered two new Bombardier CRJ200LR planes with an option for one more. Planes were delivered in the beginning of the year 1998 when two Dash-7 and two DC-9-30 left the fleet. Another CRJ200LR arrived later in the 1998. { Flight International November 1997 } Bombardier CRJ200LR were chosen as the best option for flights operated from Ljubljana, which allowed for more flights to be flown directly and more frequent. CRJ200LR are in 48 seats configuration which give space for a larger baggage compartment needed for charters. In 1999 Adria’s fleet was consisted out of 3 Airbus A320, which were now operating back home and three CRJ200LR. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the airline head office was in Ljubljana. { &quot; World Airline Directory. &quot; } { Flight International. 18–24 March 1998. 37. &quot; Kuzmiceva 7, Ljubljana. 1000, Slovenia &quot; } { Home page.

Retrieved on 7 February 2011. &quot; Adria Airways d.d Kuzmičeva 7 1000 Ljubljana Slovenia &quot; } [ 2000s: Getting on the new markets ] Adria started to connect the Balkan cities with the western Europe via its hub Ljubljana in the late 90s. Cities like Sarajevo, Skopje, Ohrid, Tirana were connected with Scandinavia, UK, Germany and France. After a Kosovo war ended in 1998, Adria was the first one to fly to Pristina in the winter 1999-2000. { Adria Airways Winter 1999-2000 Timetable } In March 2000, the fourth new 48 seats Bombardier CRJ200LR arrived. Maribor, the second largest city in Slovenia was connected with Munich for a short period of time in the summer of 2000. There were 5 weekly flights around noon. In 2001, Adria Airways recorded a large decrease in the number of annual passengers as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In winter 2001-2002 Adria started flying in the EU market on the Vienna - Frankfurt -Vienna route. In July 2002, Bombardier Aerospace selected Adria as the first authorised heavy maintenance facility for CRJ aircraft in Europe. In spring 2003 Adria leased CRJ100LR with 50 seats from Bombardier and was leased till January 2011. IOSA certificate was obtained in August 2004 among the first airline in the world. The same month the sixth CRJ200LR with 50 seats was leased from GECAS. On 18 November 2004, Adria Airways joined the Star Alliance. { Boeing 737-500, UR-GAS, at } { London Gatwick Airport. (April 2007) } In January 2005, seventh brand new CRJ200LR with 50 seats was delivered to Adria. This year, Adria ended with a loss of around 10M€ and a new CEO was announced later in 2005. While new leadership ideas were not reasonable, Tadej Tufek became a new CEO in 2006. Two Boeing 737-500 (112 seats) aircraft were leased from Ukraine International and Cirrus Air to fill the gap between A320 (162 seats) and CRJ200 (48/50 seats). One Airbus A320 was leased to Afriqiyah Airways till the late 2009 while the another Airbus A320 joined Afriqiyah in the winter 2006-2007 till the Summer 2008. In 2006, the company recorded a minimal profit and transported its first annual millionth passenger since the late 1980s. In the beginning of year 2007, Adria ordered two Bombardier CRJ900 which were delivered in May the same year. During the Summer fleet consisted now out of one Airbus A320 (162 seats), one leased Boeing B737-500 (112 seats) from Ukraine Intl Airlines, two Bombardier CRJ900LR (86 seats) and seven Bombardier CRJ200LR (48/50 seats) aircraft. In November 2007 Adria has announced to purchase a new CRJ1000 NextGen and two new CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Adria ended year with a small profit. In 2008 Adria converted its CRJ1000 NextGen order into fifth CRJ900 and made a loss of 3M€ again. { Adria Airways Annual Report 2008 } { Bombardier CRJ900, S5-AAK, at } { Frankfurt Airport. (June 2011) } In March 2009, Adria Airways has signed a letter of intent with Airbus to purchase a new Airbus A319 aircraft. The management board made a plan to replace Airbus A320 fleet with new Airbus A319 aircraft. The seating configuration of the aircraft allows for 135 seats, which is rational for the type of service operated by Adria Airways. Two Airbus A320 were sold to Myanmar Airways International in 2009, S5-AAC in October and S5-AAB in December. In November 2009 new headquarters at Ljubljana Airport were opened. A loss of 14M€ Euro s was made in 2009. { Adria Airways Annual Report 2009 } [ 2010s: Solving the crisis ] Adria started a new decade with a huge accumulated loss. Though the future looked bright as two brand new A319 were planned to arrive in April 2010. In March 2010, Adria added Belgrade to its schedule, which was last operated prior to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. In April 2010, all operation was moved to Maribor, as Ljubljana airport was having its runway renovated. { Ljubljana Airport will close to all traffic for runway renovation between 7th and 21st April 2010 } Later that month, Adria like many other airlines in Europe, was grounded due to the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland. Adria took delivery of two brand new Airbus A319 s { Aviation news, April 30, 2010 } with a slight delay due to the volcanic eruption in April/May 2010. { Airbus A319 S5-AAR, at } { Frankfurt Airport } In June 2010, as a part of reorganisation of the company, Adria Tehnika and Adria Flight School were created as separate companies. { Adria Airways news June 2, 2010 } New flights to Banja Luka { Adria News July 14, 2010 } started in July, which are operated in co-operation with Sky Srpska. Flights ended one year after the beginning. Later that month, flights to Marseille were started, offering Turkish truck drivers a connection from Istanbul via Ljubljana. This flights were cancelled at the end of year 2011. Summer 2010 Adria’s fleet consisted of one Airbus A320 (162 seats), two Airbus A319 (135 seats), four Bombardier CRJ900LR (86 seats) and seven Bombardier CRJ200LR (48/50 seats) aircraft. On 11 September 2010, Airbus A320-231 registered S5-AAA, was retired and is stored at Ljubjana Airport till date. With the beginning of the winter timetable, flights from Marseille were moved to Toluon. From December 10, 2010, Adria has started serving new routes from Pristina, Kosovo. Destinations during the winter were Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Munich. { Adria news, November 18, 2010 } During summer, Brussels, Copenhagen and Paris were added to those started in the winter season. On January 14, 2011, CEO Tadej Tufek and Executive Director Marjan Ravnikar resigned because of bad results in the last years of leadership. The new CEO became Klemen Boštjančič and a new Executive Director Robert Vuga. Adria sold its shares in Adria Tehnika, to Ljubljana Airport and to the Government, to cover part of the loss. { Adria News, January 17, 2011 } At the end of January 2011, CRJ100LR registered S5-AAH was retired and returned in August 2011 to Bombardier Capital. In March 2011, Adria celebrated its 50th anniversary. An exhibition in The National Museum of Contemporary History was made showing the history of Slovenian national carrier. { The National Museum of Contemporary History } Adria&apos;s long term partners helped Adria with its celebration in December 2011. As a part of immediate actions by the new management, two new Airbus aircraft were leased. An Airbus A320-231, with registration S5-AAS (ex EI-DOD) is leased since April 2011 for 42 months. { Adria news, May 6, 2011 } It has 180 seats and is mostly operated on charter flights. Since end of May, a second Airbus A320-211 (ex CS-TNB) with registration S5-AAT was supposed to be leased for 18 months but it was stored in October same year. It wore Adria retro colors from the 60’. On January 26, 2012, S5-AAT was returned to the lessor GOAL which sold the aircraft. { http://www.goal-leasing.de/portfolio/jet/index.php } Adria Airways in retro colours In summer 2011 Adria operated with 2 Airbus A320 (180/162 Seats), 2 Airbus A319 (135 Seats), 4 Bombardier CRJ900 (86 Seats) and 6 Bombardier CRJ200 (50/48 Seats). The third Airbus A320 registered S5-AAA is still owned by Adria but it is not operational and is stored at Ljubljana airport. A total loss of 63.073.630 Euros was made in 2010. Note that the majority of the loss is due to revaluation of the fleet which showed a decrease of 45.443.441 Euros manily because of poor makert value of the CRJ200. Due to revaluation and accumulated losses, a financial restructuring plan was made in August. It involved the Government of Slovenia and the banks from which Adria took loans in the past years. By the plan, the Government invested 50 Million Euros and banks converted 25%-50% of the loans into the ownership. On September 21, 2011, Adria finalised the deal with the banks and the Government. Together Adria got 69.720.983,00 Euros, 50M from the Government, the rest was converted from loans in to the ownership by the banks. { http://www.adria.si/sl/news.cp2?uid=10BCF7CD-C34F-CD33-03DD-87F4360862EC &amp; linkid=news &amp; cid=18AE590F-0A78-8DCB-97F6-0819EAC75FB9 Adria Airways news, September 21, 2011 } On September 19, 2011, Adria Airways and Croatia Airlines signed a letter or agreement to lease each other&apos;s planes.
