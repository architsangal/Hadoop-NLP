[ History ] [ November 2010 ] The Fort Ransom Military Post was established in 1867. It was built to protect settlers and railroad workers who were working on the Northern Pacific Railroad between Fargo and Bismarck. It was named for distinguished Civil War veteran Major General Thomas E.G. Ransom. The fort was built on top of Grizzly Bear Hill, a site chosen by Brigadier General Alfred H. Terry. Fort Ransom was dismantled in 1872 and the materials were used to build Fort Seward at Jamestown, North Dakota in Stutsman County. The army had determined that protection of the Northern Pacific Railroad crew at the James River crossing was a higher priority than protecting the overland route. The final disposition of the military reservation took place on July 14, 1880, when it was turned over to the Department of Interior for survey and sale to homesteaders. The original site of the fort is located to the southwest of the town of Fort Ransom and 3 miles south of Fort Ransom State Park.
