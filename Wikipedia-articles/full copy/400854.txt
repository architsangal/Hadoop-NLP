Daniel Francis Galouye (11 February 1920 â€“ 7 September 1976) was an American science fiction writer. During the 1950s and 1960s, he contributed novelettes and short stories to various digest size science fiction magazines, sometimes writing under the pseudonym Louis G. Daniels. Born in New Orleans, Galouye (pronounced Gah-lou-ey) [ May 2010 ] graduated from Louisiana State University (B.A.) and then worked as a reporter for several newspapers. During World War II, he served in the US Navy as an instructor and test pilot, receiving injuries that led to later health problems. On December 26, 1945, he married Carmel Barbara Jordan. From the 1940s until his retirement in 1967, he was on the staff of The States Item. He lived in New Orleans but also had a summer home across Lake Ponchartrain at St. Tammany Parish in Covington, Louisiana. [ Novels and stories ] Galouye&apos;s first published fiction, the novelette Rebirth, appeared in the March 1952 issue of Imagination. His work appeared in many magazines of the period including Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Between 1961 and 1973, Galouye wrote five novels, notably Simulacron Three, basis of the movie The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and the German TV miniseries, Welt am Draht (1973) (directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder ). His first novel, Dark Universe (1961) was nominated for a Hugo. According to his obituary in the New Orleans States-Item, Galouye...... was a Navy pilot during WWII from 1942 to 1946. He graduated from Pensacola Naval Air School, held the rank of lieutenant and was for a time during his service years in charge of a training school in Hawaii for Navy airmen. Immediately after release from the Navy, he began his career with The States-Item as a reporter, then as a copy editor and joined the editorial department in 1956. He later was named associate editor of that department, retiring in 1967. He is survived by his widow, Mrs. Carmel Barbara Jordan Galouye; two daughters, Mrs. Gerald Johan Zomerdijk of Zaandam, Holland, and Mrs. Joseph Edward Ingraham of Covington; and five grandchildren. Dufour, Pie. &quot; D. F. Galouye, ex-S-I editor, is dead at 56, &quot; &apos;&apos;New Orleans States-Item&apos;&apos;, September 18, 1976. His retirement was due to failing health, which was in turn related to injuries sustained during his Navy service. His health continued to decline until his early death at age 56. He died in New Orleans&apos; Veteran&apos;s Hospital and is interred at Covington Cemetery #1 in Covington. { Willick, George C.
