The Guggenheim family is an American family, of Swiss Jewish ancestry. Beginning with Meyer Guggenheim, who arrived in America in 1847, the family were known for their global successes in mining and smelting (including the American Smelting and Refining Company ). During the 19th century, the family possessed one of the largest fortunes in the world. They later became known for their philanthropy in diverse areas such as modern art and aviation, including several Guggenheim Museums as well as the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and I. M. Pei&apos;s Guggenheim Pavilion at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. They sold off their global mining interests following World War I, then later purchased nitrate mines in Chile. Subsequently, the family largely left business.

Ratzenberger&apos;s publicist said they had a &quot; short lived relationship &quot; and that Ratzenberger was unaware of any criminal activity.
