The production model was certified by the FAA in October 1984. Since then, the Caravan has undergone a number of design evolutions. Working with FedEx, Cessna produced first the Cargomaster, and followed that with the stretched and upgraded Super Cargomaster. The passenger model, the Grand Caravan, was derived from the Super Cargomaster. Cessna 208B Grand Caravan factory demonstrator, with under-belly baggage locker, bearing the Cessna Caravan motto &quot; Sure Thing &quot; Cessna offers the 208B in many configurations. The basic 208 airframe can be outfitted with various types of landing gear, allowing it to operate in a wide variety of environments. Some common adaptations include skis, enlarged tires for unprepared runway s, and floats on the Caravan Amphibian model. In the cabin, the Caravan can be outfitted with seats or cargo holds. The standard high-density airline configuration features four rows of 1-2 seating behind the two seats in the cockpit. This variant is capable of holding up to thirteen passengers, although it is marketed as being able to make a profit carrying just four. [ Cessna Caravan.

Many variants include an under-belly cargo pod, which can be used for additional freight capacity, or for passenger baggage.
