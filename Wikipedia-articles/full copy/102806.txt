[ Norm Prescott, 78; Producer Co-Founded Filmation Studios The Los Angeles Times July 7, 2005 http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/07/local/me-passings7.2 2010-08-24 ] During a period lasting from the 1960s through the 1980s, the only real competitor to Hanna-Barbera Productions in the field of TV cartoons was Filmation. [ May 2010 ] Filmation&apos;s founders and principal producers were Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott. A trademark of the company&apos;s productions, beginning in 1969, was a rotating &quot; Produced by &quot; (and on some shows, &quot; Executive Producers &quot; ) credit seen in the end credits (and in later productions, the opening sequences) of Filmation programs, as a device that was supposedly created to allow Prescott and Scheimer to share equal billing. Previously, Scheimer&apos;s name had been placed above Prescott&apos;s. However, the later Filmation productions credited only Scheimer, in the form of his signature ( &quot; Lou Scheimer, Executive Producer &quot; ), starting with 1982&apos;s Gilligan&apos;s Planet. Many of its shows—particularly the productions of the late 1970s and 1980s—are notable for imparting a simple moral or life-lesson (explained by a key character, in a child-friendly manner) in the epilogue. [ History ] Filmation&apos;s 3rd logo from 1975 Lou Scheimer and Filmation&apos;s main director Hal Sutherland met while working at Larry Harmon Pictures on the made-for-TV Bozo and Popeye cartoons. Eventually Larry Harmon closed the studio. SIB Productions, a Japanese firm with U.S. offices in Chicago, approached Scheimer and Sutherland about producing a cartoon called Rod Rocket. The two agreed to take on the work and also took on a project for Family Films, owned by the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, for ten short animated films based on the life of Christ. The project enabled Scheimer and Sutherland to finance their own small Los Angeles animation studio, called True Line. Paramount Pictures soon purchased SIB Productions, and True Line&apos;s staff increased; including the arrival of former radio disc jockey Norm Prescott, who became a partner in the firm. He had already been working on the animated feature Pinocchio in Outer Space which was primarily produced by Belvision Studios, and also brought in the Journey Back to Oz project, which would be released over ten years later by Filmation. Both Rod Rocket and the life of Christ series credited &quot; Filmation Associates &quot; with &quot; Production Design &quot; in addition to Scheimer and Sutherland as directors; but True Line was not officially changed into the Filmation Associates corporation until Rod Rocket entered syndication in 1963. { http://www.toontracker.com/rodrock/rodrock.htm Rod Rocket } (SIB Productions, whose logo bore a resemblance to the original Filmation logo, would soon go on to become &quot; Sib-Tower 12 Productions &quot; and produce the first few of Chuck Jones &apos; Tom and Jerry films for MGM, until becoming MGM Animation/Visual Arts for the remainder of the films). [ Filmation Shuts Plant, Beats Closing Law Deadline by 1 Day The Los Angeles Times February 8, 1989 http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-08/business/fi-2066_1_plant-closing-law 2010-08-24 James Bates ] The new Filmation studio would for the next few years make television commercials, until approached by DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger to do a Superman cartoon. This premiered in 1966, and was followed by several of the other DC Comics heroes, and then in 1968, the first Archie show. Both series greatly helped Filmation&apos;s popularity to increase, into the 1970s, when it really scored big with several of its shows. [ Animation style ] [ June 2008 ] { Lindsay Dawson working on a key-frame of animation for &apos;&apos; } { He-Man and the Masters of the Universe &apos;&apos;. This was a typical working desk for animators, layout artists, and background designers at Filmation in 1983. } As with other producers of Saturday morning cartoon s, Filmation was more concerned with quantity rather than quality; however, it did make a number of attempts to rise above the standard animated fare and produce reasonably well-written cartoons. The best-known example of this is its animated adaptation Star Trek: The Animated Series, which included scripts contributed by well-known science fiction writers and starred most of the original cast. Other favorably remembered Filmation series included a 16-part animated serial of Flash Gordon, originally intended as a movie for theatrical release, Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All. The original film edit was only aired thrice on NBC, years after the series was canceled. Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids was another hailed series created by and starring Bill Cosby with an explicit educational focus, which enabled the actor to earn a doctorate in education. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, based on the popular line of Mattel toys, opened up a vibrant new North American market for first-run television syndication for animation in the 1980s. The animated adaptations of the Archie Comics characters were also noteworthy for the original pop music produced for it, particularly the song, &quot; Sugar, Sugar &quot;, which was a #1 hit single. [ Production Is Less Animated at Filmation Studio The Los Angeles Times January 1, 1988 http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-01/entertainment/ca-8278_1_animated-feature 2010-08-24 Charles Solomon ] In addition, certain episodes of He-Man and Bravestarr, in substance, and often animation, were pioneers in children&apos;s animated series of their time and paved the way for broader storytelling. Examples include He-Man&apos;s &quot; The Problem with Power &quot; which dealt with He-Man believing he had killed an innocent bystander. Another is &quot; Teela&apos;s Quest &quot; which introduced a now-famous mythology on The Sorceress being Teela&apos;s mother, who is heir to the mantle of safeguarding Grayskull, the versed continuity shared between He-Man and She-Ra, among others. Likewise, the scripts for Star Trek, which were often written by the same people who had written for the live-action version of the show, tended to be quite sophisticated, and garnered the first Emmy Award for the franchise. [ Quality ] Filmation had a reputation for exploiting the technique of limited animation to produce a number of animated series with a distinct look. It made heavy use of rotoscoping in later years (beginning with its Tarzan and Flash Gordon series). It also re-used the same animated sequences over and over, many times, to the point where the Filmation style was instantly recognizable. Veteran He-Man writer Chris Weber noted this in verse, set to &quot; I&apos;ve Been Working on the Railroad &quot; : &quot; Can&apos;t you see the kiddies streaming / home to watch him after school? / Can&apos;t you hear my boss a-screaming / &apos;Use stock footage, fool!&apos; &quot;. Filmation&apos;s animation often looked poor-quality, due to the limiting of the number of frames per second used to fewer than the regular 24 frame/second seen on film or 25/30 frame/s seen on video. Frames would be repeated to compensate for the deficiency, resulting in a jerky and cheap look. This frequent use of stock footage saved production money, but often resulted in sacrifice of continuity. This was countered by cutting from one stock shot to another after only a second or two, long enough to set the scene but before the eye could notice all of the unexplained errors. This became part of Filmation style during a period when most TV and motion picture production tended to run minimum shots of 4 –5 seconds. In contrast to the rapid jump cut s during action sequences, another Filmation trademark was the recurring use of long establishing-shots in which the camera would pan slowly across a very wide background painting, thus filling up screen time with sequences requiring little or no animation. Filmation also pioneered other animation technologies, particularly in Flash Gordon, which included backlighting effects for the first time in American animation (they were already in use in Japan), including moire effects to represent energy field s (a technique that was later used in He-Man and later in She-Ra). It also pioneered a unique method of generating 3-D vehicle animation by filming white-outlined black miniatures against black backgrounds using a computerized motion-control camera and high-contrast film, then printing the negatives onto acetate frame-by-frame, to create animation cels which were then hand-painted. This produced a dynamic, three-dimensional effect which had never been seen in cel animation before. It predated the modern use of 3-D computer animation for vehicles in 2-D animated productions. However, it had a distinctive &quot; flicker &quot; to it, because some of the painted lines went in and out of visibility as the miniatures moved. Unlike many American studios, Filmation never relied upon animation studios outside the United States for the bulk of its production; Ghostbusters and Bravestarr both state in the end credits that they were &quot; made entirely in the U.S.A. &quot;. Filmation did, however, rely on outsourcing once, when the company created its animated Zorro series. It was animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha of Japan, however the storyboards and graphics were made by Filmation itself. Filmation is also noteworthy for its lavish background paintings under the direction of longtime department head Erv Kaplan such as the purple-colored &quot; night sky &quot; backgrounds used in He-Man and She-Ra. [ Cartoon factory Filmation is under orders to cut costs, and a plan to shift some of its production overseas has alienated workers. The Los Angeles Times August 25, 1987 http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-25/business/fi-3946_1 2010-08-24 James Bates ] [ Color Cartoon Maker Blue Over Westinghouse Order to Cut Costs The Los Angeles Times August 25, 1987 http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-25/business/fi-4050_1_cartoon-factory 2010-08-24 James Bates ] Characters, as well as plots, were typically run of the mill for the time. For example, most episodes of Ghost Busters had the same scheme (bad guys develop an evil plan, the heroes are needed but always absent, Ghost Buggy the talking car complains about their dangerous position, Tracey the Gorilla pulls out of his back pack exactly the miscellaneous item the Ghost Buster needs in a moment of despair, Eddie doing a number of clumsy/stupid things etc.). Although as previously mentioned, Filmation made various attempts to rise above the norm. Many of the sounds and explosion effects used in its cartoons are also very familiar, the majority of them being recycled from Hanna-Barbera (though this was, and still is a common trait among animation companies), though the company&apos;s DC Comics cartoons of 1966-7 used more realistic sound effects. [ Original characters ] There were very few original animated characters created by the studio. Two examples were Fraidy Cat, a timid feline who has lost 8 of his 9 lives, which come back to haunt him; and Wacky and Packy, a caveman and his pet mammoth ( &quot; Packy &quot; refers to the latter character being a &quot; pachyderm &quot; ) who enter the modern age through a time warp. Both of these originally aired as segments of the Uncle Croc&apos;s Block show on ABC (hosted by Charles Nelson Reilly ). The show did so poorly that ABC, whose entertainment division had just come under control of Fred Silverman, reportedly ceased ordering programs from Filmation. [ December 2007 ] In a period where ideas for cartoons had run dry (comedy was heavily scrutinized for violence, and everything else seemed to copy the popular Scooby-Doo format), Filmation&apos;s strong point was its adaptations of popular TV shows, movies and other works, although at least one show, &quot; M*U*S*H &quot; (the third animated segment on Uncle Croc&apos;s Block), while not a direct adaptation was inspired by the film (and later TV series) M*A*S*H. [ Live-action shows ] Filmation incorporated live-action into some of its animated series. Shows like The Hardy Boys and Archie&apos;s Funhouse featured live-action footage of an audience watching the bands perform and Fat Albert had segments featuring series creator Bill Cosby. The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam!, was more of a hybrid - a live-action variety show with animated segments. Actors appeared as characters from the Hero High portion of the show, singing songs and telling jokes. Filmation made six fully live-action shows, including Space Academy, its spin-off Jason of Star Command, Ark II, Shazam! (based on the DC Comics character Captain Marvel ), The Ghost Busters, and The Secrets of Isis. The 2006 DVD release of the animated series Space Sentinels includes pre-production footage for an aborted live-action version entitled The Young Sentinels. [ The Ghost Busters ] Filmation produced a live-action series called The Ghost Busters in 1975 starring Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker (late of F-Troop ) and noted science-fiction fan and collector Bob Burns as &quot; Tracy the Gorilla &quot;. The characters worked as paranormal investigators, working for an unseen &quot; Chief &quot; who delivered their &quot; Ghost Busting assignments &quot; in whimsical disguised recording devices as in Mission: Impossible. Nine years later, Columbia Pictures, who produced an unrelated 1984 movie of almost the same name, had to get the rights to the title from the company. Filmation capitalized on the popularity of the film by producing a new cartoon based on their earlier series. Like its other shows, it used stock footage heavily; in one episode, character designs and animation sequences were recycled from the Groovie Goolies series of nearly 15 years earlier. To avoid confusion, the animated version of the film was called The Real Ghostbusters. As a dig on the Filmation series, an episode was written about a group of fraudulent ghost fighters, trying to steal the &quot; Real &quot; Ghostbusters&apos; business and thunder. [ Looney Tunes/Groovie Goolies crossover ] Also of note is Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies, a special featuring several of Warner Bros. &apos; Looney Tunes stars (paired with Filmation&apos;s own Groovie Goolies, a group of classic monsters). Written by Len Janson and Chuck Menville (who played themselves in a live-action sequence), this aired on The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie in 1972. While most of the Warner Brothers characters were drawn well (veteran Warners animator Virgil Ross was working there at the time), and voiced by veteran voice actor Mel Blanc, the special is not liked by many fans of classic Warner Bros. animation because of its limited animation, as well as a weak storyline. This was not Filmation&apos;s last dalliance with classic cartoon characters; in the late 1970s the company produced new series based on the characters from the Terrytoons archive ( Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle ) and a new Tom and Jerry series as well. [ Feature films ] Filmation also ventured into the feature film business. In fact, one of Filmation&apos;s first projects was Journey Back to Oz, an animated sequel to the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Begun in 1964, the project was held back for eight years when Filmation did not have enough money to finish the film. It was only after its successes with other series that the company was profitable enough to complete &quot; Journey &quot; for theatrical release in 1972. In its final years, Filmation produced feature film versions of its He-Man and She-Ra franchises, as well as unofficial cult animated sequels to other established films, such as Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night and Happily Ever After. [ Pinocchio Legend Grows New Animated Film Isn&apos;t A Sequel But A Continuation Morning Call http://articles.mcall.com/1987-12-26/features/2596981_1_lou-scheimer-carlo-collodi-geppetto 2010-12-12 ] [ Voice talent ] Like other animation studios, Filmation had its stock company of voice-over actors. Some of the most famous included Larry Storch, Dallas McKennon (best known as the voice of Archie in the Archie cartoon and as Cincinnatus, in the Daniel Boone TV series), Adam West and Burt Ward (who recreated their roles as &quot; Batman and Robin &quot; from their 1960s live-action series for Filmation&apos;s 1977 animated incarnation), Jane Webb, and good friends and colleagues Ed Asner and Linda Gary (Gary voiced a majority of Filmation&apos;s work in the 1980s), along with John Erwin (voice of Reggie Mantle, and later the voice of He-Man ), Alan Oppenheimer (character actor in TV and film), Ted Knight, George DiCenzo (John BlackStar, Hordak, Bow on She-ra ), Melendy Britt, Howard Morris, Pat Fraley, Charlie Adler, Ed Gilbert, Susan Blu, Erika Scheimer (daughter of Lou Scheimer ), and even Lou Scheimer himself (either uncredited, or under the pseudonym of &quot; Erik (sometimes &quot; Eric &quot; ) Gunden &quot; ). [ Background musical talent ] For the company&apos;s 1960s superhero efforts composer John Gart (under the stage name John Marion) and music supervisor Gordon Zahler created strong themes and backing cues using a large orchestra until 1968&apos;s Batman entry, which used sparser production and jazzier themes. According to the book lets accompanying some of the DVDs of Filmation&apos;s shows, legendary composer Ray Ellis (who was assisted by his son Marc Ellis ) had produced the background music for most Filmation series under the pseudonyms &quot; Yvette Blais and Jeff Michael. &quot; { Mangels, Andy, DVD booklets for Space Sentinels/The Freedom Force, Hero High, The Ghost Busters, Space Academy, Jason of Star Command, and The Secrets of Isis } Yvette Blais was Ellis&apos; wife, while &quot; Jeff &quot; and &quot; Michael &quot; were the names of producer Norm Prescott&apos;s two sons. (Exactly what hand Prescott took in the music, other than hiring the composers and musicians, is not clear.) The full length features Treasure Island and Oliver Twist credit &quot; George Blais &quot;. Ellis&apos; name does appear in Archie and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch credits, and both &quot; Ray Ellis &quot;, and &quot; Jeff Michaels &quot; appear side by side on Groovie Goolies credits, where &quot; Ellis &quot; is credited for &quot; Sabrina background Music &quot;, and &quot; Michaels &quot; is credited for &quot; Groovie Goolies background music &quot;. Much of Ellis&apos; background music in the early &apos;70s had a distinct, richly orchestrated sound not found on many other made-for-TV cartoon series of that period; though as time went on, it became more synthesized. Ellis&apos; work at the studio lasted from 1968 to 1982. Haim Saban and Shuki Levy composed and produced the studio&apos;s music for He-Man and She-Ra (during 1983-1986), along with the other studios for which they produced music scores. Frank W. Becker provided the music for Filmation&apos;s final animated series, Bravestarr. Filmation routinely included a plug for its music publisher, Shermley Music, in the closing credits of most of its shows. This has never been common practice on American TV. { Group W &apos;s distinctive font style, to reflect its ownership by that company. } [ Ownership ] The Filmation studio was owned by The TelePrompTer Company in the early 1970s, then by Westinghouse (through its Group W Productions division, following its purchase of TelePrompTer&apos;s cable and entertainment properties) in 1982. In 1988 Filmation was purchased by the L&apos;Oréal cosmetics company. L&apos;Oréal promptly closed the studio on February 3, 1989 and ended Filmation&apos;s legacy. As a result, most of the staff was terminated on that same day. This happened a day before a new law went into practice requiring companies to give employees 60 days notice before a mass termination, which is presumably why L&apos;Oréal acted so quickly. [ June 2009 ] Filmation&apos;s last production was the feature film Happily Ever After (a sequel to the story of Snow White ), released to theaters in 1993. Also, at the time of the closing, two new animated TV shows, Bugzburg and Bravo (a spinoff of Bravestarr), were beginning production. Since then, most of the Filmation back catalog had come under the ownership of Hallmark Cards, through its Hallmark Entertainment subsidiary; however, since a large amount of Filmation&apos;s output was based on characters licensed from other companies, many titles which are also under the ownership of Entertainment Rights are actually under the control of other studios (such as CBS and Warner Bros. ). In March 2004, ownership of the Filmation back catalog which was under the ownership of Hallmark was sold to a British company called Entertainment Rights. Entertainment Rights has since made the revelation that when Hallmark converted all of its Filmation shows to digital format in the 1990s, only PAL-format copies were made, with the original film prints apparently discarded.

As a result, many of Entertainment Rights&apos; DVD releases (distributed by BCI Eclipse in the United States) are based on the international versions (which have PAL prints). Because they were taken from PAL-based transfers, without correction, these releases exhibit the so-called &quot; 576i speedup &quot; effect in which the soundtrack plays 4% too fast resulting in the pitch being a half-step higher than it was originally (see PAL and Telecine for more information). PAL-NTSC conversion artefacts also include softness and ghosting. The exception appears to be at least four titles from ER&apos;s library: Groovie Goolies, Ark II, and both the live-action and animated Ghostbusters series. These series appear to have been sourced from original NTSC transfers for their U.S. release by BCI. Another exception, Star Trek: The Animated Series which was owned by Paramount Television, now CBS Television Distribution, is also in the NTSC format.

[ Genius Products/The Weinstein Company ] The Archie Show - The Complete Series - July 31, 2007 Archie&apos;s Funhouse - The Complete Series - March 4, 2008 Sabrina, the Teenage Witch - The Complete Animated Series - April 29, 2008 TVShowsonDVD.com reported, citing &quot; reliable sources &quot; that Genius Products acquired Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids from ER for a planned DVD release for sometime in 2008. { http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Fat-Albert-Cosby-Kids-DVDs-Planned/8879 } The first release announced is a DVD of the Halloween special which will be released on August 26, 2008, and will contain 2 bonus episodes. { http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Fat-Albert-Cosby-Kids-Halloween-Special/9601 } Plans for a release of the regular series have yet to be announced. [ Fox ] 20th Century Fox presumably owns the rights to the Journey to the Center of the Earth and Fantastic Voyage TV series. Fantastic Voyage was released in PAL format on a 3 dvd set in the United Kingdom on November 21, 2011 through Revelation Films. However, there are currently no plans to release Journey to the Center of the Earth on DVD at this time. [ Other ] The rights status to The Hardy Boys (although it is presumable, but not confirmed, that these lie with CBS due to CBS owning Simon &amp; Schuster, the current owners of the Hardy Boys copyright and book series on which this show was based), Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down, and Sport Billy are unknown at this time, nor is it known whether or not they survive in any form. These three series do not appear in the Entertainment Rights library, nor do the Superstretch and Microwoman, Manta and Moray, and Web Woman segments from Tarzan and the Super 7. According to science fiction writer and animation historian Andy Mangels, who hosts commentary for many Filmation releases, the three Super 7 segments in question were pulled from distribution due to &quot; various lawsuits &quot; from Marvel Comics and DC Comics. It also is unknown whether or not the three segments still survive in any form. The rights to Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle presumably rest with the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the original author of the Tarzan novels. However, Warner Bros. has recently announced a Saturday Morning Cartoons Collection DVD release which will contain an episode of The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, evidence that WB controls at least some rights to the Filmation Tarzan series. (In the past, WB has also held international TV distribution rights to Tarzan.)
