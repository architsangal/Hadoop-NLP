There, they find the &quot; Naturan Demonta &quot;, a Sumerian variation of the Book of the Dead. They also find a tape recorder that plays demonic incantations from the book, unleashing evil demon s. The demons proceed to isolate and kill off the students, beginning with Cheryl, who is hypnotized by the voice of a demon and lured out into the woods at night. Alone and far from the safety of the cabin, Cheryl is attacked by trees possessed by the demons, which come to life in a tentacle-like fashion and brutally rape her. Escaping the trees, Cheryl flees back to the cabin and is nearly overtaken by a demon. The others do not believe Cheryl&apos;s story and assume that she was attacked by a wild animal. Her brother, Ash, decides to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to civilization has been destroyed with the supports bent into the shape of a hand. Later, Cheryl, with the essence of a demon infesting her body following her encounter with the trees, becomes possessed and stabs Linda, Ash&apos;s girlfriend, in the ankle with a pencil. Scotty forces Cheryl into the cellar and locks it, but his girlfriend Shelly is also possessed by a demon, which spies on her from outside her bedroom as she is changing before hurling itself at her. Now possessed, Shelly attacks Scotty and sustains a number of brutal injuries before Scotty dismembers her with an axe. Clearly shaken by Shelly&apos;s death, Scotty leaves to go find an alternate trail through the woods. Ash goes to check on Linda, but finds that she, too, has become possessed, but she makes no attempt to attack him. Scotty returns, having suffered grave injuries inflicted onto him by the possessed trees. He tells Ash that there is an alternate trail through the woods before passing out, and Linda and Cheryl start laughing maniacally at their predicament. The two women suddenly seem to snap out of their possession, but it is revealed to be a trick when Ash almost releases Cheryl from the cellar and she tries to strangle him through the door. Ash locks Linda outside of the cabin and tends to Scotty&apos;s injuries, but he quickly bleeds to death. Linda sneaks in through the backdoor and attacks Ash with a ceremonial dagger, but Ash is able to take the dagger from her and impale her through her torso, seemingly killing her. Ash takes Linda&apos;s body to the work shed and tries to dismember her with a chainsaw, but finds that he cannot bring himself to do it and buries her instead. She rises from the grave and wrestles with Ash, who eventually lops her head off with a shovel. Returning to the cabin, Ash finds that Cheryl has escaped. Armed with a shotgun, Ash finds Cheryl hiding outside and shoots her in the shoulder, but it doesn&apos;t seem to have any effect. After barricading all of the doors, Ash descends into the cellar to find some extra shotgun shells, and while down there he experiences a series of strange events such as mysterious voices and blood seeping from numerous crevices and openings in the walls. Scotty&apos;s body reanimates, now possessed by a demon, and tries to kill Ash, but he cripples him by gouging out his eyes. Ash then notices that the Book of the Dead has fallen near the fireplace and is starting to burn, as are Cheryl and Scotty, giving the illusion that disposal of the book into the fire will destroy the demons. Cheryl breaks into the cabin and knocks Ash down with little effort. While Scotty pins him down, Cheryl repeatedly beats Ash with a fireplace poker. Ash is able to grab the book after several attempts and tosses it into the fireplace just as Cheryl raises the poker to impale him. The demons leave the bodies of Cheryl and Scotty, which become inanimate and rapidly decay and fall apart. Ash, believing he has survived the ordeal, heads outside. In the final scene, a demon emerges from the woods and descends upon Ash, who turns around and lets out a bloodcurdling scream. [ Cast ] Bruce Campbell as Ashley &quot; Ash &quot; Williams : Ash is the last survivor of the group and the main protagonist of the film. Ash is a young man who only wanted to take his friends on a trip into the woods, unaware of what to expect. Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl Williams: Ash&apos;s younger sister and the odd woman out of the group. She is the first to suspect the danger surrounding the cabin and the first to be possessed. Her deadite serves as the main antagonist of the film. Betsy Baker as Linda: Linda is Ash&apos;s girlfriend, with whom he is very much in love. She keeps a necklace that Ash gave to her early in the film. Richard DeManicor as Scotty: Ash&apos;s college roommate. In the first half of the film, Scott is more of a joker and does not take anything seriously, but after Shelly&apos;s death, he starts to comprehend the evil that the group is up against. Theresa Tilly as Shelly: Scotty&apos;s girlfriend and the least developed member of the group. She does not understand what&apos;s going on around the cabin and is not alive long enough to figure it out. Bob Dorian as the voice on the recorder (uncredited) Actors Richard DeManincor (Scott) and Theresa Tilly (Shelly) both went under different &quot; stage names &quot; during the shoot, since they were members of the Screen Actors Guild and wanted to avoid being penalized for participating in a non-union production. They are credited in the credits as &quot; Hal Delrich &quot; for DeManincor and &quot; Sarah York &quot; for Tilly. According to Bruce Campbell &apos;s autobiography, If Chins Could Kill, Richard acquired his stage name by combining his short name with his roommates&apos; names, Hal and Del. [ Production ] The short film Within the Woods (1978) was made as a prototype to help convince possible investors to fund The Evil Dead. In it, the filmmakers experimented with techniques they would use in the feature. It shares plot elements with The Evil Dead and also stars Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss, although with Sandweiss as the main character.

In Germany, the movie&apos;s release was hindered by public authorities for almost 10 years. Original 1982 cinema and video releases of the movie had been seized, making the movie successful on the black market video circuit with pirated copies abounding. Several well-known horror enthusiasts publicly criticized the German ban on the movie, including author Stephen King (who gave it a rave review in the November 1982 issue of Twilight Zone ). A heavily edited version was made available legally during 1992. In 2001, an uncut German DVD version was released, but the Berlin-Tiergarten Court ordered seizure of the DVD in April 2002 (Case Number 351 Gs 1749/02). In Finland, The Evil Dead was later released uncut on DVD by Future Film, and rated K-18. In the United Kingdom, the film was one of the first to be labeled a video nasty during the mid-1980s controversy over such movies and was finally released uncut in 2001. When the film was re-submitted in the US for a rating in 1994, the MPAA classified it with an NC-17 rating.
