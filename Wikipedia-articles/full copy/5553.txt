Political map of Costa Rica. Shaded relief map of Costa Rica. Map of Costa Rica. Topography of Costa Rica Costa Rica is located on the Central American Isthmus, surrounding the point 10° north of the equator and 84° west of the prime meridian. It borders both the Caribbean Sea (to the east) and the North Pacific Ocean (to the west), with a total of 1,228  km of coastline (212  km on the Caribbean coast and 1,016  km on the Pacific). Costa Rica shares a border with Nicaragua to the north (309  km long border) and with Panama to the south (330  km long border). The area of Costa Rica is 51,100  km² of which 50,660  km² is land and 440  km² is water, making it slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia. The spine of the country produces many major river systems. Rivers draining into the Caribbean include: Colorado River (Rio Colorado) Pacuare River (Rio Pacuare) Reventazón River (Rio Parismina) Reventazón River (Rio Reventazon) Sixaola River (Rio Sixaola) Rivers draining into the Lake Nicaragua or the San Juan River (Rio San Juan), whose waters eventually drains into the Caribbean, include: Sapoá River (Rio Sapoá) Frío River (Rio Frío) San Carlos River (Rio San Carlos) Sarapiquí River (Rio Sarapiquí) Rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean include: Abangares River (Rio Abangares) Guacimal River (Rio Guacimal) Sierpe River (Rio Sierpe) Tempisque River (Rio Tempisque) Térraba River (Rio Terraba) In the eastern half of the country, the San Juan River forms the northern border with Nicaragua. [ Mountain ranges ] [ Cordillera de Tilarán ] The Tilaran Range is part of the Continental Divide east of Lake Arenal and the nearby active volcano Arenal, and running into the Cordillera Central range further east. It is located in the Abangares district of the province of Guanacaste. At the edge of the range is the Monteverde cloud forest preserve, a major ecotourism destination. [ Cordillera Central ] The Central Range continues the Continental Divide east of Cordillera de Tilarán. It has four large volcanoes: Poás, Barva, Irazú and Turrialba. The highest peak is Irazú at 3,432 m. [ Cordillera de Guanacaste ] The Guanacaste Range is in northern Costa Rica near the border with Nicaragua. The range forms part of the southern region of the Continental Divide, the highest peak being the extinct stratovolcano Miravalles at 2,028 m. Peaks include: Miravalles Volcano (2,028 m) Orosí Volcano (1,659 m) Rincón de la Vieja Volcano (1,916 m) [ Cordillera de Talamanca ] Much of the Talamanca Range is included in the La Amistad International Park, which is shared between Costa Rica and Panama. The country&apos;s highest peaks lie in this mountain range: the Cerro Chirripó and the Cerro Kamuk. Much of the region is covered by the forest. [ Cerros de Escazú ] The Cerros de Escazú borders the Central Valley to the south and is considered the northernmost portion of the Cordillera de Talamanca. [ Volcanoes ] Four volcanoes (two of them active) rise near San Jose, in the center of the country; one of the volcanoes, Irazu Volcano, erupted destructively in 1963–1965. [ Climate ] [ Climate of Costa Rica ] The country has a tropical and subtropical climate and is part of the Neotropic ecozone. It is part of many ecoregion s, including Costa Rican seasonal moist forests, Bocas del Toro-San Bastimentos Island-San Blas mangroves, Mosquitia-Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast mangroves, Southern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves, Central American dry forests, and Talamancan montane forests. An inlet from the Pacific the Gulf of Nicoya contains several small islands, the largest of these being Chira Island with a population of around four thousand. Costa Rica&apos;s dry season in most places is from December to April, while the rainy season is from May to November. On the Caribbean coast, however, December is by far the wettest month. The highlands areas are always cooler. The lowest elevation levels in the country are on the western and eastern coasts, at sea level. The highest point is Cerro Chirripó, a volcanic mountain with an elevation of [ 3810 m ft 0 on ] (part of Chirripó National Park ). On a clear day, it is possible to see both the Caribbean and the Pacific from the peak. [ Ecology ] Like all Central American countries, Costa Rica is considered part of a biodiversity hotspot. According to the INBio, about 4.5% of the world&apos;s biodiversity can be found in Costa Rica. { Rainforest in Costa Rica } Costa Rica is home to about 12,119 species of plant s, of which 950 are endemic. { Costa Rica Forest Information and Data. rainforests.mongabay.com } There are 117 native trees and more than 1,400 types of orchid s, a third of them can be found in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. { Monteverde Costa Rica Orchids Garden Photo Gallery. Monteverdeinfo.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-28. } Almost a half of the country&apos;s land is covered by forests, though only 3.5% is covered by primary forests. Deforestation is a devastating process, with more than 8,100 ha of forest being lost annually. The main reason for such high deforestation levels is to make plains for cattle ranching. Wildlife diversity is very high; there are 441 species of amphibian s and reptile s, 838 species of bird s, 232 species of mammals and 181 species of fresh water fish. Costa Rica has high levels of endemism; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are endangered. According to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered. { Home. Unep-Wcmc. Retrieved on 2012-01-28. } Some of the country&apos;s most endangered species are the Harpy eagle, the Giant anteater, the Golden toad and the Jaguar. IUCN reports the Golden toad as extinct. [ 3172 Incilius periglenes ] { IUCN Red List &apos;s article about the } { Golden toad } [ Protected areas ] [ National Parks of Costa Rica List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica ] The country is noted for its national park system, administered by SINAC (Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion, or &quot; National System of Conservation Areas &quot; ). This agency oversees the 26 national park, and more than 160 protected areas in Costa Rica. The other types of protected areas in Costa Rica are National Wildlife Refuges, Biological Reserves, Protection Zones, and Absolute Nature Reserves. Together the protected areas comprise over one-fourth of Costa Rican territory. 9.3% of the country is protected under IUCN categories I-V. [ Tortuguero National Park ] The creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1970 gave much needed protection to one of the region&apos;s most important and unique natural resources: a 22  km stretch of shoreline that serves as the principal nesting site for sea turtles. [ International law ] Costa Rica is party to many environmental treaties, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Environmental Modification, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Montreal Protocol, the Ramsar Convention, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, the Desertification Convention, the Endangered Species Convention, the Basel Convention, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Convention on Marine Dumping, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It has signed but not ratified the Convention on Marine Life Conservation and the Kyoto Protocol. Central America gained independence from Spain on September 15, 1820.
