It is a cosmopolitan district known as the location for the annual Notting Hill Carnival, and for being home to the Portobello Road Market. [ Portobello Road London Online http://www.londononline.co.uk/articles/Portobello_Road/ 18 February 2010 ] Notting Hill has a contemporary reputation as an affluent and fashionable area; [ West London London Hotels.com http://www.londonhotels.com/london/areas/west-london/ 18 February 2010 ] known for attractive terrace s of large Victorian townhouses, and high-end shopping and restaurants (particularly around Westbourne Grove and Clarendon Cross).

However, the large houses have also provided multi-occupancy rentals for much of the 20th century. Caribbean immigrants were drawn to the area in the 1950s, partly because of the dubious practices followed by the landlord Peter Rachman, and became the target of white Teddy Boy s in the 1958 Notting Hill race riots. Notting Hill has had an association with artists and &quot; alternative &quot; culture since its development in the 1820s.

[ -ing http://www.glaucus.org.uk/-ing.htm 17 February 2009 ] [ Potteries and Piggeries ] { Pottery Lane. } [ Pottery Lane ] The area in the west around Pottery Lane was used in the early nineteenth century for making bricks and tiles out of the heavy clay dug in the area. The clay was shaped and fired in a series of brick and tile kilns. { http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/yourlondon/london_history/pottery_lane.shtml } The only remaining nineteenth-century tile kiln in London is on Walmer Road. { Notting Hill } In the same area, pig farmers moved in after being forced out of the Marble Arch area. Avondale Park was created in 1892 out of a former area of pig slurry called &apos;the Ocean&apos;. This was part of a general clean-up of the area which had become known as the Potteries and Piggeries. [ 19th century development ] [ Ladbroke Estate ] The area remained rural until the westward expansion of London reached Bayswater in the early 19th century. The main landowner in Notting Hill was the Ladbroke family, and from the 1820s James Weller Ladbroke began to undertake the development of the Ladbroke Estate. Working with the architect and surveyor Thomas Allason, Ladbroke began to lay out streets and houses, with a view to turning the area into a fashionable suburb of the capital (although the development did not get seriously under way until the 1840s). Many of these streets bear the Ladbroke name, including Ladbroke Grove, the main north-south axis of the area, and Ladbroke Square, the largest private garden square in London. The original idea was to call the district Kensington Park, and other roads (notably Kensington Park Road and Kensington Park Gardens ) are reminders of this. The local telephone prefix 7727 (originally 727) is based on the old telephone exchange name of PARk. { London Director system exchange names } { Portobello Road } { Ladbroke Estate, consisting of a large central circus with radiating streets and garden squares, or &quot; paddocks &quot;. } Ladbroke left the actual business of developing his land to the firm of City solicitors, Smith, Bayley (known as Bayley and Janson after 1836), who worked with Allason to develop the property. In 1823 Allason completed a plan for the layout of the main portion of the estate. This marks the genesis of his most enduring idea – the creation of large private communal gardens, originally known as &quot; pleasure grounds &quot;, or &quot; paddocks &quot;, enclosed by terraces and/or crescents of houses. Instead of houses being set around a garden square, separated from it by a road, Allason&apos;s houses would have direct access to a secluded communal garden in the rear, to which people on the street did not have access and generally could not see. To this day these communal garden squares continue to provide the area with much of its attraction for the wealthiest householders. { http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49874 page at British History Online } { Hippodrome in the upper left hand corner. } In 1837 the Hippodrome racecourse was laid out. [ http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/destinations/england/article727749.ece The Times London Notting Hill on foot Sara McConnell 6 February 2006 20 May 2010 ] The racecourse ran around the hill, and bystanders were expected to watch from the summit of the hill. However, the venture was not a success, in part due to a public right of way which traversed the course, and in part due to the heavy clay of the neighbourhood which caused it to become waterlogged. The Hippodrome closed in 1841, after which development resumed and houses were built on the site. The crescent-shaped roads that circumvent the hill, such as Blenheim Crescent, Elgin Crescent, Stanley Crescent, Cornwall Crescent, and Landsdowne Crescent, were built over the circular racecourse tracks. At the summit of hill stands the elegant St John&apos;s church, built in 1845 in the early English style, and which formed the centrepiece of the Ladbroke Estate development. The Notting Hill houses were large, but they did not immediately succeed in enticing the very richest Londoners, who tended to live closer to the centre of London in Mayfair or Belgravia. The houses appealed to the upper middle class, who could live there in Belgravia style at lower prices. In the opening chapter of John Galsworthy &apos;s Forsyte Saga novels, he housed the Nicholas Forsytes &quot; in Ladbroke Grove, a spacious abode and a great bargain &quot;. { John Galsworthy The Man of Property, Chapter 1, published 1906 } In 1862 Thomas Hardy left Dorchester for London to work with architect Arthur Blomfield; during this period he lived in Westbourne Park Villas. He immersed himself in the city&apos;s literary and cultural life, studying art, visiting the National Gallery, attending the theatre, and writing prose and poetry. His first published story &quot; How I Built Myself A House &quot; appeared in Chamber&apos;s Journal in 1865. Here he wrote his first―but never published―novel The Poor Man and the Lady in 1867, and the poem &quot; A Young Man&apos;s Exhortation, &quot; from which Graham Greene took an epigraph for his own novel, The Comedians. Arthur Machen (1863–1947), the author of many supernatural and fantastic fictions, lived at 23 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill Gate, in the 1880s; he writes of his life here in his memoirs, Far Off Things (1922) and Things Near and Far (1923). His mystical work The Hill of Dreams (1907; though written ten years earlier) has scenes set in Notting Hill; it is here that the protagonist Lucian Taylor encounters the beautiful bronze-haired prostitute who will later connive at his death. [ Early to mid-20th century ] { Pinehurst Court, showing } { All Saints &apos; church in the background } The reputation of the district altered over the course of the 20th century. As middle class households ceased to employ servants, the large Notting Hill houses lost their market and were increasingly split into multiple occupation. During the Blitz a number of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the Luftwaffe, including All Saints&apos; church, which was hit in 1940 and again in 1944. In the postwar period the name Notting Hill evoked a down-at-heel area of cheap lodgings, epitomised by the racketeering landlord Peter Rachman and the murders committed by John Christie in 10 Rillington Place, since demolished. The area to the north east, Golborne, was particularly known for being, in the words of Charles Booth, &quot; one of the worst areas in London &quot;. [ One thousand years of Goldborne Golborne Life http://www.golbornelife.co.uk/golbornehistory.html 17 February 2009 ] Southam Street had 2,400 people living in 140 nine-roomed houses in 1923, and the slum children from this street were documented in the 1950s photographs of Roger Mayne. In late August and early September 1958, the Notting Hill race riots occurred. The series of disturbances are thought to have started on 20 August when a gang of white youths attacked a Swedish woman, Majbritt Morrison, who was married to a West Indian man. { BBC News : Long history of race rioting, } { British Broadcasting Corporation, 28 May 2001. } Later that night a mob of 300 to 400 white people, including many &quot; Teddy Boy s &quot;, were seen on Bramley Road attacking the houses of West Indian residents. The disturbances, racially-motivated rioting and attacks continued every night until they petered out by 5 September. The dire housing conditions in Notting Hill led Bruce Kenrick to found the Notting Hill Housing Trust in 1963, helping to drive through new housing legislation in the 1960s and found the national housing organisation Shelter in 1966. { http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/news.aspx?id_Content=731 } Nos 1-9 Colville Gardens, now known as Pinehurst Court, had become so run down by 1969 that its owner, Robert Gubay of Cledro Developments, described conditions in the buildings as &quot; truly terrible &quot;. { Jan O&apos;Malley The Politics of Community Action in Notting Hill, Spokesman Press, 1977 } The slums were cleared during redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s when the Westway Flyover and Trellick Tower were built.

[ Geography ] The hill from which Notting Hill takes its name is still clearly visible, with its summit in the middle of Ladbroke Grove, at the junction with Kensington Park Gardens. Notting Hill has no official boundaries, so definitions of which areas fall under Notting Hill vary. The postcode &quot; W11 &quot;, centred on the Post Office in Westbourne Grove, near the junction with Denbigh Road, is the one most closely associated with Notting Hill, although the postcode immediately to the north, &quot; W10 &quot;, covers that part of North Kensington which would fall within a broader definition. The local historian Florence Gladstone, in her much reprinted work &quot; Notting Hill in Bygone Days &quot; defines Notting Hill as the whole of that part of Kensington which is north of the road known as Notting Hill Gate.
