[ the sex manual the radio show The Perfumed Garden (radio show) ] The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight ( [ الروض العاطر في نزهة الخاطر ] al-raw d al-&apos;â t ir fî nuzhat al-khâ t ir) by Mu h ammad ibn Mu h ammad al-Nafzawi is a fifteenth-century Arabic sex manual and work of erotic literature. The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive, gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about sexual health, and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the penis and vagina, has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement. thumb [ History ] [ May 2009 ] According to the introduction of Colville&apos;s English translation, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote The Perfumed Garden sometime between 1410 and 1434. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi, { أبو عبدالله محمد ابن عمر النفزاوي } was born among the Berber Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day Tunisia. Circa 1420 he compiled at the request of the Hafsid ruler of Tunis, Abû Fâris `Abd al-`Azîz al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the Arabian Nights. [ Translations ] [ 1976: Khawam French translation ] A new French translation by René R. Khawam was published in 1976. [ 1886: Burton English translation ] The book first became widely known in the English speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir Richard Francis Burton. The Arabic manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isadore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript&apos;s last chapter, twenty one, was incomplete, apparently because it concerned homosexuality and pederasty. When Burton died towards the end of 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including the excised chapter. This translation, due to be called &quot; The Scented Garden &quot; was never published as Burton&apos;s wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death. Burton mentions that he considers that The Perfumed Garden can be compared with the works of Aretin and Rabelais, and the French book Conjugal Love by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes The Perfumed Garden unique as a book of its kind is &quot; the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented. &quot; Burton points out that not all of the ideas in The Perfumed Garden are original: &quot; For instance, all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book Birds and Flowers by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams. &quot; [ 1999: Colville English translation ] In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English The Perfumed Garden translated directly from the Arabic original. Of the Burton translation, he says, &quot; details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources. The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation. The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original &quot;. Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled &quot; Sexual Technique &quot; in Colville&apos;s translation and &quot; Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition &quot; in Burton&apos;s. Burton&apos;s translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these. Colville&apos;s translation is 2½ pages long, and lists eleven unnamed sex positions.
