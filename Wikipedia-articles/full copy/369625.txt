[ 1924 4 11 ] { University of Southern California } { Social } { Professional, Engineering } { International } { Toms River } { New Jersey } { USA } { 15 active chapters } { http://www.sigmaphidelta.org } { Factoid } { Social Fraternity of Engineers } ΣΦΔ (Sigma Phi Delta) is an international social fraternity of engineers. Billing itself as &quot; The Premier International Fraternity of Engineers &quot;, the organization is the only fraternity of its kind that draws its membership exclusively from male engineering students at ABET -accredited colleges and universities, as other similar organizations are co-ed or admit students not strictly in traditional engineering programs (such as architecture or technical sciences). Sigma Phi Delta enjoys a close working relationship with its female counterpart, ΑΩΕ - Alpha Omega Epsilon. [ Object of the Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity ] The Object of the Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity shall be to promote the advancement of the Engineering Profession; to foster the advancement of Engineering Education; to instill a greater spirit of cooperation among Engineering students and organizations; to inculcate in its members the highest ideals of Virtuous manhood, good Citizenship, obedience to Law, and Brotherhood; and to encourage excellence in Scholarship. [ Code of Ethics of the Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity ] The Code of Ethics of Sigma Phi Delta is founded upon the basic principles of truth and honesty. The quotation, &quot; Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, &quot; should be the light guiding the footsteps of an Engineer towards service and success. An Engineer should at all times be mentally, physically and morally clean, and should conduct himself as a gentleman. He should be courageous in following his own convictions, mentally awake to make use of every opportunity, and should consider the welfare of others before his own. To his superiors, an Engineer should be dutiful; to his co-workers, helpful; to his subordinates, generous; to all men, brotherly. An Engineer should take a good grip on the joys of life. He should play the game like a man. He should fight against nothing so hard as his own weaknesses, and should endeavor to gain in strength. He should live so that his actions shall never besmirch his own honor, and thus maintain the honor of the Engineering Profession. [ History ] Sigma Phi Delta was founded at University of Southern California on April 11, 1924 and currently has 15 active chapters. [ Alpha Chapter - University of Southern California ] Alpha Chapter was founded on April 11, 1924 in the third attempt to establish an engineering fraternity at the University, the other two having terminated into general fraternities. Members of Alpha Chapter are traditionally active in the student government of USC&apos;s Viterbi School of Engineering and participate in a wide variety of engineering-related activities. Unlike many fraternities at USC, the Alpha Chapter owns its house. As the founding chapter, Alpha has deep rooted traditions and a rich history. [ Delta Chapter - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ] { Delta Chapter was founded on January 25, 1928 by a group of students that included a brother of an Alpha Chapter Founder and an Alpha Chapter Alumnus in graduate school. Delta Chapter has traditionally provided leadership for the fraternity, witnessed by the fact that it has produced 5 Grand Presidents who have guided the fraternity 46 of its 80+ years of existence.

Though Omega is much younger than other active chapters, it is proudly very active in all of its ordeals and well known among the National Fraternity for its unique character and involvement.
