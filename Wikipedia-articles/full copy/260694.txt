[ Rail ] A single-track railway spur between Plymouth and Sheboygan runs through the city. The track was originally built for use as an interurban line, but saw use primarily as a freight line served by the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, and later, Union Pacific. In 2006, citing low demand and degraded infrastructure, Union Pacific announced plans to abandon the line west of the Kohler Company factory in Kohler, thus terminating all service to Sheboygan Falls. In May 2009, the State of Wisconsin Department of Transportation finalized the purchase of the Plymouth-Sheboygan Falls portion of the line from Union Pacific, with the intent of repairing the long dormant line to allow the Wisconsin &amp; Southern Railroad to provide restored service to Sheboygan Falls. { &quot; State: Rail line connecting Falls, Plymouth to go back in service &quot;, Sheboygan Press, May 23, 2009. } The track through downtown Sheboygan Falls has been of interest to railfan s because of a number of interesting features, including an iron trestle over the Sheboygan River, a small section of street running where the line runs at grade along city streets, and antiquated &quot; wig-wag &quot; signals at several crossings. Many of these features have been threatened because of the Union Pacific&apos;s abandonment of the line; the trestle has been barricaded and parts of the tracks leading to it have been removed, { Family Wants Barricades on Railroad Trestle, WTMJ-4 TV (Milwaukee), May 21, 2009 } and plans to restore the line for the resumption of service may require the replacement of the wig-wag signals, which do not conform to current safety requirements.
