[ County History http://www.nd.gov/content.htm?parentCatID%3D83%26amp%3Bid%3DCounty%20History Official Portal for North Dakota State Government 4 May 2011 ] [ Geography ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of [ 2082 sqmi 1 ], of which [ 2010 sqmi 1 ] is land and [ 73 sqmi 1 ] (3.49%) is water. Dunn County is somewhat unique among western North Dakota counties. Like other counties in the region, it has both prairie and badlands areas. Located in the northwest part of the county are the Killdeer Mountains, which are more accurately described as hills. These hills help create a mini-ecosystem on the southern edge of the Little Missouri badlands, which has a greater abundance of aspen forests and wildlife than is typically found in southwestern North Dakota. The northwest corner of the county, northwest of the Killdeer Mountains, features many square miles of bur oak forest, mainly on the north-facing slopes of the hills. Bur oak and quaking aspen, though native to North Dakota, are sparse in western North Dakota, with Dunn County being a notable exception.
