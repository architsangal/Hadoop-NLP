Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late 20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the late 1990s while working on The Simpsons, later bringing Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox. In the United States, the series aired on Fox from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 before ceasing production. Futurama was then aired in rerun s on Cartoon Network &apos;s Adult Swim from 2003 to 2007, until the network&apos;s contract expired. It was revived in 2007 as four direct-to-video films; the last of the four was released in early 2009. Comedy Central entered into an agreement with 20th Century Fox Television to syndicate the existing episodes and air the films as 16 new, half-hour episodes.

[ Production ] [ Development ] Fox expressed a strong desire in the mid-1990s for Matt Groening to create a new series, and he began conceiving Futurama during this period. In 1996, he enlisted David X. Cohen, then a writer and producer for The Simpsons, to assist in developing the show. The two spent time researching science fiction books, television shows, and films. When they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and story lines; Groening claimed they had gone &quot; overboard &quot; in their discussions.

Cohen have served as executive producers and show runners during the show&apos;s entire run, and also function as creative consultants. Ken Keeler became an executive producer for Season 4 and subsequent seasons. [ Writing ] The planning for each episode begins with a table meeting of writers, who discuss the plot ideas as a group. A single staff writer writes an outline and then produces a script. Once the first draft of a script is finished, the writers and executive producers call in the actors to do a table read. After this script reading, the writers collaborate to rewrite the script as a group before eventually sending it to the animation team.

Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Doctor Zoidberg, Zapp Brannigan and many other incidental characters.

Due to a casting change, West was called back to audition again and was promptly awarded the role. West claims that the voice of Fry is deliberately modeled on his own, so as to make it difficult for another person to replicate the voice. Doctor Zoidberg&apos;s voice is based on Lou Jacobi and George Jessel. The character of Zapp Brannigan was originally created and intended to be performed by Phil Hartman.

Due to Hartman&apos;s death, West was subsequently given the role. West states that his version of Zapp Brannigan is an imitation of Hartman and also &quot; modeled after a couple of big dumb announcers I knew. &quot; Katey Sagal voices exclusively Leela, and is the only member of the main cast to voice only one character. The role of Leela was originally assigned to Nicole Sullivan. In an interview in June 2010, Sagal remarked that she did not know that another person was to originally voice Leela until many years after the show first began; going on to state that she is still unaware who the original voice actor even is.

Bender was the most difficult character to cast, as the show&apos;s creators had not decided what a robot should sound like.

Recurring guest stars include: Dawnn Lewis, Tom Kenny, Phil Hendrie, Dan Castellaneta, Coolio, Al Gore, and Stephen Hawking, among others. [ Animation ] Computer-generated explosion in &apos;&apos;Futurama&apos;&apos; Rough Draft Studios animates Futurama. The studio receives the completed script of an episode and storyboard s it into over 100 drawings. It then creates a pencil-drawn animatic with 1000 frames. Rough Draft&apos;s sister studio in South Korea renders the 30,000-frame finished episode. In addition to traditional cartoon drawing, Rough Draft Studios often uses CGI for fast or complex shots, such as the movement of spaceships, explosions, nebulae, and snow scenes. The opening sequence is entirely rendered in CGI. The CGI is rendered at 24 frames per second (as opposed to hand-drawn often done at 12 frames per second) and the lack of artifacts makes the animation appear very smooth and fluid. CGI characters look slightly different due to spatially &quot; cheating &quot; hand-drawn characters by drawing slightly out of proportion or off-perspective features to emphasize traits of the face or body, improving legibility of an expression. PowerAnimator is used to draw the comic-like CGI.

The opening sequence was re-rendered and scaled to adapt to the show&apos;s transition to 16:9 widescreen format. For the final episode of Season 6, Futurama is completely reanimated in three different styles: the first segment of the episode features black-and-white Fleischer and Walter Lantz style animation, the second is drawn in the style of a low-resolution video game, and the final segment is in a style of Japanese anime.

[ Leela&apos;s Homeworld Leela&apos;s Homeworld Futurama Fox Network 2002-02-17 4 12 ] [ A Clone of My Own A Clone of My Own Futurama Fox Network 2000-04-09 2 10 3 ] Philip J. Fry ( Billy West ) Fry is a dim-witted, immature, slovenly, yet good-hearted pizza delivery boy who falls into a cryogenic pod, causing it to activate and freeze him just after midnight on January 1, 2000. He re-awakens on New Year&apos;s Eve, 2999, and gets a job as a cargo delivery boy at Planet Express, a company owned by his only living relative, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth. Fry&apos;s love for Leela is a recurring theme throughout the series. Turanga Leela ( Katey Sagal ) Leela is the competent, one-eyed captain of the Planet Express Ship. Abandoned as a baby, she grew up in the Cookieville Minimum Security Orphanarium believing herself to be an alien from another planet, but learns that she is actually a mutant from the sewers in the episode &quot; Leela&apos;s Homeworld &quot;. Prior to becoming the ship&apos;s captain, Leela worked as a career assignment officer at the cryogenics lab where she first met Fry. She is Fry&apos;s primary love interest. Her name is a reference to the Turangalîla-Symphonie by Olivier Messiaen. &quot; Futurama &quot; (1999) - Trivia Bender Bending Rodríguez ( John DiMaggio ) Bender is a foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking, cigar-smoking, kleptomania cal, misanthropic, egocentric, ill-tempered robot manufactured by Mom&apos;s Friendly Robot Company. He was originally programmed to bend girders for suicide booth s, and is later designated as assistant sales manager and cook, despite lacking a sense of taste. He is Fry&apos;s best friend and roommate. Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth ( Billy West ) Professor Hubert Farnsworth, also known simply as &quot; the Professor, &quot; is Fry&apos;s distant nephew. Farnsworth founded Planet Express Inc. to fund his work as a mad scientist. Although he is depicted as a brilliant scientist and inventor, at more than one-hundred and sixty years old he is extremely prone to age-related forgetfulness and fits of temper. In the episode &quot; A Clone of My Own, &quot; the Professor clones himself to produce a successor, Cubert Farnsworth, whom he treats like a son. Dr. John A. Zoidberg ( Billy West ) Zoidberg is a lobster -like alien from the planet Decapod 10, and the neurotic staff physician of Planet Express. Although he claims to be an expert on humans, his knowledge of human anatomy and physiology is woefully inaccurate. Zoidberg&apos;s expertise seems to be with extra-terrestrial creatures. He is homeless, penniless, and—despite being depicted as Professor Farnsworth&apos;s long-time friend—held in contempt by everyone on the crew, except Fry. Amy Wong ( Lauren Tom ) Amy is an incredibly rich, blunt, spoiled, ditzy, and accident-prone long-term intern at Planet Express. She is an engineering student at Mars University and heiress to the western hemisphere of Mars. Born on Mars, she is ethnically Chinese and is prone to cursing in Cantonese and using 31st-century slang. Her parents are the wealthy ranchers Leo and Inez Wong. She is promiscuous in the beginning of the series and eventually enters a monogamous relationship with Kif Kroker. In the show&apos;s sixth season, she acquires her doctorate. Hermes Conrad ( Phil LaMarr ) Hermes is the Jamaica n accountant of Planet Express. A 36th-level bureaucrat (demoted to level 37 during the series) and proud of it, he is a stickler for regulation and enamored of the tedium of paperwork and bureaucracy. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the popular party activity. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died. Hermes has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year-old son, Dwight. Zapp Brannigan ( Billy West ) Zapp Brannigan is the incompetent, extraordinarily vain captain of the DOOP starship Nimbus. He is a satirical pastiche of Captain Kirk and William Shatner. Although Leela thoroughly detests him, Brannigan—a self-deluded lady&apos;s man —pursues her relentlessly, often at great personal risk. Brannigan was dishonorably dismissed from the DOOP in Brannigan Begin Again but was reinstated in the same episode. He was originally going to be voiced by Phil Hartman, but Hartman died before production could begin. Kif Kroker ( Maurice LaMarche ) Zapp Brannigan&apos;s 4th Lieutenant and long-suffering personal assistant, Kif is a member of the amphibious species that inhabits the planet Amphibios 9. Although extremely timid, he eventually works up the courage to date Amy. Kif is often shown sighing in disgust at the nonsensical rantings of his commanding officer. Mom ( Tress MacNeille ) Mom is the malevolent, foul-mouthed, cruel, and narcissistic owner of MomCorp, the thirtieth century&apos;s largest shipping and manufacturing company, with a monopoly on robots. In public, she maintains the image of a sweet, kindly old woman by speaking in stereotypically antiquated statements and wearing a mechanical fat suit. She occasionally launches insidious plans for world domination and corporate takeover. She has a romantic history with the Professor which left her bitter and resentful. She has three bumbling sons, Walt, Larry, and Igner (modeled after the Three Stooges ), who do her bidding despite frequent abuse, and often infuriate her with their incompetence. In Bender&apos;s Game, it is revealed that Igner&apos;s father is Professor Farnsworth. Nibbler ( Frank Welker ) Nibbler is Leela&apos;s pet Nibblonian, whom she rescued from an imploding planet and adopted early in the series. Despite his deceptively cute exterior, Nibbler is actually a highly intelligent super-being whose race is responsible for maintaining order in the universe. He is revealed in &quot; The Why of Fry &quot; to have been directly responsible for Fry&apos;s cryogenic freezing. While the size of an average house cat, his race is capable of devouring much larger animals. He defecates dark matter, which until Bender&apos;s Game is used as fuel for space cruisers in the series. [ Setting ] Fry&apos;s first glimpse of New New York City Futurama is set in New New York at the turn of the 31st century, in a time filled with technological wonders. The city of New New York has been built over the ruins of present-day New York City, referred to as &quot; Old New York. &quot; Various devices and architecture are similar to the Populuxe style. Global warming, inflexible bureaucracy, and substance abuse are a few of the subjects given a 31st-century exaggeration in a world where the problems have become both more extreme and more common. Just as New York has become a more extreme version of itself in the future, other Earth locations are given the same treatment; Los Angeles, for example, is depicted as a smog-filled apocalyptic wasteland. Numerous technological advances have been made between the present day and the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by Ron Popeil (who has a guest cameo in &quot; A Big Piece of Garbage &quot; ), which has resulted in many historical figures and current celebrities being present, including Groening himself; this became the writers&apos; device to feature and poke fun at contemporary celebrities in the show. Curiously, several of the preserved heads shown are those of people who were already dead well before the advent of this technology; one of the most prominent examples of this anomaly is frequent Earth president Richard Nixon, who died in 1994. The heads also appear to be in the age that the individual was most famous and not the older age in which they died. The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses  — even featuring its own digital world (similar to Tron or The Matrix )  — is slow and largely consists of pornography, pop-up ad s, and &quot; filthy &quot; (or Filthy Filthy) chat room s. Some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. Television is still a primary form of entertainment. Self-aware robots are a common sight, and are the main cause of global warming thanks to their alcohol-powered systems. The wheel is obsolete (no one but Fry even seems to recognize the design), [ Mother&apos;s Day Mother&apos;s Day (Futurama) Futurama Fox Network 2000-05-14 2 14 ] having been forgotten and replaced by hover cars and a network of large, clear pneumatic transportation tubes. Environmentally, common animals still remain, alongside mutated, cross-bred (sometimes with humans) and extraterrestrial animals. Ironically, Spotted Owls are often shown to have replaced rats as common household pests. Although rats still exist, sometimes rat s act like pigeon s. Pigeons still exist, as well. Pine tree s, anchovies and poodle s have been extinct for 800 years. Earth still suffers the effects of greenhouse gases, although in one episode Leela states that its effects have been counteracted by nuclear winter. In another episode, the effects of global warming have been somewhat mitigated by the dropping of a giant ice cube into the ocean, and later by pushing Earth farther away from the sun. Futurama&apos;s setting is a backdrop, and the writers are not above committing continuity error s if they serve to further the gags. For example, while the pilot episode implies that the previous Planet Express crew was killed by a space wasp, the later episode &quot; The Sting &quot; is based on the crew having been killed by space bees instead. { Verrone, Patric M (2003), DVD commentary for &quot; } { The Sting &quot;, Futurama. Original air date June 1, 2003. No. 12, Season 4. 20th Century Fox. } The &quot; world of tomorrow &quot; setting is used to highlight and lampoon issues of today and to parody the science fiction genre. [ Cohen, David X 2003 Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Space Pilot 3000 &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] [ Themes ] Earth is depicted as being multicultural to the extent that a wide range of human, robot, and extraterrestrial beings interact with the primary characters. In some ways the future is depicted as being more socially advanced than Fry&apos;s, and therefore the audience&apos;s, reality. However, it is often shown to have many of the same types of problems, challenges, mistakes, and prejudices as the present. Robots make up the largest &quot; minority &quot;. Most robots are self-aware and have been granted freedom and self-determination, but while a few are depicted as wealthy members of the upper class, they are often treated as second-class citizens. Likewise, robot–human relationships (termed &quot; robosexual &quot; ) are stigmatized, [ I Dated a Robot I Dated a Robot Futurama Fox Network 2001-05-13 3 15 ] and robot–human marriages are initially depicted as illegal. [ Proposition ∞ Proposition Infinity Futurama Fox Network 2010-07-08 6 4 ] Sewer mutants are mutated humans who must live in the sewers by law. They are initially depicted as holding urban legend status and regarded as fictional by most members of the public. This was contradicted by later episodes that depict Earth society as having enforced laws regarding mutants. However, since the conclusion of Season Six, mutants have been granted full status as citizens and are therefore granted the same rights to surface use as normal humans. Religion is still a prominent part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. A merging of the major religious groups of the 20th century has resulted in the First Amalgamated Church, [ Pinsky Mark The Gospel According to the Simpsons. Bigger and possibly even Better! edition 2003 978-0-664-23265-8 229–235 ] while Voodoo is now mainstream. New religions include Oprahism, Robotology, and the banned religion of &apos;&apos;Star Trek&apos;&apos; fandom. Religious figures include Father Changstein-El-Gamal, the Robot Devil, Reverend Preacherbot, and passing references to the Space Pope, who appears to be a large crocodile -like creature. While very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the Futurama universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion. Earthican flag, &quot; Ol&apos; Freebie &quot; Earth has a unified government headed by the President of Earth. Richard Nixon&apos;s head is elected to the position in Season Two, and holds the office in subsequent episodes. Earth&apos;s capital is Washington, D.C., and the flag of Earth is similar in design to the flag of the United States, with the western hemisphere displayed in place of the fifty stars. The show is set mostly in the former United States, and other parts of the world are rarely shown. Citizens of Earth are referred to as &quot; Earthicans, &quot; and English is shown to be the primary language of almost every sentient species. The Democratic Order of Planets (D.O.O.P.) has been compared to both the United Nations and the United Federation of Planets of the Star Trek universe. [ Love&apos;s Labours Lost in Space Love&apos;s Labours Lost in Space Futurama Fox Network 1999-04-13 1 4 ] Numerous other galaxies have been colonized or have made contact by the year 3000. Mars has been terraformed and is home to Mars University, Mars Vegas, and tribes similar to Native Americans, though they departed upon learning that the &quot; worthless bead &quot; they traded their land for (the Martian surface) was actually a giant diamond worth a fortune, deciding to buy another planet and act like it is sacred. A derivative of baseball, called blernsball, is played, and the New New York Mets, a laughingstock of the league, still play in Shea Stadium. A New New York Yankees team also exists. Due to the fact that the world of Fry&apos;s time was destroyed, much of the knowledge of history before then was lost. In the 31st century, facts gathered by archaeologists are portrayed as grossly inaccurate. For example, in &quot; The Lesser of Two Evils &quot;, the theme park &quot; Past-O-Rama &quot; presents a history in which 20th-century car factories had &quot; primitive robot &quot; assembly lines in which cars were not assembled by giant robotic welding arms, but by robots dressed like stereotypical cavemen. Another example comes from &quot; The Series Has Landed &quot;, in which knowledge of the Moon Landing has been lost for centuries. As a result, archaeologists came to the conclusion that the idea to go to the moon came from the infamous quote from The Honeymooners. [ Hallmarks ] [ Opening sequence ] Much like the opening sequence in &apos;&apos;The Simpsons&apos;&apos; with its chalkboard, sax solo, and couch gag s, Futurama has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. As the show begins, blue lights fill the screen and the Planet Express ship flies across the screen with the title of the show being spelled out in its wake. Underneath the title is a joke caption such as &quot; Painstakingly drawn in front of a live studio audience. &quot; or &quot; When you see the robot: DRINK! &quot; [ Farewell to the funny future http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14221036_ITM Azrai, Ahmad 2004-10-31 2008-01-10 Asia Africa Intelligence Wire ] After flying through downtown New New York and past various recurring characters, the Planet Express ship crashes into a large screen showing a short clip from a classic cartoon. These have included clips from Looney Tunes shorts, cartoons produced by Max Fleischer, a short of &apos;&apos;The Simpsons&apos;&apos; from a Tracey Ullman episode, [ &apos;Flickr Slideshow&apos; http://www.flickr.com/photos/nachop/sets/450093/show/ 2007 ] and the show&apos;s own opening sequence in &quot; The Devil&apos;s Hands Are Idle Playthings &quot;. Most episodes in Season 6 use an abridged opening sequence, omitting the brief clip of a classic cartoon. Several episodes begin with a cold opening before the opening sequence, although these scenes do not always correspond with the episode&apos;s plot. The opening sequence has been lampooned several times within the show, in episodes including &quot; That&apos;s Lobstertainment! &quot;, &quot; The Problem with Popplers &quot;, as &quot; Future-roma &quot; in &quot; The Duh-Vinci Code &quot; and as &quot; Futurella &quot; in &quot; Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences &quot;. Series director Scott Vanzo has remarked on the difficulty of animating the sequence. It took four to five weeks to fully animate the sequence, and it consists of over 80 levels of 3D animation composited together. [ Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kelley, Brian; Sheesley, Brian; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Scott; DiMaggio, John 2002 Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Love&apos;s Labours Lost in Space &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox Scott Vanzo:The final is kinda difficult for us to create, it has over 80 levels of 3D animation that are composited together, a lot of cheats, probably the single biggest scene that we have ever done, or at least we view it as a scene, so... I don&apos;t know what else to say. David X. Cohen:How long did it take just to animate that 28 seconds? Vanzo:I think we did it in about four or five weeks, all together. ] It takes approximately one hour to render a single frame, and each second of the sequence consists of around 30 frames. [ Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kelley, Brian; Sheesley, Brian; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Scott; DiMaggio, John 2002 Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Love&apos;s Labours Lost in Space &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox David X. Cohen: How long does it take — out of curiosity, I don&apos;t even the answer to this — how long does it take to render one frame of that kind of degree of computer– 3D computer graphics? Scott Vanzo:We split it into a lot of different levels, because it was taking so long, and that way we can fix things a lot easier. I would say, probably about an hour a frame for that title. Cohen:And 30 frames per second? So that adds up. ] Bender&apos;s Big Score has an extended opening sequence, introducing each of the main characters. In The Beast with a Billion Backs and Bender&apos;s Game the ship passes through the screen&apos;s glass and temporarily becomes part of the environment depicted therein—a pastiche of Disney &apos;s Steamboat Willie and Yellow Submarine respectively—before crashing through the screen glass on the way out. In Into the Wild Green Yonder, a completely different opening sequence involves a trip through a futuristic version of Las Vegas located on Mars. The theme tune is sung by Seth MacFarlane and is different from the standard theme tune. The end of the film incorporates a unique variation of the opening sequence; as the Planet Express ship enters a wormhole, it converts into a pattern of lights similar to the lights that appear in the opening sequence. The Futurama theme was created by Christopher Tyng. The theme is played on the tubular bell s but is occasionally remixed for use in specific episodes, including a version by the Beastie Boys used for the episode &quot; Hell Is Other Robots &quot;, in which they guest starred. The theme also samples a drum break originating from &quot; Amen, Brother &quot; by American soul group The Winstons; however, the drum break is replaced in Season 6. A remixed rendition of the theme is used in Season 5, which features altered instruments and a lower pitch. Season 6 also uses this remix, but it has been reduced again in pitch and tempo. The theme has been noted for its similarities to Pierre Henry &apos;s Psyché Rock (1967). [ AOqfWj0HqNE PIERRE HENRY - Psyché Rock (Pre Futurama Theme) (HQ) ] It was originally intended for the Futurama theme to be remixed in every episode.

Stewart; Haaland, Bret; West, Billy 2002 Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Mars University &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox David X. Cohen:It actually sounds pretty good, if you have a good quality TV stereo system, but it didn&apos;t transmit that well on the air. It lost a lot of the dynamic range, so it doesn&apos;t sound as good on actual broadcast as we thought it would. ] Despite this, beatbox renditions of the theme performed by Billy West and John DiMaggio are used for the episodes &quot; Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television &quot; and &quot; Spanish Fry &quot;. [ Language ] { Latin characters } There are three alternative alphabets that appear often in the background of episodes, usually in the forms of graffiti, advertisements, or warning labels. Nearly all messages using alternative scripts transliterate directly into English. The first alphabet consists of abstract characters and is referred to as Alienese, a simple substitution cipher from the Latin alphabet. [ http://www.omniglot.com/writing/futurama.htm Omniglot 2008-06-03 ] The second alphabet uses a more complex modular addition code, where the &quot; next letter is given by the summation of all previous letters plus the current letter. &quot; [ The Day the Earth Stood Stupid The Day the Earth Stood Stupid Futurama Audio Commentary 11 ] The codes often provide additional jokes for fans dedicated enough to decode the messages. The third language sometimes used is Hebrew. Aside from these alphabets, most of the displayed wording on the show uses the Latin alphabet. Several English expressions have evolved since the present day. For example, the word Christmas has been replaced with Xmas (pronounced &quot; ex-mas &quot; ), and the word ask with aks (pronounced axe). According to David X. Cohen it is a running joke that the French language is extinct in the Futurama universe (though the culture remains alive), much like Latin is in the present. [ Space Pilot 3000 Space Pilot 3000 Futurama Fox Network 1999-03-28 1 01 Audio commentary 20 ] In the French dubbing of the show, German is used as the extinct language instead. [ Humor ] { &quot; 30th Century Fox &quot;. } Although the series uses a wide range of styles of humor, including self-deprecation, black comedy, off-color humor, slapstick, and surreal humor, its primary source of comedy is its satirical depiction of everyday life in the future and its parodical comparisons to the present. Matt Groening notes that, from the show&apos;s conception, his goal was to make what was, on the surface, a goofy comedy that would have underlying &quot; legitimate literary science fiction concepts. &quot; { Keller, Joel (January 31, 2007). Matt Groening talks about Futurama&apos;s comeback. } { TV Squad. Retrieved February 1, 2007. } The series contrasted &quot; low culture &quot; and &quot; high culture &quot; comedy; for example, Bender&apos;s catchphrase is the insult &quot; Bite my shiny metal ass &quot; while his most terrifying nightmare is a vision of the number 2, a joke referencing the binary numeral system (Fry assures him, &quot; there&apos;s no such thing as two. &quot; ). The series developed a cult following partially due to the large number of in-joke s it contains, most of which are aimed at &quot; nerd s. &quot; In commentary on the DVD releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his &quot; nerdiest joke[s]. &quot; [ Raging Bender Raging Bender Futurama Fox Network 2000-02-27 2 8 ] These included mathematical joke s  — such as &quot; Loew&apos;s \aleph_0 -plex &quot; ( aleph-null -plex) movie theater,  — as well as various forms of science humor  — for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner &quot; No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it, &quot; a reference to the observer effect in quantum mechanics. [ The Luck of the Fryrish The Luck of the Fryrish Futurama Fox Network 2001-03-11 3 4 ] In the season six episode &quot; Law and Oracle &quot;, Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th century quantum physicist. On the front seat of the car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies &quot; A cat, some poison, and a Caesium atom. &quot; Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrodinger answers &quot; It&apos;s a superposition of both states until you open the box and collapse the wave function. &quot; The run is a reference to the Schrödinger&apos;s cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics.

[ Booker M. Keith Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy 115–124 ] Journalist/critic Frank Lovece in Newsday contrasted the humor tradition of Groening&apos;s two series, finding that, &quot; The Simpsons echoes the strains of American-Irish vaudeville humor  — the beer-soaked, sneaking-in-late-while-the-wife&apos;s-asleep comedy of Harrigan and Hart, McNulty and Murray, the Four Cohans (which, yes, included George M. ) and countless others: knockabout yet sentimental, and ultimately about the bonds of blood family. Futurama, conversely, stems from Jewish-American humor, and not just in the obvious archetype of Dr. Zoidberg. From vaudeville to the Catskills to Woody Allen, it&apos;s that distinctly rueful humor built to ward away everything from despair to petty annoyance  — the &apos;You gotta do what you gotta do&apos; philosophy that helps the &apos;Futurama&apos; characters cope in a mega-corporate world where the little guy is essentially powerless &quot;. Animation maven Jerry Beck concurred: &quot; I&apos;m Jewish, and I know what you&apos;re saying. Fry has that [type of humor], Dr. Zoidberg, all the [vocal artist] Billy West characters. I see it. The bottom line is, the producers are trying to make sure the shows are completely different entities &quot;. [ Reception, legacy, and achievements ] [ Success ] Futurama&apos;s 7:00  p.m. Sunday timeslot caused the show to often be pre-empted by sports and usually have a later than average season premiere. It also allowed the writers and animators to get ahead of the broadcast schedule so that episodes intended for one season were not aired until the following season. By the beginning of the fourth broadcast season, all the episodes to be aired that season had already been completed and writers were working at least a year in advance.
