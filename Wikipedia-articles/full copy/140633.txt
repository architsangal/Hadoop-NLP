[ the song by The Beatles ] [ August 2010 ] [ RIAA 2009 ] { yes } { The Beatles } { &quot; } { Hey Jude &quot; (1968) } { &quot; Get Back &quot; (1969) } { &quot; } { The Ballad of John and Yoko &quot; (1969) } [ Getbacksample.ogg &quot; Get Back &quot; single ] &quot; Get Back &quot; is a song by The Beatles, originally released as a single on 11 April 1969 and credited to &quot; The Beatles with Billy Preston. &quot; [ Lewisohn 1988 172 ] A different mix of the song later became the closing track of Let It Be (1970), which was the Beatles&apos; last album released just after the group split. The single version was later issued on CD on the second disc of the Past Masters compilation. The single reached number one in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, West Germany, and Mexico. It was the Beatles&apos; only single that credited another artist at their request. &quot; Get Back &quot; was the Beatles&apos; first single release in true stereo in the US. In the UK, the Beatles&apos; singles remained monaural until the following release, &quot; The Ballad of John and Yoko &quot;. [ Composition ] [ Musical development ] &quot; Get Back &quot; is unusual in the Beatles&apos; canon in that almost every moment of the song&apos;s evolution has been extensively documented, from its beginning as an offhand riff to its final mixing in several versions. Much of this documentation is in the form of illegal (but widely available) bootleg recording s, and is recounted in the book Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of the Beatles&apos; Let It Be Disaster by Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt. [ Sulpy Schweighardt 2003 84 ] The song&apos;s melody grew out of some unstructured jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. [ Sulpy Schweighardt 2003 84 ] Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking &quot; Get back to the place you should be &quot; from fellow Beatle George Harrison &apos;s &quot; Sour Milk Sea &quot; into &quot; Get back to where you once belonged &quot;. [ Sulpy Schweighardt 2003 152 ] (McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax &apos;s recording of the song a few months earlier.) On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of &quot; Get Back &quot; to the group, with the &quot; Sweet Loretta &quot; verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the &quot; Get Back &quot; single, McCartney wrote, &quot; We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then...when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by. &quot; [ The Beatles 2000 319 ] The released version of the song is composed of two verses, with an intro, outro, and several refrains. The first verse tells the story of a man named Jojo, who leaves his home in Tucson, Arizona, for some &apos;California grass &apos;. (McCartney&apos;s soon-to-be wife Linda had attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, where the couple later owned a spacious ranch.) The second verse is about a sexually ambiguous character named &quot; Loretta Martin &quot;, who &quot; thought she was a woman, but she was another man. &quot; The single version includes a coda urging Loretta to &quot; get back &quot; to where she once belonged. At the beginning of the Let It Be version of the song, Lennon can be heard jokingly saying &quot; Sweet Loretta Fart (often misheard as &quot; fat &quot;, due to Lennon&apos;s pronunciation [ Douglas Mike The Mike Douglas Show (TV Program) 7 February 1972 ] ), she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan. &quot; The album version of the song also ends with him famously quipping &quot; I&apos;d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition &quot;. (Originally he said that at the end of the rooftop concert, but Phil Spector edited it into the &quot; Get Back &quot; song on the Let It Be album.) Lennon claimed in 1980 that &quot; there&apos;s some underlying thing about Yoko in there &quot;, claiming that McCartney looked at Yoko Ono in the studio every time he sang &quot; Get back to where you once belonged. &quot; [ Sheff 2000 202 ] [ Early versions ] Around the time he was developing the lyrics to &quot; Get Back &quot;, McCartney satirised the &quot; Rivers of Blood speech &quot; by former British Cabinet minister Enoch Powell in a brief jam that has become known as the &quot; Commonwealth Song &quot;. The lyrics included a line &quot; You&apos;d better get back to your Commonwealth homes &quot;. The group improvised various temporary lyrics for &quot; Get Back &quot; leading to what has become known in Beatles&apos; folklore as the &quot; No Pakistanis &quot; version. [ Sulpy Schweighardt 2003 153 ] This version is more racially charged, and addresses attitudes toward immigrants in America and Britain: &quot;...don&apos;t need no Puerto Ricans living in the USA &quot;; and &quot; don&apos;t dig no Pakistanis taking all the people&apos;s jobs &quot;. [ The Beatles Bible 2008 ] In an interview in Playboy magazine in 1980, Lennon described it as &quot;...a better version of &apos; Lady Madonna &apos;. You know, a potboiler rewrite. &quot; [ Sheff 2000 201 ] On 23 January, the group (now in Apple Studios) [ Lewisohn 1988 166 ] tried to record the song properly; bootleg recordings preserve a conversation between McCartney and Harrison between takes discussing the song, and McCartney explaining the original &quot; protest song &quot; concept. The recording captures the group deciding to drop the third verse largely because McCartney does not feel the verse is of high enough quality, although he likes the scanning of the word &quot; Pakistani &quot;. Here the song solidifies in its two-verse, three-solo format. [ Recordings and post-production work ] Billy Preston joined The Beatles on keyboards from 22 January, having been recruited by Harrison partly with a view to deter bickering among the Beatles. [ The Beatles Bible 2008 ] The group with Preston playing Fender Rhodes electric piano recorded about ten takes on 23 January. On 27 January they made a concerted effort to perfect &quot; Get Back &quot;, recording about 14 takes. By this time the song had the addition of a false ending and reprise coda. After numerous takes the band jammed some old numbers and then returned to &quot; Get Back &quot; one last time in an attempt to record the master take. This performance (Take 11) was considered to be the best yet – it was musically tight and punchy without mistakes, though the song finishes without the restart. On the session tape, George Harrison comments &quot; we missed that end &quot;; this is the version heard on the Let It Be... Naked album. On 28 January [ Sulpy Schweighardt 2003 84 ] the group attempted to recapture the previous day&apos;s performance and recorded several new takes each including the coda. Whilst these takes were good, they did not quite achieve the quality of the best take from the previous day. The lineup for the released versions of &quot; Get Back &quot; was Paul McCartney, lead vocal and bass; John Lennon, lead guitar and backing vocal; George Harrison, rhythm guitar; Ringo Starr, drums; and Billy Preston, electric piano. Harrison, the usual lead guitarist, had temporarily quit the group on 10 January, so Lennon worked out the lead guitar. The Beatles had EMI produce a mono remix of the track on 4 April, [ Lewisohn 1996a ] completed by Jeff Jarrett. The Beatles were unhappy with the mix and on 7 April McCartney and Glyn Johns worked at Olympic Studios to produce new remixes for the single release. [ Lewisohn 1988 172 ] They made an edited version using the best take of the main part of the song (take eleven) from 27 January and the &apos;best coda&apos; ending from 28 January. The edit is so precise that it appears to be a continuous take, achieving the desired ending The Beatles had wanted all along. This was a divergence from the concept of straight live performance without studio trickery, but a relatively minor one, and avoids the somewhat abrupt ending of the version that is used on the Let It Be... Naked album. { The Beatles performed &quot; Get Back &quot; (along with other songs from the album) as part of the &quot; The Beatles Rooftop Performance &quot; which took place on the roof of } { Apple Studios in } { Savile Row, } { London on 30 January 1969. &quot; Get Back &quot; was performed in full three times.

After the police spoke to } { Mal Evans, he turned off Lennon and Harrison&apos;s amplifiers only for Harrison to switch them back on, insisting that they finish the song. It was during this period that McCartney ad-libbed, &quot; You&apos;ve been playing on the roofs again, and that&apos;s no good, and you know your Mummy doesn&apos;t like that...she gets angry...she&apos;s gonna have you arrested! Get back! &quot; None of the rooftop versions appear on record in their entirety although in the } { Let It Be film an edited version of the rooftop performance was included, and is available on } { Anthology 3. } At the end of the last rooftop performance of &quot; Get Back &quot;, the audience applauds and McCartney says &quot; Thanks, Mo &quot; in reply to Maureen Starkey &apos;s cheering. Lennon adds: &quot; I&apos;d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we&apos;ve passed the audition &quot;. Spector used some of the talk preceding the master take of 27 January and edited on these comments to make the album version sound different from the single. The stereo single version was the first Beatles&apos; recording to feature Starr&apos;s drum kit in true stereo, mixed across the left and right channels. This utilised the then-fairly new 8-track recording technology and was a result of the growing popularity of stereo over mono. The only other Beatles&apos; track to employ this recording method was &quot; The End &quot; on Abbey Road. [ Releases ] [ Single version ] On 11 April 1969, Apple Records released &quot; Get Back &quot; as a single in the United Kingdom, paired with &quot; Don&apos;t Let Me Down &quot; on the B-Side. The single began its seventeen-week stay in the charts on 26 April at number one, a position it held for six weeks. It was the only Beatles single to enter the UK charts at the top. &quot; Get Back/Don&apos;t Let Me Down &quot; was released in the United States on 5 May. Five days later, &quot; Get Back &quot; began its first of twelve weeks on the chart. Two weeks after the song&apos;s chart debut it hit number one, where it stayed for five weeks. In both the United Kingdom and the United States, the single was released by Apple, although EMI retained the rights to the song as part of their contract. It was the only Beatles&apos; single to include an accompanying artist&apos;s name, crediting &quot; Get Back/Don&apos;t Let Me Down &quot; to &quot; The Beatles with Billy Preston &quot;. Apple launched a print ad campaign for the song concurrent with its release showing a photo of the band with the slogan The Beatles as Nature Intended, indicating that the sound of &quot; Get Back &quot; harked to the group&apos;s earlier days. The single version of the song contains a tape echo effect throughout and a coda after a false ending, with the lyrics &quot; Get back Loretta / Your mommy&apos;s waiting for you / Wearing her high-heel shoe s / And her low-neck sweater / Get back home, Loretta. &quot; This does not appear on the album version; the single version&apos;s first LP appearance would come three years later on the 1967–1970 compilation. This version also appeared in the albums 20 Greatest Hits, Past Masters and The Beatles 1. This single version was also included in the original line-up of the proposed Get Back album that was scheduled to be released during the fall of 1969. In Britain and Europe &quot; Get Back/Don&apos;t Let Me Down &quot; was the Beatles&apos; last single to be released in mono, but in the US the single was released in stereo. It was the Beatles&apos; first single to be released in true stereo instead of mono as part of the &quot; stereo only &quot; movement gaining force in 1969. In both versions the lead guitar played by Lennon is in the left channel and the rhythm guitar played by Harrison is in the right channel. The single was also released in the experimental PocketDisc format by Americom in conjunction with Apple and Capitol in the late 1960s. [ Let It Be version ] When Phil Spector came to remix &quot; Get Back &quot; he wanted to make it seem different from the version released as the single, though both versions were the same take. The previous unreleased Get Back albums included elements of studio chatter to add to the live feel of the recordings. In this spirit, Spector included part of the studio chatter recorded immediately before the master take (recorded on 27 January) and added McCartney and Lennon&apos;s remarks after the close of the rooftop performance. This created the impression that the single and album versions are different takes. The single&apos;s echo effect was also omitted from the remix. [ Anthology 3 version ] In 1996, a different version of &quot; Get Back &quot; from the Rooftop Concert was released. It was the last song from the concert. The police had arrived and warned The Beatles to end their concert. After some bargaining, the group was given the chance to play one more song. During the last verse McCartney ad-libs, &quot; Get back Loretta/You&apos;ve been singing on the roof again!/...Your mummy doesn&apos;t like that.../Oh no... she gets angry/She&apos;s gonna have you arrested! &quot; [ Lewisohn 1996b 33–34 ] [ Let It Be... Naked version ] In 2003 &quot; Get Back &quot; was re-released on the Let It Be... Naked album, remixed by independent producers with the sanction of the surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, with John Lennon &apos;s and George Harrison &apos;s widows. The &quot; naked &quot; version of &quot; Get Back &quot; is ostensibly a cleaned up version of the single version albeit much shorter as there is a fade immediately before the final &quot; whoo &quot; and coda. Apple also prepared a specially-created music video of the Let It Be... Naked release of the song to promote that album in 2003. This video is edited together using stock footage of the band, along with Billy Preston, George Martin and others. [ Love version ] In 2006 a newly mixed version of &quot; Get Back &quot; produced by George Martin and his son Giles was included on the album Love. This version incorporates elements of &quot; A Hard Day&apos;s Night &quot; (the intro chord ), &quot; A Day in the Life &quot; (the improvised orchestral crescendo ), &quot; The End &quot; (Ringo Starr&apos;s drum solo, Paul McCartney&apos;s second guitar solo, and John Lennon&apos;s last guitar solo), and &quot; Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) &quot; (Take 1&apos;s drum count-off intro). [ Miami Herald 2006 ] However, there are several edits in this piece, including an extended intro, and the second verse is removed completely. [ Saturday Night Live performance ] Paul McCartney performed the song as a kind of encore on Saturday Night Live on Dec. 11, 2010. The performance was unusual for the show because McCartney had played the two standard songs that musical guests play, then had played a third song ( &quot; A Day in the Life &quot; ). At the normal conclusion of the show, when host Paul Rudd thanked the cast, McCartney took the stage again for &quot; Get Back &quot;, which broadcast was partially cut off due to time constraints.

Patrick Williams, the US arranger and composer, did a jazz-oriented instrumental cover of the song for his 1970 album Heavy Vibrations. That version became the longtime theme for the TV quiz Sports Challenge, hosted by Dick Enberg. Soul singer Doris Troy with assistance from Harrison, recorded the song as the b-side of her version of the folk song &quot; Jacob&apos;s Ladder &quot; on the Beatles&apos; own Apple label. Elvis Presley performs the song as part of a medley with &quot; Little Sister &quot; in the rockumentary film That&apos;s the Way It Is (1970). Elton John covers it completely during extended live performance of &quot; Burn Down the Mission &quot; on 11-17-70 (Uni 19305, 1971), a live broadcast over WABC-FM, New York City on that date. Ike &amp; Tina Turner covered it twice, with one version appearing on their 1971 album Workin&apos; Together. It remained a staple of their live show for many years. The Punkles did a Punk cover of this song on their Pistol album. Rod Stewart covered the song for the 1976 ephemeral music documentary All This and World War II. (Various Artists, 1976). An alternate version is found on CD 2 of the collectors edition of A Night on the Town. He also performed the song as a duet with Tina Turner on his 1981 TV special, Tonight I&apos;m Yours. Billy Preston, in the movie Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band and released on Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Various Artists, 1978). Shirley, Squirrely and Melvin, released on Shirley, Squirrely and Melvin (Excelsior 88009, 1981). Steve Wariner, in 1995 for the Beatles tribute album Come Together: America Salutes the Beatles. Status Quo covered the song on their Don&apos;t Stop album in 1996. Al Green covered the song on his debut LP for Willie Mitchell&apos;s Hi Records in 1969. Chris Clark covered the song on her second and final album, CC Rides Again. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band covered the song on their album Welcome to Woody Creek in 2004. McCartney performed a version of the song at the 1986 Prince&apos;s Trust Rock Gala at London&apos;s Wembley Arena, along with several other artists, including Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Paul Young, Elton John, Phil Collins and Brian May. Slovenian industrial band Laibach covered the song on their album Anthems. The song appears on Mott the Hoople &apos;s 1974 live album, Live, in a medley. [ Parodies and cultural references ] [ Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet The Simpsons 1993-09-30 ] [ Holden 2007 ] [ McKenzie 2010 ] The Rutles &apos; &quot; Get Up and Go &quot;, written by Neil Innes, features a set of lyrics parody ing &quot; Get Back &quot;. The lyrics are about a jockey by the name of Joe who leaves his &quot; one-horse town &quot; set to an almost identical tune. This apparently caused a copyright dispute which resulted in the song being omitted from the Rutles soundtrack album, although it was reinstated for the later CD reissue. At the end of The Simpsons episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet &quot;, all the members of The Be Sharps sing their first hit on Moe&apos;s rooftop while George Harrison, driving by, says &quot; It&apos;s been done. &quot; Also, at the end of their song, Homer says the ending comments &quot;...I hope we pass the audition &quot;, followed by everyone laughing and Barney saying &quot; I don&apos;t get it. &quot; In the 2007 film, Across the Universe, directed by Julie Taymor, most characters are named after lyrics in Beatles songs. A principal character is named Jojo, played by Martin Luther McCoy. In February 2010, NBC used a cover of the song in commercials to promote Jay Leno &apos;s return to the 11:35pm time slot for The Tonight Show. The titular characters in the popular long-running Japanese comic-book series JoJo&apos;s Bizarre Adventure are all named after the song. Also a character in the series, also one of the JoJos himself, Joseph Joestar is often seen in the end of the each story arc he appears in listening the song from his Walkman.
