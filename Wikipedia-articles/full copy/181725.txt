Eid gained all of Davik that was north of the Nordfjord and east of and including the village of Lefdal. (Population in that area was 654. ) All of Hornindal west of and including the villages of Navelsaker and Holmøyvik (population: 310) was also merged into Eid. After this merger, Eid&apos;s total population was 4,532. At this point, Eid gained a third sub-parish from the former municipality of Davik: Kjølsdalen. Then on 1 January 1992, the village of Lote (population: 152) was transferred from the municipality of Gloppen to Eid. [ The name ] The Old Norse form of the name was Øygir; this was originally the name of a fjord (now called the Eidsfjord). The name of the fjord is probably derived from a river name Aug, and this again is derived from the word öfugr which means &quot; backwards &quot;. The actual river (now called Eidselva) meander s back and forth and from certain points it can seem to run backwards. [ Coat of arms ] The coat of arms were granted on 26 April 1986. The arms show the head of a fjord horse. The region is well known for its own race of horses, called the Fjording, that are very common and popular in the area. The Fjording is characterised by its white and black mane.
