Security was their primary value: all else was secondary. Both of them had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe. My father&apos;s career had followed the path familiar to so many New York immigrants. Lower East Side. Scant schooling. Street hustling. Hard work at anything to keep life together. Early marriage. Struggling out of poverty. &lt; p &gt; Curiously, success came to him during the Depression. He founded what later became Harry Mander and Company, a small service business to the garment industry, manufacturing pipings, waist bands, pocketing and collar canvas. &lt; p &gt; One of the reasons for my father&apos;s success during hard times was World War II. He was beyond draft age and so was free to do a successful trade in servicing the manufacture of military uniforms. After the war, the business grew in new directions as the economy spurted forward into an era of rapid growth.

I became a rebel through advertising. It was by being in advertising and realizing what advertising does in the system. I mean I can&apos;t explain why I, unlike other advertising men, saw that as a big problem. But I became involved using those techniques to help, you know, environmental groups and anti-war groups and civil rights groups, using advertising as a technique to help them. Advertising and also public relations work. So using that medium is what awoke me in many ways to the power of the medium and the power to use it in the reverse, against the system as well. Although the main problem is that those who are in power have so much more power and more money than those who are trying to resist it. And so we&apos;re always up against a heavy ratio, and the fact the opposite side has more power than we do. In 1965, Mander married feminist author Anica Vesel Mander (b. 1934, d. 2002-06-19).
