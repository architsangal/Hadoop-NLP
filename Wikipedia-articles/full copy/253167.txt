Villanueva [ Languages ] Bikol is the primary language spoken in Albay, being a part of the Bicol Region. It has many dialects, such as Bicolano Viejo, Daragueño, Legazpeño or Albayano, Oasnon and others. The dialects spoken in the coastal areas of the province are similar to the language spoken in Camarines Sur, while those further inland are similar to each other but differ significantly from the coastal dialect. The majority of the inhabitants also understand Tagalog and English. [ History ] [ Pre-Hispanic period ] Long before the Spaniards arrived, Albay had a thriving civilization. Formerly called Ibat, Albay was once ruled by Gat Ibal, an old chief who also founded the old barangay of Sawangan, now the district of Albay and part of the city of Legazpi. [ Spanish colonial period ] In July 1569, Luis Enriquez de Guzman, a member of the expedition led by Maestro de Campo Mateo de Saz and Captain Martin de Goiti, led a group which crossed from Burias and Ticao islands and landed on a coastal settlement called Ibalon in what is presently the province of Sorsogon. From this point another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of Camalig. In 1573, Juan de Salcedo penetrated the Bicol Peninsula from the north as he made it as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of Santiago de Libon. Jose Maria Peñaranda, a military engineer, was made “corregidor” of the province on May 14, 1834. He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges. The entire Bicol Peninsula was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast. In 1636, the two partidos were separated, and Ibalon became a separate province with Sorsogon as capital. In the 17th century, Moro slave raiders from southern Philippines, ravaged the northeastern coastal areas of the province of Albay. Mayon Volcano, in one of its most violent eruptions, destroyed the five towns surrounding its base on February 1, 1814. This eruption forced the town of Cagsawa to relocate to its present site, Legazpi. A decree was issued by Governor-General Narciso Claveria in 1846 separating Masbate, Ticao and Burias from Albay to form the comandancia of Masbate. Albay was then divided into four districts: Iraya, Cordillera or Tabaco, Sorsogon and Catanduanes. [ Philippine revolution ] Glicerio Delgado, a condemned insurecto (insurgent), started revolutionary activities in the province. With a headquarter in the mountain of Guinobatan town, he joined the revolutionary government of Albay as a lieutenant in the infantry. A unit of the Philippine Militia was then organized by the Spanish military authorities. Mariano Riosa was appointed major of the Tabaco Zone, which comprised all the towns along the seacoast from Albay to Tiwi, while Anacieto Solano was appointed major for the Iraya Zone, which was made up of the towns from Daraga to Libon. Each town was organized into sections of fifty men under the command of a lieutenant. During the Philippine Revolution on September 22, 1898, the provisional revolutionary government of Albay was formed with Anacieto Solano as provisional president. Major General Vito Belarmino, the appointed military commander, reorganized the Filipino Army in the province. [ American colonial period ] The sovereignty of the country was transferred to the United States after the Treaty of Paris (1898). { McKinley, William (1898). &quot; &apos;&apos;The Acquisition of the Philippines&apos;&apos; from &apos;&apos;Papers Relating to Foreign Affairs&apos;&apos; &quot;.

Retrieved on 2012-05-18. } During the Philippine-American War, Brigadier General William Kobbe headed the expedition that landed at the ports of Sorsogon, Bulan and Donsol. From there, the American marched to Legazpi and captured it. Although a civil government was established in Albay on April 26, 1901, Colonel Harry H. Bandhortz, Commanding Officer of the Constabulary in the Bicol Region, said that General Simeon Ola, with a thousand men, continued to defy American authority after the capture of Belarmino in 1901. Ola was later captured with about six hundred of his men. [ World War II ] During the Second World War, the Kimura Detachment of the Japanese Imperial Forces occupied Legazpi on December 12, 1941. The region was defended only by the Philippine Constabulary unit under Major Francisco Sandico. { &quot; History of Albay &quot;.
