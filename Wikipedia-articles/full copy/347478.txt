[ December 2008 ] What&apos;s Happening!! lasted from 1976 to 1979. He was a millionaire by age 29. After the show ended, Berry, who weighed over 300 pounds, had trouble finding work because he was permanently identified with the Rerun character. Eventually however, he came to embrace his being typecast, and made his peace with it as the best means to maintain his celebrity. In public, he was often seen wearing the red beret and red suspenders that are part of the Rerun character, and even went so far as to have his middle name legally changed to &quot; Rerun &quot;. [ Substance abuse problems ] During the 1980s, Berry battled drug addiction and alcoholism. He revived the character of Rerun in the series What&apos;s Happening Now!!, but he was only on that show for a year. Berry asked for more money than the rest of the cast (believing he was the reason people tuned in).
