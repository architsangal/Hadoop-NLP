Retrieved on August 6, 2008 } Albert Brooks made his first guest appearance on The Simpsons in this episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob. In this episode, Homer decides to purchase an RV and the Simpsons set off for a vacation in the wilderness. After accidentally driving it off the edge of a cliff, the family find themselves trapped in the woods. As Homer and Bart try to find a way back to civilization, Homer gets himself covered in mud and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist. The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the woods to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears. [ Plot ] Homer is jealous of Ned Flanders &apos; new RV and goes shopping for one of his own. Bob, the owner of the RV store shows the family the Ultimate Behemoth. During the tour, Bart and Lisa are impressed, but Marge is concerned about the cost. However, Bob does a credit check on the computer and learns that Homer has bad credit scores. As a result, he is unable to afford a new RV, and is forced to settle for a dilapidated, second hand RV instead. The family packs everything into their new RV and head off on a camping trip. Against Marge&apos;s wishes, Homer takes an unwise, off-road shortcut that soon results in the RV dangling precariously on the edge of a cliff. The family manages to inch out of the vehicle just before it plummets off the cliff, stranding them in the wilderness. Marge and Lisa set up camp while Homer and Bart head off to look for civilization. Maggie follows them, but quickly gets separated and is cared for by an adoptive family of grizzly bear s. Homer and Bart&apos;s attempts to find food prove fruitless, and soon they fall into a river and lose their clothes. Homer finds a beehive and attempts to get the honey, but is repeatedly stung by bees that cause his mouth to swell, rendering him incomprehensible. He staggers into mud, where an amateur cameraman captures a video of him and, mistaking him for Bigfoot, sells it to the local news. Soon the forest is swarming with Bigfoot hunters. Lisa and Marge are found and rescued. Marge sees a picture of &quot; Bigfoot &quot; and announces that he is actually her husband, causing a minor tabloid scandal. Homer and Bart encounter a grizzly bear, but Maggie calms it before it attacks them. Maggie leaves with Homer and Bart as they wander back into civilization, where Homer is immediately tranquilized and brought to a research lab for study. They keep him for several days, but eventually are forced to release him. The results of their study are inconclusive. [ Production ] { James L.

Brooks, but they ended up going with Maggie being raised by bears instead.

[ Archer, Wes 2001 The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; The Call of the Simpsons &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] In the original script, Homer and Bart were not talking in the scene where they concealed their private parts with mud and moss, but Sam Simon thought it would be &quot; too funny to leave as a stage direction &quot; and they added dialogue to the scene. [ Reiss, Mike 2001 The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; The Call of the Simpsons &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] Albert Brooks guest starred in the episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be identified with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode. [ Reception ] In its original American broadcast on February 18, 1990, &quot; The Call of the Simpsons &quot; finished third place in the ratings for that day, with a Nielsen rating of 14.6 and a 22 percent audience share.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: &quot; This episode is a bit less than the sum of its parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there&apos;s some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears? &quot; In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding &quot; the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all. &quot; [ http://web.archive.org/web/20090202012353/http%3A//www.wdbgproductions.com/cinerama/reviews/simpsonsseason1.htm http://www.wdbgproductions.com/cinerama/reviews/simpsonsseason1.htm The Complete First Season 2011-09-15 2009-02-02 2001-09-25 Grelck, David B.
