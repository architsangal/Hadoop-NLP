[ April 2012 ] { bodhrán, a traditional Irish drum. } Irish Music is the generic term for music that has been created in various genres on the island of Ireland. The indigenous music of the island is termed Irish traditional music. It has remained vibrant through the 20th, and into the 21st century, despite globalizing cultural forces. In spite of emigration and a well-developed connection to music influences from Britain and the United States, Irish music has kept many of its traditional aspects and has itself influenced many forms of music, such as country and roots music in the USA, which in turn have had some influence on modern rock music. It has occasionally been fused with rock and roll, punk rock and other genres. Some of these fusion artists have attained mainstream success, at home and abroad. In recent decades Irish music in many different genres has been very successful internationally. However, the most successful genres have been rock, popular and traditional fusion, with performers such as U2, Enya, Westlife, Boyzone, Thin Lizzy, Rory Gallagher, Bob Geldof, Clannad, The Corrs, The Chieftains, The Irish Tenors, Van Morrison, The Saw Doctors, Snow Patrol, The Cranberries, The Undertones, Ash, The Script, Sinéad O&apos;Connor, Damien Rice, Glen Hansard, and Celtic Woman achieving success nationally and internationally. [ Early Irish music ] By the High and Late Medieval Era, the Irish annals were listing native musicians, such as the following: 921. Cú Congalta, priest of Lann-Leire, the Tethra (i. e. the singer or orator) for voice, personal form, and knowledge, died. 1011.

Cú Chuimne (died 747) lived much of his adult life in Gaelic Scotland, and composed at least one hymn. Foillan, who was alive in the seventh century, travelled through much of Britain and France; around 653 at the request of St. Gertrude of Brabant, taught psalmody to her nuns at Nievelle. Tuotilo (c.850–c. 915), who lived in Italy and Germany, was noted both as a musician and a composer. Helias of Cologne (died 1040), is held to be the first to introduce Roman chant to Cologne. His contempory, Aaron Scotus (died 18 November 1052) was an acclaimed composer of Gregorian chant in Germany. Donell Dubh Ó Cathail (c. 1560s-c.1660), was not only musician of Viscount Buttevant, but, with his uncle Donell Óge Ó Cathail, harper to Elizabeth I. [ Early Modern times ] [ Dancing Willow - Demo-CD 2007 06 - Give me your hand.ogg Give Me Your Hand Instrumental featuring viola da gamba and recorder, performed by Dancing Willow ] Up to the seventeenth century, harp musicians were patronised by the aristocracy in Ireland. This tradition died out in the eighteenth century with the collapse of Gaelic Ireland. Turlough Carolan (1670–1738) is the best known of those harpists, [ Sawyers June Skinner The Complete Guide to Celtic Music 2002 London Aurum ] {, p 28. } [ Yeats, Gráinne http://www.harpspectrum.org/folk/yeats_short.shtml The Rediscovery of Carolan Harpspectrum.com 25 April 2008 ] and over 200 of his compositions are known. He wrote in a baroque style that is usually classified as classical music, but his music has entered the tradition and is played by many folk musicians today. Edward Bunting collected some of the last-known Irish harp tunes at the Belfast Harp Festival in 1792. Other important collectors of Irish music include Francis O&apos;Neill [ Haggerty Bridget Francis O&apos;Neill - The Man Who Saved Our Music http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/AMusic/FrancisONeil.html Irishcultureandcustoms.com 25 April 2008 ] and George Petrie. Other notable Irish musicians of this era included Cearbhall Óg Ó Dálaigh (fl. c. 1630); Piaras Feiritéar (1600?–1653); William Connellan (fl. mid-17th century) and his brother, Thomas Connellan (c. 1640/1645–1698), composers; Dominic Ó Mongain (alive 18th century); Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh (1695–1807); poet and songwriter Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin (1748–1782); Arthur O&apos;Neill (fl. 1792); Patrick Byrne (c.1794-1863); world-renowned piper Tarlach Mac Suibhne (c. 1831-1916); poet and songwriter Colm de Bhailís (1796–1906). [ Traditional music ] [ Folk music of Ireland ] A traditional music session, also known as a &apos;&apos;seisiún&apos;&apos;. Irish traditional music includes many kinds of songs, including drinking songs, ballad s and lament s, sung unaccompanied or with accompaniment by a variety of instruments. Traditional dance music includes reels (4/4), hornpipe s and jig s (the common double jig is in 6/8 time). [ http://www.whistleworkshop.co.uk/jigs.htm Whistle Workshop Whistle Workshop 2 April 2012 ] The polka arrived at the start of the nineteenth century, spread by itinerant dancing masters and mercenary soldiers, returning from Europe. [ Sawyers June Skinner The Complete Guide to Celtic Music 2002 London Aurum ] {, p 48-49. } Set dancing may have arrived in the eighteenth century. [ http://www.insideireland.com/sample02.htm Inside Ireland Inside Ireland 2 April 2012 ] Later imported dance-signatures include the mazurka and the highlands (a sort of Irished version of the Scottish strathspey ). [ Sawyers June Skinner The Complete Guide to Celtic Music 2002 London Aurum ] {, p 48. } In the nineteenth century folk instruments would have included the flute the fiddle and the uilleann pipes. A revival of Irish traditional music took place around the turn of the 20th century. The button accordion and the concertina were becoming common. [ http://www.concertina.com/worrall/ Concertinas in Ireland Concertina.com 2 April 2012 ] Irish stepdance was performed at céilís, organised competitions and at some country houses where local and itinerant musicians were welcome. [ http://www.setdancingnews.net/news/quotes3.lp Country House music Setdancingnews.net 14 January 2006 2 April 2012 ] Irish dancing was supported by the educational system and patriotic organisations. An older style of singing called sean-nós ( &quot; in the old style &quot; ), which is a form of traditional Irish singing was still found, mainly for very poetic songs in the Irish language. [ http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/sean-nos.htm Sean nos Mustrad.org.uk 2 April 2012 ] From 1820 to 1920 over 4,400,000 Irish emigrated to the USA, creating an Irish diaspora in Chicago (see Francis O&apos;Neill ), Boston, New York and other cities. [ http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAEireland.htm Irish emigration Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk 2 April 2012 ] Irish musicians who were successful in the USA made recordings which found their way around the world and re-invigorated musical styles back in the homeland. [ Clarke Gerry Oldtime Records Vol 1 2006 Galway Oldtime Records ] {, Liner notes to CD. } For example American-based fiddlers like Michael Coleman, James Morrison and Paddy Killoran did much to popularise Irish music in the 1920s and 1930s. After a lull in the 1940s and 1950s, when (except for Céilidh bands ) traditional music was at a low ebb, Seán Ó Riada &apos;s The Chieftains, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, The Irish Rovers, The Dubliners, Ryan&apos;s Fancy and Sweeney&apos;s Men were in large part responsible for a second wave of revitalization of Irish folk music in the 1960s. Several of these were featured in the 2010 TV movie &quot; My Music: When Irish Eyes are Smiling &quot;. { My Music: When Irish Eyes Are Smiling } They were followed by the likes of Planxty, The Bothy Band and Clannad in the 70s. Later came such bands as Stockton&apos;s Wing, De Dannan, Altan, Arcady, Dervish and Patrick Street, along with a wealth of individual performers. { Geoff Wallis: Rough Guide to Irish Music } More and more people play Irish music and many new bands emerge every year Téada, Gráda, The Bonny Men, Caladh Nua, Dervish, Lúnasa being some (to name a few). [ Classical music in Ireland ] { John Field, one of Ireland&apos;s foremost classical composers. } In the eighteenth century a number of musical clubs were formed, mainly in Dublin, for charitable purposes, which led to an upsurge in performances. Handel arrived in Dublin in 1742 to superintend the first performance of his famous oratorio. The Passerini and Damici families were favourite performers in Dublin at the operas, concerts and oratorios which were then popular. { The Irish Monthly Magazine of Politics and Culture, 1833, p. 378 } Among the next generation of musicians was John Stevenson (1761 –1833), who is best known for his publications of Irish Melodies with poet Thomas Moore. His works include religious music, catches, glees, odes, operas, songs and symphonies and accompaniments to airs. [ Boylan Henry 1998 A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition 411 Dublin Gill and MacMillan 0-7171-2945-4 ] His contemporaries in the musical field were Michael Kelly and Doctor Carter. John Field, who lived in the early Romantic Era has been credited with the creation of the Nocturne form, later developed by Frédéric Chopin. Michael W. Balfe composer of 38 operas for the houses of London, Paris, Milan and Vienna; William Vincent Wallace composer of six operas and Charles Villiers Stanford achieved popularity in Europe and the UK during the 19th and early-20th centuries, but success for Irish composers has come primarily from outside the Irish state. Michele Esposito, a figure of seminal importance in the history of Irish music of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, arrived in Ireland in 1882. He became chief pianoforte professor at the Royal Irish Academy of Music and remained in Ireland for forty-six years, teaching two generations of musicians and composing notable works. { Jeremy Dibble, Michele Esposito (Dublin, Field Day Publications 2010) } A notable contributor to Irish music since the 1930s was Cork professor of music Aloys Fleischmann. Today, the best-known living Irish composer is Gerald Barry whose operatic works have been particularly successful in the UK and Europe. [ http://www.cmc.ie/composers/composer.cfm?composerID%3D4 Gerald Barry Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland 2 April 2009 ] [ Performers of note ] Performers of classical music of note include Catherine Hayes, (1818–1861) Ireland&apos;s first great international prima donna and the first Irish woman to perform at La Scala in Milan; tenor John McCormack (1884–1945), the most celebrated tenor of his day; opera singer Margaret Burke-Sheridan (1889–1958); tenor Josef Locke (1917–1999) achieved global success and was the subject of the 1991 film Hear My Song; the concert flautist Sir James Galway and pianist Barry Douglas. { Niall O’Loughlin/Richard Wigmore, &apos;Galway, Sir James&apos;, } { Grove Music Online,. Retrieved 12 August 2007. } Douglas achieved fame in 1986 by claiming the International Tchaikovsky Competition gold medal. Mezzo-sopranos Bernadette Greevy and Ann Murray have also had success internationally. { The Irish Times, &quot; A remarkable voice of remarkable longevity &quot;, 30 September 2008 } [ Choral music ] Anúna. Choral music in Ireland has produced Anúna, Ireland&apos;s National Choir { Global Times, China }, known for their contribution to Riverdance in the early 1990s. They have also been nominated for a Classical Brit Award in the UK and were invited to give the first ever Irish Prom at the BBC Proms series in the Royal Albert Hall in 1999. In 2012 they featured as the voices of Hell in the video game Diablo III { Destructoid News }. The National Chamber Choir of Ireland are principally funded by the Arts Council of Ireland. Their artistic director is Paul Hillier { National Chamber Choir website }. Resurgam is also an important professional choral group that have begun to make an impact upon the awareness of vocal music beyond that of opera or contemporary popular music, while there are several high-quality church choirs, particularly in Dublin: The Palestrina Choir (St. Mary&apos;s Pro-Cathedral), Christ Church Cathedral Choir (Christ Church Cathedral) and St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral Choir. In the 1980s Shaun Davey composed The Brendan Voyage, a mix of classical orchestral and Irish traditional styles with the uilleann piper Liam O&apos;Flynn as the soloist. He continued and expanded this genre with his compositions The Pilgrim, Granuaile, and The Relief of Derry Symphony. Piano Concerto No.1, Guitar Concerto No.1 and the Variations on Bach&apos;s Inventions are some of the works of Richard Kearns who is another of Ireland&apos;s classical composers. [ Popular music ] Enya fused traditional Irish elements with New Age to create a unique sound which has made her Ireland&apos;s second biggest-selling act of all time. [ Early popular performers ] Performers of popular music began appearing as early as the late 1940s; Delia Murphy popularised Irish folk songs that she recorded for HMV in 1949; Margaret Barry is also credited with bringing traditional songs to the fore; Donegal&apos;s Bridie Gallagher shot to fame in 1956 and is considered &apos;Ireland&apos;s first international pop star&apos;; { http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16470862 } Belfast-born singer Ruby Murray achieved unprecedented chart success in the UK in the mid-1950s; The Bachelors were an all-male harmony group from Dublin who had hits in the UK, Europe, US, Australia and Russia; Mary O&apos;Hara was a soprano and harpist who was successful on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1950s and early 1960s; Waterford crooner Val Doonican had a string of UK hits and presented his own TV show on the BBC from 1965 to 1986. [ Showbands in Ireland ] [ Irish showband ] Irish Showbands were a major force in Irish popular music, particularly in rural areas, for twenty years from the mid-1950s. The showband played in dance halls and was loosely based on the six or seven piece Dixieland dance band. The basic showband repertoire included standard dance numbers, cover versions of pop music hits, ranging from rock and roll, country and western to jazz standards. Key to the showband&apos;s success was the ability to learn and perform songs currently in the record chart s. They sometimes played Irish traditional or Céilidh music and a few included self-composed songs. [ Finbar O&apos;Keefe 2002 Goodnight, God Bless and Safe Home - The Golden Showband Era The O&apos;Brien Press 0-86278-777-7 ] [ Country and Irish ] [ Country and Irish ] With the rise in popularity of American country music, a new subgenre developed in Ireland known as &apos;Country and Irish&apos;. It was formed by mixing American Country music with Irish influences, incorporating Irish folk music. This often resulted in traditional Irish songs being sung in a country music style. It is especially popular in the rural Midlands and North-West of the country. It also remains popular among Irish emigrants in Britain. Big Tom and The Mainliners were the first major contenders in this genre, having crossed over from the showband era of the 1960s. Other major artists were Philomena Begley and Margo, the latter even being bestowed the unofficial title of Queen of Country &amp; Irish.

Enya achieved international success with New Age /Celtic fusions. The Afro-Celt Sound System achieved fame adding West African influences and drum n bass in the 1990s while bands such as Kíla fuse traditional Irish with rock and world music representing the Irish tradition at world music festivals across Europe and America. The most notable fusion band in Ireland was Horslips, who combined Irish themes and music with heavy rock. Riverdance is a musical and dancing interval act which originally starred Michael Flatley and Jean Butler and featuring the choir Anúna. It was performed during the Eurovision Song Contest 1994. Popular reaction to the act was so immense that an entire musical revue was built around the act. [ Pop/Rock ] [ Irish rock ] The 1960s saw the emergence of major Irish rock bands and artists, such as Them, Van Morrison, Emmet Spiceland, Eire Apparent, Skid Row, Taste, Rory Gallagher, Dr. Strangely Strange, Thin Lizzy, Mellow Candle. In 1970 Dana put Ireland on the pop music map by winning Eurovision with her song All Kinds Of Everything. She went to number one in the UK and all over Europe and paved the way for many Irish artists. Gilbert O&apos;Sullivan went to the top of the charts in 1972 with a string of hits, and the all-sister line-up of The Nolans gained international chart success in the late 1970s. { http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1388344/Me-school-photo-Coleen-Nolan-remembers-vile-bully-exams-sat.html } Chris de Burgh achieved international acclaim with his 1986 hit &quot; Lady in Red &quot;. Groups who formed during the emergence of Punk rock in the mid-late 1970s included U2, Virgin Prunes, The Boomtown Rats, The Undertones, Aslan, Gavin Friday, and Stiff Little Fingers. Later in the 80s and into the 90s, Irish punk fractured into new styles of alternative rock, which included That Petrol Emotion, My Bloody Valentine and Ash. { http://irishrockers.com/IrishRockHistory.php } The Pogues fused punk with traditional Irish songs. Thin Lizzy in concert, 1981 In the 1990s, pop bands like the Corrs, B*Witched, Boyzone, Westlife and The Cranberries emerged. In the same decade, Ireland also contributed a subgenre of folk metal known as Celtic metal with exponents of the genre including Cruachan, Primordial, Skyclad, Geasa and Waylander.
