[ Education ] Western Brown High School [ Trivia ] Mount Orab was formerly home to the Lake Drive-In movie theater, which was destroyed by a storm in the late 1980s. After the theater was shut down, the management posted &quot; Gone with the Wind &quot; on the marquee, a punning reference to the storm. A local newspaper printed a picture of the marquee prompting rumors that a tornado had taken the theater out during a re-release of Gone with the Wind. A 1942 photograph in the Library of Congress, long thought to be a picture of another small Ohio town ( Mount Gilead ), was recently identified as Mount Orab by sharp-eyed observers on the Shorpy.com website.
