[ Structure and discovery ] In 1902, Hermann Emil Fischer isolated hydroxyproline from hydrolized gelatin. In 1905, Hermann Leuchs synthesized a racemic mixture of 4-hydroxyproline. [ R.H.A.

Analysis 1908 1912 Longmans, Green and Co. London 132 ] Hydroxyproline differs from proline by the presence of a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the gamma carbon atom. Zwitterionic structure of (2&apos;&apos;S&apos;&apos;,4&apos;&apos;R&apos;&apos;)-4-hydroxyproline (left) and (2&apos;&apos;R&apos;&apos;,4&apos;&apos;S&apos;&apos;)-4-hydroxyproline (right) [ Production and function ] Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post-translational modification ). The enzyme catalysed reaction takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it is not directly incorporated into proteins, hydroxyproline comprises roughly 4% of all amino acids found in animal tissue, more than seven amino acids which are directly incorporated.

Raines Ronald T. 2010 April Prolyl 4-hydroxylase Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 45 2 106–124 2841224 10.3109/10409231003627991 20199358 ] Hydroxyproline is a major component of the protein collagen [ Szpak Paul Fish bone chemistry and ultrastructure: implications for taphonomy and stable isotope analysis http://uwo.academia.edu/PaulSzpak/Papers/827788/Fish_Bone_Chemistry_and_Ultrastructure_Implications_for_Taphonomy_and_Stable_Isotope_Analysis Journal of Archaeological Science 2011 38 12 3358–3372 10.1016/j.jas.2011.07.022 ]. Hydroxyproline and proline play key roles for collagen stability. { Nelson, D. L. and Cox, M. M. (2005) Lehninger&apos;s Principles of Biochemistry, 4th Edition, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York. } They permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. { Brinckmann, J., Notbohm, H. and Müller, P.K. (2005) Collagen, Topics in Current Chemistry 247, Springer, Berlin. } In the canonical collagen Xaa-Yaa-Gly triad (where Xaa and Yaa are any amino acid), a proline occupying the Yaa position is hydroxylated to give a Xaa-Hyp-Gly sequence. This modification of the proline residue increases the stability of the collagen triple helix. It was initially proposed that the stabilization was due to water molecules forming a hydrogen bonding network linking the prolyl hydroxyl groups and the main-chain carbonyl groups. [ Bella J Eaton M Brodsky B Berman HM Crystal and molecular structure of a collagen-like peptide at 1.9 A resolution Science 266 5182 75–81 1994 7695699 10.1126/science.7695699 ] It was subsequently shown that the increase in stability is primarily through stereoelectronic effect s and that hydration of the hydroxyproline residues provides little or no additional stability.

Raines R.T. 2008 Stabilization of the Collagen Triple Helix by O-Methylation of Hydroxyproline Residues Journal of the American Chemical Society 130 10 2952–2953 18271593 2802593 ] In addition to collagen, the mammalian proteins elastin and argonaute 2 have collagen-like domains in which hydroxyproline is formed. Some snail poisons, conotoxin s, contain hydroxyproline, but lack collagen-like sequences. Hydroxylation of proline has been shown to be involved in targeting Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) for degradation by proteolysis. Under normoxia (normal oxygen conditions) EGLN1 protein hydroxylates the proline at the 564 position of HIF-1 alpha, which allows ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) and subsequent targeting for proteasome degradation.

For this reason, hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount. Hydroxyproline rich glycoprotein s are also found in plant cell walls. { Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998. 49:281–309 PLANT CELL WALL PROTEINS Gladys I. Cassab } [ Clinical significance ] Proline hydroxylation requires ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ). The most obvious, first effects (gingival and hair problems) of absence of ascorbic acid in humans come from the resulting defect in hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen, with reduced stability of the collagen molecule, causing scurvy. Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have also been demonstrated in Paget&apos;s disease. { http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/pagets_disease } [ Other hydroxyprolines ] Other hydroxyprolines also exist in nature, the most notable ones being 2,3-cis-, 3,4-trans-, and 3,4-dihydroxyproline, which occurs in diatom cell wall s [ 10.1126/science.164.3886.1400 Nakajima T. Volcani B.E. 1969 3,4-Dihydroxyproline: a new amino acid in diatom cell walls Science 164 3886 1400–1401 5783709 ] and is postulated to have a role in silica deposition. Hydroxyproline is also found in the walls of oomycete s, fungus-like protists related to diatoms. { Alexopoulos, C.J., Mims C.W. and Blackwell, M.(1996). Introductory Mycology, 4th ed., p. 687-688. (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons). ISBN 0-471-52229-5. } cis-4-hydroxyproline (2S, 4S) is found in the toxic cyclic peptides from Amanita mushrooms (e.g., alpha-amanitin and phalloidin) { Wieland, T.
