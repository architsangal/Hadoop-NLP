The new model, which would have been badged as the Rover 55, was planned to be built in the Longbridge plant alongside the New Mini, and BMW were granted a £152 million subsidy by the British government to refurbish the plant. In 2000, development was close to completion, but after BMW sold the Rover Group, the project&apos;s rights were taken by BMW, which stopped the project and kept the only working prototype in their headquarters of Munich.
