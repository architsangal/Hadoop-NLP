First published January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by and created to compete with the already established Buck Rogers adventure strip. Also inspired by these series were comics such as Dash Dixon (1935 to 1939) by H.T. Elmo and Larry Antoinette and Don Dixon and the Hidden Empire (1935 to 1941) by Carl Pfeufer and Bob Moore. [ June 2008 ] In Australia, the character and strip were retitled Speed Gordon to avoid a negative connotation of the word &quot; Flash &quot;. { p.42 Burrows, Toby &amp; Stone, Grant Comics in Australia and New Zealand 1994 Routledge } At the time, the predominant meaning of &quot; flash &quot; was &quot; showy &quot;, connoting dishonesty.

Dale Arden was named Camille in the French translation. In Mexico and some countries in Latin America, the strip is called &quot; Roldán el Temerario &quot;. The Flash Gordon comic strip has been translated into a wide variety of media, including motion pictures, television and animated series. The latest version, a &apos;&apos;Flash Gordon&apos;&apos; TV series, appeared on the US Sci Fi Channel in 2007 –2008 and then on the United Kingdom Sci Fi Channel. A print comic book series by Brendan Deneen and Paul Green and published by Ardden Entertainment debuted in 2008, with the first arc entitled &quot; The Mercy Wars &quot;, and is also available on iTunes for the iPod and iPhone. These were followed by further storylines. [ Characters and story ] Alex Raymond&apos;s &apos;&apos;Flash Gordon&apos;&apos; (February 25, 1934) The comic strip follows the adventures of Flash Gordon, a handsome polo player and Yale graduate, and his companions Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov. The story begins with Earth bombarded by fiery meteors. Dr. Zarkov invents a rocket ship to locate their place of origin in outer space. Half mad, he kidnaps Flash and Dale, whose plane has crashed in the area, and the three travel to the planet Mongo, where they discover the meteors are weapons devised by Ming the Merciless, evil ruler of Mongo. For many years, the three companions have adventures on Mongo, traveling to the forest kingdom of Arboria, ruled by Prince Barin; the ice kingdom of Frigia, ruled by Queen Fria; the jungle kingdom of Tropica, ruled by Queen Desira; the undersea kingdom of the Shark Men, ruled by King Kala; and the flying city of the Hawkmen, ruled by Prince Vultan. They are joined in several early adventures by Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Eventually, Ming is overthrown, and Mongo is ruled by a council of leaders led by Barin. Flash and friends return to Earth and have some adventures before returning to Mongo and crashing in the kingdom of Tropica, before reuniting with Barin and others. Flash and his friends would travel to other worlds and frequently return to Mongo, where Prince Barin, married to Ming&apos;s daughter Princess Aura, has established a peaceful rule (except for frequent revolts led by Ming or by one of his many descendants). The long story of the Skorpii War takes Flash to other star systems, using starships that are faster than light.

It is Raymond&apos;s work, particularly his Sunday strip s, that are the most prized and reprinted. They have seen print from a number of publishers, notably Nostalgia Press, Kitchen Sink Press and Checker Book Publishing Group. The Mac Raboy Sundays have been reprinted by Dark Horse Comics in black and white, while Kitchen Sink began to collect both the Dan Barry and Austin Briggs daily strips. Those stories written by noted author Harry Harrison were reprinted in Comics Revue magazine, published by Manuscript Press. Tempo Books published 6 mass-market paperbacks reprinting strips from the 1970s in the 1980s.

[ Films ] Most of the Flash Gordon film and television adaptations retell the early adventures on the planet Mongo. [ Film serials ] [ Flash Gordon (serial) ] [ Flash Gordon&apos;s Trip to Mars ] [ Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe ] Flash Gordon was featured in three serial film s starring Buster Crabbe : Flash Gordon (1936), Flash Gordon&apos;s Trip to Mars (1938), and Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940). The 1936 Flash Gordon serial was condensed into a feature-length film titled Flash Gordon or Rocket Ship or Space Soldiers or Flash Gordon: Spaceship to the Unknown; [ 27624 ] the 1938 serial into a feature-length film entitled Flash Gordon: The Deadly Ray from Mars and the 1940 serial into a feature-length film entitled The Purple Death from Outer Space.

Riding the coattails of Star Wars, Superman, and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Flash Gordon was not a critical success on release, but the film has been buoyed by its later cult -status, and is particularly lauded for the calibre of both its score and supporting cast, which featured many notable actors. Melody Anderson co-starred with Jones as Dale Arden, alongside Chaim Topol as Dr. Hans Zarkov, Max von Sydow as Ming, Timothy Dalton as Prince Barin, Brian Blessed as Prince Vultan, Peter Wyngarde as Klytus and Ornella Muti as Princess Aura. Produced by Dino De Laurentiis, with extraordinarily ornate production designs and costumes by Danilo Donati, the bright colors and retro effects were inspired directly by the comic strip and 1930s serials. Brian Blessed &apos;s performance as the Hawkman Prince Vultan lodged the veteran stage and screen actor into the collective consciousness for the utterance of a single line   – &quot; GORDON&apos;S ALIVE?! &quot;   – which, nearly 30 years later, remains the most repeated, reused, and recycled quotation from both the film and Blessed&apos;s career. { &quot; Brian Blessed &quot; at the BBC&apos;s H2G2.

The first 26 episodes had the distinction of being filmed in West Berlin, Germany less than a decade after the end of World War II. This is notable, given that some episodes show the real-life destruction still evident in Germany several years after the war. The final 13 episodes were filmed in Marseille, France. In this series, Flash, Dale ( Irene Champlin ), and Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) worked for the Galactic Bureau of Investigation in the year 3203. The actual timeline was established in one episode, &quot; Deadline at Noon &quot;, in which Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarkov went back in time to Berlin in the year 1953. The GBI agents traveled in the Skyflash and Skyflash II spaceships. The series was syndicated, appearing on stations affiliated with the long-defunct DuMont Network, and many other independent stations in the United States. Stylistic similarities with the Buster Crabbe films are obvious, and may have been desired by the producers. It was recut into a movie in 1957. [ Flash Gordon animated (1979-80) ] [ The New Adventures of Flash Gordon ] In 1979, Filmation produced an animated series, often referred to as called The New Adventures of Flash Gordon, but is actually titled Flash Gordon. The expanded title was used to distinguish it from previous versions. The project was originally designed as a TV film but NBC decided to change it into an animated series. NBC was unhappy with the serial nature of the first season, as it clashed with their re-run style (details can be found on a documentary included on the DVD), so the second season was much changed and also aimed at a younger audience. Each episode included two stand-alone stories, often featuring a young dragon named Gremlin, introduced for comic relief. Unfortunately, this decision led to a decline in ratings and the show was canceled thereafter. [ Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All (1982) ] [ Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All ] Filmation produced this successful animated television movie, written by Star Trek writer Samuel A. Peeples, before they began their Saturday morning series, but the TV-movie did not actually air until 1982. It was critically well-received, and is considered one of the best film versions of Flash Gordon, though it would never be re-broadcast following its premiere. [ 270950 Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All ] This movie has yet to be commercially released in the United States, although some sources indicate that off-air bootlegs are prevalent. The only known commercial releases were by VAP Video in Japan (catalog #67019-128), c. 1983, in both laser disc and NTSC VHS videotape formats and in Bulgaria, where it was released on VHS &quot; Van Chris &quot; and &quot; Drakar &quot;. The movie also aired numerous times on &quot; Diema &quot; Channel in the late 90s. In the Japanese release it is presented uncut with the original English voice track, with Japanese subtitles added for its intended audience. At the end of the movie is a trailer for the De Laurentiis live-action movie, as well as trailers for other titles from the VAP Video library at the time. The covers for both versions feature comic-strip panels, using stills taken from the movie. Its last listing was in VAP Video&apos;s catalog for 1983. [ July 2008 ] [ Defenders of the Earth (1986) ] [ Defenders of the Earth ] In the 1986 cartoon Defenders of the Earth, Flash teamed up with fellow King Features heroes The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician in 65 episodes. This series took extreme liberties with all the characters, revealing that Flash and Dale Arden had conceived a son, Rick Gordon, who is in his mid-teens when the series begins. Dale has her mind torn from her body by Ming in the first episode and is preserved in a crystal, which Rick is able to recover and give to his father. Dale is reborn on Earth as Dynak-X, the strategic super-computer based in the Defenders&apos; Headquarters. [ Flash Gordon (1996) ] [ Flash Gordon (1996 TV series) ] In 1996, Hearst Entertainment premiered an animated Flash Gordon television series. This version turned Flash and Dale into hoverboard ing teenagers. [ Flash Gordon (2007-08 live-action) ] [ Flash Gordon (2007 TV series) ] The Sci Fi Channel premiered its new Flash Gordon series in the United States on August 10, 2007. On January 12, 2007 at the Television Critics Association tour, it was announced that the live-action series would comprise 22 one-hour episodes, produced in Canada in early 2007. Under an agreement with King Features Syndicate, the series was produced by Reunion Pictures of Vancouver with Robert Halmi Sr. and Robert Halmi Jr. of RHI Entertainment serving as Executive Producers. The characters of Ming, Dale Arden, and Dr. Hans Zarkov were drastically altered. Eric Johnson, best known for his earlier work on the WB&apos;s Smallville, played the title character of Steven &quot; Flash &quot; Gordon. Gina Holden (who has appeared in Fantastic Four and Aliens vs. Predator ) played Dale Arden, Dr. Hans Zarkov played by Jody Racicot ( Night at the Museum ), and John Ralston portrayed the arch-villain, Ming. In this version of the series, Flash&apos;s actual name is &quot; Steven Gordon &quot;, with &quot; Flash &quot; being a nickname. Advertisements featured a cover version of Queen &apos;s &quot; Flash&apos;s Theme &quot; (from the 1980 film) performed by the band Louis XIV. The song was not present in any episode of the show, however. The show was canceled officially in early 2008. [ Radio serials ] Starting April 22, 1935, the strip was adapted into The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon, a 26-episode weekly radio serial. The series followed the strip very closely, amounting to a week-by-week adaptation of the Sunday strip for most of its run. Flash Gordon was played by Gale Gordon, later famous for his television roles in Our Miss Brooks, Dennis the Menace, The Lucy Show and Here&apos;s Lucy (the latter two with Lucille Ball ). The cast also included Maurice Franklin as Dr. Zarkov and Bruno Wick as Ming the Merciless. [ http://www.audio-classics.com/ltheamazinginterplanetary.html Audio Classics Archive: The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon Audio-classics.com 2010-12-14 ] The radio series broke with the strip continuity in the last two episodes, when Flash, Dale and Zarkov returned to Earth. They make a crash landing in Africa, where they meet Jungle Jim, the star of another of Alex Raymond&apos;s comic strips. The series ended on October 26, 1935 with Flash and Dale&apos;s marriage. The next week, The Adventures of Jungle Jim picked up in that Saturday timeslot. Two days later, on October 28, The Further Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon debuted as a daily show, running five days a week. This series strayed further from Raymond&apos;s strip, involving Flash, Dale and Zarkov in an adventure in Atlantis. The series aired 74 episodes, ending on February 6, 1936. { &quot; Radio Science Fiction: Information and Help to the New Collector &quot;, by Terry G.G. Salmonson.

It featured: Flash as a washed up basketball player who finds new purpose in life on Mongo, Dale as an adventurous reporter who is just as capable as Flash, and a gray-skinned Ming who is less of an Asian stereotype. The series ran for the planned nine issues and was left with an open-ended conclusion. Though Mongo was not a threat to Earth in this series, Ming had every intention of conquering Earth once he coerced Dr. Zarkov into designing the needed ships. In 1995, Marvel Comics did a two-issue series with art by Al Williamson in the style of the Flash comics he had produced for King and others. A new comic book series was released by Ardden Entertainment in August 2008, though with inconsistent release dates for subsequent issues. The initital story arc concluded in mid-2009 with an open door to an announced new story arc to begin fall 2009.

Ardden&apos;s second Flash Gordon arc is currently entitled Invasion of the Red Sword (2010). A reprint of all of Al Williamson&apos;s Flash Gordon comic books in black and white was printed by Flesk in 2009. In 2010, Dark Horse Comics began an archive reprint series in hardback, starting with the original comics published by Dell. The second volume covers the comics published by King Comics, the third covers the comics published by Charlton Comics, the fourth covers the comics published by Gold Key, and the fifth covers the comics published by Whitman. In 2011, Dynamite Entertainment began a new series called Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist. The series is written by Eric Trautmann (Vampirella, Red Sonja), from a story and designs by Alex Ross (Kingdom Come, Marvels, Project: Superpowers) and illustrated by Daniel Lindro. [ Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine ] &apos;&apos;Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine&apos;&apos; (1936) In 1936, one issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine was published by Harold Hersey, featuring a novel about Flash Gordon, entitled The Master of Mars. It was written by little-known author James Edison Northford. The saddle-stitched novel was based (more or less) on the comic strip story lines, and included color illustrations reminiscent of Alex Raymond&apos;s artwork. On the back pages a second installment, The Sun Men of Saturn, was promised, but it never saw print. Even though the series did not gain in popularity, the lone issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine has become a much sought-after item for pulp magazine collectors. [ Novels ] The first novel based on the strip, Flash Gordon in the Caverns of Mongo, was published in 1936 by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. The credited author was Alex Raymond. Like the pulp magazine of the same year, it failed to launch a series. In 1973, Avon books launched a six-book series of adult-oriented Flash Gordon novels: The Lion Men of Mongo, The Plague of Sound, The Space Circus, The Time Trap of Ming XIII, The Witch Queen of Mongo and The War of the Cybernauts. Although the books were credited to Alex Raymond, they were all written by SF writer Ron Goulart. In 1980, Tempo books released a series by David Hagberg : Massacre in the 22nd Century, War of the Citadels, Crisis on Citadel II, Forces from the Federation, Citadels under Attack and Citadels on Earth. Except for the names of the hero and his co-stars of Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov, this series had little to do with any other version of Flash Gordon. [ 1939 World&apos;s Fair ] The name &quot; Flash Gordon &quot; was emblazoned on the proscenium of a ride at the 1939 New York World&apos;s Fair. An article in Popular Science (March 1939) described how 150 people could enter a ride designed to resemble a rocket ship with a motion picture screen and vibrating seats for a simulated trip to another planet. The ride was located &quot; at the opposite end of the amusement zone from the parachute tower &quot;. Fairgoers walked around a simulation of Venus as a jungle planet, inhabited by mechanical dinosaurs to enter a &quot; Martian Headquarters &quot;, where &quot; weirdly costumed Martians and mechanically animated models of giant beasts enact[ed] episodes from the adventures of Flash Gordon &quot;. The ride&apos;s Martians did not look like those in the 1938 serial, however, nor did the rocket ship. { &quot; World&apos;s Fair Thrills &quot;, Popular Science.
