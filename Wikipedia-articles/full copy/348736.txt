[ Biography ] Smith was born Chadwick Smith on October 25, 1961 in Saint Paul, Minnesota but spent most of his childhood in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan where he attended Andover High School and graduated from Lahser High School in 1980. Following high school, Smith spent his time playing in many local bands and the local club scene. It wasn&apos;t until 1988 when Smith decided to fly to California to visit his brother that his life changed. While in California, Smith was one of the last drummers to audition for the vacant spot left open by D. H. Peligro in the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Smith completely blew the other three band members away with his aggressive drumming, although Smith&apos;s personal style and background of hard rock and motorcycles didn&apos;t completely mesh with the other three, who came from a punk rock background. Singer Anthony Kiedis hired Smith to be in the band although he insisted that he needed to get rid of his bandana and long hair. The following day, Smith showed up for another audition wearing the same bandanna and sporting the same long hair. Kiedis admired Smith and found his persistence pretty impressive. [ April 2012 ] Smith joined the Chili Peppers in December 1988 and within a few months was recording his first album with the band, Mother&apos;s Milk. Smith reflected on joining the band in a 2012 interview by saying “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, cool, they have a record deal. Great! I’d love to be in a band that has a record deal. We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically. I was like, ‘Man, this is a blast! These guys are great!’ … We were just doing what we do. We just jammed, which is what we still do today. It’s very similar.” [ http://stadium-arcadium.com/30-03-2012/chad-smith-red-hot-chili-peppers-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-induction-gary-graff-article/red-hot-chili-peppers-news/article17340 Chad Smith talks about the Red Hot Chili Peppers induction into the Hall of Fame in 2012 Stadium-arcadium.com 2012-03-30 2012-04-03 ] In 2008, during a break for the Chili Peppers, Smith joined the hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot.
