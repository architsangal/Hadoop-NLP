The role of letters in communication has changed significantly since the nineteenth century. Historically, letters (in paper form) were the only reliable means of communication between two persons in different locations. As communication technology has diversified, posted letters have become less important as a routine form of communication; they however still remain but in a modified form. For example, the development of the telegraph shortened the time taken to send a letter by transferring the letter as an electrical signal (for example in Morse code ) between distant points. At the telegraph office closest to the destination of the letter, the signal was transferred back into a hardcopy format and sent as a normal mail to the person&apos;s home. This allowed the normal speed of communication to be drastically shortened for larger and larger distances. This required specialised technicians to encode and decode the letter. The facsimile (fax) machine took this one step further: an entire letter could be completely transferred electrically from the sender&apos;s house to the receiver&apos;s house by means of the telephone network as an image. Today, the Internet is becoming (or has become) the predominant medium for sending letters. The term e-mail, meaning electronic mail, has entered into everyday speech. By analogy, the term letter is sometimes used for e-mail messages with a formal letter-like format. (And regular letters, since they take longer, are often called &quot; snail-mail. &quot; ) Historically, letters exist from the time of ancient India, ancient Egypt and Sumer, through Rome, Greece and China, up to the present day. Letters make up several of the books of the Bible. Archives of correspondence, whether for personal, diplomatic, or business reasons, serve as primary source s for historian s. [ The study of letter writing ] Due to the timelessness and universality of letter writing, there is a wealth of letters and instructional materials (for example, manuals, as in the medieval ars dictaminis ) on letter writing throughout history. The study of letter writing usually involves both the study of rhetoric and grammar. { Carol Poster and Linda C.

This is because of three main advantages: No special device needed - almost everybody has a residence or other place at which he or she can receive mail. A mailbox is all that the intended recipient needs - unlike e-mail or phone calls, where the intended recipient needs access to a computer and an e-mail account or a telephone respectively. &quot; Catch-all &quot; advertising- unlike e-mails, where the recipient needs an individual e-mail address to receive messages, individuals are not necessarily chosen, by rather can widely cover many or all addresses in a given locality. Physical record - important messages that need to be retained (e.g. invoices; government notification such as tax or immigration) can be kept relatively easily and securely. [ The letter-delivering process ] Here is how a letter gets from the sender to the recipient: Sender writes letter and places it in an envelope on which the recipient&apos;s address is written in the centre front of the envelope. Sender ensures that the recipient&apos;s address includes the Zip or Postal (if applicable) code and often he includes his return address on the envelope. Sender buys a postage stamp and attaches it to the front of the envelope on the top right corner on the front of the envelope. Sender puts the letter in a postbox. The national postal service for the sender&apos;s country (e.g., the Royal Mail, UK; US Postal Service, US; Australia Post in Australia; or Canada Post in Canada ) empties the postbox and takes all the contents to the regional sorting office. The sorting office then sorts each letter by address and postcode and delivers the letters destined for a particular area to that area&apos;s post office. Letters addressed to a different region are sent to that region&apos;s sorting office, to be sorted further. The local post office dispatches the letters to their delivery personnel who deliver them to the appropriate addresses. This whole process, depending on how far the sender is from the recipient, can take anywhere from a day to 3–4 weeks. International mail is sent via trains and plane s to other countries.
