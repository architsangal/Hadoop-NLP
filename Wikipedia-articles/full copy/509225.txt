It is home to the NFL &apos;s Chicago Bears. It reopened on September 29, 2003 after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium&apos;s history). With the current stadium capacity of 61,500, Soldier Field is the smallest stadium in the NFL. [ February 2012 ] See List of current National Football League stadiums. [ History ] [ Origin of name and design model ] The field serves as a memorial to American soldier s who had died in past wars, hence its name. It was designed in 1919 and completed in the 1920s. It officially opened on October 9, 1924, the 53rd anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire, as Municipal Grant Park Stadium, changing its name to Soldier Field on November 11, 1925. Its formal dedication as Soldier Field was on Saturday, November 27, 1926, during the 29th annual playing of the Army vs Navy game. Its design is modeled on the Greco-Roman architectural tradition, with doric columns rising above the stands. However, after being rebuilt, the modern stands now dwarf the columns. [ Early configuration ] In its earliest configuration, Soldier Field was capable of seating 74,280 spectators and was in the shape of a U. Additional seating could be added along the interior field, upper promenades and on the large, open field and terrace beyond the north endzone, bringing the seating capacity to over 100,000. The largest crowd for any event at Soldier Field is difficult to determine. Please see &quot; Notable Events &quot; below for specific events. [ The Chicago Bears ] Although used as the site for many sporting events and exhibitions, it was not until September 1971 that the Chicago Bears first made it their home. They previously played at Wrigley Field, best known as the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Seating capacity was reduced to 55,701 by building a grandstand in the open end of the U shape. This moved the field closer to both ends at the expense of seating capacity. The goal of this renovation was to move the fans closer to the field. Beginning in 1978, the plank seating was replaced by individual seats with backs and armrests. In 1982, a new press box as well as 60 skyboxes were added to the stadium, boosting capacity to 66,030. Fifty-six more skyboxes were added in 1988, increasing capacity to 66,946. Capacity was slightly increased to 66,950 in 1992. By 1994, capacity was slightly reduced to 66,944.

Grass returned for the 1988 football season. The field features many memorials to past Bears heroes. It is said that it has twice as many memorials than any other stadium. [ January 2011 ] [ Renovation and delisting ] Aerial view from 2002, showing Soldier Field with interior demolished. View of east side and marina Soldier Field before a soccer match. In 2001, the Chicago Park District, which owns the structure, faced substantial criticism when it announced plans to alter the stadium by architect Dirk Lohan, the grandson of architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, of the Chicago-based architecture firm of Lohan Associates in a joint venture with architect Benjamin T. Wood of the Boston-based architecture firm Wood &amp; Zapata. Dozens of articles by writers and columnists attacked the project as an aesthetic, political, and financial nightmare. Seldom has a project received such universally negative reviews. In addition to a groundswell of criticism by civic and preservation groups, the architecture community was withering in its comments. &quot; A fiasco, &quot; said Stanley Tigerman.

Nobody has copied it; nobody has learned from it. People like it for nostalgic reasons. They remember the games and parades and tractor pulls and veterans&apos; affairs they&apos;ve seen there over the years. I wouldn&apos;t do this if it were the Parthenon. But this isn&apos;t the Parthenon, &quot; Lohan said. On September 23, 2004, as a result of the 2003 renovation, a 10-member federal advisory committee unanimously recommended that Soldier Field be delisted as a National Historic Landmark.

Ahlgren was quoted in Preservation Online as stating that &quot; if we had let this stand, I believe it would have lowered the standard of National Historic Landmarks throughout the country, &quot; and, &quot; If we want to keep the integrity of the program, let alone the landmarks, we really had no other recourse. &quot; The stadium lost the Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.

[ http://www.soldierfield.net/content/stadium-field-rental Soldier Field ] The current design of the stadium, with the Greek style columns being the primary remnant of the older facility, has prompted some fans to refer to the stadium as the &quot; Spaceship on Soldier Field &quot;.

Also with the renovation, the front row 50-yard line seats are now only 55 feet away from the sidelines. This was the shortest distance of all NFL stadiums, until MetLife Stadium opened in 2010, with a distance of 46 feet. [ February 2012 ] In May 2012, the stadium became the first NFL stadium to achieve LEED status. { http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=8842 } [ Public transportation ] The closest Chicago &apos;L&apos; station to Soldier Field is the Roosevelt/Wabash station on the Orange, Green and Red lines. The Chicago Transit Authority also operates the #128 Soldier Field Express bus route to the stadium from Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station. There are also two Metra stations close by—the Museum Campus/11th Street station on the Metra Electric and South Shore lines, and 18th Street, which is only on the Metra Electric Line. Pace also provides access from the Northwest, West and Southwest suburbs to the stadium with four express routes from Schaumburg, Lombard, Bolingbrook, Burr Ridge, Palos Heights and Oak Lawn.

Louisville won 26 –0. ( Chicago Tribune, October 2, 1924) Over 100,000 spectators attended the 1926 Army/Navy Game, this game would decide the national championship, as Navy entered undefeated and Army had lost only to Notre Dame. For once, the game lived up to all of the pre-game hoop-la, and even though the game ended in a 21–21 tie, Navy was awarded the national championship. The all-time collegiate attendance record of 123,000 plus was established November 26, 1927, as Notre Dame beat the University of Southern California 7–6. Over 15,000 spectators attend the first leg of the 1928 National Challenge Cup (now known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup ) between soccer teams Bricklayers and Masons F.C. of Chicago and New York Nationals of New York City. The match ended in 1–1 tie, and New York won the second leg 3–0 in New York City Austin beats Leo to win 1937 Prep Bowl; another contender for the highest attendance ever (estimated at over 120,000 spectators). The Chicago Prep Bowl games are held here, every year the day after Thanksgiving. The bowl game is older than the IHSA state championship tournament held since the 1960s. The stadium was the site of the former College All-Star Game, an exhibition between the last year&apos;s NFL champion (or, in its final years, Super Bowl champion) and a team of collegiate all-star players of the previous season prior to their reporting to the training camps of their new professional teams. This game was discontinued after the 1976 NFL season. The final game in 1976 was halted in the third quarter when a torrential thunderstorm broke out and play was never resumed. Aerial view of the stadium Four NFC Championship Game s have been held at the stadium. The 1985 NFC Championship Game took place in Soldier Field, where the Bears defeated the Los Angeles Rams 24 –0. The 1988 NFC Championship Game took place here, where the Bears lost to eventual Super Bowl XXIII champions San Francisco 49ers 28 –3. The 2006 NFC Championship Game granted the Bears their second trip to the Super Bowl, the first in 21 years, with a 39 –14 victory over the New Orleans Saints.
