[ History ] The word Bonnaroo, popularized by New Orleans R &amp; B singer Dr. John with his 1974 album Desitively Bonnaroo, [ Dougherty Steve Dr. John&apos;s Unlikely New Partner The Wall Street Journal March 30, 2012 D4 ] means &quot; a really good time. &quot; It is a Ninth Ward slang construction taken from the French &quot; bon &quot; meaning &quot; good, &quot; and &quot; rue &quot; from the French &quot; street, &quot; translating to &quot; the best on the streets. &quot; { &quot; Jon Pareles at the Bonnaroo Music Festival &quot; The New York Times 19 January 2006 } The name was chosen both for its literal meaning and to honor the rich Louisiana music tradition. The first Bonnaroo took place in 2002 and took inspiration from music festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury. With no traditional advertising, the festival sold out in nearly two weeks. By 2003, the festival had been named by Rolling Stone as one of the top 50 moments in rock &amp; roll. Comedy acts like Jim Breuer were first added in 2005. In 2007, Bonnaroo purchased the land for the festival, creating Great Stage Park with all of its iconic features. A permanent main stage was installed in 2010. { Buchanan, Leigh. Superfly Presents.

The following are a few of the more permanent venues. Which Stage at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN. Centeroo - The Central area of Bonnaroo. Serviced by two main entrances, nearly all of the festival activity is enclosed in this area. Various merchants and activities supplement the plethora of music related activities located within Centeroo. While Centeroo is open 24 hours a day, musical artists generally only play from noon until the evening, followed by the unopposed headlining act. Afterwards, there are late-night sets, usually running from midnight until the early morning, sometimes as late as 5 or 6 AM. What Stage - The main stage of the festival is also the largest. What Stage is open from approximately noon until midnight (late night sets usually over by 3am). Traditionally, the headlining act each day will play on the What Stage with no other acts performing on any other stages. Which Stage - The second stage, Which Stage, is generally one of the last stages to finish before the headlining act each night. After the headlining act performs, a late night show generally follows here. This Tent, That Tent, and The Other Tent - These three tents serve as a combined tertiary tier for musical performances. Late night shows also generally occur in all three of these venues, along with the yearly Superjam, a one-off combination of various musicians performing at the festival. Comedy Tent - This tent is reserved strictly for comedy acts, such as stand up comedians. Various other small tents and stages also exist, such as the Solar Stage, Lunar Stage, Sonic Stage, and the Cinema tent. See the Bonnaroo website for further details on these venues. [ Activities ] { Some graffiti by artist Ryan McCauley on the Graffiti Wall, which separates Centeroo from the campsites. } Available to the Bonnaroo public throughout the week are various activity tents. These tents become most popular with the night crowd, with such activities set up as The Silent Disco tent and several other club or bar-themed venues. In the Silent Disco, each person upon entering the tent is given a set of headphones that syncs with the DJ and the music, so everyone is listening to the same song through the headphones while appearing from the outside to be dancing to no music at all. Other activities include the Comedy Tent where comedians from Mike Birbiglia to Flight of the Conchords have performed. The Cinema tent, showing a variety of mainstream and independent movies, is also popular as it is one of the air conditioned tents, and the Broo’ers Festival tent is a popular attraction featuring a variety of breweries from all over the United States. Outside the big tents, Planet Roo hosts a variety of non-profit organizations sharing information on healthy lifestyles and resource conservation, and Splash-a-Roo (a giant slip-n-slide area) and a giant mushroom fountain provide a practical way to beat the heat. Bonnaroo creators designated the wall surrounding Centeroo, colloquially called &quot; the Graffiti Wall &quot;, as a place for street artists to paint whatever they feel like painting. Activities like these,along with great food vendors and unique shopping, provide an easy and fun way to hang around the Centeroo in between music performances. In 2009, Bonnaroo debuted the Bungaloo, a community art project that invited festival goers to paint a small tile that was then affixed to 10 foot water drops suspended between The Other Tent and This Tent. For each tile painted, the festival-goer could vote for the charity of their choice. Bungaloo, a new online paint company, made a $1000 donation to the charity with the most votes.
