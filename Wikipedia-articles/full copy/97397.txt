[ April 2012 October 2011 October 2011 October 2011 ] In the terminology of Islam, [ ar DIN duʿāʾ ] ( [ دعاء ], plural: [ ar DIN daʿawāt ] [ ar دعوات ]; also transliterated Doowa [ Bombay High Court:Haji Bibi vs H.H. Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah 1 September, 1908 http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1531123/ Russell, High Court of Bombay 26 March 2012 ] ) literally meaning invocation, is an act of supplication. The term is derived from an Arabic word meaning to &apos;call out&apos; or to &apos;summon&apos;, and Muslims regard this as a profound act of worship. This is when Muslim people from all over connect with God and ask him for forgiveness and favors. The Islamic prophet Muhammad is reported to have said &quot; Dua is the very essence of worship, &quot; while one of God &apos;s commands expressed through the Qur&apos;an is for them to call out to Him: [ 40 60 ns ] There is a special emphasis on du&apos;a in Muslim spirituality and early Muslims took great care to record the supplications of Muhammad and transmit them to subsequent generations. [ March 2010 ] These traditions precipitated new genres of literature in which prophetic supplications were gathered together in single volumes that were memorized and taught. Collections such as Imam al-Nawawi &apos;s Kitab al-adhkar and Shams al-Din al-Jazari&apos;s al-Hisn al-Hasin exemplify this literary trend and gained significant currency among Muslim devotees keen to learn how Muhammad supplicated to God. However, Du&apos;a literature is not restricted to prophetic supplications; many later Muslim scholars and sages composed their own supplications, often in elaborate rhyming prose that would be recited by their disciples. Popular du&apos;as would include Jazuli &apos;s Dala&apos;il al-Khayrat, which at its peak spread throughout the Muslim world, and Imam al-Shadhili &apos;s Hizb al-Bahr which also had widespread appeal. [ March 2010 ] Du&apos;a literature reaches its most lyrical form in the Munajat, or &apos;whispered intimate prayers&apos; such as those of Ibn &apos;Ata Allah al-Iskandari. Among the shia schools, the Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya records du&apos;as attributed to Ali and his grandson Zayn al-Abidin. [ muslim yes 35 6505 ] [ bukhari yes 8 75 362 ] [ Types and categories ] Dua is essentially an expression of submission of faith to God and of one&apos;s neediness. Type I: Du&apos;a al-mas&apos;alah, or the &apos;du&apos;a of asking.&apos; This type of du&apos;a is when one asks for the fulfillment of a need, or that some harm be removed from him/her. An example would be when a person asks, &quot; O God! Grant me good in this world, and good in the next life! &quot; Type II: Du&apos;a al-&apos;ibadah, or the &apos;du&apos;a of worship.&apos; This type of du&apos;a represents a very broad concept. In Islam, every single act of worship includes this type of du&apos;a. Examples would include when a Muslim prays salat or gives zakaat or fasts. [ What is asked ] Du&apos;a can also be divided into two broad categories depending on what is being asked. These two categories include religion and the world. Examples of making du&apos;a for religion would include things such as if a Muslim asked God to increase their faith or ask God to forgive them for their sins. Examples pertaining to the world would include things such as if a Muslim asks God for an increase in wealth, to be cured from a disease, or to be granted more children. In Islam, a Muslim is supposed to ask from both these categories. [ Holy Du&apos;a ] [ Holy Du&apos;a ] The Holy Du&apos;a is the obligatory prayer recited five times a day, as described in the Qur&apos;an: &quot; And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that are evil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember (their Lord): &quot; [ April 2012 ] The Holy Du&apos;a is read in the Arabic language. Until the 1950s, Ismaili s from India and Pakistan performed the prayer the language of the local Jamaat. [ 10.1080/02666958708716015 noedit ] [ Duas ] [ section ] [ section March 2012 March 2012 ] 1) A person who recites from [ ar إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ] in Surah Al-Imran till the end of the Surah on any night or part of the night, will receive the reward of performing his Salaat for the whole night. 2) A person recites Surah Yaseen early in the morning then his need for the day will be fullfilled. 3) Abdullah bin Masood narrates that Muhammad has stated that the person who recites the last two ayats of Suratul Baqarah till the end, then these two ayats will be sufficient for him, i.e. Allah will protect him from all evil and ploys. 4) When retiring to sleep, make wudhu, dust off the bed three times, lie on the right side, place the right hand under the head or cheeks and recite the following dua three times. 5) A person who recites three times [ ar أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ ] in the morning the last three ayats of Suratul Hashr then Allah delegates 70,000 angles to send mercy onto him till the evening and if he dies that day, he will die as a martyr and if he recites these in the evening then Allah delegates 70,000 angels to send mercy onto him till the morning and if he dies that night, he dies as martyr. 6) A Muslim servant recites (the underlying) three times every morning, then it becomes the responsibility of God to satisfy him on the Day of Qiyamah. [ ar رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبَّاً وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ ِينَاً وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ نَبِيَّاً ] 7) A person who has recited (the underlying) in the morning, he has pleased (praised, glorified) God for His favours of the morning, and if he has done so in the night, he has thanked Allah for His favours of the night. [ ar اللَّهُمَّ مَا أَصْبَحَ بِي مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ أَوْ بِأَحَدٍ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ فَمِنْكَ وَحْدَكَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ فَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ وَلَكَ الشُّكْرُ ] 8) If a person recites three ayats of Surah Rum (Para 21) and if he misses his normal recitation of the day, he will still be rewarded for it. This applies to the night as well. 9) If after reading it you die in the night, then it is as if you have died on &apos;Natural Deen&apos; and if you awake in the morning alive then you will have good fortune &quot;. 10) If a person retires to bed on the side and recites Surah Fathiha and Surah Ikhlaas (Qul huwa- Allaho Ahad) he is immune from everything besides death. 11) Reciting Ayat-ul Kursi will cause the reciter to be protected throughout the night by the angels and the Satan will not come near him. 12) When a person enters his bed (to sleep), an angel and a Shaitaan surround him. The Shaitaan whispers &apos;your awakening will end in evil&apos; and the angel says&apos; end in good &quot;. One sleeps after engaging in dhikr, the angels will protect him throughout the night. In order to gain the protection of the angels, it is encouraged to engage in Dhikr and then sleep. 13) A man saw the Holy Prophet many a time in his dreams. Every time he requested the Holy Prophet to advise him, what to do so that he might leave this world with his faith intact. The Holy Prophet in reply advised him to recite the following Dua’a every day. In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! The Security, the Security the Security from the vanishment of the faith. O the Eternally Known! O the Eternally Obliging and O the Guide of those gone astray, Thee alone do we worship and of Thee (only) do we seek help. May Allah’s blessings be upon His best creation Mohammed and all his (pure) progeny. 14) The following Dua’a in its context with its meaning seems to be very effective and advantageous. Many a learned persons recite this in the Qunoot and many recite it after finishing the prayer: [ ar صُلَحَآئِكَ وَ بِمُنَاجَاتِ فُقَرَآئِكَ نَسْئَلُكَ زِيَادَةً فِيْ الْعِلْمِ وَصِحَّةً فِيْ الْجِسْمِ وَ طُوْلاً فِيْ الْعُمْرِ فِيْ طَاعَتِكَ وَ سِعَةً فِيْ الرِّزْقِ وَ تَوْبَةً قَبْلَ الْمَوْتِ وَ رَاحَةً عِنْدَ الْمَوْتِ وَ مَغْفِرَةً بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ وَ نُوْرًا فِيْ الْقَبْرِ وَ نَجَاةً مِّنَ النَّارِ وَ دُخْوْلًا فِيْ الْجَنَّةِ وَ عَافِيَةً مِنْ كُلِّ بَلَآءِ الدُّنْيَا وَعَذَابِ الْآخِرَةِ بِحَقِّ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ الطَّيِّبِيْنَ الطَّاهِرِيْنَ. ] Transliteration: Elaahee be-akhasse sefaateka wa be-I’zze jalaaleka wa be-a-a’zame asmaaa-eka wa be-I’smate ambeyaaa-eka wa be-noore awleyaaa-eka wa bedame shohadaaa-eka wa be-medaade o’lamaaa-eka wa be-do-a’aa-e solahaaa-eka wa be-monaajaate foqaraaa-eka nas-aloka zeyaadatan fil I’lme wa sehhatan fil jisme wa toolan fil o’mre fee taa-a’teka wa se-a’tan fir-rizqe wa tawbatan qablal mawte wa raahatan I’ndal mawte Wa maghferatn ba’dal mawte wa nooran fil-qabre wa najaatam menan naare wa dokhoolan fil jannate wa a’afeyatan min kulle balaaa-id dunyaa wa a’zaabil aakherate Be-haqqe mohammadin wa ahle baytehit tayyebeenat taahereen.

[ Zayn al-Abidin&apos;s Dua ] Zayn al-Abidin conveyed his understanding of the relationship between human and God by the prayers and supplications that he offered God during his extensive nighttime vigils in the mosque of Muhammad in Medina. These prayers and supplications were written down and then disseminated by his sons and the subsequent generations. Among them is the Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, which is known as the Psalms [ #F0FFF0 An extract of Dua Abu Hamza al-Thumali by Zayn al-Abidin : All Praise is for Allah who treats me with clemency, just as if I have no sin. So my Lord is the most praised by me of all, and most worthy of my praise. O&apos; Allah! I find the roads of wishes to You wide open, And the rivers of hope to You vast and running, And counting on Your bountifulness (in times of need) for those who wished You freely accessible, And the gates of prayer to those who are disparate, wide ajar, And I know that You are for those who ask You in the position of answer, And for those who are distressed, You are in a posture of rescue. ] [ The Pre-Conditions ] In Islam there are nine pre-conditions that need to be present in order for a du&apos;a to be accepted. [ March 2012 ] [ Only Allah responds ] This first pre-condition can be supported by the following verse in the Quran. In Sura h Al-Naml Verse 62: Or, Who listens to the [soul] distressed when it calls on Him, and Who relieves its suffering, and makes you inheritors of the earth? So is there any god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed! { Quran Surah 27 Verse 62 } Muhammad said: “If you ask, then ask of Allah, and if you seek help, then seek the help of Allah.” [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2516] Abu Hurayrah reported Muhammad as saying: “Make Dua to Allah when you are certain of a response.” [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi] [ Sincerity ] This is basically summed up in one sentence: in Islam a Muslim prays to God alone. This can be supported by several verses in the Quran. In Sura h Al-Jinn Verse 18 it says:&apos;&apos; &quot; And the places of worship are for God [alone]: So invoke not any one along with God;&apos; { Quran Surah 72 Verse 18 } In Sura h Al-An&apos;am Verse 40 it says:Say: &quot; Think ye to yourselves, if there come upon you the wrath of God, or the Hour [that ye dread], would ye then call upon other than God?- [reply] if ye are truthful! { Quran Surah 6 Verse 40 } In Sura h Al-A&apos;raf Verse 194 it says:Verily those whom ye call upon besides God are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are [indeed] truthful! { Quran Surah 7 Verse 194 } In Sura h Al-A&apos;raf Verse 197 it says: &quot; But those ye call upon besides Him, are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves. &quot; { Quran Surah 7 Verse 197 } [ Tawassul ] The term Tawassul means the seeking of God&apos;s help and response through something beloved to Him. There are many ways of performing Tawassul, as mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, one may make mention of the names and attributes of God (See 99 Names of Allah ) or a good deed one has done, a blessed time such as Ramadhan. One could also ask someone alive to make du&apos;a to God on one&apos;s behalf. [ Patience ] In Islam, to be hasty in du&apos;a is said to be a cause of rejection of du&apos;a. The concept of hastiness is described in the following hadith. It was asked, &quot; O Messenger of God?...What does it mean to be hasty? &quot; Prophet Muhammad responded &quot; A worshipper says, &apos;I have prayed and prayed, and I don&apos;t yet see that it will be accepted; so he gives up hope of being answered, and leaves du&apos;a&apos;. { Hadith narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, as mentioned in sahih al-Jami #7705 } Basically this means that a person makes du&apos;a and it does not get answered right away so a person gives up and stops asking for it. The type of hastiness that is forbidden in Islam is that a person leaves du&apos;a, thinking that God will not respond to it. In Islam, Muslims are instructed to not give up du&apos;a because they do not see a response immediately. This can be supported by verses in the Quran and Hadiths. In Sura h Al-Anbiya Verse 19 it says: Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary; { Quran Surah 21 Verse 19 } Muhammad is reported to have said: &quot; You will be responded to as long as you are not hasty (meaning that you give up du&apos;a) &quot; { Hadith narrated by al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud and others, from abu Hurayrah, as mentioned in sahih al-Jami #8085 } The word hasty is used because it means that a person is hasty in expecting a response. [ Purity ] In Islam, in order for a person&apos;s du&apos;a to be accepted by God, it must be for something pure and good. [ Good Intentions ] In Islam it is imperative that a person making du&apos;a have the best of intention for whatever he or she is asking. An example would be if someone asks for an increase in wealth, they should intend with that increase in wealth to spend more on the poor and on their relatives. [ Attentive Heart ] Muhammad is reported to have said, &quot; Make du&apos;a to God in a state that you are certain that your du&apos;a will be responded to, and know that God does not respond to a du&apos;a that originates from a negligent, inattentive heart &quot; &apos;&apos; { Hadith narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim from Abu-Hurayrah and authenticated by al-Albani in sahih al-Jami } According to this hadith, a Muslim is instructed to make du&apos;a with a mindful heart. A Muslim should be aware of what he is saying and should believe in his or her heart that their du&apos;a will be responded to by God. [ Sustenance ] It states in the Quran in Sura h Al-Baqarah Verse 200: So when ye have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises of God, as ye used to celebrate the praises of your fathers,- yea, with far more Heart and soul. There are men who say: &quot; Our Lord! Give us (Thy bounties) in this world! &quot; but they will have no portion in the Hereafter. { Quran Surah 2 Verse 200 } Again and moreover Muhammad is reported to have said, &quot; O People! God is al-Tayyib (pure), and He only accepts that which is pure! God has commanded the Messengers, for He said, &apos;O Messengers! Eat from the pure foods, and do right.&apos; Furthermore he said, &apos;O you who believe! Eat from the pure and good foods we have given you.&apos; Then Prophet Hazrat Muhammad mentioned a traveller on a long journey, who is dishevelled and dusty, and he stretches forth his hands to the sky, saying, &apos;O my Lord! O my Lord!&apos;, While his food is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, his clothing is unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully; how can he be answered? &quot; { Hadith reported by Ahmad, Muslim, and al-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah, as mentioned in sahih al-Jami #2744 } The Hadith above describes a man who earned his money by cheating other people. His money was impure so therefore everything he purchased with his money became impure. His clothes, drink, and food were all purchased with that money which was considered impure, so his clothes, drink and food were all considered impure. According to the above hadith, in Islam a person&apos;s du&apos;a will not be accepted by God if he earns unlawful money. The hadith also stresses that according to Islam, anyone who eats impure foods, such as pork, will have his or her du&apos;a rejected by God. [ Non-interference ] In Islam there is no specific time of day to which making du&apos;a is restricted. In Islam, if something more important comes up than du&apos;a, then that takes precedence. What is more important than du&apos;a is defined by the Quran and Sunnah. Some examples include the call to prayer. If the adhan is called, in Islam one must respond to it. Another example is if a person is making du&apos;a, and his or her parents call him or her for assistance, then responding to his or her parents takes precedence over du&apos;a. This means a person must stop making du&apos;a when he or she hears the adhan or the parents calling him or her, to respond. In Islam, the rights of the parents are great and are emphasized greatly in the Quran and Hadiths. [ Why Duas are not answered ] There are various reasons due to which Du&apos;as, supplications and invocations are not accepted. [ Authentic or Confirmed reasons ] [ Impatience ] Allah rejects supplications if the worshipper is hasty or does not have patience. It was asked, &quot; O Messenger of God?...What does it mean to be hasty? &quot; Prophet Muhammad responded &quot; A worshipper says, &apos;I have prayed and prayed, and I don&apos;t yet see that it will be accepted; so he gives up hope of being answered, and leaves du&apos;a&apos;. (Hadith narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, as mentioned in sahih al-Jami #7705) It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (Radiallhu Anhu) that the Messenger of Allah said: “(The Dua) of any one of you will be answered so long as he is not hasty in seeking a response and does not say, ‘I prayed but I have not had a response.’” [Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5981; Muslim, 2735] { http://www.alquranclasses.com/?p=754 } { http://www.areweprepared.ca/post/2009/02/01/Why-our-Duaas-are-not-answered.aspx } “A person’s Dua will continue to be answered so long as he does not pray for something sinful or for the breaking of family ties.” Narrated by Muslim. [ Change oneself first ] This aspect is explained in the following verse: [ 13 11 ns ] [ Praising God ] One reported Hadith relates as follows, Once a man said, &quot; O God, forgive me and have mercy and have mercy on me! &quot; This was after the man had finished two raka&apos;ats. Prophet Muhammad said, &quot; You have been hasty, O worshipper! When you finish your prayer, then sit down and praise God with the praise that he is worthy of, and pray upon me, then state your du&apos;a... &quot; { Hadith narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa&apos;i from Fadalah ibn Ubayd and authenticated by Al-albani in Sahih al Jami #3988 } [ If worshipper thinks Dua will not be answered ] Muhammad is reported to have said, &quot; Make du&apos;a to God in a state that you are certain that your du&apos;a will be responded to, and know that God does not respond to a du&apos;a that originates from a negligent, inattentive heart &quot; ( Hadith narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim from Abu-Hurayrah and authenticated by al-Albani in sahih al-Jami ) Not thinking positively of Allah may have invocations unanswered. Muhammad said: “Allah, may He be exalted, says: ‘I am as My slave thinks I am.’” [Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7405; Muslim, 4675] [ Sinful or Haram Income and food ] Muhammad made mention of a person who travels widely, his hair dishevelled, and covered with dust. “He lifts his hands and makes supplication, ‘O Lord, O Lord,’ but his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful, and his nourishment is unlawful. How then can his supplication be accepted?” { http://www.ramadan.com.au/index.php?option=com_content &amp; view=article &amp; id=130 &amp; Itemid=118 } (Similar version in Hadith reported by Ahmad, Muslim, and al-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah, as mentioned in sahih al-Jami #2744)“A person’s Dua will continue to be answered so long as he does not pray for something sinful or for the breaking of family ties.” Narrated by Muslim. [ Asking for something sinful ] Abu Hurayrah (R.A) said that The Messenger of Allah said: “A person’s Dua will continue to be answered so long as he does not pray for something sinful or for the breaking of family ties.” Narrated by Muslim A dua for something that is haram cannot be made and will not be fulfilled. We cannot ask for that which is forbidden in Islam. Such duas would definitely not be answered. Hence for starters we should know that what we are asking for should be halal according to the Islamic Shariah. No one should pray for death. [ Cutting of the ties of kinship ] “A person’s Dua will continue to be answered so long as he does not pray for something sinful or for the breaking of family ties.” Narrated by Muslim. Muhammad said: “The supplication of a slave continues to be granted as long as he does not supplicate for a sinful thing or for something that would cut off the ties of kinship and he does not grow impatient.” [ August 2011 ] [ Making Dua conditional ] The Prophet said: “Let not any one of you say, ‘O Allah, forgive me if You will, O Allah, have mercy on me if You will.’ Let him be resolute in the matter, whilst knowing that no one can compel Allah to do anything.” [Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim] [ Other optional Etiquette ] There are various other optional techniques and etiquettes in the Quran and Sunnah for Du&apos;a. Those who wish to do can do and those who wish to avoid can skip. Listed here are a limited few and just a fraction of ettiquettes of du&apos;a that scholars have found in reference to in the Quran and Sunnah. [ Raising one&apos;s hands ] Raising one&apos;s hands is an encouraged option. There are many hadith that describe how Muhammad raised his hands during du&apos;a. Some hadith describe him having raised his hands way up high in emergency situations. Many scholars agree that if it is not an extreme situation that Muhammad did not raise his hands above his head. The exact manner that many scholars in Islam describe how high the hands should be raised during a regular Du&apos;a is up to the shoulders with palms placed together.Scholars however agree that there are two authentic ways of raising one&apos;s hands: when not in drastic conditions the palms of one&apos;s hands should be turned up facing the skies, whilst the back of one&apos;s hands are facing the ground, then the du&apos;a can be &quot; recited &quot;. One must also make sure to face the Qiblah (direction of prayer), whilst making du&apos;a.The second way agreed upon by scholars is to have the palms facing one&apos;s face; once again one must face the Qiblah, but this time the back of one&apos;s hands should also face the Qiblah. Evidence for facing the Qiblah during du&apos;a can be found in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim- Abdullah ibn Zayd narrated:&apos;The Prophet left (Madinah) to this prayer, seeking rain. So he made a du&apos;a, and asked for rain, then he faced the qiblah and turned his cloak inside-out&apos;Sahih al-Bukhari #6343, Muslim #894 and others [ Facing the Qiblah ] The Qiblah is the direction that Muslims face while performing salah. Facing the Qiblah is an encouraged option. It has been reported in hadith that Muhammad faced the Qiblah while making du&apos;a as narrated in several hadith. [ February 2007 ] There are also well-known [ September 2007 ] Sahih hadith which narrate that it is forbidden to lift one&apos;s eyes towards the sky in prayer. Abu Huraira(ra) reported: People should avoid lifting their eyes towards the sky while supplicating in prayer, otherwise their eyes can be snatched away. { Hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah and Jabir b. Samura, as mentioned in Sahih Muslim (Book of Prayer, chapter 24), #863 and #862 } [ Wiping the Face ] Once the du&apos;a has been completed, it is most common for the supplicant to wipe their face with their hands, and this act signals the end of the du’a. However, this practice is objected to by others, { The Weakness of the Ahaadeeth Mentioning Wiping the Face with the Hands after Du`aa&apos; (Supplication), From Irwaa&apos; al-Ghaleel (2/178-182), by } { Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani } based upon a number of reasons. These reasons include: the wiping of the face is an innovation because there are no authentic hadiths which state that Muhammad ever did it or ordered his followers to do it. { The Weakness of the Ahaadeeth Mentioning Wiping the Face with the Hands after Du`aa&apos; (Supplication), From Irwaa&apos; al-Ghaleel (2/178-182), by } { Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani } Also, in du’a al- Qunut, Muhammad was never reported to have wiped his face after completing the du’a, or to have ordered his followers to do so. Finally, there are many authentic hadiths regarding du’a and none of them mention wiping the face at all.
