In the United States, the Danone brand is marketed as Dannon, a subsidiary of Groupe Danone (under the name The Dannon Company). Besides the Danone/Dannon brand of yogurts, the company owns several internationally known brands of bottled water: Volvic, Evian, and Badoit. About 56% of its 2006 net sales derived from dairy, 28% from beverages, and 16% from biscuits and cereals. [ http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/95/951/95168/items/258892/AnnualReport2006.pdf Danone Annual Report 2006 12 July 2008 PDF ] Danone owns many water brands worldwide. In Asia, it has acquired Yili, Aqua (Indonesia) and Robust (92%) and has a 51% holding in China&apos;s Wahaha Joint Venture Company, giving it a total market share of 20% and making it the leading vendor of packaged water in Asia. [ History ] [ Name ] The original company bearing the corporate name was founded in 1919 by Isaac Carasso in Barcelona as a small factory producing yoghurt. The factory was named Danone, a Catalan diminutive of the name of his first son, Daniel Carasso. Ten years later, the company moved from Spain to neighboring France, and the first French factory was built. During the German occupation of France during World War II, Daniel moved the company to New York to avoid persecution as a result of his Jewish faith. In the United States, Daniel partnered with the Swiss-born Spaniard Joe Metzger and changed the brand name to Dannon to sound more American. In 1951, Daniel Carasso returned to Paris to manage the family&apos;s businesses in France and Spain, and the American business was sold in 1959. In Europe in 1967, Danone merged with Gervais, the leading fresh cheese producer in France and became Gervais Danone. [ Glassmaking tradition ] Another branch of Groupe Danone descended from industrial glassmaker Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel (BSN), which was founded by the family of Antoine Riboud. After a failed attempted takeover battle for its larger rival Saint-Gobain, Riboud transformed it into one of Europe&apos;s leading food groups in the 1970s through a series of acquisitions and mergers, including the 1973 merger with Gervais Danone. [ Strategic reorientation ] Former Danone head office The acquisitions initially took the shape of vertical integration, acquiring Alsacian brewer Kronenbourg and Evian mineral water who were the glassmaker&apos;s largest customers. This move provided content with which to fill the factory&apos;s bottles. [ http://www.danone.com/wps/portal/jump/DanoneCorporateIntl.Company.History.1966_1980 Danone Group History of Success: from bottles to beverages 11 April 2007 ] In 1973, the company merged with Gervais Danone and began to expand internationally. In 1979, the company abandoned glassmaking by disposing of Verreries Boussois. In 1987, Gervais Danone acquired European biscuit manufacturer Général Biscuit, owners of the LU brand, and, in 1989, it bought out the European biscuit operations of Nabisco.

Franck Riboud succeeded his father, Antoine, as the company&apos;s chairman and chief executive officer in 1996 when Riboud senior retired. Under Riboud junior, the company continued to pursue its focus on three product groups (dairy, beverages, and cereals) and divested itself of several activities which had become non-core. In 1999 and 2003, the group sold 56% and 44%, respectively, of its glass-containers business.

[ Protecting Danone ] Due to its narrow focus and relatively small size, Danone is potentially an attractive takeover target for its competitors, namely Nestlé and Kraft Foods.

[ Joint ventures ] Global locations of Groupe Danone factories Danone has adopted a strategy of growth through joint ventures, particularly in fast-growing emerging markets, because it lacked the management depth and size to grow quickly. In its markets, Danone has built an attractive portfolio in emerging markets over the past 10 years which represents 30% of its sales. { James T. Areddy &amp; Deborah Ball, Danone&apos;s China Strategy Is Set Back, } { Wall Street Journal, Page A10, 15 June 2007 } Danone has continued to pursue this strategy and has recently signed joint ventures with companies such as Al Safi in Saudi Arabia (2001), { Al Safi Danone History } Yakult in India (2005) and Vietnam (2006), Alquería in Colombia (2007), and Mengniu in China (2006). Danone has been having problems with some of its other joint ventures, notably its joint venture with Hangzhou Wahaha Group (1996) and Britannia Biscuits in India (1995), which have been in high-profile disputes since early 2007 and 2006, respectively. Danone filed for arbitration with Britannia Biscuits in the Bombay High Court on 29 June; arbitration with the Wahaha Group was accepted in Hangzhou on 17 June 2007. [ India ] Under the 1995 joint venture agreement to acquire Britannia Industries, Danone agreed not to launch food brands within India without the consent of the Wadia family. { Ruth David, Danone&apos;s Indian Cookie JV Set To Snap, Forbes, 25 June 2007 } The partners also agreed on a right of first refusal to the other partner in the event of the other wishing to exit. { Danone may dissolve ties with Britannia, IRIS NEWS DIGEST, 21 June 2007, Retrieved 18 July 2007 } In light of frustrations with the growth and marketing strategy in India, Danone initiated plans to independently invest in an Indian dairy subsidiary. In May 2007, Nusli Wadia told the Ministry of Commerce and Industry that Danone invested in Avesthagen, a Bangalore-based bio-nutrition company, in October 2006 in violation of the government&apos;s Press Note 1, 2005, which requires a foreign company to obtain the consent of its Indian joint venture partner before pursuing an independent business in a similar area, including joint ventures based purely on technical collaboration. Danone argued that Press Note 1 did not apply to it as it did not have a formal technology transfer or trademark agreement with Avesthagen, and that its 25% holding in Britannia was indirect. { Danone denies JV with India&apos;s Britannia; to proceed with solo plans – report, Thomson Financial, 25 May 2007 } Wadia also filed a case in the Bombay High Court for a breach of a non-compete clause in the contract. The court ordered Danone not to alienate, encumber, or sell shares of Avestagen. { Wadias take Danone to court, 5 December 2006 } In September 2007, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board of India rejected Danone&apos;s claims that it does not need a non-compete waiver from the Wadias in order to enter into business in India alone. { Danone needs NOC from Wadias: FIPB, 28 September 2007 } [ Israel ] In March 1996 Danone signed an agreement to purchase 20 percent of the Strauss Group, Israel&apos;s second largest food manufacturer.

The new conglomerate, named Bright Foods, would be managed by the Shanghai local administration and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The parties announced in October 2007 that Danone would divest its stake by selling it to the other two main shareholders at a small profit.
