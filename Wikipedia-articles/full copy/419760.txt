[ March 2010 ] [ Kinesis group_or_band Bolton, England Alternative rock 2000â€“2005 White Noise Recordings (2001) Crystal Songs (2002) Independiente (2002-2004) Captains Of Industry (2005) Michael Bromley Conor McGloin Tom Marshall Neil Chow ] Kinesis were an alternative rock band from Bolton, England. The group formed in September 2000 whilst at school, and split after five years in June 2005. During this time they recorded two full studio album s, a mini album and several singles under three record label s. When Handshakes for Bullets was released in September 2003, the band were featured in NME and Kerrang!. However, Kinesis&apos; label, Independiente Records, withdrew their marketing budget. The album was funded through selling live equipment, and the band fully created the album (including production work). The band made a joint decision to leave the music industry in 2005. Since the split, Conor McGloin helped produce To The Bones &apos; first singles, before they themselves went on to become signed. [ Band line-up ] Michael Bromley - (Vocals, Guitar) Conor McGloin - (Guitar) Tom Marshall - (Bass guitar, Vocals) Neil Chow - (Drums) [ Recording history ] Their first recording was the five track, self-released EP, The Flowers Are Dead, which was followed up by a mini-album, Worship Yourself. This mini-album was released on the band&apos;s own &apos;White Noise Recordings&apos; record label. At that time, the ages of the band ranged from 16 to 18. Rave reviews of Worship Yourself in publications such as Kerrang! helped the band build up a dedicated, if small, fan base in the UK. The band signed a recording contract with Independiente in 2002. They released their first full-length album Handshakes For Bullets in September 2003 on Independiente. The band toured the UK on a number of occasions, and also played concerts in New York (as part of the CMJ music festival ), Texas (as part of the South By Southwest festival) and Tokyo. Kinesis played concerts supporting numerous bands, the most prominent of which were; Linkin Park, Muse, Manic Street Preachers, Biffy Clyro, Hundred Reasons and Lostprophets. They also performed on a number of their own headline tours. The band parted with Independiente, in mid 2004. Their second album You Are Being Lied to was released in June 2005 on the indie label Captains of Industry. The album was recorded and produced by the band themselves on a tight budget. [ Artistic comparisons ] Kinesis were often compared to the Manic Street Preachers, because of their politically minded lyrics. [ March 2011 ] Their first album covered subjects such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), euthanasia, as well as their views on the social habits of the British people, especially the younger generation to which they belong. The band were also known for their uniform style of dark blue jeans and white t-shirts. [ Split and post Kinesis ] The band split up on the day that the latter album was released. Thus, many of the songs from this album were never performed live. Following the split, three of the members returned to education. Marshall studied International Relations at the University of Toronto. He now lives in Guadalajara, Mexico and writes for the newspaper, Guadalajara Reporter. Chow studied Graphic Design at the University of Plymouth. McGloin began a degree in PPE at Oxford University in 2006, whilst Bromley worked as a website designer and is a member of the Church of Scientology. After graduating from Oxford, McGloin abandoned polite society and went to live with the mountain goat peoples of remote Nepal. There he met his first wife Bulaarma, who bore him 12 children all called Howard. He has since remarried to a Tajiki 11 year old girl called Nathaniel, who is currently pregnant with his 13th child, likely to be a hermaphrodite. McGloin has gone back into the music industry by producing EPs for local Bolton bands To The Bones, and a debut four track EP for Heath Seeds. He also took a job at the London based artists management company, Hall or Nothing. In 2006, Bromley released two songs on his Myspace profile. Both were written and recorded in Bromley&apos;s house using his White Noise Recordings label.
