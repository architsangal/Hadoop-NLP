However, geographers historically divided the region into several distinct ethnographic sections based on each area&apos;s respective inhabitants.

Also transliterated as Zenj or Zinj, it was inhabited by Bantu -speaking peoples called the Zanj. { F.R.C. Bagley et al., The Last Great Muslim Empires, (Brill: 1997), p.174 } { Bethwell A. Ogot, Zamani: A Survey of East African History, (East African Publishing House: 1974), p.104 } The geographers drew an explicit ethnographic distinction between the Sudan region and its analogue Zanj, with the area to their extreme east on the Red Sea coast in the Horn of Africa. In modern-day Ethiopia was Al-Habash or Abyssinia, { Sven Rubenson, The survival of Ethiopian independence, (Tsehai, 2003), p.30. } which was inhabited by the Habash or Abyssinians, who were the forebears of the Habesha. { Jonah Blank, Mullahs on the mainframe: Islam and modernity among the Daudi Bohras, (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p.163. } In northern Somalia was Barbara or the Bilad al-Barbar ( &quot; Land of the Berbers &quot; ), which was inhabited by the Eastern Baribah or Barbaroi, as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively.

This occurred 10 million to 5 million years ago. { Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: } { Palgrave Macmillan, p. 2, ISBN 0-333-59957-8. } By 3 million years ago several australopithecine (southern apes) hominid species had developed throughout southern, eastern and central Africa. They were tool users, not makers of tools.About 2.3 million BCE, the next major evolutionary step occurred when primitive stone tools were used to scavenge kills made by other predators and harvest carrion for their bones and marrow. In hunting, H. habilis was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was more prey than hunter, although H. habilis probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small game and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as Oldowan. { Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 2-3, ISBN 0-333-59957-8. } Around 1.8 million years ago Homo ergaster first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From Homo ergaster, Homo erectus (upright man) evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were small brained and used primitive stone tools, much like H. habilis. The brain later grew in size, and H. erectus eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the Acheulean. Possibly the first hunters, H. erectus mastered the art of making fire and were the first hominids to leave Africa, colonizing the entire Old World and perhaps later giving rise to Homo floresiensis. Although some recent writers suggest that H. georgicus, a H. habilis descendant, was the first and most primitive hominid to ever live outside Africa, many scientists consider H. georgicus to be an early and primitive member of the H. erectus species. { Shillington, Kevin(2005).

Around 50,000 - 60,000 years ago their expansion out of Africa launched the colonization of our planet by modern human-beings.

Kush and Nubia at her greatest phase is considered Sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s oldest urban civilization. Nubia was a major source of gold for the ancient world. Nubians built famous structures like the Deffufa, mud brick temples similar to the ziggurats of Mesopotamia in material and function. { AncientSudan.org } They built numerous pyramids. Sudan, the site of ancient Nubia, has more pyramids than anywhere in the world. { Mokhtar (editor), AnciGent Civilizations of Africa Vo. II, General History of Africa, UNESCO, 1990 } The Axumite Empire spanned the southern Sahara and the Sahel along the western shore of the Red Sea. Located in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, Aksum was deeply involved in the trade network between India and the Mediterranean. Emerging from ca. the 4th century BCE, it rose to prominence by the 1st century AD. It was succeeded by the Zagwe dynasty in the 10th century. Aksumites carved, constructed monolithic stelaes to cover the graves of their kings like King Ezana&apos;s Stele and churches out of solid rock, like Church of St. George at Lalibela. In ancient Somalia, city-states flourished such as Opone, Mosyllon and Malao that competed with the Sabaeans, Parthia ns and Axumites for the wealthy Indo - Greco - Roman trade. { Oman in history By Peter Vine Page 324 } { Stone city of } { Gondershe, } { Somalia. } In the Middle Ages, several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade including the Ajuuraan State, which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building, { Shaping of Somali society Lee Cassanelli pg.92 } the Sultanate of Adal, whose General Ahmed Gurey was the first African commander in history to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal&apos;s conquest of the Ethiopian Empire, { Futuh Al Habash Shibab ad Din } and the Gobroon Dynasty, whose military dominance forced governors of the Omani empire north of the city of Lamu to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan Ahmed Yusuf. { Sudan Notes and Records  – Page 147 } In the late 19th century after the Berlin conference had ended, European empires sailed with their armies to the Horn of Africa. The imperial armies in Somalia alarmed the Dervish leader Muhammad Abdullah Hassan, who gathered Somali soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and began one of the longest colonial resistance wars ever. { Fasilides Castle, } { Ethiopia. } Further south in East Africa, during the first millennium AD, Nilotic and Bantu -speaking peoples moved into the region, and the latter now comprise three-quarters of Kenya&apos;s population. Increased trade (namely with Arab merchants) and the development of ports helped birth of Swahili culture. Developed from an outgrowth of indigenous Bantu settlements, { African Archaeological Review, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1998, pp. 199-218(20) } the Swahili Coast of Kenya, Tanzania and northern Mozambique was part of the east African region which traded with Persia, China, the Arab world, and India especially for ivory and slaves. In 1498, Vasco da Gama became the first European to reach the East African coast, and by 1525, the Portuguese had subdued the entire Swahili seaboard. Portuguese control lasted until the early 18th century when Arabs from Oman established a foothold in the region. Assisted by Somalis, Ottomans and Omani Arabs, { Portuguese rule and Spanish crown in South Africa, 1581–1640 – Page 25 } the indigenous coastal dwellers succeeded in driving the Portuguese from the area north of the Ruvuma River by the early 18th century. [ Western Africa ] [ History of West Africa ] [ Ghana Empire Mali Empire Songhay Empire Kingdom of Benin Kingdom of Nri ] { Louvre } The Bantu expansion is a major migration movement originating in West Africa around 2500 BCE, reaching East and Central Africa by 1000 BCE and Southern Africa by the early centuries AD. The Nok culture is known from a type of terracotta figure found in Nigeria, dating to between 500 BCE and AD 200. There were a number of medieval empires of the southern Sahara and the Sahel, based on trans-Saharan trade, including the Ghana Empire and the Mali Empire, Songhai Empire, the Kanem Empire and the subsequent Bornu Empire. { Davidson, Basil. Africa History, Themes and Outlines, revised and expanded edition.

New Scientist, 11 September 1999, Issue 2203. } In the forest zone, several states and empires emerged. The Ashanti Empire arose in the 16th century in modern day Ghana and Ivory Coast. The oldest kingdom in Nigeria, the Kingdom of Nri, was established by the Igbo in the 11th century. Nri was famous for having a priest-king who wielded no military power. Nri was a rare African state as it never dealt in the trade of slaves. All slaves and outcasts who sought refuge in their territory were freed. Other major states included the kingdoms of Ifẹ and Oyo in the western block of Nigeria which became prominent about 700–900 and 1400 respectively, and center of Yoruba culture. The Yoruba&apos;s built massive mud walls around their cities, the most famous being Sungbo&apos;s Eredo. Another prominent kingdom in southwestern Nigeria was the Kingdom of Benin whose power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the well known city of Eko which was named Lagos by the Portuguese traders and other early European settlers. The Edo speaking people of Benin are known for the Walls of Benin, which is the largest man-made structure in the world. In the 18th century, the Oyo and the Aro confederacy were responsible for most of the slaves exported from Nigeria, with Great Britain, France and Portugal shipping the majority of the slaves. { The Slave Trade } Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British expanded trade with the Nigerian interior. In 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence received international recognition, and in the following year the Royal Niger Company was chartered under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900, the company&apos;s territory came under the control of the British Government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On January 1, 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. By 1960, most of the region received independence from colonial rule. [ Central Africa ] [ History of Central Africa ] [ Lunda Empire ] { Ndongo and } { Matamba. } During the 14th century, the Luba Kingdom in southeast Congo came about under a king whose political authority came from religious spiritual legitimacy. The kingdom controlled agriculture and trade in the region of salt and iron from the north and copper from the Zambian/Congo copper belt. { Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 138,139,142, ISBN 0-333-59957-8. } Rival kingship factions which split from the Luba Kingdom later moved among the Lunda people, marrying into its elite and laying the foundation of the Lunda Empire in the 16th century. The ruling dynasty centralised authority among the Lunda under the Mwata Yamyo or Mwaant Yaav. The Mwata Yamyo&apos;s legitimacy, like the Luba king, came from being viewed as a spiritual religious guardian. This system of religious spiritual kings was spread to most of central Africa by rivals in kingship migrating and forming new states. Many new states received legitimacy by claiming descent from the Lunda dynasties. The Kingdom of Kongo existed from the Atlantic west to the Kwango river to the east. During the 15th century, the Bakongo farming community was united with the capital at Mbanza Kongo, under the king title, Manikongo. Other significant states and peoples included the Kuba Kingdom, producers of the famous raffia cloth, the Eastern Lunda, Bemba, Burundi, Rwanda, and the Kingdom of Ndongo. [ Southern Africa ] [ History of Southern Africa ] [ Kingdom of Mutapa ] Settlements of Bantu -speaking peoples, who were iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the Limpopo River by the 4th or 5th century displacing and absorbing the original Khoisan speakers. They slowly moved south, and the earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoi-San people, reaching the Fish River in today&apos;s Eastern Cape Province. { Great Zimbabwe : Tower in the Great Enclosure. } Monomotapa was a medieval kingdom (c. 1250–1629) that used to exist between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers of Southern Africa, in the territory of modern-day Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Famous are the ruins at its old capital of Great Zimbabwe. In 1487, Bartolomeu Dias became the first European to reach the southernmost tip of Africa. In 1652, a victualling station was established at the Cape of Good Hope by Jan van Riebeeck on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a Dutch possession. Great Britain seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1795, ostensibly to prevent it from falling into the hands of the French but also to use Cape Town in particular as a stop on the route to Australia and India. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the Dutch East India Company declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1806. The Zulu Kingdom (1817–79) was a Southern African tribal state in what is now Kwa-Zulu Natal in southeastern South Africa. The small kingdom gained world fame during and after the Anglo-Zulu War. During the 1950s and early 1960s, most Sub-Saharan African nations achieved independence from imperialist rule. { M. Martin, Phyllis and O&apos;Meara, Patrick (1995).

Africa generates 47 GW of electricity, less than 0.6% of global market share. Many countries are besieged by power shortages. { Creamer Media. &apos;&apos;Africa’s energy problems threatens growth, says Nepad CEO&apos;&apos; 12 November 2009 } Because of rising prices in commodities such as coal and oil, thermal sources of energy are proving to be too expensive for power generation. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to build additional hydropower generation capacity of at least 20,165 MW by 2014. The region has the potential to generate 1,750 TWh of energy, of which only 7% has been explored. The failure to exploit its full energy potential is largely due to significant underinvestment, as at least 4 times as much (approximately $23 billion a year) and what is currently spent is invested in operating highcost power systems and not on expanding the infrastructure. African governments are taking advantage of the readily available water resources to broaden their energy mix. Hydro Turbine Markets in Sub-Saharan Africa generated revenues of $120.0 million in 2007 and is estimated to reach $425.0 million. Asian countries, notably China, India and Japan, are playing an active role in power projects across the African continent. The majority of these power projects are hydro-based because of China&apos;s vast experience in the construction of hydro-power projects and part of the Energy &amp; Power Growth Partnership Services programme. { CreamerMedia.co.za } { CreamerMedia.co.za } With electrification numbers, Sub-Saharan Africa with access to the Sahara and being in the tropical zones has massive potential for solar photovoltaic electrical potential. { RedOrbit.com } [ March 2011 ] { Redorbit } Six hundred million people could be served with electricity based on its photovoltaic potential. { Flatow, Ira. Could Africa Leapfrog The U.S. In Solar Power?. Science Friday 6 June 2008. } China is promising to train 10,000 technicians from Africa and other developing countries in the use of solar energy technologies over the next five years. Training African technicians to use solar power is part of the China-Africa science and technology cooperation agreement signed by the Chinese science minister and African counterparts during premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s visit to Ethiopia in December 2003. { Hepeng, Jia. &apos;&apos;China to train developing nations in solar technologies&apos;&apos;. SciDevNet 20 August 2004. } The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) is developing an integrated, continent-wideenergy strategy. This has been funded by, amongst others, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund. These projects must be: sustainable involve a cross-border dimension and/or have a regional impact involve public and private capital contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development involve at least one country in sub-Saharan Africa. [ Media ] Radio is the major source of information in Sub-Saharan Africa. { English, Cynthia. &apos;&apos;Radio the Chief Medium for News in Sub-Saharan Africa&apos;&apos;. Gallup 23 June 2008. } Cell phone usage in Sub-saharan has brought about a revolution. Average coverage stands at more than a third of the population. Countries such as Gabon, Seychelles, and South Africa boast almost 100% penetration. Only five countries —Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia —still have a penetration of less than 10%. Broadband penetration outside of South Africa has been limited where it is exorbitantly expensive. { &apos;&apos;Africa Calling: Cellphone usage sees record rise&apos;&apos;. Mail &amp; Guardian: 23 October 2009. } { Aker, Jenny C.(2008). “Can You Hear Me Now?”How Cell Phones are Transforming Markets in Sub-Saharan Africa } [ March 2011 ] {, Center for Global Development. } Access to the internet via cell phones is on the rise. { MG.co.za } Television is the second major source of information. Because of power shortages, the spread of television viewing has been limited. Eight percent have television, a total of 62 million. But those in the television industry view the region as an untapped green market. Digital television and pay for service are on the rise. { Pfanner, Eric. &apos;&apos;Competition increases for pay TV in sub-Saharan Africa&apos;&apos;. New York Times 6 August 2007. } [ Infrastructure ] According to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). { Christian K.M. Kingombe 2011. Mapping the new infrastructure financing landscape. London: } { Overseas Development Institute } Less than 40% of rural Africans live within two kilometers of an all-season road, the lowest level of rural accessibility in the developing world. Spending on roads averages just below 2% of GDP with varying degree among countries. This compares with 1% of GDP that is typical in industrialized countries, and 2–3% of GDP found in fast-growing emerging economies. Although the level of effort is high relative to the size of Africa’s economies, it remains little in absolute terms, with low-income countries spending an average of about US$7 per capita per year. { Ken Gwilliam, Vivien Foster, Rodrigo Archondo-Callao, Cecilia Briceño-Garmendia, Alberto Nogales, and Kavita Sethi(2008). Africa infrastructure country diagnostic, Roads in Sub-Saharan Africa. World Bank and the SSATP: p. 4 } Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such as areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa. It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa&apos;s improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005 and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average 30-40% returns for telecommunications (ICT) investments, over 40% for electricity generation and 80% for roads. In Africa, it is argued that in order to meet the MDGs by 2015 infrastructure investments would need to reach about 15%t of GDP (around $93 billion a year). Currently, the source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by state spending, others by overseas development aid (ODA) and yet others by private investors. In sub-Saharan Africa, the state spends around $9.4 billion out of a total of $24.9 billion. In irrigation, SSA states represent almost all spending; in transport and energy a majority of investment is state spending; in ICT and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, aid, the private sector and non-OECD financiers between them exceed state spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased from $7 billion (2002) to $27 billion (2009). China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor. [ Oil and minerals ] The region is a major exporter to the world of gold, uranium, chrome, vanadium, antimony, coltan, bauxite, iron ore, copper and manganese. South Africa is a major exporter of manganese { USGS.gov } as well as Chromium. About 42% of world reserves and about 75% of the world reserve base of chromium are located in South Africa. { USGS.gov } South Africa is the largest producer of platinum, with 80% of the total world&apos;s annual mine production and 88% of the world&apos;s platinum reserve. { Gold-Eagle.com } Sub-saharan Africa produces 33% of the world&apos;s bauxite with Guinea as the major supplier. { USGS.gov } Zambia is a major producer of copper. { USGS.gov } Democratic Republic of Congo is a major source of coltan. Production from Congo is very small but has 80% of proven reserves. { pp 2-3 Bepress.com } Sub-saharan Africa is a major producer of gold, producing up to 30% of global production. Major suppliers are South Africa, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Guinea, and Mali. South Africa had been first in the world in terms of gold production since 1905, but in 2007 it moved to second place, according to GFMS, the precious metals consultancy. { MBendi.com } Uranium is major commodity from the region. Significant suppliers are Niger, Namibia, and South Africa. Namibia was the number one supplier from Sub-Saharan Africa in 2008. { World-Nuclear.org } The region produces 49% of the world&apos;s diamonds. By 2015, it is estimated that 25% of North American oil will be from Sub-Saharan Africa, ahead of the Middle East.Sub-Saharan Africa has been the focus of an intense race for oil by the West and China, India, and other emerging economies, even having only 10% of proven oil reserves, less than the Middle East. This race has been referred to as the second Scramble for Africa. The reasons are all economic. Most Sub-Saharan oil is off the coast of host countries. Transportation cost is low. No pipelines has to be laid as in Central Asia. If political turmoil hits host country, production does not stop since operation is off-shore. Sub-Saharan oil is viscous and has very low sulfur content. This requires less refining and is less costly. New sources of oil are being located in Sub-Saharan Africa more frequently than anywhere else. Of all new sources of oil, 1/3 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. { Ghazvinian, John (2008). Untapped: The Scramble for Africa&apos;s Oil. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, pp. 1-16, ISBN 0-15-603372-0, ISBN 978-0-15-603372-5. } [ Agriculture ] Sub-Saharan Africa has more variety of grains than anywhere in the world. Between 13,000 and 11,000 BCE wild grains began to be collected as a source of food in the cataract region of the Nile, south of Egypt. The collecting of wild grains as source of food spread to Syria, parts of Turkey and Iran by the eleventh millennium BCE. By the tenth and ninth millennia southwest Asians domesticated their wild grains, wheat and barley after the notion of collecting wild grains was spread from the Nile. { Christopher Ehret, (2002). The Civilization of Africa. University of Virginia Press: Charlottesville, pp. 98 ISBN 0-8139-2085-X. } Numerous crops have been domesticated in the region and spread to other parts of the world. These crops included sorghum, castor beans, coffee, cotton { Vandaveer, Chelsie(2006). What was the cotton of Kush? KillerPlants.com, Plants That Change History Archive. } okra, black-eyed peas, watermelon, gourd, and pearl millet. Other domesticated crops included teff, enset, African rice, yams, kola nuts, oil palm, and raffia palm. { National Research Council (U.S.). Board on Science and Technology for International Development (1996). Lost Crops of Africa: Grains. National Academy Press, ISBN 0-309-04990-3, ISBN 978-0-309-04990-0. } Domesticated animals include the guinea fowl and the donkey. Agriculture represents 20% to 30% of GDP and 50% of exports. In some cases, 60% to 90% of the labor force are employed in agriculture. { WorldDefenseReview.com } Most agricultural activity is subsistence farming. This has made agricultural activity vulnerable to climate change and global warming. Biotechnology has been advocated to create high yield, pest and environmentally resistant crops in the hands of small farmers. The Bill and Malinda Gates foundation is a strong advocate and donor to this cause. Biotechnology and GM crops have met resistance both by natives and environmental groups. { Business24-7.ae } [ March 2011 ] Cash crops include cotton, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, and tobacco. The OECD says Africa has the potential to become an agricultural superbloc if it can unlock the wealth of the savannahs by allowing farmers to use their land as collateral for credit. { Blogspot.com } There is such international interest in Sub-Saharan agriculture, that the World Bank increased its financing of African agricultural programs to $1.3 billion in the 2011 fiscal year. [ Africa Regional Brief World Bank http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polsc325-4.1-Africa-Regional-Brief.pdf May 7th 2012 ] Recently, there has been a trend to purchase large tracts of land in Sub-Sahara for agricultural use by developing countries.Early in 2009, George Soros highlighted a new farmland buying frenzy caused by growing population, scarce water supplies and climate change. Chinese interests bought up large swathes of Senegal to supply it with sesame. Aggressive moves by China, South Korea and Gulf states to buy vast tracts of agricultural land in Sub-Saharan Africa could soon be limited by a new global international protocol. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/nov/02/global-protocol-subsahara-land-grab The Guardian London Global protocol could limit Sub-Saharan land grab Nick Mathiason 2009-11-02 2010-04-09 ] [ Education ] Forty percent of African scientists live in OECD countries, predominately in Europe, the United States and Canada. { Gabara, Nthambeleni. &apos;&apos;Developed Nations Should Invest In African Universities&apos;&apos;. Buanews, 12 November 2009 } This has been described as an African brain drain. Even with the drain, enrollments in Sub-Saharan African universities tripled between 1991 and 2005, expanding at an annual rate of 8.7%, which is one of the highest regional growth rates in the world. In the last 10 to 15 years interest in pursuing university level degrees abroad has increased. In some OECD countries, like the United States, Sub-Saharan Africans are the most educated immigrant group. Sub-Saharan African countries spent an average of 0.3% of their GDP on science and technology on in 2007. This represents an increase from US$1.8 billion in 2002 to US$2.8 billion in 2007, a 50% increase in spending. { Nordling, Linda. &apos;&apos;Africa Analysis: Progress on science spending?&apos;&apos;.

This is apparent in the number of languages spoken. The region contains over 1,000 languages, which is 1/6 of the world&apos;s total. { Bowden, Rob (2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 37, ISBN 1-4034-9910-1. } With the exception of extinct Sumerian, the Afro-Asiatic has the longest documented history of any language phyla in the world. Egyptian was recorded as early as 3200 BCE. The Semitic branch was recorded as early as 2500 BCE. { Brown, Keith and Ogilvie, Sarah(2008). Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world Concise Encyclopedias of Language and Linguistics Series. Elsevier, p. 12, ISBN 0-08-087774-5, ISBN 978-0-08-087774-7. } The distribution of the Afro-Asiatic languages within Africa is principally concentrated in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. The Chadic branch is distributed in Central and West Africa. { Peek, Philip M. and Yankah, Kwesi(2004). African folklore: an encyclopedia. London:(Rourledge)Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 205, ISBN 0-415-93933-X, 9780415939331 } Hausa is a lingua franca in West Africa (Niger, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Cameroon, and Chad). { Schneider, Edgar Werner and Kortmann, Bernd(2004).

Berlin: } { Walter de Gruyter, pp. 867-868, ISBN 3-11-017532-0, ISBN 978-3-11-017532-5. } The Semitic branch of the phylum also has a notable presence in Western Asia, making Afro-Asiatic the only language family spoken in Africa that is also attested outside of the continent. In addition to languages now spoken, Afro-Asiatic includes several ancient languages, such as Ancient Egyptian, Biblical Hebrew and Akkadian. The Khoi-San languages represent the oldest language family in the world. { Corballis, Michael C.(2003). From hand to mouth: the origins of language. Princeton University Press, p. 130, ISBN 0-691-11673-3, ISBN 978-0-691-11673-0. } They include languages indigenous to Southern and Eastern Africa, though some, such as the Khoi languages, appear to have moved to their current locations not long before the Bantu expansion. { Güldemann, Tom and Edward D. Elderkin (forthcoming) &quot; On external genealogical relationships of the Khoe family &quot;. In Brenzinger, Matthias and Christa König (eds.), Khoisan languages and linguistics: the Riezlern symposium 2003. Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung 17. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe. } In Southern Africa, their speakers are the Khoi and Bushmen (San), in East Africa, the Sandawe and Hadza. { San tribesman. } The Niger–Congo phylum is the largest language family in the world in terms of the number of languages (1,436) it contains. { Bellwood, Peter S.(2005). First farmers: the origins of agricultural societies. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 218, ISBN 0-631-20566-7, ISBN 978-0-631-20566-1. } The vast majority of languages of this family are tonal such as Yoruba, Fulani and Igbo. A major branch of Niger–Congo languages is the Bantu family, which covers a greater geographic area than the rest of the family put together. Bantu speakers represent the majority of inhabitants in southern, central and southeastern Africa, though Pygmy, Khoisan ( Bushmen ), and Nilotic groups, respectively, can also be found in those regions. Bantu-speakers can also be found in parts of Central Africa such as the Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and southern Cameroon. Swahili, a Bantu language with many Arabic, Persian and other Middle Eastern and South Asian loan word s, developed as a lingua franca for trade between the different peoples in southeastern Africa. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also &quot; San &quot;, closely related to, but distinct from &quot; Hottentots &quot; ) have long been present. The San evince unique physical traits, and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa. The Nilo-Saharan languages are concentrated in the upper parts of the Chari and Nile rivers. They are principally spoken by Nilotic peoples and are also spoken in Sudan among the Fur, Masalit, Nubian and Zaghawa peoples and in West and Central Africa among the Songhai and Kanuri. The Old Nubian language is also a member of this phylum. { Afrikaner } { Trekboer s in the } { Karoo of } { South Africa. } South Africa has the largest populations of Whites, India ns and Coloured s in Africa. The term &quot; Coloured &quot; is used to describe persons of mixed race in South Africa and Namibia.

Sub-Saharan Africa is largely Christian, while North Africa is predominantly Muslim. However, there are Muslim majorities in the Sahel and Sudan regions and along the East African coast (Muslim majorities in The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Somalia; comparable numbers of Christians and Muslims in Chad, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast with significant Muslim communities in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Eritrea ). { Encyclopædia Britannica. Britannica Book of the Year 2003. Encyclopædia Britannica, (2003) ISBN 978-0-85229-956-2 p. 306 Southern Africa is predominately Christian however. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, as of mid-2002, there were 376,453,000 Christians, 329,869,000 Muslims and 98,734,000 people who practiced traditional religions in Africa. Ian S. Markham,(A World Religions Reader. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 1996.) is cited by Morehouse University as giving the mid 1990s figure of 278,250,800 Muslims in Africa, but still as 40.8% of the total. These numbers are estimates and remain a matter of conjecture. See Amadu Jacky Kaba. The spread of Christianity and Islam in Africa: a survey and analysis of the numbers and percentages of Christians, Muslims and those who practice indigenous religions. The Western Journal of Black Studies, Vol 29, Number 2, June 2005. Discusses the estimations of various almanacs and encyclopedium, placing Britannica&apos;s estimate as the most agreed figure. Notes the figure presented at the World Christian Encyclopedia, summarized here, as being an outlier. On rates of growth, Islam and Pentecostal Christianity are highest, see: The List: The World’s Fastest-Growing Religions, Foreign Policy, May 2007. } Traditional African religions can be broken into down linguistic cultural groups, with common themes. Among Niger–Congo -speakers is a belief in a creator God; ancestor spirits; territorial spirits; evil caused by human ill will and neglecting ancestor spirits; priest of territorial spirits. New world religions such as Santería, Vodun, and Candomblé, would be derived from this world view. Among Nilo-Saharan speakers is the belief in Divinity; evil is caused by divine judgement and retribution; prophets as middlemen between Divinity and man. Among Afro-Asiatic -speakers is henotheism, the belief in one&apos;s own gods but accepting the existence of other gods; evil here is caused by malevolent spirits. The Semitic Abrahamic religion of Judaism is comparable to the latter world view. { Baldick, Julian (1997). Black God: the Afroasiatic roots of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions. Syracuse University Press:ISBN 0-8156-0522-6 } Khoisan religion is non-theistic but a belief in a Spirit or Power of existence which can be tapped in a trance-dance; trance-healers. { Christopher Ehret, (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, pp. 102-103, ISBN 0-8139-2085-X. } Traditional Sub-Saharan African religion displays very complex ontology, cosmology, and metaphysics. Mythologies, for example, demonstrated the difficulty fathers of creation had in bringing about order from chaos. Order is what is right and natural and any deviation is chaos. Sub-Saharan cosmology and ontology is neither simple or linear. It defines duality, the material and immaterial, male and female, heaven and earth. Common principles of being and becoming are widespread: Among the Dogon, the principle of Amma (being) and Nummo (becoming), among the Bambara Pemba (being) and Faro (becoming), { Davidson, Basil(1969). The African Genius,An Introduction to African Social and Cultural History. Little Brown and Company: Boston, pp. 168-180. } { Library of Congress 70-80751. } { Ifá divination and its four digit binary code } West Africa Akan mythology Ashanti mythology (Ghana) Dahomey (Fon) mythology Efik mythology (Nigeria, Cameroon) Igbo mythology (Nigeria, Cameroon) Isoko mythology (Nigeria) Yoruba mythology (Nigeria, Benin) Central Africa Bushongo mythology (Congo) Bambuti (Pygmy) mythology (Congo) Lugbara mythology (Congo) East Africa Akamba mythology (East Kenya) Dinka mythology (South Sudan) Lotuko mythology (South Sudan) Masai mythology (Kenya, Tanzania) Southern Africa Khoisan religion Lozi mythology (Zambia) Tumbuka mythology (Malawi) Zulu mythology (South Africa) Sub-Saharan traditional divination systems displays great sophistication. For example the bamana sand divinition uses well establish symbolic codes that can be reproduce using four bits or marks. A binary system of one or two marks are combined. Random outcomes are generated using a fractal recursive process. It is analogous to a digital circuit but can be reproduced on any surface with one or two marks. This system is widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa. { Eglash, Ron: &quot; African Fractals: Modern computing and indigenous design.” Rutgers 1999 ISBN 0-8135-2613-2 } [ Music ] [ Music of Africa African popular music ] Traditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region&apos;s various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered around the drums. It is partially true. A large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages, is rhythmic and centered around the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspect of Sub-Saharan music has been transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as Samba, Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, Rock &amp; Roll, Salsa, Reggae and Rap music. { Bowden, Rob(2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 40, ISBN 1-4034-9910-1. } But Sub-Saharan music involves a lot of music with strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern sahel and along the nile, among the Nilo-Saharan, made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Among the Afro-Asiatic s, we see extensive use of string instruments. Dancing involve swaying body movements and footwork. Among the Khoisan s extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork. { Christopher Ehret, (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, p. 103, ISBN 0-8139-2085-X. } Modern Sub-Saharan African music has been influence by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.) vice-versa being influenced by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans. Popular styles are Mbalax in Senegal and Gambia, Highlife in Ghana, Zoblazo in Ivory Coast, Makossa in Cameroon, Soukous in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kizomba in Angola, and Mbaqanga in South Africa. New World styles like Salsa, R &amp; B/Rap, Reggae, and Zouk also have widespread popularity. [ Art ] [ African art ] The oldest abstract art in the world is a shell necklace dated 82,000 years in the Cave of Pigeons in Taforalt, eastern Morocco. { ScienceDaily.com } The second oldest abstract form of art and the oldest rock art is found in the Blombos Cave at the Cape in South Africa, dated 77,000 years. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1753326.stm BBC News &apos;Oldest&apos; prehistoric art unearthed 2002-01-10 2010-04-09 ] The Blombos Cave represent what is man&apos;s earliest art form. Sub-saharan Africa has some of the oldest and most varied style of rock art in the world. { &apos;&apos;Rock Art In Africa&apos;&apos;, Trust for African Rock Art (TARA) } Although Sub-saharan African art is very diverse there are some common themes. One is the use of the human figure. Second, there is a preference for sculpture. Sub-saharan art is meant to be experience three dimensionly, not two dimensionly. A house is meant to be experience from all angles. Third, art is meant to be performed. Sub-saharan Africans have specific name for mask. The name incorporates the sculpture, the dance, and the spirit that incorporates the mask. The name denotes all three elements. Fourth, art that serves a practical function, utilitarian. The artist and craftsman are not separate. A sculpture shaped like a hand can be used as a stool. Fifth, the use of fractals or non-linear scaling. The shape of the whole is the shape of the parts at different scales. Before the discovery of fractal geometry, Louis Senghor, Senegal’s first president, referred to this as “dynamic symmetry.” William Fagg, the British art historian, compared it to the logarithmic mapping of natural growth by biologist D’Arcy Thompson. Lastly, Sub-saharan art is visually abstract, instead of naturalistic. Sub-saharan art represents spiritual notions, social norms, ideas, values, etc. An artist might exaggerated the head of a sculpture in relations to the body not because he does not know anatomy but because he wants to illustrate that the head is the seat of knowledge and wisdom. The visual abstraction of African art was very influential in the works of modernist artist like Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Jacques Lipchitz. { &apos;&apos;African Influences in Modern Art&apos;&apos;, Metropolitan Museum of Art. } { Alexandre, Marc(1998). World Bank Publication: DC. ISBN 0-8213-4195-2, ISBN 978-0-8213-4195-7 } [ Cuisine ] [ African cuisine ] { cabbage } Sub-Saharan African cuisine like everything about Africa is very diverse. A lot of regional overlapping occurs, but there are dominant elements region by region. A plate of fufu accompanied with peanut soup West African cuisine can be described as starchy, flavorfully spicey. Dishes include fufu, kenkey, couscous, garri, foutou, and banku. Ingredients are of native starchy tubers, yams, cocoyams, and cassava. Grains include millet, sorghum, and rice, usually in the sahel, are incorporated. Oils include palm oil and shea butter(sahel). One finds recipes that mixes fish and meat. Beverages are palm wine(sweet or sour) and millet beer. Roasting, baking, boiling, frying, mashing, and spicing are all cooking techniques. East African cuisine reflects its Islamic, geographical Indian Ocean cultural links. Dishes include ugali, injera, wat, sukumi wiki, and halva. Spices such as curry, saffron, cloves, cinnamon, pomegranate juice, cardamon, ghee, and sage are used, especially among Muslims. Meat includes cattle, sheep, and goats, but is rarely eaten since its viewed as currency and wealth. In the Horn of Africa, pork and non-fish seafood is avoided by Christians and Muslims. Dairy products and all meats are avoided during lent by Ethiopians. Maize (corn) is a major staple from Sudan to southern Africa. Cornmeal is used to make ugali, a popular dish with different names from Sudan to southern Africa. Teff is used to make injera or canjeero (Somali) bread. Other important foods include enset, noog, lentils, rice, banana, leafy greens, chiles, peppers, cocconut milk and tomatoes. Beverages are coffee (domesticated in Ethiopia), chai tea, fermented beer from banana or millet. Cooking techniques include roasting and marinating. { Ethiopia n and } { Eritrea n cuisine. } Central African cuisine connects with all major regions of Sub-Saharan Africa: Its cuisine reflects that. Ugali and fufu are eaten in the region. Central African cuisine is very starchy and spicy hot. Dominant crops include plantains, cassava, peanuts, chillis, and okra. Meats include beef, chicken, and sometimes exotic meats called bush meat (antelope, warthog, crocodile). Widespread spicy hot fish cuisine is one of the differentiating aspects. Mushroom is sometimes used as a meat substitute. Traditional Southern African cuisine surrounds meat. Traditional society typically focused on raising, sheep, goats, and especially cattle. Dishes include braai (barbecue meat), sadza, bogobe, pap (fermented cornmeal), milk products (buttermilk, yoghurt). Crops utilized are sorghum, maize (corn), pumpkin beans, leafy greens, and cabbage. Beverages include ting (fermented sorghum or maize), milk, chibuku (milky beer). Influences from the Indian and Malay community can be seen its use of curries, sambals, pickled fish, fish stews, chutney, and samosa. European influences can be seen in cuisines like biltong (dried beef strips), potjies (stews of maize, onions, tomatoes), French wines, and crueler or koeksister (sugar syrup cookie). [ Clothing ] [ Clothing in Africa ] Kangas A man wearing a Boubou and woman wearing a Kaftan. { The Ashanti Kente cloth patterns } Like most of the world, Sub-Saharan Africans have adopted Western-style clothing. In some country like Zambia, used Western clothing has flooded markets, causing great angst in the retail community. Sub-Saharan Africa boasts its own traditional clothing style. Cotton seems to be the dominant material. In East Africa, one finds extensive use cotton clothing. Shemma, shama, and kuta are types of Ethiopian clothing. Kanga are Swahili cloth that comes in rectangular shapes, made of pure cotton, and put together to make clothing. Kitenges are similar to kangas and kikoy, but are of a thicker cloth, and have an edging only on a long side. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Sudan are some of the African countries where kitenge is worn. In Malawi, Namibia and Zambia, kitenge is known as Chitenge. One of the unique materials, which is not a fiber and is used to make clothing is barkcloth, an innovation of the baganda people of Uganda. It came from the Mutuba tree (Ficus natalensis). { Yoshida, Reiko. &apos;&apos;Proclamation 2005: Barcloth making in Uganda&apos;&apos; Unesco: Intangible Cultural Heritage (Uganda) 13 May 2009 } On Madagascar a type of draped cloth called lamba is worn. In West Africa, again cotton is the material of choice. In the Sahel and other parts of West Africa the boubou and kaftan style of clothing are featured. Kente cloth is created by the Akan people of Ghana and Ivory Coast, from silk of the various moth species in West Africa. Kente comes from the The Ashanti twi word kenten which means basket. It is sometimes used to make dashiki and kufi. Adire is a type of Yoruba cloth that is starch resistant. Raffia cloth and barkcloth are also utilized in the region. In Central Africa, the Kuba people developed raffia cloth from the raffia plant fibers. It was widely used in the region. Barkcloth was also extensively used. In Southern Africa one finds numerous uses of animal hide and skins for clothing. The Ndau in central Mozambique and the Shona mix hide with barkcloth and cotton cloth. Cotton cloth is referred to as machira. Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho, and Swazi also made extensive use of hides. Hides come from cattle, sheep, goat, and elephant. Leopard skins were coveted and were a symbol of kingship in Zulu society. Skins were tanned to form leather, dyed, and embedded with beads. [ Sports ] Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan men are its main patrons. Major leagues are the African Champions League, a gathering of various football clubs. Africa Cup of Nations is a gathering of 16 teams from various African nations held every two years (January 20 - February 10, 2008). The Confederation Cup is a competition for the National Cup winner in each African country. Finals are in November. Cameroon played in the World Cup for the sixth time, a record for a Sub-saharan team. South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a first for a Sub-Saharan country. In 1996 Nigeria won the gold for football, a momentous achievement for Sub-Saharan African football. Famous Sub-saharan football stars are Emmanuel Adebayor, Obafemi Martins, Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Kanu Nwankwo Jay-Jay Okocha, Taye Taiwo and Samuel Eto&apos;o Fils. The most talented Sub-saharan African football players find themselves courted and sought after by European leagues. There are currently more than 1000 Africans playing for European clubs. Sub-Saharan Africans have found themselves the target of racism by European fans. FIFA has been trying hard to crack down on racist outburst during games. { About.com } { AllAfrica.com } [ http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C1798795%2C00.html European Soccer&apos;s Racism Problem December 2, 2005 Deutsche Welle Deutsche Welle ] Rugby is also popular in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Confederation of African Rugby governs rugby games in the region and chooses the best team to play in the Rugby World Cup. South Africa is a major force in the game and won the championship in 2007. Boxing is also a popular sport in Sub-Saharan Africa with a long history with Senegalese born fighter Battling Siki the first world champion to come out of Sub-Saharan Africa. Countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa have produced numerous professional world champions such as Dick Tiger, Hogan Bassey, Samuel Peter, Azumah Nelson and Jake Matlala. Cricket has a following. The African Cricket Association is an international body which oversees cricket in African countries. South Africa and Zimbabwe have their own governing bodies. In 2003 the Cricket World Cup was held in South Africa, first time it was held in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, Ethiopia and Kenya have produced many notable long-distance athletes. Each country has federations that identify and cultivate top talent. Athletes from Ethiopia and Kenya hold all the distance records (except the 1500 metres) from 800m to the marathon. { Bicourt, John. &apos;&apos;John Bicourt: Do Kenyan and Ethiopian runners have a genetic advantage?&apos;&apos; Inside the Games,Tuesday, 28 April 2009. } Famous runners are Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele, Paul Tergat, and John Cheruiyot Korir. { Tucker, Ross and Dugas, Jonathan. &apos;&apos;Sport&apos;s great rivalries: Kenya vs. Ethiopia, and a one-sided battle (at least on the track)&apos;&apos;, The Science of Sport, 14 July 2008. } [ List of countries and regional organization ] Only six African countries are not geographically a part of Sub-Saharan Africa: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco). Together with the Sudan and South Sudan, they form the UN subregion of Northern Africa which also makes up the largest bloc of the Arab World. Nevertheless, many international organizations include Sudan and South Sudan as part of Sub-Saharan Africa. Although a long-standing member of the Arab League, Sudan has substantial non-Arab populations in the west ( Darfur, Masalit, Zaghawa ), north ( Nubian ) and south ( Kordofan, Nuba ).

Mauritania and Niger only include a band of the Sahel along their southern borders. All other African countries have at least significant portions of their territory within Sub-Saharan Africa.
