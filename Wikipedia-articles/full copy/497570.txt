Pierre Saint-Amant Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant (12 September 1800 – 29 October 1872) was a leading French chess master and an editor of the chess periodical Le Palamède. He is best known for losing a match against Howard Staunton in 1843 that is often considered to have been an unofficial match for the World Chess Championship. Saint-Amant learned chess from Wilhelm Schlumberger, who later became the operator of The Turk. He played at the Café de la Régence, where he was a student of Alexandre Deschapelles. { Anne Sunnucks, The Encyclopaedia of Chess, St. Martin&apos;s Press, 1970, p. 419. } For many years he played on level terms with Boncourt, a strong player, and received odds of pawn and two moves from Deschapelles and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais. In 1834-36, he led a Paris team that won both games of a correspondence chess match against the Westminster Club, then England&apos;s leading chess club. { H. J. R. Murray, A History of Chess, Oxford University Press, 1913, p. 881. ISBN 0-19-827403-3. } After La Bourdonnais&apos; death in 1840, he was considered the country&apos;s best player. { David Hooper and } { Kenneth Whyld, } { The Oxford Companion to Chess (2d ed. 1992), pp. 350-51. ISBN 0-19-866164-9. } In December 1841 he revived Le Palamède (at its inception in 1836 the world&apos;s first chess periodical ), { Hooper &amp; Whyld, p. 56. } { Murray, p. 886. } which ran until 1847. { Hooper &amp; Whyld, p. 350. } He played two matches against Staunton in 1843. The first, in London, he won 3½-2½ (three wins, one draw, two losses), but he lost a return match in Paris just before Christmas 13-8 (six wins, four draws, eleven losses). { Sergeant, pp. 55-56. } This second match is sometimes considered an unofficial world championship match. In 1858, Saint-Amant played in the Birmingham tournament, a knock-out event. He won in the first round, but lost in the second by a 2-1 score to Ernst Falkbeer. { R. D. Keene and } { R. N. Coles, Howard Staunton: the English World Chess Champion, } { British Chess Magazine, 1975, pp. 21-23. } Returning to Paris, he witnessed the adulatory reception accorded Paul Morphy at the Café de la Régence. { A correspondent for the } { American Chess Monthly wrote, &quot;  &apos;Does anybody believe,&apos; exclaims St. Amant, &apos;that it is not the season and that there is nobody in Paris? Let them go to the Café de la Régence and glance at the throng of spectators who look on in admiration while Morphy, the young American, displays his wonderful attainments.&apos;   &quot; } { Philip W. Sergeant, Morphy&apos;s Games of Chess, Dover Publications, pp. 150-51. } { According to Morphy&apos;s biographer, &quot; Saint Amant wrote that [Morphy] supplied a want which Paris had felt for a long time —the want of a hero. &quot; Frederick Milne Edge, The Exploits &amp; Triumphs in Europe of Paul Morphy the Chess Champion, Dover Publications, 1973, p. 171. ISBN 0-486-22882-7. } The score of one game between them is known, a 22-move rout by Morphy of Saint-Amant and his consultation partner, given as &quot; F. de L. &quot; or &quot; F. de L&apos;A &quot;. { J. Löwenthal, Morphy&apos;s Games of Chess, George Bell and Sons, 1909, pp. 232-33. } { Sergeant, pp. 150-51. } { Saint-Amant-Morphy, Paris 1858. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-12. } Outside of chess, Saint-Amant became a government clerk in Paris at an early age. { Philip W. Sergeant, A Century of British Chess, David McKay, 1934, p. 54. } He then served as the secretary to the governor of French Guiana from 1819 to 1821. He was dismissed from that appointment after he protested against the slave trade that still existed in that colony. { Harry Golombek (editor), Golombek&apos;s Encyclopedia of Chess, pp. 283-84. ISBN 0-517-53146-1. } { Reuben Fine, The World&apos;s Great Chess Games, Dover Publications, 1976, p. 9. ISBN 0-486-24512-8. } After that, he tried his hand as a journalist and actor, then became a successful wine merchant. He was a captain in the French National Guard during the 1848 revolution. For his role in saving the Palais des Tuileries from destruction by the mob, he was made its Governor for a few months. In 1851-52, he was the French consul to California. Upon returning to France he spent some years writing well-regarded works on the French colonies, and a treatise on the wines of Bordeaux. In 1861 Saint-Amant retired to Algeria. He died there in 1872 after being thrown from his carriage.
