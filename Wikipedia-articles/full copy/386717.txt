Important communication routes run through the town, namely the Central Rail Line, which connects Silesia and Krakow with Warsaw, and national road number 12, which creates a connection between the Western and Eastern parts of Poland. The town also has a good connection with the Silesia–Warsaw highway. The town and commune have a total area of 190  km², and make one of the largest communes in the Łódź district; 36 thousand inhabitants live here, of which 23,162 (as of 2007) live in Opoczno. The town is located in northwestern corner of historic Polish province of Lesser Poland on the boundary between Lesser Polish Upland, and Mazovian Lowland. First mention of Opoczno comes from 1284, when Prince Leszek II the Black stated that the town administratively belonged to the Sandomierz Collegiate church. Opoczno gained its town rights in 1365, and its first starosta was Sobek z Wyszkowic. In the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries Opoczno was one of major urban centers of Sandomierz Voivodeship, in which it was the capital of a county. In 1405, a hospital was opened there, and in 1550, with the permission of King Sigismund II Augustus, waterworks were built. In 1646, a synagogue was opened, but the period of prosperity came to end during the Swedish invasion of 1655 - 1660, when Opoczno was burned to the ground by the Swedes, and most of its inhabitants were murdered. Following the Partitions of Poland, Opoczno was annexed by the Austrian Empire, and in 1815 it became part of the Russian Empire. In 1880, Tile Manufacture was founded, which today is known as “Opoczno S.A.” In 1919 Opoczno and its county made part of Kielce Voivodeship, and on April 1, 1938, it was transferred to Lodz Voivodeship (see Territorial changes of Polish Voivodeships on April 1, 1938 ). In the early stages of World War II, Opoczno was the site of fierce combat during the Invasion of Poland. Wilhelm Fritz von Roettig, the first general to be killed in the war, was killed in Opoczno just a few days after the war began. Among most interesting points of interest in the town there is Opoczno Castle. Its origins go back to mid-14th century, when King Casimir III the Great initiated construction of a number of castles across Poland. Opoczno Castle was located within town walls, and was the seat of a starosta. It burned down in the great fire in the 15th century, and current form is the reconstruction of the original complex. Another interesting object is the “House of Esterka ”. Esterka was a legendary Jewish mistress of Casimir the Great. She was the daughter of a tailor from Opoczno, and the house in which she allegedly was raised is located in Opoczno’s market square. The house was reconstructed in 1893, but under windows one can still find Latin inscriptions from 16th century. On the wall there also is the coat of arms of Sandomierz Voivodeship.
