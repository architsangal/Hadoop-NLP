It is the flagship station of the Fuji News Network (FNN) and the Fuji Network System. Fuji Television also operates three premium television stations, known as &quot; Fuji TV One &quot;, &quot; Fuji TV Two &quot;, and &quot; Fuji TV Next &quot; (called together as &quot; Fuji TV OneTwoNext &quot; ), all available in High-definition. It is owned by Fuji Media Holdings, Inc., the holding company of the Fujisankei Communications Group. [ Offices ] The headquarters are located at 2-4-8, Daiba, Minato, Tokyo. The Kansai office is found at Aqua Dojima East, Dojima, Kita-ku, Osaka. The Nagoya office is found at Telepia, Higashi-sakura, Higashi-ku, Nagoya. [ History of Fuji TV ] Fuji Television Network Inc. was founded on November 18, 1948, and started broadcasting on March 1, 1959. In June of that year, Fuji TV formed a network with Tokai TV, Kansai TV, and Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting. In October 1966, a news network of exchanging news with local stations with the name of FNN (Fuji News Network) was formed. On April 1, 1986, Fuji TV changed their corporate logo from the old &quot; Channel 8 &quot; logo, to the &quot; Medama &quot; logo used by the Fujisankei Communications Group. In 1987, Fuji TV worked with Nintendo to create a game called Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic for the Famicom, which later became the basis for Super Mario Bros. 2. In October 1987, Fuji TV branded their late-night/early-morning slots collectively as JOCX-TV2 (meaning &quot; alternative JOCX-TV &quot; ) in an effort to market the traditionally unprofitable time slots and give opportunities to young creators to express their new ideas. JOCX-TV2 featured numerous experimental programs on low budgets under this and follow-on brands, a notable example being Zuiikin&apos; English which first aired in spring 1992. The JOCX-TV2 branding itself was changed in October 1988 to JOCX-TV+, which lasted until September 1991 when it was replaced with GARDEN/JOCX-MIDNIGHT in October 1991. The GARDEN/JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding lasted until September 1992 when it was replaced with the JUNGLE branding, which lasted from October 1992 to September 1993. The JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding was introduced in October 1993 to replace the previous JUNGLE branding, and lasted until March 1996 when Fuji TV decided to stop branding their late-night/early-morning slots. On March 10, 1997, Fuji TV moved from their old headquarters in Kawadacho, Shinjuku, into a new building in Odaiba, Minato designed by Kenzo Tange. Since 2002, Fuji TV has co-sponsored the Clarion Girl contest, held annually to select a representative for Clarion who will represent Clarion&apos;s car audio products in television and print advertising campaign s during the following year. On March 3, 2006, Fuji Television Network Inc. consolidated &quot; Nippon Broadcasting Holdings, Inc. &quot; the broadcasting business of which was taken over by Nippon Broadcasting System, Inc. two days before. On October 1, 2008, former Fuji TV became a certified broadcasting holding company [ &quot; Fuji Media Holdings, Inc. &quot; 株式会社フジ・メディア・ホールディングス Kabushiki gaisha Fuji Media Hōrudingusu ] and newly-founded &quot; Fuji Television Network Inc. &quot; took over the broadcasting business. Fuji TV, which broadcasts Formula One in Japan since 1987, is the only media sponsor of a Formula One Grand Prix in the world. Fuji TV has also licensed numerous Formula One video games including Human Grand Prix IV: F1 Dream Battle. [ Controversies ] On August 7 and 21, 2011, more than 2,000 protesters from the Japanese Culture Channel Sakura and other rightist groups rallied in front of Fuji Television and Fuji Media Holdings&apos; headquarters in Odaiba, Tokyo to demonstrate against the network&apos;s increased use of Korean content. Channel Sakura called Fuji TV the &quot; Traitor Network &quot; in these protests.
