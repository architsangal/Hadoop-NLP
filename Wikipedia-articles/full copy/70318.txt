{ Gaumont &apos;s sound films. The Chronomégaphone, designed for large halls, employed compressed air to amplify the recorded sound. Wierzbicki (2009), p. 74; &quot; Representative Kinematograph Shows &quot; (1907). The Auxetophone and Other Compressed-Air Gramophones explains pneumatic amplification and includes several detailed photographs of Gaumont&apos;s Elgéphone, which was apparently a slightly later and more elaborate version of the Chronomégaphone. } A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, as opposed to a silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades would pass before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in New York City in April 1923. The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the United States in the mid- to late 1920s. At first, the sound films incorporating synchronized dialogue—known as &quot; talking pictures &quot;, or &quot; talkies &quot; —were exclusively shorts; the earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects. The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927. A major hit, it was made with Vitaphone, the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology. Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures. By the early 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood&apos;s position as one of the world&apos;s most powerful cultural/commercial systems (see Cinema of the United States ). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere) the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation&apos;s film industry—the most productive such industry in the world since the early 1960s. [ History ] [ Early steps ] [ Kinetoscope ] { Dickson Experimental Sound Film (1894 or 1895), produced by } { W.K.L. Dickson as a test of the early version of the } { Edison } { Kinetophone, combining the } { Kinetoscope and } { phonograph. } The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, a couple of days after photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, the two inventors privately met. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting zoopraxiscope with Edison&apos;s recorded-sound technology. { Robinson (1997), p. 23. } No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope, essentially a &quot; peep-show &quot; system, as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph. The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection. { Robertson (2001) claims that German inventor and filmmaker } { Oskar Messter began projecting sound motion pictures at 21 Unter den Linden in September 1896 (p. 168), but this seems to be an error. Koerber (1996) notes that after Messter acquired the Cinema Unter den Linden (located in the back room of a restaurant), it reopened under his management on September 21, 1896 (p. 53), but no source beside Robertson describes Messter as screening sound films before 1903. } In 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor François Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones. { Altman (2005), p. 158; Cosandey (1996). } An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, was developed by Clément-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system—Théâtroscope—were also presented at the Exposition. { Lloyd and Robinson (1986), p. 91; Barnier (2002), pp. 25, 29; Robertson (2001), p. 168. Gratioulet went by his given name, Clément-Maurice, and is referred to thus in many sources, including Robertson and Barnier. Robertson incorrectly states that the Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre was a presentation of the Gaumont Co.; in fact, it was presented under the aegis of Paul Decauville (Barnier, ibid.). } Three major problems persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which were difficult to start and maintain in tandem. { Sound engineer Mark Ulano, in &quot; The Movies Are Born a Child of the Phonograph &quot; (part 2 of his essay &quot; Moving Pictures That Talk &quot; ), describes the Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre version of synchronized sound cinema: This system used an operator adjusted non-linkage form of primitive synchronization. The scenes to be shown were first filmed, and then the performers recorded their dialogue or songs on the Lioretograph (usually a Le Éclat concert cylinder format phonograph) trying to match tempo with the projected filmed performance. In showing the films, synchronization of sorts was achieved by adjusting the hand cranked film projector&apos;s speed to match the phonograph. the projectionist was equipped with a telephone through which he listened to the phonograph which was located in the orchestra pit. } Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project to satisfactorily fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed directly in front of the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound. { Crafton (1997), p. 37. } { Sarah Bernhardt and giving the names of eighteen other &quot; famous artists &quot; shown in &quot; living visions &quot; at the } { 1900 Paris Exposition using the Gratioulet-Lioret system. } Cinematic innovators attempted to cope with the fundamental synchronization problem in a variety of ways. An increasing number of motion picture systems relied on gramophone records —known as sound-on-disc technology; the records themselves were often referred to as &quot; Berliner discs &quot;, after one of the primary inventors in the field, German-American Emile Berliner. In 1902, Léon Gaumont demonstrated his sound-on-disc Chronophone, involving an electrical connection he had recently patented, to the French Photographic Society. { Barnier (2002), p. 29. } Four years later, Gaumont introduced the Elgéphone, a compressed-air amplification system based on the Auxetophone, developed by British inventors Horace Short and Charles Parsons. { Altman (2005), p. 158. If there was a drawback to the Elgéphone, it was apparently not a lack of volume. Dan Gilmore describes its predecessor technology in his 2004 essay &quot; What&apos;s Louder than Loud? The Auxetophone &quot; : &quot; Was the Auxetophone loud? It was painfully loud. &quot; For a more detailed report of Auxetophone-induced discomfort, see The Auxetophone and Other Compressed-Air Gramophones. } Despitehigh expectations, Gaumont&apos;s sound innovations had only limited commercial success—though improvements, they still did not satisfactorily address the three basic issues with sound film and were expensive as well. For some years, American inventor E. E. Norton&apos;s Cameraphone was the primary competitor to the Gaumont system (sources differ on whether the Cameraphone was disc- or cylinder-based); it ultimately failed for many of the same reasons that held back the Chronophone. { Altman (2005), pp. 158–65; Altman (1995). } In 1913, Edison introduced a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. Conditions, however, were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after little more than a year. { Gomery (1985), pp. 54–55. } By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses &apos; conception of mankind&apos;s genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph. { Lindvall (2007), pp. 118–25; Carey (1999), pp. 322–23. } Meanwhile, innovations continued on another significant front. In 1907, French-born, London-based Eugene Lauste —who had worked at Edison&apos;s lab between 1886 and 1892—was awarded the first patent for sound-on-film technology, involving the transformation of sound into light waves that are photographically recorded direct onto celluloid. As described by historian Scott Eyman, It was a double system, that is, the sound was on a different piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, where it would be photographed on the side of the film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide. { Eyman (1997), pp. 30–31. } Though sound-on-film would eventually become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, which came to an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process to an audience of scientists in Berlin. [ Sipilä, Kari http://www.finland.cn/Public/default.aspx?contentid%3D99637 A Country That Innovates Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland April 2004 2009-12-08 ] [ http://www.filmsoundsweden.se/backspegel/tigerstedt.html Eric Tigerstedt Film Sound Sweden 2009-12-08 ] { See also A. M. Pertti Kuusela, E.M.C Tigerstedt &quot; Suomen Edison &quot; (Insinööritieto Oy: 1981). } Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. { Bognár (2000), p. 197. } Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate to big-league commercial purposes, and for many years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures. { Gomery (1985), pp. 55–56. } [ Crucial innovations ] A number of technological developments contributed to making sound cinema commercially viable by the late 1920s. Two involved contrasting approaches to synchronized sound reproduction, or playback: Advanced sound-on-film – In 1919, American inventor Lee De Forest was awarded several patents that would lead to the first sound-on-film technology with commercial application. In De Forest&apos;s system, the sound track was photographically recorded on to the side of the strip of motion picture film to create a composite, or &quot; married &quot;, print. If proper synchronization of sound and picture was achieved in recording, it could be absolutely counted on in playback. Over the next four years, he improved his system with the help of equipment and patents licensed from another American inventor in the field, Theodore Case. { Sponable (1947), part 2. } At the University of Illinois, Polish-born research engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner was working independently on a similar process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture to members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. { Crafton (1997), pp. 51–52; Moone (2004); Łotysz (2006). Note that Crafton and Łotysz describe the demonstration as taking place at an AIEE conference. Moone, writing for the journal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&apos;s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, says the audience was &quot; members of the Urbana chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. &quot; } As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner&apos;s system would never be taken advantage of commercially; De Forest&apos;s, however, soon would. { De Forest Phonofilms shorts, touting their technological distinction: no phonograph. } On April 15, 1923, at New York City&apos;s Rivoli Theater, came the first commercial screening of motion pictures with sound-on-film, the future standard: a set of shorts under the banner of De Forest Phonofilms, accompanying a silent feature. { Gomery (2005), p. 30; Eyman (1997), p. 49. } That June, De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee, Freeman Harrison Owens, for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents. Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts, Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field. [ Hall, Brenda J. http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID%3D66 Freeman Harrison Owens (1890–1979) Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture 2008-07-28 2009-12-07 ] The following year, De Forest&apos;s studio released the first commercial dramatic film shot as a talking picture—the two-reeler Love&apos;s Old Sweet Song, directed by J. Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel. { A few sources indicate that the film was released in 1923, but the two most recent authoritative histories that discuss the film—Crafton (1997), p. 66; Hijiya (1992), p. 103—both give 1924. There are claims that De Forest recorded a synchronized musical score for director } { Fritz Lang &apos;s } { Siegfried (1924) when it arrived in the United States the year after its German debut—Geduld (1975), p. 100; Crafton (1997), pp. 66, 564—which would make it the first feature film with synchronized sound throughout. There is no consensus, however, concerning when this recording took place or if the film was ever actually presented with synch-sound. For a possible occasion for such a recording, see the August 24, 1925, &apos;&apos;New York Times&apos;&apos; review of &apos;&apos;Siegfried&apos;&apos;, following its American premiere at New York City&apos;s Century Theater the night before, which describes the score&apos;s performance by a live orchestra. } Phonofilm&apos;s stock in trade, however, was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries, popular music acts, and comedy performances. President Calvin Coolidge, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker, Ben Bernie, Eddie Cantor, and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm&apos;s pictures. Hollywood remained suspicious, even fearful, of the new technology. As Photoplay editor James Quirk put it in March 1924, &quot; Talking pictures are perfected, says Dr. Lee De Forest. So is castor oil. &quot; { Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 20. } De Forest&apos;s process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions, a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures, which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets. By the end of 1930, the Phonofilm business would be liquidated. { Low (1997a), p. 203; Low (1997b), p. 183. } In Europe, others were also working on the development of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. { Robertson (2001), p. 168. } By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system in which sound was recorded on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont would license and briefly put the technology to commercial use under the name Cinéphone. { Crisp (1997), pp. 97–98; Crafton (1997), pp. 419–20. } It was domestic competition, however, that led to Phonofilm&apos;s eclipse. By September 1925, De Forest and Case&apos;s working arrangement had fallen through. The following July, Case joined with Fox Film, Hollywood&apos;s third largest studio, to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed by Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name Movietone, thus became the first viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage. { Sponable (1947), part 4. } In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film. { See Freeman Harrison Owens (1890–1979), op. cit. A number of sources erroneously state that Owens&apos;s and/or the Tri-Ergon patents were essential to the creation of the Fox-Case Movietone system. } Advanced sound-on-disc – Parallel with improvements in sound-on-film technology, a number of companies were making progress with systems in which movie sound was recorded onto phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith &apos;s failed silent film Dream Street. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, Dream Street was re-released, with love song added, at New York City&apos;s Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. { Bradley (1996), p. 4; Gomery (2005), p. 29. Crafton (1997) misleadingly implies that Griffith&apos;s film had not previously been exhibited commercially before its sound-enhanced premiere. He also misidentifies Ralph Graves as Richard Grace (p. 58). } There would be no others for more than six years. { Warner Bros. &apos; &apos;&apos; } { Don Juan &apos;&apos; (1926), the first major motion picture to premiere with a full-length synchronized soundtrack. Audio recording engineer } { George Groves, the first in Hollywood to hold the job, would supervise sound on &apos;&apos; } { Woodstock &apos;&apos;, 44 years later. } In 1925, Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood studio with big ambitions, began experimenting with sound-on-disc systems at New York&apos;s Vitagraph Studios, which it had recently purchased. The Warner Bros. technology, named Vitaphone, was publicly introduced on August 6, 1926, with the premiere of the nearly three-hour-long Don Juan; the first feature-length movie to employ a synchronized sound system of any type throughout, its soundtrack contained a musical score and sound effects, but no recorded dialogue—in other words, it had been staged and shot as a silent film. Accompanying Don Juan, however, were eight shorts of musical performances, mostly classical, as well as a four-minute filmed introduction by Will H. Hays, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, all with live-recorded sound. These were the first true sound films exhibited by a Hollywood studio. { The eight musical shorts were Caro Nome, An Evening on the Don, La Fiesta, His Pastimes, The Kreutzer Sonata, Mischa Elman, Overture &quot; Tannhäuser &quot;, and Vesti La Giubba. } Warner Bros.&apos; The Better &apos;Ole, technically similar to Don Juan, followed in October. { Crafton (1997), pp. 76–87; Gomery (2005), pp. 38–40. } Sound-on-film would ultimately win out over sound-on-disc because of a number of fundamental technical advantages: Synchronization: no interlock system was completely reliable, and sound could fall out of synch due to disc skipping or minute changes in film speed, requiring constant supervision and frequent manual adjustment Editing: discs could not be directly edited, severely limiting the ability to make alterations in their accompanying films after the original release cut Distribution: phonograph discs added expense and complication to film distribution Wear and tear: the physical process of playing the discs degraded them, requiring their replacement after approximately twenty screenings Liebman (2003), p. 398. Nonetheless, in the early years, sound-on-disc had the edge over sound-on-film in two substantial ways: [ Schoenherr, Steven E. http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/dynamic.html Dynamic Range Recording Technology History History Department at the University of San Diego 2002-03-24 2009-12-11 http://web.archive.org/web/20060905003034/http%3A//history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/dynamic.html September 5, 2006 yes ] [ Schoenherr, Steven E. http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html Motion Picture Sound 1910–1929 Recording Technology History History Department at the University of San Diego 1999-10-06 2009-12-11 http://web.archive.org/web/20070429191100/http%3A//history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html April 29, 2007 yes ] Production and capital cost: it was generally less expensive to record sound onto disc than onto film and the exhibition systems—turntable/interlock/projector—were cheaper to manufacture than the complex image-and-audio-pattern-reading projectors required by sound-on-film Audio quality: phonograph discs, Vitaphone&apos;s in particular, had superior dynamic range to most sound-on-film processes of the day, at least during the first few playings; while sound-on-film tended to have better frequency response, this was outweighed by greater distortion and noise As sound-on-film technology improved, both of these disadvantages were overcome. The third crucial set of innovations marked a major step forward in both the live recording of sound and its effective playback: { Western Electric engineer E. B. Craft, at left, demonstrating the } { Vitaphone projection system. A Vitaphone disc had a running time of about 11 minutes, enough to match that of a 1,000-foot reel of 35mm film. } Fidelity electronic recording and amplification – Beginning in 1922, the research branch of AT &amp; T &apos;s Western Electric manufacturing division began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film. In 1925, the company publicly introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders. That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest in just one month later. { Crafton (1997), p. 70. } In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT &amp; T for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months. { Crafton (1997), pp. 71–72. } During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company&apos;s sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs —the new name for the AT &amp; T research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeaker s at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York&apos;s Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of Don Juan.

(ERPI), to handle rights to the company&apos;s film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI&apos;s hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox&apos;s related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. { Gomery (2005), pp. 42, 50. See also Motion Picture Sound 1910–1929, perhaps the best online source for details on these developments, though here it fails to note that Fox&apos;s original deal for the Western Electric technology involved a sublicensing arrangement. } [ http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html 20070429191100 DASHBot ] Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium. [ Triumph of the &quot; talkies &quot; ] In February 1927, an agreement was signed by five leading Hollywood movie companies: the so-called Big Two— Paramount and MGM —a pair of studios in the next rank— Universal and the fading First National —and Cecil B. DeMille &apos;s small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion. The alliance then sat back and waited to see what sort of results the forerunners came up with. { Crafton (1997), pp. 129–30. } In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox&apos;s for use of Western Electric technology. As Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema in different directions, both technologically and commercially—Fox with newsreels and then scored dramas, Warners with talking features—so did ERPI, which sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios. { Gomery (1985), p. 60; Crafton (1997), p. 131. } { Al Jolson and } { May McAvoy accompanies extensive promotional text, including the catchphrase &quot; You&apos;ll see and hear him on Vitaphone as you&apos;ve never seen or heard before &quot;.

On May 20, 1927, at New York&apos;s Roxy Theater, Fox Movietone presented a sound film of the takeoff of Charles Lindbergh &apos;s celebrated flight to Paris, recorded earlier that day. In June, a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York and Washington, D.C., was shown. These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date. { Gomery (2005), p. 51. } In May, as well, Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue: the short They&apos;re Coming to Get Me, starring comedian Chic Sale. { Lasky (1989), pp. 21–22. } After rereleasing a few silent feature hits, such as Seventh Heaven, with recorded music, Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23: Sunrise, by acclaimed German director F. W. Murnau. As with Don Juan, the film&apos;s soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects (including, in a couple of crowd scenes, &quot; wild &quot;, nonspecific vocals). { Eyman (1997), pp. 149–50. } Then, on October 6, 1927, Warner Bros.&apos; The Jazz Singer premiered. It was a smash box office success for the mid-level studio, earning a total of $2.625 million in the U.S. and abroad, almost a million dollars more than the previous record for a Warners&apos; film. { Glancy (1995), p. 4 [online]. The previous highest-grossing Warner Bros. film was Don Juan, which Glancy notes earned $1.693 million, foreign and domestic. Historian Douglas Crafton (1997) seeks to downplay the &quot; total domestic gross income &quot; of The Jazz Singer, $1.97 million (p. 528), but that figure alone would have constituted a record for the studio. Crafton&apos;s claim that The Jazz Singer &quot; was in a distinct second or third tier of attractions compared to the most popular films of the day and even other Vitaphone talkies &quot; (p. 529) offers a skewed perspective. Although the movie was no match for the half-dozen biggest hits of the decade, the available evidence suggests that it was one of the three highest-earning films released in 1927 and that overall its performance was comparable to the other two, } { The King of Kings and } { Wings. It is undisputed that its total earnings were more than double those of the next four Vitaphone talkies; the first three of which, according to Glancy&apos;s analysis of in-house Warner Bros. figures, &quot; earned just under $1,000,000 each &quot;, and the fourth, } { Lights of New York, a quarter-million more. } Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying, like Sunrise and Don Juan, on a score and effects. When the movie&apos;s star, Al Jolson, sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech—one of Jolson&apos;s character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between him and his mother. The &quot; natural &quot; sounds of the settings were also audible. [ Allen, Bob http://www.amps.net/newsletters/issue23/23_jazz.htm Why The Jazz Singer? AMPS Newsletter Association of Motion Picture Sound autumn 1997 2009-12-12 ] { Note that Allen, like many, exaggerates The Jazz Singer s commercial success; it was a big hit, but not &quot; one of the big box office hits of all time &quot;. } Though the success of The Jazz Singer was due largely to Jolson, already established as one of America&apos;s biggest music stars, and its limited use of synchronized sound hardly qualified it as an innovative sound film (let alone the &quot; first &quot; ), the movie&apos;s profits were proof enough to the industry that the technology was worth investing in. { Geduld (1975), p. 166. } The development of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in fits and starts before The Jazz Singer, and the film&apos;s success did not change things overnight. Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. { Crafton (1997), p. 148. } Even with access to both technologies, however, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio beside Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17, 1928, eight months after The Jazz Singer. { Crafton (1997), p. 140. } FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric &apos;s RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, Photophone. Unlike Fox-Case&apos;s Movietone and De Forest&apos;s Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the rule. (In both sorts of system, a specially designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, the lines are of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, the lines are of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood&apos;s newest major studio, RKO Pictures. { Dorothy Mackaill and } { Milton Sills in &apos;&apos;The Barker&apos;&apos;, } { First National &apos;s inaugural talkie. The film was released in December 1928, two months after Warner Bros. acquired a controlling interest in the studio. } Meanwhile, Warner Bros. had released three more talkies, all profitable, if not at the level of The Jazz Singer: In March, The Tenderloin appeared; it was billed by Warners as the first feature in which characters spoke their parts, though only 15 of its 88 minutes had dialogue. Glorious Betsy followed in April, and The Lion and the Mouse (31 minutes of dialogue) in May. { Hirschhorn (1979), pp. 59, 60. } On July 6, 1928, the first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, premiered. The film cost Warner Bros. only $23,000 to produce, but grossed $1.252 million, a record rate of return surpassing 5,000%. In September, the studio released another Al Jolson part-talking picture, The Singing Fool, which more than doubled The Jazz Singer&apos;s earnings record for a Warners movie. { Glancy (1995), pp. 4–5. Schatz (1998) says the production cost of Lights of New York totaled $75,000 (p. 64). Even if this number is accurate, the rate of return was still over 1,600%. } This second Jolson screen smash demonstrated the movie musical&apos;s ability to turn a song into a national hit: inside of nine months, the Jolson number &quot; Sonny Boy &quot; had racked up 2 million record and 1.25 million sheet music sales. { Robertson (2001), p. 180. } September 1928 also saw the release of Paul Terry &apos;s Dinner Time, among the first animated cartoon s produced with synchronized sound. Soon after he saw it, Walt Disney released his first sound picture, the Mickey Mouse short Steamboat Willie. { Crafton (1997), p. 390. } Over the course of 1928, as Warner Bros. began to rake in huge profits due to the popularity of its sound films, the other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology. Paramount, the industry leader, put out its first talkie in late September, Beggars of Life; though it had just a few lines of dialogue, it demonstrated the studio&apos;s recognition of the new medium&apos;s power. Interference, Paramount&apos;s first all-talker, debuted in November. { Eames (1985), p. 36. } The process known as &quot; goat glanding &quot; briefly became widespread: soundtracks, sometimes including a smatter of post-dubbed dialogue or song, were added to movies that had been shot, and in some cases released, as silents. { Crafton (1997) describes the term&apos;s derivation: &quot; The skeptical press disparagingly referred to these [retrofitted films] as &apos;goat glands&apos;  ... from outrageous cures for impotency practiced in the 1920s, including restorative elixers, tonics, and surgical procedures. It implied that producers were trying to put some new life into their old films &quot; (pp. 168–69). } A few minutes of singing could qualify such a newly endowed film as a &quot; musical. &quot; (Griffith&apos;s Dream Street had essentially been a &quot; goat gland. &quot; ) Expectations swiftly changed, and the sound &quot; fad &quot; of 1927 became standard procedure by 1929. In February 1929, sixteen months after The Jazz Singer&apos;s debut, Columbia Pictures became the last of the eight studios that would be known as &quot; majors &quot; during Hollywood&apos;s Golden Age to release its first part-talking feature, Lone Wolf&apos;s Daughter. { The first official releases from RKO (which produced only all-talking pictures) appeared still later in the year, but after the October 1928 merger that created it, the company put out a number of talkies produced by its FBO constituent. } In late May, the first all-color, all-talking feature, Warner Bros.&apos; On with the Show!, premiered. { Robertson (2001), p. 63. } Yet most American movie theaters, especially outside of urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: while the number of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. { Block and Wilson (2010), p. 56. } The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies&apos; universal appeal—through mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. { Crafton (1997), pp. 169–71, 253–54. } Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. Points West, a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio. { In 1931, two Hollywood studios would release special projects without spoken dialogue (now customarily classified as &quot; silents &quot; ): } { Charles Chaplin &apos;s } { City Lights (United Artists) and } { F. W. Murnau and } { Robert Flaherty &apos;s } { Tabu (Paramount). The last totally silent feature produced in the United States for general distribution was The Poor Millionaire, released by Biltmore Pictures in April 1930. Four other silent features, all low-budget Westerns, were also released in early 1930 (Robertson [2001], p. 173). } [ Transition: Europe ] { Marlene Dietrich in &apos;&apos;Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame&apos;&apos; (1929). Dietrich did not sing in the film, but did so the following year in &apos;&apos; } { Der Blaue Engel &apos;&apos;, which made her an international star. } The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. { As Thomas J. Saunders (1994) reports, it premiered the same month in Berlin, but as a silent. &quot; Not until June 1929 did Berlin experience the sensation of sound as New York had in 1927—a premiere boasting dialogue and song &quot; : The Singing Fool (p. 224). In Paris, The Jazz Singer had its sound premiere in January 1929 (Crisp [1997], p. 101). } According to film historian Rachael Low, &quot; Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable. &quot; { Low (1997a), p. 191. } On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (I Kiss Your Hand, Madame). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber.

With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany&apos;s two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. { Gomery (1980), pp. 28–30. } Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system&apos;s value, Tobis also established its own production operations. { See, e.g., Crisp (1997), pp. 103–4. } During 1929, most of the major European filmmaking countries began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe&apos;s first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik&apos;s Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP&apos;s corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: The Clue of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact. { Low (1997a), pp. 178, 203–5; Low (1997b), p. 183; Crafton (1997), pp. 432; } [ http://www.deutsches-filminstitut.de/f_films/film/f018529.htm Der Rote Kreis Deutsches Filminstitut 2009-12-08 ] { Note also that IMDb.com incorrectly refers to Der Rote Kreis/The Crimson Circle as a } { British International Pictures (BIP) coproduction (it also spells Zelnik&apos;s first name &quot; Frederic &quot; ). The authentic BIP production Kitty is sometimes included among the candidates for &quot; first British talkie. &quot; In fact, the film was produced and premiered as a silent for its original 1928 release.

Spoto (1984), pp. 131–32, 136. } The first successful European dramatic talkie was the all-British Blackmail. Directed by twenty-nine-year-old Alfred Hitchcock, the movie had its London debut June 21, 1929. Originally shot as a silent, Blackmail was restaged to include dialogue sequences, along with a score and sound effects, before its premiere. A British International Pictures (BIP) production, it was recorded on RCA Photophone, General Electric having bought a share of AEG in order to gain access to the Tobis-Klangfilm markets. Blackmail was a substantial hit; critical response was also positive—notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle, for example, called it &quot; perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen. &quot; { Quoted in Spoto (1984), p. 136. } On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film industry came out with a talkie: G’schichten aus der Steiermark (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. { Wagenleitner (1994), p. 253; Robertson (2001), p. 10. } On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. { Jelavich (2006), pp. 215–16; Crafton (1997), p. 595, n. 59. } Sweden&apos;s first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with Le Collier de la reine (The Queen&apos;s Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé -Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside of London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later. { Crisp (1997), p. 103; } [ http://www.epinay-sur-seine.fr/epinay/rb010102.asp Epinay ville du cinéma Epinay-sur-Seine.fr 2009-12-08 ] [ Erickson, Hal http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/164397/Le-Collier-De-La-Reine/overview Le Collier de la reine(1929) Allmovie NYTimes.com 2009-12-08 ] [ Chiffaut-Moliard, Philippe http://www.cine-studies.net/r5a0_1930.html Le cinéma français en 1930 Chronologie du cinéma français (1930–1939) Cine-studies 2005 2009-12-08 ] { In his 2002 book Genre, Myth, and Convention in the French Cinema, 1929–1939 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), Crisp says that Le Collier de la reine was &quot; &apos;merely&apos; sonorized, not dialogued &quot; (p. 381), but all other available detailed descriptions (including his own from 1997) mention a dialogue sequence.

According to } { Il Cinema Ritrovato, the program for XXI Mostra Internazionale del Cinema Libero (Bologna; November 22–29, 1992), the film was shot in Paris. According to the IMDb entry on the film, it was a Czech-German coproduction. The two claims are not necessarily contradictory. According to the Czech-Slovak Film Database, it was shot as a silent film in Germany; soundtracks for Czech, German, and French versions were then recorded at the Gaumont studio in the Paris suburb of } { Joinville. } Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures—Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania. { See Robertson (2001), pp. 10–14. Robertson claims Switzerland produced its first talkie in 1930, but it has not been possible to independently confirm this. The first talkies from Finland, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, and Turkey appeared in 1931, the first talkies from Ireland (English-language) and Spain and the first in Slovak in 1932, the first Dutch talkie in 1933, and the first Bulgarian talkie in 1934. In the Americas, the first Canadian talkie came out in 1929—North of &apos;49 was a remake of the previous year&apos;s silent His Destiny. The first Brazilian talkie, Acabaram-se os otários (The End of the Simpletons), also appeared in 1929. That year, as well, the first Yiddish talkies were produced in New York: East Side Sadie (originally a silent), followed by Ad Mosay (The Eternal Prayer) (Crafton [1997], p. 414). Sources differ on whether Más fuerte que el deber, the first Mexican (and Spanish-language) talkie, came out in 1930 or 1931. The first Argentine talkie appeared in 1931 and the first Chilean talkie in 1934. Robertson asserts that the first Cuban feature talkie was a 1930 production called El Caballero de Max; every other published source surveyed cites La Serpiente roja (1937). Nineteen-thirty-one saw the first talkie produced on the African continent: South Africa&apos;s Mocdetjie, in Afrikaans. Egypt&apos;s Arabic Onchoudet el Fouad (1932) and Morocco&apos;s French-language Itto (1934) followed. } The Soviet Union&apos;s robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930: Dziga Vertov &apos;s nonfiction Entuziazm had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; Abram Room &apos;s documentary Plan velikikh rabot (The Plan of the Great Works) had music and spoken voiceovers. { Rollberg (2008), pp. xxvii, 9, 174, 585, 669–70, 679, 733. Several sources name Zemlya zhazhdet (The Earth Is Thirsty), directed by Yuli Raizman, as the first Soviet sound feature. Originally produced and premiered as a silent in 1930, it was rereleased with a non-talking, music-and-effects soundtrack the following year (Rollberg [2008], p. 562). } Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world. { Morton (2006), p. 76. } In June 1931, the Nikolai Ekk drama Putevka v zhizn (The Road to Life or A Start in Life), premiered as the Soviet Union&apos;s first true talking picture. { Rollberg (2008), pp. xxvii, 210–11, 450, 665–66. } Throughout much of Europe, conversion of exhibition venues lagged well behind production capacity, requiring talkies to be produced in parallel silent versions or simply shown without sound in many places. While the pace of conversion was relatively swift in Britain—with over 60 percent of theaters equipped for sound by the end of 1930, similar to the U.S. figure—in France, by contrast, more than half of theaters nationwide were still projecting in silence by late 1932. { Crisp (1997), p. 101; Crafton (1997), p. 155. } According to scholar Colin G. Crisp, &quot; Anxiety about resuscitating the flow of silent films was frequently expressed in the [French] industrial press, and a large section of the industry still saw the silent as a viable artistic and commercial prospect till about 1935. &quot; { Crisp (1997), pp. 101–2. } The situation was particularly acute in the Soviet Union; as of May 1933, fewer than one out of every hundred film projectors in the country was as yet equipped for sound. { Kenez (2001), p. 123. } [ Transition: Asia ] { Heinosuke Gosho &apos;s &apos;&apos;Madamu to nyobo&apos;&apos; (&apos;&apos;The Neighbor&apos;s Wife and Mine&apos;&apos;; 1931), a production of the } { Shochiku studio, was the first major commercial and critical success of Japanese sound cinema.

Though the country&apos;s film industry was among the first to produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, Reimai (Dawn), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. { Burch (1979), pp. 145–46. Note that Burch misdates Madamu to nyobo as 1932 (p. 146; see above for sources for correct 1931 date). He also incorrectly claims that } { Mikio Naruse made no sound films before 1936 (p. 146; see below for Naruse&apos;s 1935 sound films). } Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: Taii no musume (The Captain&apos;s Daughter) and Furusato (Hometown), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. { Anderson and Richie (1982), p. 77. } Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. { Freiberg (1987), p. 76. } Two of the country&apos;s leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujiro Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. { Naruse&apos;s first talking picture, Otome-gokoro sannin shimai (Three Sisters with Maiden Hearts), as well as his widely acclaimed Tsuma yo bara no yo ni (Wife!

The enduring popularity of the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to the tradition of the benshi, a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening. As director Akira Kurosawa later described, the benshi &quot; not only recounted the plot of the films, they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen.... The most popular narrators were stars in their own right, solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre. &quot; { Quoted in Freiberg (1987), p. 76. } Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues, The end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn&apos;t lack anything, least in Japan, where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn&apos;t have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment. { Quoted in } [ Sharp, Jasper http://www.midnighteye.com/features/silentfilm_pt1.shtml A Page of Madness(1927) Midnight Eye 2002-03-07 2009-12-07 ] By the same token, the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound—allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology. { See Freiberg (2000), &quot; The Film Industry. &quot; } { Alam Ara &apos;&apos; premiered March 14, 1931, in Bombay. The first Indian talkie was so popular that &quot; police aid had to be summoned to control the crowds. &quot; Quoted in Chatterji (1999), &quot; The History of Sound. &quot; } { It was shot with the Tanar single-system camera, which recorded sound directly onto the film. } The Mandarin-language Gēnǚ hóng mǔdān ( [ 歌 女 紅 牡 丹 ], Singsong Girl Red Peony), starring Butterfly Wu, premiered as China&apos;s first feature talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of The Devil&apos;s Playground, arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner Fellers is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie. { Reade (1981), pp. 79–80. } In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star Sulochana, excerpted from the silent feature Madhuri (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country&apos;s first. { Ranade (2006), p. 106. } The following year, Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu Alam Ara, and produced Kalidas, primarily in Tamil with some Telugu.

The poster shows a camera unboothed and unblimped, as it might be when shooting a musical number with a prerecorded soundtrack. } In the short term, the introduction of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production. Cameras were noisy, so a soundproofed cabinet was used in many of the earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors, at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera. For a time, multiple-camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots. The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally. Show Girl in Hollywood (1930), from First National Pictures (which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound), gives a behind-the-scenes look at some of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies. Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings, known as &quot; blimps &quot;, designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors. In 1931, a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced: three-way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low, medium, and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass &quot; woofer &quot;, a midrange driver, and a treble &quot; tweeter. &quot; { Millard (2005), p. 189. } There were consequences, as well, for other technological aspects of the cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked in order to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast in order to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. [ Allen, Bob http://www.amps.net/newsletters/issue15/15_lets_.htm Let&apos;s Hear It For Sound AMPS Newsletter Association of Motion Picture Sound autumn 1995 2009-12-13 ] Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical. As David Bordwell describes, technological improvements continued at a swift pace: &quot; Between 1932 and 1935, [Western Electric and RCA] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of film recording, reduced ground noise  ... and extended the volume range. &quot; These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: &quot; Increasing the fidelity of recording  ... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness. &quot; { Bordwell (1985), pp. 300–1, 302. } Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin&apos; in the Rain —was that some silent-era actors simply did not have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, a process known as &quot; looping &quot;, had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes. { Bordwell and Thompson (1995), p. 124; Bordwell (1985), pp. 301, 302. Note that Bordwell&apos;s assertion in the earlier text, &quot; Until the late 1930s, the post-dubbing of voices gave poor fidelity, so most dialogue was recorded direct &quot; (p. 302), refers to a 1932 source. His later (coauthored) description, which refers to the viability of looping in 1935, appears to replace the earlier one, as it should: in fact, then and now, most movie dialogue is recorded direct. } { amplitude of the audio signal at each instant. } With Hollywood&apos;s wholesale adoption of the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved. Over the course of 1930–31, the only major players using sound-on-disc, Warner Bros. and First National, changed over to sound-on-film recording. Vitaphone&apos;s dominating presence in sound-equipped theaters, however, meant that for years to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound-on-disc versions of their films alongside the sound-on-film prints. { Crafton (1997), pp. 147–48. } Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method, leaving two major American systems: the variable-area RCA Photophone and Western Electric&apos;s own variable-density process, a substantial improvement on the cross-licensed Movietone. { See Bernds (1999), part 1. } Under RCA&apos;s instigation, the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible, meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other. { See Crafton (1997), pp. 142–45. } This left one big issue—the Tobis-Klangfilm challenge. In May 1930, Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri-Ergon patents, helping bring Tobis-Klangfilm to the negotiating table. { Crafton (1997), p. 435. } The following month an accord was reached on patent cross-licensing, full playback compatibility, and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment. As a contemporary report describes: Tobis-Klangfilm has the exclusive rights to provide equipment for: Germany, Danzig, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, the Dutch Indies, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Finland. The Americans have the exclusive rights for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Russia. All other countries, among them Italy, France, and England, are open to both parties. { &quot; Outcome of Paris &quot; (1930). } The agreement did not resolve all the patent disputes, and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed over the course of the 1930s. During these years, as well, the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA Photophone&apos;s variable-area approach—by the end of 1936, only Paramount, MGM, and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI. { Crafton (1997), p. 160. } [ Labor ] { Photoplay &apos;&apos;, December 1929, featuring } { Norma Talmadge. As movie historian } { David Thomson puts it, &quot; sound proved the incongruity of [her] salon prettiness and tenement voice. &quot; Thomson (1998), p. 732. } While the introduction of sound led to a boom in the motion picture industry, it had an adverse effect on the employability of a host of Hollywood actors of the time. Suddenly those without stage experience were regarded as suspect by the studios; as suggested above, those whose heavy accents or otherwise discordant voices had previously been concealed were particularly at risk. The career of major silent star Norma Talmadge effectively came to an end in this way. The celebrated German actor Emil Jannings returned to Europe. Moviegoers found John Gilbert &apos;s voice an awkward match with his swashbuckling persona, and his star also faded. { Crafton (1997), pp. 480, 498, 501–9; Thomson (1998), pp. 732–33, 285–87; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 34, 22, 20. } Audiences now seemed to perceive certain silent-era stars as old-fashioned, even those who had the talent to succeed in the sound era. The career of Harold Lloyd, one of the top screen comedians of the 1920s, declined precipitously. { Crafton (1997), p. 480; Wlaschin (1979), p. 26. } Lillian Gish departed, back to the stage, and other leading figures soon left acting entirely: Colleen Moore, Gloria Swanson, and Hollywood&apos;s most famous performing couple, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. { Thomson (1998), pp. 288–89, 526–27, 728–29, 229, 585–86: Wlaschin (1979), pp. 20–21, 28–29, 33–34, 18–19, 32–33. } As actress Louise Brooks suggested, there were other issues as well: Studio heads, now forced into unprecedented decisions, decided to begin with the actors, the least palatable, the most vulnerable part of movie production. It was such a splendid opportunity, anyhow, for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars.... Me, they gave the salary treatment. I could stay on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [Paramount studio chief B. P.] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I&apos;d be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit. { Brooks (1956). } Similarly, Clara Bow &apos;s speaking voice was sometimes blamed for the demise of her Hollywood career, though the real issues involved her clashes with studio executives and what film historian David Thomson describes as the &quot; backlash of bourgeois hypocrisy &quot; against a lifestyle that would have been unremarkable for a male star. { Thomson (1998), pp. 80–81; Crafton (1997), pp. 498–501, 508–9. } Buster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium, but when his studio, MGM, made the changeover to sound, he was quickly stripped of creative control. Though a number of Keaton&apos;s early talkies made impressive profits, they were artistically dismal. { See Dardis (1980), pp. 190–91, for an analysis of the profitability of Keaton&apos;s early sound films. } Several of the new medium&apos;s biggest attractions came from vaudeville and the musical theater, where performers such as Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Jeanette MacDonald, and the Marx Brothers were accustomed to the demands of both dialogue and song. { Thomson (1998), pp. 376–77, 463–64, 487–89; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 57, 103, 118, 121–22. } James Cagney and Joan Blondell, who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930. { Thomson (1998), pp. 69, 103–5, 487–89; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 50–51, 56–57. } A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: Richard Barthelmess, Clive Brook, Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and the incomparable Charlie Chaplin, whose City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects. { Thomson (1998), pp. 45–46, 90, 167, 689–90, 425–26, 122–24; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 45–46, 54, 67, 148, 113, 16–17. } Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless Seventh Heaven and Sunrise, as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar Our Dancing Daughters (1928). { Thomson (1998), pp. 281, 154–56; Wlaschin (1979), pp. 87, 65–66. } Greta Garbo was the one non–native English speaker to achieve Hollywood stardom on either side of the great sound divide. { Thomson (1998), pp. 274–76; Wlaschin (1979), p. 84. } As talking pictures emerged, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.

The AFM had its first encounter with wholesale unemployment brought about by technology. Within three years, 22,000 theater jobs for musicians who accompanied silent movies were lost, while only a few hundred jobs for musicians performing on soundtracks were created by the new technology. 1928 – While continuing to protest the loss of jobs due to the use of &apos;canned music&apos; with motion pictures, the AFM set minimum wage scales for Vitaphone, Movietone and phonograph record work. Because synchronizing music with pictures for the movies was particularly difficult, the AFM was able to set high prices for this work. &quot; } More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped; according to historian Preston J. Hubbard, &quot; During the 1920s live musical performances at first-run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema. &quot; { Hubbard (1985), p. 429. } With the coming of the talkies, those featured performances—usually staged as preludes—were largely eliminated as well. The American Federation of Musicians took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the Pittsburgh Press features an image of a can labeled &quot; Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever &quot; and reads in part: Canned Music on Trial This is the case of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres. The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education. Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music. If the theatre-going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable. Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanisation. It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist, upon the human contact, without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost. [ http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/pg.1/ Canned Music on Trial Ad*Access Duke University Libraries 2009-12-09 ] { The text of the ad continues: Is Music Worth Saving? No great volume of evidence is required to answer this question. Music is a well-nigh universally beloved art. From the beginning of history, men have turned to musical expression to lighten the burdens of life, to make them happier. Aborigines, lowest in the scale of savagery, chant their song to tribal gods and play upon pipes and shark-skin drums. Musical development has kept pace with good taste and ethics throughout the ages, and has influenced the gentler nature of man more powerfully perhaps than any other factor. Has it remained for the Great Age of Science to snub the Art by setting up in its place a pale and feeble shadow of itself? } By the following year, a reported 22,000 U.S. moviehouse musicians had lost their jobs. { Oderman (2000), p. 188. } [ Commerce ] { MGM &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { The Broadway Melody &apos;&apos; was the first smash-hit talkie from a studio other than Warner Bros. and the first sound film to win the } { Academy Award for Best Picture. } In September 1926, Jack Warner, head of Warner Bros., was quoted to the effect that talking pictures would never be viable: &quot; They fail to take into account the international language of the silent pictures, and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play, the action, the plot, and the imagined dialogue for himself. &quot; { &quot; Talking Movies &quot; (1926). } Much to his company&apos;s benefit, he would be proven very wrong—between the 1927–28 and 1928–29 fiscal years, Warners&apos; profits surged from $2 million to $14 million. Sound film, in fact, was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry. During that same twelve-month span, Paramount&apos;s profits rose by $7 million, Fox&apos;s by $3.5 million, and Loew&apos;s/MGM&apos;s by $3 million. { Gomery (1985), pp. 66–67. Gomery describes the difference in profits simply between 1928 and 1929, but it seems clear from the figures cited that he is referring to the fiscal years that ended September 30. The fiscal year roughly paralleled (but was still almost a month off from) the traditional Hollywood programming year—the prime exhibition season began the first week of September with Labor Day and ran through Memorial Day at the end of May; this was followed by a fourteen-week &quot; open season &quot;, when films with minimal expectations were released and many theaters shut down for the hot summer months. See Crafton (1997), pp. 183, 268. } RKO, which hadn&apos;t even existed in September 1928 and whose parent production company, FBO, was in the Hollywood minor leagues, by the end of 1929 was established as one of America&apos;s leading entertainment businesses. { Lasky (1989), p. 51. } Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound: the musical. Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929, and more than eighty the following year. { Bradley (1996), p. 279. } Even as the Wall Street crash of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into depression, the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune. The 1929–30 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous, with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs. Reality finally struck later in 1930, but sound had clearly secured Hollywood&apos;s position as one of the most important industrial fields, both commercially and culturally, in the United States. In 1929, film box-office receipts comprised 16.6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation; by 1931, the figure had reached 21.8 percent. The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half. { Finler (2003), p. 376. } Hollywood ruled on the larger stage, as well. The American movie industry—already the world&apos;s most powerful—set an export record in 1929 that, by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film, was 27 percent higher than the year before. { Segrave (1997) gives the figures as 282 million feet in 1929 compared to 222 million feet the year before (p. 79). Crafton (1997) reports the new mark in this peculiar way: &quot; Exports in 1929 set a new record: 282,215,480 feet (against the old record of 9,000,000 feet in 1919) &quot; (p. 418). But in 1913, for instance, the U.S. exported 32 million feet of exposed film (Segrave [1997], p. 65). Note also that Crafton says of the 1929 exports, &quot; Of course, most of this footage was silent &quot;, though he provides no figures (p. 418). In contrast, if not necessarily contradiction, Segrave points to the following: &quot; At the very end of 1929 the New York Times reported that most U.S. talkies went abroad as originally created for domestic screening &quot; (p. 77). } Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded. In fact, the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers, relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards. The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages, a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-dubbing and subtitling. Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets, by 1937, American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe. { Eckes and Zeiler (2003), p. 102. } { Iberian language. } Just as the leading Hollywood studios gained from sound in relation to their foreign competitors, they did the same at home. As historian Richard B. Jewell describes, &quot; The sound revolution crushed many small film companies and producers who were unable to meet the financial demands of sound conversion. &quot; { Jewell (1982), p. 9. } The combination of sound and the Great Depression led to a wholesale shakeout in the business, resulting in the hierarchy of the Big Five integrated companies (MGM, Paramount, Fox, Warners, RKO) and the three smaller studios also called &quot; majors &quot; (Columbia, Universal, United Artists) that would predominate through the 1950s. Historian Thomas Schatz describes the ancillary effects: Because the studios were forced to streamline operations and rely on their own resources, their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus. Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the studio system finally coalesce, with the individual studios coming to terms with their own identities and their respective positions within the industry. { Schatz (1998), p. 70. } The other country in which sound cinema had an immediate major commercial impact was India. As one distributor of the period said, &quot; With the coming of the talkies, the Indian motion picture came into its own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation. This was achieved by music. &quot; { Quoted in Ganti (2004), p. 11. } From its earliest days, Indian sound cinema has been defined by the musical—Alam Ara featured seven songs; a year later, Indrasabha would feature seventy. While the European film industries fought an endless battle against the popularity and economic muscle of Hollywood, ten years after the debut of Alam Ara, over 90 percent of the films showing on Indian screens were made within the country. { Ganti (2004), p. 11. } Most of India&apos;s early talkies were shot in Bombay, which remains the leading production center, but sound filmmaking soon spread across the multilingual nation. Within just a few weeks of Alam Ara&apos;s March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta -based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai Sasthi. { Rajadhyaksha and Willemen (2002), p. 254; Joshi (2003), p. 14. } The Hindustani Heer Ranjha was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, Sati Sulochana, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. { Guy (2004). } Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India as it did in the United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures. { Rajadhyaksha and Willemen (2002), pp. 30, 32. } Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India has been among the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year. { Robertson (2001), pp. 16–17; } [ http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/Infosheet_No1_cinema_EN.pdf Analysis of the UIS International Survey on Feature Film Statistics UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2009-05-05 2009-12-13 ] [ Aesthetic quality ] In the first, 1930 edition of his global survey The Film Till Now, British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared, &quot; A film in which the speech and sound effects are perfectly synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema. It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema. &quot; { Quoted in Agate (1972), p. 82. } Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form; Alfred Hitchcock, though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe, held that &quot; the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema &quot; and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside &quot; photographs of people talking &quot;. { Quoted in Chapman (2003), p. 93. } In Germany, Max Reinhardt, stage producer and movie director, expressed the belief that the talkies, &quot; bringing to the screen stage plays  ... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself  ... like reproductions of paintings. &quot; { Quoted in Crafton (1997), p. 166. } { Westfront 1918 &apos;&apos; (1930) was celebrated for its expressive re-creation of battlefield sounds, like the doomful whine of an unseen grenade in flight. } In the opinion of many film historians and aficionados, both at the time and subsequently, silent film had reached an aesthetic peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents. { See, e.g., Crafton (1997), pp. 448–49; Brownlow (1968), p. 577. } For instance, despite fading into relative obscurity once its era had passed, silent cinema is represented by eleven films in Time Out &apos;s Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll, held in 1995. The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film—not only in the United States, but also in the West as a whole—was 1929; yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures ( Pandora&apos;s Box [1929], Zemlya [1930], City Lights [1931]) and zero talkies in the Time Out poll. (City Lights, like Sunrise, was released with a recorded score and sound effects, but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a &quot; silent &quot; —spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema.) The earliest sound film to place is the French L&apos;Atalante (1934), directed by Jean Vigo; the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is Bringing Up Baby (1938), directed by Howard Hawks. { Time Out Film Guide (2000), pp. x–xi. } The first sound feature film to receive near-universal critical approbation was Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel); premiering on April 1, 1930, it was directed by Josef von Sternberg in both German and English versions for Berlin&apos;s UFA studio. { Kemp (1987), pp. 1045–46. } The first American talkie to be widely honored was All Quiet on the Western Front, directed by Lewis Milestone, which premiered April 21. The other internationally acclaimed sound drama of the year was Westfront 1918, directed by G. W. Pabst for Nero-Film of Berlin. [ Arnold, Jeremy http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid%3D93569%26amp%3BmainArticleId%3D176230 Westfront 1918 Turner Classic Movies 2009-12-13 ] Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of &quot; the new verisimilitude [that] rendered silent cinema&apos;s former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow, as well as its preference for allegorical characters, anachronistic. &quot; { Kaes (2009), p. 212. } Cultural historians consider the French L&apos;Âge d&apos;Or, directed by Luis Buñuel, which appeared late in 1930, to be of great aesthetic import; at the time, its erotic, blasphemous, anti-bourgeois content caused a scandal. Swiftly banned by Paris police chief Jean Chiappe, it was unavailable for fifty years. { Rosen (1987), pp. 74–76. } The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero-Film&apos;s M, directed by Fritz Lang, which premiered May 11, 1931. { M, for instance, is the earliest sound film to appear in the 2001 &apos;&apos;Village Voice&apos;&apos;: 100 Best Films of the 20th Century poll and the 2002 &apos;&apos;Sight and Sound&apos;&apos; Top Ten poll (among the 60 films receiving five or more votes). See also, e.g., Ebert (2002), pp. 274–78. } As described by Roger Ebert, &quot; Many early talkies felt they had to talk all the time, but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives, providing a rat&apos;s-eye view. &quot; { Ebert (2002), p. 277. } [ Cinematic form ] &quot; Talking film is as little needed as a singing book. &quot; { Quoted in Kenez (2001), p. 123. } Such was the blunt proclamation of critic Viktor Shklovsky, one of the leaders of the Russian formalist movement, in 1927. While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art, others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity. The following year, a group of Soviet filmmakers, including Sergei Eisenstein, proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition, the so-called contrapuntal method, would raise the cinema to &quot; unprecedented power and cultural height. Such a method for constructing the sound-film will not confine it to a national market, as must happen with the photographing of plays, but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea. &quot; { Eisenstein (1928), p. 259. } So far as one segment of the audience was concerned, however, the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation: Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes, &quot; Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse, cinema, on equal terms with hearing people. The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again. &quot; { Hamilton (2004), p. 140. } { André Bazin &apos;s description. &quot; It flung the whole earth onto the screen in a jigsaw of visual images and sounds. &quot; Bazin (1967), p. 155. } On March 12, 1929, the first feature-length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere. The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, it was not a drama, but a documentary sponsored by a shipping line: Melodie der Welt (Melody of the World), directed by Walter Ruttmann. { There is disagreement on the running time of the film. The Deutsches Filminstitut&apos;s webpage on the film gives 48 minutes; the 35 Millimeter website&apos;s entry gives 40 minutes. According to filmportal.de, it is &quot; some 40 minutes &quot;. } This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is &quot; intricate, dynamic, fast-paced  ... juxtapos[ing] similar cultural habits from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score  ... and many synchronized sound effects. &quot; { Moritz (2003), p. 25. } Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: &quot; Melodie der Welt became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse. &quot; { Quoted in Dibbets (1999), pp. 85–86. } Melodie der Welt was a direct influence on the industrial film Philips Radio (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims: To render the half-musical impressions of factory sounds in a complex audio world that moved from absolute music to the purely documentary noises of nature. In this film every intermediate stage can be found: such as the movement of the machine interpreted by the music, the noises of the machine dominating the musical background, the music itself is the documentary, and those scenes where the pure sound of the machine goes solo. { Quoted in Dibbets (1999), p. 85. } Many similar experiments were pursued by Dziga Vertov in his 1931 Entuziazm and by Chaplin in Modern Times, a half-decade later. A few innovative commercial directors immediately saw the ways in which sound could be employed as an integral part of cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In Blackmail, Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character&apos;s monologue so the word &quot; knife &quot; would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. { See Spoto (1984), pp. 132–33; Truffaut (1984), pp. 63–65. } In his first film, the Paramount Applause (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, &quot; They said we couldn&apos;t record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So I said to the sound man, &apos;Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?&apos; &quot; { Milne (1980), p. 659. See also Crafton (1997), pp. 334–38. } Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking. One of the first commercial films to take full advantage of the new opportunities provided by recorded sound was Le Million, directed by René Clair and produced by Tobis&apos;s French division. Premiering in Paris in April 1931 and New York a month later, the picture was both a critical and popular success. A musical comedy with a barebones plot, it is memorable for its formal accomplishments, in particular, its emphatically artificial treatment of sound. As described by scholar Donald Crafton, Le Million never lets us forget that the acoustic component is as much a construction as the whitewashed sets. [It] replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets. Clair created teasing confusions between on- and off-screen sound. He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks, as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football (or rugby) crowd. { Crafton (1997), p. 377. } These and similar techniques became part of the vocabulary of the sound comedy film, though as special effects and &quot; color &quot;, not as the basis for the kind of comprehensive, non- naturalistic design achieved by Clair. Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by Melodie der Welt and Le Million would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre -based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling. As accurately predicted in 1928 by Frank Woods, secretary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, &quot; The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama.... The talking scenes will require different handling, but the general construction of the story will be much the same. &quot; { Quoted in Bordwell (1985), p. 298.
