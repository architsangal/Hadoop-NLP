They were held in Papendal, close to the host city of Arnhem, Netherlands, from June 21 to 30, 1980. [ Sports ] Competitors were divided into four disability categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, visually impaired, and wheelchair. It was the first time that cerebral palsy athletes competed in the Paralympics. Volleyball was added to the program as a new sport.

The 1980 Games thus marked South Africa&apos;s first absence from the Summer Paralympics since it had joined the movement in 1964, and it remained absent until 1992. The Netherlands&apos; decision thus corrected the anomaly whereby South Africa had been banned from the Olympic movement since 1960, while still being authorised to take part in the Paralympic Games. { &quot; &apos;The Netherlands against Apartheid&apos; - 1970s &quot;, International Institute of Social History } { South Africa at the Paralympics, } { International Paralympic Committee } [ ARG 1980 Summer ] [ AUS 1980 Summer ] [ AUT 1980 Summer ] [ BAH 1980 Summer ] [ BEL 1980 Summer ] [ BRA 1980 Summer ] [ CAN 1980 Summer ] [ COL 1980 Summer ] [ TCH 1980 Summer ] [ DEN 1980 Summer ] [ EGY 1980 Summer ] [ ETH 1980 Summer ] [ FIN 1980 Summer ] [ FRA 1980 Summer ] [ GBR 1980 Summer ] [ GRE 1980 Summer ] [ HKG 1980 Summer ] [ ISL 1980 Summer ] [ INA 1980 Summer ] [ IRL 1980 Summer ] [ ISR 1980 Summer ] [ ITA 1980 Summer ] [ JAM 1980 Summer ] [ JPN 1980 Summer ] [ KEN 1980 Summer ] [ KUW 1980 Summer ] [ LUX 1980 Summer ] [ MLT 1980 Summer ] [ MEX 1980 Summer ] [ NED 1980 Summer ] [ NZL 1980 Summer ] [ NOR 1980 Summer ] [ POL 1980 Summer ] [ KOR 1980 Summer ] [ ESP 1980 Summer ] [ SUD 1980 Summer ] [ SWE 1980 Summer ] [ SUI 1980 Summer ] [ USA 1980 Summer ] [ FRG 1980 Summer ] [ YUG 1980 Summer ] [ ZIM 1980 Summer ] [ Medal table ] [ 1980 Summer Paralympics medal table ] The top 10 NPCs by number of gold medals are listed below.
