[ Early life ] He was born on the family farm Klipfontein near Willowmore, Eastern Cape and trained as a lawyer at Victoria College (which later became the University of Stellenbosch ) and the University of Pretoria. { http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569087/Johannes-Gerhardus-Strijdom Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom Retrieved 16 June 2010 } [ Stellenbosch University Historical Notes: A University in the Making http://www.sun.ac.za/university/ 25 March 2010 ] After his studies, Strijdom settled in Nylstroom, Northern Transvaal. He identified strongly with this area and its people and became a local community leader among the Afrikaner s. In 1929, Strijdom was elected to the House of Assembly as MP for Waterberg, representing the National Party (NP) headed by General J.B.M. Hertzog. Strijdom was also leader of the NP in Transvaal, by far the most important province of South Africa, and as such had a strong power base. After the National Party of J.B.M. Hertzog [ South Africa: Government and Politics Denis Worral Ben Roux, Marcus Arkin, Peter Harris, Gerrit Olivier, John Barratt Denis Worral J.L. van Schaik Ltd 1977 19 Second revised (1975), second print (1977) 200 ] merged of with the South African Party of General Jan Smuts and formed the United Party (UP) during the World Economic Crisis in 1932, [ Britannica Online Encyclopedia United Party (UP) (political party, South Africa) http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/616514/United-Party 25 March 2010 ] Strijdom was part of the break-away faction of the National Party, named the Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party ( Purified National Party ). [ South Africa: Government and Politics Denis Worral Ben Roux, Marcus Arkin, Peter Harris, Gerrit Olivier, John Barratt Denis Worral J.L. van Schaik Ltd 1977 19 Second revised (1975), second print (1977) 202 ] Later, after the United Party was formed, the GNP became known as the (Reunited) National Party under the leadership of Dr. D. F. Malan. Malan, Strijdom and their followers distrusted Smuts and opposed his pro-British policy. [ South Africa: Government and Politics Denis Worral Ben Roux, Marcus Arkin, Peter Harris, Gerrit Olivier, John Barratt Denis Worral J.L. van Schaik Ltd 1977 19 Second revised (1975), second print (1977) 201 ] Most of the National Party&apos;s MPs stayed with Hertzog, and as Strijdom was loyal to Malan, he was the only MP from Transvaal to support Malan&apos;s ideals. Strijdom favoured the establishment of a republic, but this was not achieved until 1961. [ South African History Online The Development &amp; Formation of the South African Republic http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/SA-1948-1976/becoming-a-republic.htm 25 March 2010 ] [ Apartheid era ] After the surprising victory of the National Party in 1948, won on the program of implementing a strict program of apartheid or racial segregation and white minority rule, Malan became Prime Minister of South Africa and Strijdom became Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation. Although it was not one of the classic portfolios [ April 2011 ], it was apparently Strijdom&apos;s choice [ April 2011 ] since he had a keen interest in agriculture and was a part-time farmer. Strijdom was not so pleased with the portfolio although he was fond of farming. [ April 2011 ] Malan gave him the portfolio because his young wife disliked Strijdom. [ April 2011 ] That was also why Malan tried his best to get Nicolaas Havenga to succeed him as Prime Minister, rather than Strijdom. [ April 2011 ] [ Prime Minister ] On 30 November 1954, he was elected leader of the National Party and became Prime Minister of South Africa after the resignation of Malan and against the latter&apos;s will, who preferred the more moderate Havenga, Minister of Finance, as his successor. However, Strijdom was popular among NP party members and people trusted him to push things smoothly forward towards a republic, something Malan was considered to be only luke-warm about. During Strijdom&apos;s term as Prime Minister, he moved full steam ahead to remove ties with the British Empire [ South African History Online South Africa: Movement towards a Republic – JG Strijdom http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/SA-1948-1976/jg-strijdom.htm 25 March 2010 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] and deepened the Afrikaner ascendency in South Africa, while strengthening the policy of apartheid. With regard to racial policies, he believed strongly in the perpetuation of white minority rule and during his term &quot; Coloured &quot; voters were removed from the common voters roll and put on a separate Coloured voters roll, something that Malan started to do but could not push through. The extended Treason Trial of 156 activists (including Nelson Mandela ) involved in the Freedom Charter, happened during Strijdom&apos;s term in office. He also managed to further extend the NP&apos;s parliamentary seats during the general election in 1957. Strijdom&apos;s government also severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. During his last year in office, his weak health (thought to be cancer) lead to long terms of absence and he died on 24 August 1958 in Cape Town and is buried in Pretoria in the Heroes&apos; Acre.His father Petrus Gerhardus (Petrus) Strijdom was a very well known farmer and inovator in the Baviaanskloof where Strijdom was born. He owned three farms in the kloof of which the main farm was Sandvlakte on which the local school, church and shop was sited. He owned businesses and shops right down to the Gamtoos valley (birthplace of the well known Koi woman Saartjie Baardman). He also sold Baboon fur and manufactured shoes and soap amongst other products. [ Private life ] JG Strijdom was known for being very dedicated, absolutely honest and incorruptible, but also stubborn and not open for change of course. He was nicknamed The Lion of the North, because he could be rather frightening as a political opponent, although he always remained a gentleman. He was briefly married to the actress Margaretha van Hulsteyn, but they divorced within a year. His second wife was Susan de Klerk, [ A lady who worried about Donald&apos;s shirts Independent Online 1 July 2009 http://www.iol.co.za/general/news/newsprint.php?art_id%3Dvn20090701054542297C305487%26amp%3Bsf%3D 29 March 2010 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] aunt of future President F W de Klerk. Two children were born to Strijdom by his second wife, Johannes and Estelle. Susan Strijdom died in 1999 and Estelle (Crowson) in 2009. [ January 2011 ] There are still various monuments dedicated to him in South Africa. One monument in central Pretoria, which featured his bust, collapsed in 2001 injuring two people.

Struik Publishers 1986 First 156 ] which holds parts of the collapsed bust. Perhaps most notably the Hillbrow Tower in Johannesburg was officially named the J.G. Strijdom Tower until 1995 shortly after the conclusion of apartheid when it was renamed the Telkom Hillbrow Tower. In the western suburb of Johannesburg, i.e. the suburb of Weltevreeden Park, there is a road named JG Strijdom Road, which is named after him.
