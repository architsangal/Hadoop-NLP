[ ] Protactinium ( [ icon ˌ p r oʊ t æ k ˈ t ɪ n i ə m ] [ PROH tak TIN ee-əm ] ) is a chemical element with the symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acid s. It forms various chemical compound s where protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state +5, but can also assume +4 and even +2 or +3 states. The average concentrations of protactinium in the Earth&apos;s crust is typically on the order of a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits. Because of the scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research, and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel. Protactinium was first identified in 1913 by Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring and named brevium because of the short half-life of the specific isotope studied, namely protactinium-234. A more stable isotope of protactinium was discovered in 1918, and therefore the name was changed to protoactinium and then to protactinium in 1949. The new name meant &quot; parent of actinium &quot; and reflected the fact that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium. The longest-lived and most abundant (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 years and is a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium -233 as part of the chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactor s and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediment s which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various geological processes. [ History ] In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the existence of an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten, and thorium below zirconium, leaving the space below tantalum empty, and until the 1950s periodic table s were published with this structure. [ 10.1007/s10698-004-5959-9 A Revised Periodic Table: With the Lanthanides Repositioned Laing, Michael Foundations of Chemistry 7 3 2005 203 ] For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties as tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. In 1900, William Crookes isolated protactinium as an intensely radioactive material from uranium; however, he could not characterize it as a new chemical element and thus named it uranium-X.

His method was still used in the 1950s to isolate [ Th 234 ] and [ Pa 234 ] from uranium compounds.

They named the new element brevium (from the Latin word, brevis, meaning brief or short) because of its short half-life, 6.7  hours for [ Pa 234 ]. { Greenwood, p. 1250 } { Greenwood, p. 1254 } [ Fajans, K. and Gohring, O.

Über das Uran X 2 -das neue Element der Uranreihe Physikalische Zeitschrift 1913 14 877–84 ] In 1918, two groups of scientists, led by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered another isotope of protactinium, 231 Pa having much longer half-life of about 32,000  years. Thus the name brevium was changed to protoactinium as the new element was part of the decay chain of uranium-235 before the actinium (from [ πρῶτος ] = protos meaning first, before). For ease of pronunciation, the name was shortened to protactinium by the IUPAC in 1949. { Greenwood, p. 1251 } The discovery of protactinium completed the last gap in the early versions of the periodic table, proposed by Mendeleev in 1869, and it brought to fame the involved scientists, particularly Meitner. { Shea, William R. Otto Hahn and the rise of nuclear physics, Springer, 1983, ISBN 90-277-1584-X p. 213 } Aristid von Grosse produced 2  milligrams of Pa 2 O 5 in 1927, [ von Grosse, Aristid Das Element 91; seine Eigenschaften und seine Gewinnung 233–245 Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft 10.1002/cber.19280610137 61 1 1928 ] and in 1934 first isolated elemental protactinium from 0.1  milligrams of Pa 2 O 5.

Angewandte Chemie 47 37 650–653 ] He used two different procedures: in the first one, protactinium oxide was irradiated by 35  keV electrons in vacuum. In another method, called the van Arkel–de Boer process, the oxide was chemically converted to a halide ( chloride, bromide or iodide ) and then reduced in a vacuum with an electrically heated metallic filament: [ Grosse A.

For many years, this was the world&apos;s only significant supply of protactinium, which was provided to various laboratories for scientific studies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US is currently providing protactinium at a cost of about 280  USD/gram. { Protactinium, Los Alamos Laboratory } Mendeleev&apos;s 1869 periodic table with a gap for protactinium on the bottom row of the chart, between thorium and uranium [ Occurrence ] Protactinium is one of the rarest and most expensive naturally occurring elements. It is found in the form of two isotopes – 231 Pa and 234 Pa, with the isotope 234 Pa occurring in two different energy states. Nearly all natural protactinium is protactinium-231. It is an alpha emitter and is formed by the decay of uranium-235, whereas the beta radiating protactinium-234 is produced as a result of uranium-238 decay. Nearly all uranium-238 (99.8%) decays first to the 234m Pa isomer. { Protactinium, Argonne National Laboratory, Human Health Fact Sheet, August 2005 } Protactinium occurs in uraninite (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231 Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content is closer to 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic [ Grosse A. V. Agruss M. S. Journal of the American Chemical Society 56 2200 1934 10.1021/ja01325a507 10 ] ), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations on the order of one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite. { Cornelis, Rita Handbook of elemental speciation II: species in the environment, food, medicine &amp; occupational health, Vol. 2, John Wiley and Sons, 2005, ISBN 0-470-85598-3 pp. 520–521 } [ In nuclear reactors ] Two major protactinium isotopes, 231 Pa and 233 Pa are produced from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable and are usually removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, 232 Th via (n,2n) reactions produces 231 Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to 231 Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is a major contributor to the long term radiotoxic ity of spent nuclear fuel. Protactinium-233 is formed upon neutron capture by 232 Th. It further either decays to uranium-233 or captures another neutron and converts into the non-fissile uranium-234. [ Hébert, Alain Applied Reactor Physics http://books.google.com/books?id%3DsibA5ECQ8LoC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA265 17 March 2011 July 2009 Presses inter Polytechnique 978-2-553-01436-9 265– ] 233 Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27 days and high cross section for neutron capture (the so-called &quot; neutron poison &quot; ). Thus instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233 U, a significant fraction of 233 Pa converts to non-fissile isotopes and consumes neutrons, degrading the reactor efficiency. To avoid this, 233 Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactor s, during their operation, so that it only decays to 233 U. This is achieved using several meters tall columns of molten bismuth with lithium dissolved in it. In a simplified scenario, lithium selectively reduces protactinium salts to protactinium metal which is then extracted from the molten-salt cycle, and bismuth is merely a carrier. It is chosen because of its low melting point (271 °C), low vapor pressure, good solubility for lithium and actinides, and immiscibility with molten halide s. { Groult, Henri Fluorinated materials for energy conversion, Elsevier, 2005, ISBN 0-08-044472-5 pp. 562–565 } [ Preparation ] { uraninite ores. } Before the advent of nuclear reactors, protactinium was separated for scientific experiments from uranium ores. Nowadays, it is mostly produced as an intermediate product of nuclear fission in thorium high-temperature reactors: \mathrm{^{232}_{\ 90}Th \ + \ ^{1}_{0}n \ \longrightarrow \ ^{233}_{\ 90}Th \ \xrightarrow[22.3\ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{233}_{\ 91}Pa \ \xrightarrow[26.967\ d] {\beta^-} \ ^{233}_{\ 92}U} The times are half-lives. Protactinium metal can be prepared by reduction of its fluoride with calcium fluoride, [ Marples J. A. C.

[ Physical and chemical properties ] Protactinium is an actinide which is positioned in the periodic table to the left of uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of &quot; poor metals &quot;. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium is similar to that of titanium. { Seitz, Frederick and Turnbull, David Solid state physics: advances in research and applications, Academic Press, 1964, ISBN 0-12-607716-9, pp. 289–291 } Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air.

Fuger The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements 3rd 2006 Springer Dordrecht, The Netherlands Chapter 4: Protactinium 978-1-4020-3555-5 ] Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkali metals. At room temperature, protactinium crystallizes in body-centered tetragonal structure which can be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (fcc) upon cooling from high temperature, at about 1200 °C. { Young, David A. Phase diagrams of the elements, University of California Press, 1991, ISBN 0-520-07483-1, p. 222 } The thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and 700 °C is 9.9 [ -6 ] /°C. Protactinium is paramagnetic and no magnetic transitions are known for it at any temperature. { Buschow, K. H. J. Concise encyclopedia of magnetic and superconducting materials, Elsevier, 2005 ISBN 0-08-044586-1 pp. 129–130 } It becomes superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K. [ Fowler, R. D. et al.

As the electron configuration of the neutral atom is [Rn]7s 2 6d 1 5f 2, the +5 oxidation state corresponds to the low-energy (and thus favored) 5f 0 configuration. Both +4 and +5 states easily form hydroxide s in water with the predominant ions being Pa(OH) 3+, Pa(OH) 2 2+, Pa(OH) 3 + and Pa(OH) 4, all colorless. { Greenwood, p. 1265 } Other known protactinium ions include PaCl 2 2+, PaSO 4 2+, PaF 3+, PaF 2 2+, PaF 6 –, PaF 7 2– and PaF 8 3–. { Greenwood, p. 1275 } [ Chemical compounds ] [ 10.1021/ja01652a011 1954 Sellers Philip A.

The most stable is white pentoxide Pa 2 O 5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500 °C. { Greenwood, p. 1268 } Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO 2.25. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO 2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550 °C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acid s, but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100 °C. [ Elson R. Fried Sherman Sellers Philip Zachariasen W. H. The tetravalent and pentavalent states of protactinium Journal of the American Chemical Society 72 5791 1950 10.1021/ja01168a547 12 ] The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form. Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides with various metals. With alkali metals A, the crystals have a chemical formula APaO 3 and perovskite structure, or A 3 PaO 4 and distorted rock-salt structure, or A 7 PaO 6 where oxygen atoms for a hexagonal close-packed lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated. { Greenwood, p. 1269 } [ 10.1107/S056774087100284X Iyer P.

Systems involving the rare earths Acta Crystallographica 23 740 1967 10.1107/S0365110X67003639 5 ] Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily convert to hydroxides and can form various salts, such as sulfate s, phosphate s, nitrate s, etc. The nitrate is usually white but can be brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400 °C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO 3 ) 4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF &lt; sub &gt; 2 SO &lt; sub &gt; 4 with phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900 °C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO 3 ) 4 into the diphosphate PaP 2 O 7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO 3 groups form pyramids of C 2v symmetry. Heating PaP 2 O 7 in air to 1400 °C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium. [ Halides ] Protactinium(V) fluoride forms white crystals where protactinium ions are arranged in pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement. { Greenwood, p. 1270 } Coordination of protactinium (solid circles) and halogen atoms (open circles) in protactinium(V) fluoride or chloride. Protactinium(V) fluoride and protactinium(V) chloride have a polymeric structure of monoclinic symmetry. There, within one polymeric chain, all the halide atoms lie in one graphite-like plane and form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions. The coordination 7 of protactinium originates from the 5 halide atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms belonging to the nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water. The pentachloride melts at 300 °C and sublimates at even lower temperatures. Protactinium(V) fluoride can be prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with either bromine pentafluoride or bromine trifluoride at about 600 °C, and protactinium(IV) fluoride is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride at 600 °C; a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove atmospheric oxygen leaks into the reaction. Protactinium(V) chloride is prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at temperature of 200–300 °C. The by-products (such as PaOCl 3 ) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800 °C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400 °C; it can also be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at 400 °C. Protactinium bromides are produced by the action of aluminum bromide, hydrogen bromide, carbon tetrabromide or a mixture of hydrogen bromide and thionyl bromide on protactinium oxide. An alternative reaction is between protactinium pentachloride and hydrogen bromide or thionyl bromide. Protactinium(V) bromide has two similar monoclinic forms, one is obtained by sublimation at 400–410 °C and another by sublimation at slightly lower temperature of 390–400 °C.

Crystal Structures of some Protactinium Bromides 1968 737 217 Nature 5130 1968Natur.217..737B ] Protactinium iodides result from the oxides and aluminum iodide or ammonium iodide heated to 600 °C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na 3 PaF 8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F – ions which form a nearly perfect cube. More complex protactinium fluorides are also known such as Pa 2 F 9 { Greenwood, p. 1271 } and ternary fluorides of the types MPaF 6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH 4 ), M 2 PaF 7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH 4 ) and M 3 PaF 8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF 6 formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF 5. These compounds can be obtained by evaporating a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K +, Rb +, Cs + or NH 4 +. A similar variation was observed for the M 2 PaF 7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs 2 PaF 7 and M 2 PaF 7 (M = K, Rb or NH 4 ). [ Asprey L. B. Kruse F. H. Rosenzweig A. Penneman R. A.

PaOBr 3 has a monoclinic structure composed of double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three Pa atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural to that of other actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900 °C. In hydrides and nitrides, protactinium has a low oxidation state of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250 °C, and the nitride is a product of ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800 °C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400 °C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH 4 ) 4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH 4 – ions. { Greenwood, p. 1277 } The proposed structure of the Pa(C 8 H 8 ) 2 molecule [ Organometallic compounds ] Protactinium(IV) forms a tetrahedral complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C 5 H 5 ) 4 ) with four cyclopentadienyl rings, which can be synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C 5 H 5 ) 2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. { Greenwood, pp. 1278–1279 } Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, Pa(C 8 H 8 ) 2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K 2 C 8 H 8, in tetrahydrofuran. [ Isotopes ] [ Isotopes of protactinium ] Twenty-nine radioisotope s of protactinium have been discovered, the most stable being 231 Pa with a half-life of 32,760 years, 233 Pa with a half-life of 27 days, and 230 Pa with a half-life of 17.4 days. All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 1.6 days, and the majority of these have half-lives less than 1.8 seconds. Protactinium also has two nuclear isomer s, 217m Pa (half-life 1.2 milliseconds) and 234m Pa (half-life 1.17 minutes). [ Audi G 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties 2003 3 729 Nuclear Physics A http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf 2003NuPhA.729....3A ] The primary decay mode for isotopes of protactinium lighter than (and including) the most stable isotope 231 Pa (i.e., 212 Pa to 231 Pa) is alpha decay and the primary mode for the heavier isotopes (i.e., 232 Pa to 240 Pa) is beta decay. The primary decay product s of isotopes of protactinium lighter than (and including) 231 Pa are actinium isotopes and the primary decay products for the heavier isotopes of protactinium are uranium isotopes. [ Applications ] Although protactinium is located in the periodic table between uranium and thorium, which both have numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research. Protactinium-231 arises from the decay of uranium-235 formed in nuclear reactors, and by the reaction 232 Th  +  n  →   231 Th  +  2n and subsequent beta decay. It may support a nuclear chain reaction, which could in principle be used to build nuclear weapon s. The physicist Walter Seifritz once estimated the associated critical mass as 750±180  kg, { Seifritz, Walter Nukleare Sprengkörper – Bedrohung oder Energieversorgung für die Menschheit, Thiemig-Verlag (1984), ISBN 3-521-06143-4. } but this possibility (of a chain reaction) has been ruled out by other nuclear physicists since then. { Ganesan, S. et al. &apos;&apos;A Re-calculation of Criticality Property of &lt; sup &gt; 231 &lt; /sup &gt; Pa Using New Nuclear Data&apos;&apos;, Current Science, 1999, &apos;&apos;77  (5) 667–677. } With the advent of highly sensitive mass spectrometers, an application of 231 Pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become possible. So, the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of the formation of minerals. In particular, its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of North Atlantic water bodies during the last melting of Ice Age glacier s. [ 10.1038/nature02494 J. F. McManus, R. Francois, J.-M. Gherardi, L. D. Keigwin, and S. Brown-Leger Collapse and rapid resumption of Atlantic meridional circulation linked to deglacial climate changes Nature 2004 428 6985 834–837 15103371 http://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/pdf/mcmanus-2004.pdf 2004Natur.428..834M ] Some of the protactinium-related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long-living members of the uranium decay chain – uranium, thorium and protactinium, for example. These elements have 6, 5 and 4 f-electrons in the outer shell and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and protactinium, but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for protactinium. Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,750 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate. { Articles &quot; Protactinium &quot; and &quot; Protactinium-231 – thorium-230 dating &quot; in Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th edition, 1995, p. 737 } [ Cheng H Uranium-thorium-protactinium dating systematics Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 62 3437 1998 10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00255-5 1998GeCoA..62.3437C 21–22 ] [ Precautions ] Protactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive and thus all manipulations with it are performed in a sealed glove box. Its major isotope 231 Pa has a specific activity of 0.048 Ci /gram and primarily emits alpha-particles of the energy 5 MeV, which can be stopped by a thin layer of any material. However, it slowly decays, with the half-life of 32,760 years, into 227 Ac, which has a specific activity of 74 Ci/gram, emits both alpha and beta radiation, and has a much shorter half-life of 22 years. 227 Ac, in turn, decays into lighter isotopes with even shorter half-lives and much greater specific activities (SA), as summarized in the table below.

Only about 0.05% of ingested protactinium is absorbed into the blood and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 40% of the protactiniumdeposits in the bones, about 15% goes to the liver, 2% to the kidneys, and the rest leaves the body. The biological half-life of protactinium is about 50 years in the bones, whereas in other organs the kinetics has a fast and slow component. So in the liver 70% of protactinium have a half-life of 10 days and 30% remain for 60 days. The corresponding values for kidneys are 20% (10 days) and 80% (60 days). In all these organs, protactinium promotes cancer via its radioactivity. The maximum safe dose of Pa in the human body is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231 Pa. This isotope is 2.5 [ 8 ] times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid. [ Palshin, E.S. et al. Analytical chemistry of protactinium Moscow Nauka 1968 ] The maximum allowed concentrations of 231 Pa in the air is 3 [ -4 ] Bq/m 3.
