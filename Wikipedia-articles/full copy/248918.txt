The plot of 8-Bit Theater is loosely based on that of the video game Final Fantasy, in which four adventurers, the Light Warriors, must save the world by defeating four powerful demons that represent the four elements, thus relighting four magical orbs tied to the same elements, and, finally, defeating the personification of evil, Chaos.

The Light Warriors themselves tend to cause far more harm than good on their travels and mostly have to be blackmailed, bribed, or threatened into accepting quests. The comic is also not a serious epic; the protagonists and many of the supporting characters are based on and a parody of exaggerated role-playing video game stereotypes [ http://everything2.com/title/8-Bit%2BTheater 8-Bit Theater Triune &amp; Dialogue September 24, 2001 Everything2 December 25, 2009 http://web.archive.org/web/20100206151229/http%3A//everything2.com/title/8-Bit%2BTheater February 6, 2010 no ] to the point where many characters are actually named after their character class es, and much of the humor displayed in 8-Bit Theater is derived from the ineptitude of characters [ http://webcomicoverlook.com/2007/10/25/the-webcomic-overlook-17-8-bit-theater/ #17: 8-Bit Theater El Santo October 25, 2007 The Webcomic Overlook December 25, 2009 ] as well as from the interactions between four protagonists who are travelling together but do not actually like each other very much. The range of comedic devices 8-Bit Theater employs includes droll humor, running gag s, word play, and slapstick, and another significant portion of the humor results from creating reader anticipation for dramatic moments which fail to come. Clevinger has stated that &quot; [his] favorite comics are the ones where the joke is on the reader. &quot; [ http://www.nuklearpower.com/2004/04/03/teaser/ Teaser!

[ Characters ] [ Characters of 8-Bit Theater ] Final Fantasy allowed players to pick their own four-person party from six character classes and name them individually. 8-Bit Theater features six characters that each represent one of the six classes; four of these characters make up the comic&apos;s protagonists, the Light Warriors. [ The Light Warriors ] { Chocobo s. From left to right: Red Mage, Thief, Black Mage and Fighter. } Black Mage — A wizard who is highly proficient in black magic and makes an active effort to be as evil as possible. Fighter — A warrior who is extremely skilled in sword fighting, but also naïve and childlike. Thief — Thief, also known as the Prince of Elfland, employs trickery and argumentation in his pursuit of money. His biggest motivation is greed. Red Mage — Red Mage is versatile almost to the point of obsession and firmly believes that the world is a tabletop role-playing game. He is quite knowledgeable, but also somewhat delusional.

White Mage was assigned by her order to protect fate and to help the Light Warriors save the world. She discreetly follows the Light Warriors around the world for a lengthy portion of the comic to achieve this goal. Black Belt – A talented martial artist and travelling companion of White Mage. Black Belt had an extremely poor sense of direction, to the effect that the laws of physics and spacetime tended to rearrange themselves around him. He was killed by the Fiend Kary in the course of the series. Sarda – An omnipotent wizard who forces the Light Warriors to retrieve the four elemental orbs. He claims to be &quot; The Wizard Who Did It &quot; and uses his powers in an immensely irresponsible and careless manner. The Dark Warriors – A group of villains based on minor enemies from the game. They consist of Garland, Bikke the Pirate, Drizz&apos;l the Dark Elf Prince, and Vilbert Von Vampire. They plot the downfall of the Light Warriors, but are depicted as even more inept than the Light Warriors themselves. The Four Fiends – Powerful elemental beings that guard their respective elemental orbs. They are Lich, Kary, Ur, and Muffin. They were individually killed by the Light Warriors, and then, following their resurrection as a group, killed by Black Mage. [ Plot ] [ section December 2009 ] &apos;&apos;For a plot summary of the game the comic parodies, see Final Fantasy (video game)#Plot. 8-Bit Theater opens with an introductory sequence that explains how the Light Warriors initially meet and decide to form an adventuring party in the kingdom of Corneria, where King Steve&apos;s daughter, Princess Sara, is being held captive by the knight Garland in the nearby Temple of Fiends.

After defeating them, they accidentally summon the third Fiend, Ur (known in the game as Kraken). The Light Warriors kill Ur, retrieve the Water Orb and travel on to Lefein in search of the Air Orb, where they meet Dragoon, the last Dragon Knight, and the evil dragon Muffin, the fourth Fiend, who guards the Orb of Air. During a battle in Muffin&apos;s Sky Castle she is killed by Dragoon. The Sky Castle itself explodes after Fighter and Black Mage take the Air Orb. Upon presenting the final orb to Sarda, he dismissively orders the Light Warriors to return to the Temple of Fiends, where they find that the Dark Warriors have made the temple their base of operations. During the night, Drizz&apos;l summons the Four Fiends from Hell and has them confront the Light Warriors. Black Mage, using evil energy he absorbed from his doppelgänger, kills the fiends, absorbs their evil energies as well and turns on the other Light Warriors. Sarda interrupts the fight and reveals his intent to destroy the Light Warriors himself. Sarda explains himself to be the grown-up version of a child that suffered great harm as a result of the Light Warrior&apos;s actions around the world.

Sarda absorbs the orbs&apos; magic energy as well as Black Mage&apos;s evil energy and easily unmakes not only the Light Warriors&apos; class changes, but also removes their original abilities. Sarda&apos;s power quickly becomes erratic and unstable, and Chaos, the King of Demons, takes the opportunity to possess Sarda&apos;s body and announce his plans to annihilate the universe. However, before a final battle between the Light Warriors and Chaos can begin, he is destroyed off-panel by a group of four White Mages, a party combination that was dismissed in one of the earliest episodes as ineffectual for the game, and all credit for saving the world goes to a group of bystanders, the Dark Warriors. The Epilogue picks up three years later. White Mage visits Red Mage and Dragoon at a restaurant, where they have started up an extremely unsuccessful support group for sole survivors of ancient sects. Afterward, White Mage visits King Thief in Elfland, who has been trying to locate Black Mage and Fighter, in an effort to obtain more riches from their adventure. Black Mage and Fighter find themselves poor and out of work in a remote town, trying to make money by taking job postings in the town square. The epilogue ends with Fighter suggesting that they resume their search for the &quot; Armor of Invincibility &quot; that Fighter has been searching for since the beginning of the comic.
