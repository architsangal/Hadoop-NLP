As of the 2010 United States Census, the township population was 36,184. Freehold Township was first formed on October 31, 1693, and was incorporated as a township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of Freehold Township were taken to form Upper Freehold Township (c. 1731), Millstone Township (February 28, 1844), Jackson Township (March 6, 1844), Atlantic Township (February 18, 1847; now Colts Neck Township), Marlboro Township (February 17, 1848) and Manalapan Township (March 9, 1848). { Snyder, John P. &apos;&apos;The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968&apos;&apos;, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 179-180. Accessed March 15, 2012. } The Battle of Monmouth was fought in what has been preserved as Monmouth Battlefield State Park, which is in Freehold Township and Manalapan. [ History ] On April 12, 1782, at Middletown Point, on the southern coast of Sandy Hook Bay, Joshua Huddy was hanged by British Loyalists under the direction of Richard Lippincott. Patriots discovered Huddy&apos;s body hanging from the gallows the following morning, cut it down and brought it to Freehold Township, where he was buried at Old Tennent Church in an unmarked grave. { The Joshua Huddy era, Monmouth County. Accessed December 14, 2006. } [ Nomenclature ] The township&apos;s title, &apos; freehold &apos;, was manifestly adapted from the English noun (occasionally utilized as an adverb) meaning &quot; the tenure of property held in fee simple for life &quot;. [ Freehold Bypass ] Route 33 once ran through the heart of Freehold, but congestion led to the study of a new freeway alignment. After several years, the freeway was downsized to merely a bypass of Freehold. Construction from near Sweetmans Lane ( CR 527 ) to U.S. Route 9 was finished in 1972. Eventually construction began again and the bypass was extended to Halls Mill Road in 1989. For decades traffic was detoured, and congestion just kept getting worse. The delay was lengthened when an endangered species was found in the path of the proposed roadway. Finally, after nearly 30 years of waiting, the bypass was fully completed in January 2003. Since then, the congestion on Route 33 and Route 33 Business has considerably lessened.
