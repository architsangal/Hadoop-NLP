[ Binaural studio Nothing as It Seems April 25, 2000 Light Years July 18, 2000 ] Binaural is the sixth studio album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour in support of its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took a short break before reconvening toward the end of 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder &apos;s writer&apos;s block, and guitarist Mike McCready entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drug s. The music on the record featured an experimental sound, evident on songs that used binaural recording techniques. The atmospheric tracks, mostly featuring somber lyrics dealing with social criticism, lead the band to convey these themes with images of nebula s in the album artwork. Binaural received positive reviews, and debuted at number two on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200. Although the record was certified gold by the RIAA, it became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status in the United States. The album&apos;s 2000 tour spawned a large collection of official bootleg releases. [ Recording ] Similar to the process for Yield, the band members worked on material individually before starting the recording sessions together.

Gossard stated that the band &quot; felt like it was time to try something new, &quot; and that they &quot; were ready for a change. &quot; [ Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready Total Guitar Future Publishing November 2002 1355-5049 103 ] Instead the band hired producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of binaural recording. Binaural recording techniques, which employ two microphones to create a 3-D stereophonic sound, were utilized on several tracks, such as the acoustic &quot; Of the Girl. &quot; Regarding Blake, Gossard said, &quot; He was just there for us the whole time, wanting us to create different moods. &quot; [ Kaufman, Gil http://web.archive.org/web/20010306062047/www.sonicnet.com/rock/features/Pearl_Jam/051500/index02.jhtml 2001-03-06 http://www.sonicnet.com/rock/features/Pearl_Jam/051500/index02.jhtml Pearl Jam&apos;s Anti-Career Sonicnet 2000-05-15 2012-02-12 ] This was the first Pearl Jam studio album following the departure of drummer Jack Irons, and features drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who had previously drummed on Pearl Jam&apos;s U.S. Yield Tour.

The album was initially mixed at Sunset Sound Factory in Los Angeles, California with Blake; however, the band proved to be dissatisfied with how the mixes turned out.

For the heavier songs, the group brought in former producer O&apos;Brien, [ Calil, Ricardo http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/89revistarock.shtml A Sombra e A Escuridão Portuguese 89 Revista Rock 1415-174X 2000 Price ] who remixed the tracks at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. { (2000) Album notes for Binaural by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

He decided to not write any more music, and to focus only on lyrics, even banning himself from playing guitar. Unable to write more lyrics, Vedder said he saw a ukulele and thought &quot; that&apos;s not a guitar, &quot; and wrote the song &quot; Soon Forget &quot; using the ukulele.

Gossard recalled that &quot; everyone wasn&apos;t on the same page &quot; due to McCready&apos;s absence and the familiarization with Cameron.

There is a lot of music out there that is very easy to digest but we never wanted to be part of it. &quot; As described by critic Jon Pareles on his review for Rolling Stone, Pearl Jam distances itself from the grunge that made them famous and &quot; delve[s] elsewhere: jumpy post-punk and somber meditations, tightly wound folk rock and turbulent, neopsychedelic rockers that sound like they boiled out of jam sessions. &quot; A few songs on the album show classic rock influences. The intro to the opening track &quot; Breakerfall &quot; uses a guitar riff similar to The Who song &quot; I Can See for Miles &quot; (from the 1967 album, The Who Sell Out ). Additionally, &quot; Soon Forget &quot;, which features Vedder playing a ukulele, is heavily influenced by The Who song &quot; Blue, Red and Grey &quot; (from the 1975 album, The Who by Numbers ), with Vedder describing it as &quot; 30 seconds of plagiarising &quot; and thanking Pete Townshend on the lyric sheet.

Bassist Jeff Ament wrote the lyrics for two songs on the album ( &quot; Gods&apos; Dice &quot; and &quot; Nothing as It Seems &quot; ), and Gossard for three ( &quot; Thin Air, &quot; &quot; Of the Girl &quot; and &quot; Rival &quot; ). The album is lyrically darker than the band&apos;s previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as &quot; pretty somber. &quot; [ Mulvey, John http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/nme_51300.shtml Interview with Pearl Jam NME 0028-6362 IPC Media 2000-05-13 2012-02-12 ] Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album&apos;s lyrics by stating, &quot; I think what everyone&apos;s looking for, y&apos;know, is freedom...That&apos;s part of being comfortable in your own skin. I know I had a problem with being told what to do, and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think its important to know when you have it, too. &quot; Ament stated that &quot; Gods&apos; Dice &quot; is about &quot; judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not &quot;, and that &quot; Nothing as It Seems &quot; is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana.

Gossard has said that the song &quot; Rival &quot; is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.

Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used with the permission of NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, &quot; The reason that we went with Tchad [Blake] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we&apos;ve been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it&apos;s still pretty [ minuscule ]. I think for me the whole space theme has a lot to do with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture. &quot; The album&apos;s title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks. Binaural literally means &quot; having or relating to two ears. &quot; Regarding the choice of the title, Gossard said, &quot; When we looked up the word &apos;binaural,&apos; it meant to listen with both ears.

In the review, Binaural In the review, Binaural is called &quot; a seething, furious album; a declamatory statement against cynicism and passivity and the simple injustices of everyday life &quot; and that &quot; even when the band slow the pace, the songs are coloured by a heartfelt intensity. &quot; Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying, &quot; The songs are sharper, the production is layered, and the performances are as compassionate as ever, resulting in their finest album since Vitalogy. &quot; Time reviewer Christopher John Farley noted that the album is &quot; less impatient and rage filled than much of Pearl Jam&apos;s earlier work. &quot; Farley added that &quot; Pearl Jam, rather quietly, is building a long-term career to rival the rock legends of the past. &quot; Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, considering that the &quot; weighty subjects [give] Pearl Jam&apos;s introspective lyrics and stone-faced rock a refreshing edge &quot; and adding that &quot; if PJ long ago lost the zeitgeist, at least they&apos;ve kept a hold on their hearts. &quot; Critic Robert Christgau described the album as &quot; Rock as inner struggle, eternally externalized. &quot; Spin gave the album seven out of 10 stars, writing that &quot; Everything you want is still there—goofy experimentalism, guitar frenzy, Eddie&apos;s self-abusive wail. It&apos;s just more solid, more clear. &quot; Q gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that &quot; Grunge may have died, but Pearl Jam it seems will never be slayed. &quot; Rolling Stone staff writer Jon Pareles gave the album three out of five stars, feeling that the album &quot; comes across as part of an extended conversation among the five band members...and fans loyal enough to check in for Pearl Jam&apos;s latest musings on love, death and social responsibility. &quot; The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars, stating that Pearl Jam &quot; are dignified, musicianly, sincere... and a teensy bit dull &quot; and observing that &quot; Vedder&apos;s affecting vocal angst drowns in a sea of pessimistic riffola. &quot; The review called Binaural &quot; a warts-and-all album; it has grabbers, songs that sink in slowly and a few absolute duds. &quot; At the 2001 Grammy Awards, &quot; Grievance &quot; received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.
