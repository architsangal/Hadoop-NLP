An innocent, affectionate gesture between the two during a song (Clark touched Belafonte on the arm) prompts concern from the show&apos;s sponsor ( Chrysler Corporation ) due to the difference in their races, but the scene is aired intact at Clark&apos;s insistence. The special airs to high ratings and marks the first time two different races share friendly bodily contact on American television.
