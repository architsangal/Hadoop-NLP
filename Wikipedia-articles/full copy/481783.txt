Ross, 1976 Canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com 2011-11-30 ] Ross placed Sir Barton in the hands of trainer H. Guy Bedwell and jockey Johnny Loftus. [ Triple Crown ] At three, Sir Barton made his season debut as a maiden in the Kentucky Derby. He was supposed to be the rabbit for his highly regarded stablemate, a horse named Billy Kelly. (A rabbit is a speed horse set up to wear out the rest of the field, thereby allowing another horse to win.) However, it was Sir Barton who led the field of 12 horses from start to finish, winning the race by five lengths.

He then won the Withers Stakes in New York and shortly thereafter completed the first Triple Crown in U.S. history by easily winning the Belmont Stakes, setting an American record for the mile and three-eighths race, the distance for the Belmont at the time. Amazingly, Sir Barton&apos;s four wins were accomplished in a space of just 32 days. He has been retrospectively honored as the 1919 Horse of the Year, American racing&apos;s highest honor. [ 1920: four-year-old season ] As a four-year-old, Sir Barton won five of the 12 races he entered during the 1920 season. In one of these races, the Saratoga Handicap, he beat the great Exterminator.

Sir Barton, bothered by sore hooves on Kenilworth&apos;s hard surface, was beaten by seven lengths. [ Retirement and stud ] He retired to stud that year, virtually forgotten by the public. In 1922 Ross sold Sir Barton to B. B. Jones who stood him at his Audley Farm in Berryville, Virginia, where he remained until 1933. In December 2008, a statue was unveiled of Sir Barton in front of Audley Farm&apos;s stallion barn.
