Pharmacological inhibition of COX can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug s, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, exert their effects through inhibition of COX. The names &quot; prostaglandin synthase (PHS) &quot; and &quot; prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase (PES) &quot; are still used to refer to COX. [ Function ] [ Prostaglandin Eicosanoid ] COX converts arachidonic acid (AA, an ω-6 PUFA ) to prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2 ), the precursor of the series-2 prostanoid s. The enzyme contains two active sites: a heme with peroxidase activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG 2 to PGH 2, and a cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G 2 (PGG 2 ). The reaction proceeds through H atom abstraction from arachidonic acid by a tyrosine radical generated by the peroxidase active site. Two O 2 molecules then react with the arachidonic acid radical, yielding PGG 2. At present, three COX isoenzyme s are known: COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3. COX-3 is a splice variant of COX-1, which retains intron one and has a frameshift mutation; thus some prefer the name COX-1b or COX-1 variant (COX-1v). [ Chandrasekharan NV, Dai H, Roos KL, Evanson NK, Tomsik J, Elton TS, Simmons DL COX-3, a cyclooxygenase-1 variant inhibited by acetaminophen and other analgesic/antipyretic drugs: Cloning, structure, and expression Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99 21 13926–31 2002 October 12242329 129799 10.1073/pnas.162468699 ] Different tissues express varying levels of COX-1 and COX-2. Although both enzymes act basically in the same fashion, selective inhibition can make a difference in terms of side-effects. COX-1 is considered a constitutive enzyme, being found in most mammalian cells. COX-2, on the other hand, is undetectable in most normal tissues. It is an inducible enzyme, becoming abundant in activated macrophage s and other cells at sites of inflammation. More recently, it has been shown to be upregulated in various carcinomas and to have a central role in tumorigenesis. Both COX-1 and -2 (also known as PGHS-1 and -2) also oxygenate two other essential fatty acids – DGLA (ω-6) and EPA (ω-3) – to give the series-1 and series-3 prostanoids, which are less inflammatory than those of series-2. DGLA and EPA are competitive inhibitor s with AA for the COX pathways. This inhibition is a major mode of action in the way that dietary sources of DGLA and EPA (e.g., borage, fish oil ) reduce inflammation. [ Simopoulos AP Omega-3 fatty acids in inflammation and autoimmune diseases J Am Coll Nutr 21 6 495–505 2002 December 12480795 ] The cyclooxygenase reaction mechanism. [ Pharmacology ] In terms of their molecular biology, COX-1 and COX-2 are of similar molecular weight, approximately 70 and 72 k Da, respectively, and having 65% amino acid sequence homology and near-identical catalytic sites. The most significant difference between the isoenzymes, which allows for selective inhibition, is the substitution of isoleucine at position 523 in COX-1 with valine in COX-2. The smaller Val 523 residue in COX-2 allows access to a hydrophobic side-pocket in the enzyme (which Ile 523 sterically hinders). Drug molecules, such as DuP-697 and the coxibs derived from it, bind to this alternative site and are considered to be selective inhibitors of COX-2. [ Classical NSAIDs ] [ Mechanism of action of aspirin ] The main COX inhibitors are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug s (NSAIDs). The classical COX inhibitors are not selective and inhibit all types of COX. The resulting inhibition of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis has the effect of reduced inflammation, as well as antipyretic, antithrombotic and analgesic effects. The most frequent adverse effect of NSAIDs is irritation of the gastric mucosa as prostaglandin s normally have a protective role in the gastrointestinal tract. Some NSAIDs are also acidic which may cause additional damage to the gastrointestinal tract. [ Newer NSAIDs ] Selectivity for COX-2 is the main feature of celecoxib, rofecoxib, and other members of this drug class. Because COX-2 is usually specific to inflamed tissue, there is much less gastric irritation associated with COX-2 inhibitors, with a decreased risk of peptic ulceration. The selectivity of COX-2 does not seem to negate other side-effects of NSAIDs, most notably an increased risk of renal failure, and there is evidence that indicates an increase in the risk for heart attack, thrombosis, and stroke through an increase of thromboxane unbalanced by prostacyclin (which is reduced by COX-2 inhibition). Rofecoxib (brand name Vioxx ) was withdrawn in 2004 because of such concerns. Some other COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such as celecoxib, and etoricoxib, are still on the market. [ Natural COX inhibition ] Culinary mushrooms, like Maitake, may be able to partially inhibit COX-1 and COX-2.

A 2006 analysis of 138 randomised trials and almost 150 000 participants [ Kearney PM, Baigent C, Godwin J, Halls H, Emberson JR, Patrono C Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis?
