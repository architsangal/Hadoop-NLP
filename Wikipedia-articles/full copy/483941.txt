It was established in 1969, incorporating Chetham&apos;s Hospital School, founded as a charity school by Humphrey Chetham in 1653. After becoming a boys&apos; grammar school in 1952, the school turned to music as its specialism, and became an independent school. There are approximately 290 pupils on roll, making it the largest music school in the United Kingdom. The oldest parts of the school date to the 1420s, when the building was constructed as a residence for priests of the church now Manchester Cathedral; these parts are listed building s, along with other parts of the complex. The site houses Chetham&apos;s Library, the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom.

Chetham&apos;s educates students between the ages of 8 and 18. Although admission is based solely on an audition to demonstrate musical potential and talent, the school regularly obtains good exam results. It maintains links to the cathedral by educating its choristers and holding regular concerts, and many Chetham&apos;s students have become professional musicians. Its ensembles, such as the Big Band and Symphony Orchestra, and many students have won awards for their music. [ History ] [ Beginnings ] The school is built on the site of Manchester Castle, a fortified manor house owned by the Grelleys after the Norman Conquest, at the confluence of the River Irwell and the River Irk. { Hartwell, p.10 } Medieval Manchester grew around the manor house and the parish church, which eventually became Manchester Cathedral. { Hartwell, p.12 } In the early 14th  century, the de la Warre family acquired the land through marriage. Thomas de la Warre refounded the church as a collegiate church in 1421. { Hartwell, p.13 } De la Warre gave the site of his manor house for the construction of a college, { Hartwell, p.20 } where eight priests, four clerks and six lay choristers lived in the care of a warden. { Hartwell, p.14 } It is likely that building began between 1424 and 1429, { Hartwell, p.21 } and the main hall and cloister rooms finished by 1458. { Hartwell, p.43 } It remains the most complete building of its kind in the country, and at the time of its construction, was the second largest building in Manchester, surpassed only by the church. The college was dissolved during the English Reformation in 1547, and purchased by Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby. { Hartwell, p.49 } It was re-founded by Queen Mary, before Elizabeth I refounded it as &quot; Christ&apos;s College &quot; in 1578. This arrangement lasted until the foundation of Manchester Cathedral in 1847. { Hartwell, p.50 } The college buildings remained the property of the Stanleys, and wardens (including the Elizabethan astronomer and mathematician John Dee ) lived on the premises with their families and servants. { Hartwell, p.51 } During the English Civil War, the college was used as a gunpowder factory and a prison. Lord James Stanley, a Royalist, was executed in 1651, and Parliament confiscated his property, including the college. { Hartwell, p.54 } [ Humphrey Chetham ] Chetham, by an unknown artist, painted after his death Humphrey Chetham (1580–1653) was an unmarried and childless financier, philanthropist and cloth merchant from Manchester. In the 1640s, he provided money for the maintenance and education of fourteen poor boys from Manchester, six from Salford, and two from Droylsden. { Oxford University Press } { http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5243 } { 19 December 2010 } In March 1649 he wrote to the Earl of Derby about his intention to establish a school. He attempted unsuccessfully to acquire the buildings of the Manchester College, which were &quot; spoyld and ruin&apos;d and become like a dunghill &quot;, to provide a hospital, school and library. { Hartwell, p.56 } In his will, Chetham left over £8,000 from his estate (which was worth about £14,000 in total) to establish a hospital school for 40  poor local boys, between the ages of six and ten from &quot; honest &quot; families, who should be taught and cared for until they were 14. { Hartwell, p.93 } { Hartwell, p.61 } His executors obtained the lease of the college where Chetham wished to house the school and library in 1654. { Hartwell, p.62 } [ Charity school ] After repairs to the college were completed in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. { Hartwell, p.64 } The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, { Hartwell, p.65 } and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. { Hartwell, p.89 } The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. { Hartwell, p.91 } Boys were admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not admitted, and all boys had to be able to read to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. { Williams, p.3 } In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall ) was built in a Tudor style. { Williams, p.33 } The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased to 99. In 1916, no boys were admitted due to lack of funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, { Williams, p.40 } which meant that while they lived at Chetham&apos;s, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18. { Williams, p.41 } [ World War II and aftermath: 1939 to 1952 ] During World War II, the boys were evacuated to the seaside town of Cleveleys, Lancashire, where they shared accommodation with a primary school. Chetham&apos;s was damaged by an explosion in December 1940, when most of the windows were shattered and the roof was set alight. { Williams, p.46 } The boys relocated to Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, in 1943 where all 41 boys were together. Thirteen boys attending grammar school moved to Buxton College. By 1944 the governors believed that it would not be appropriate for the school to return to Manchester, and it was proposed the site become a religious education centre. { Williams, p.47 } However, after years of discussion, it was decided to return the school to Manchester. { Williams, p.50 } The Education Act 1944, { Williams, p.49 } which stipulated that schools should be classified as primary or secondary, complicated matters, since Chetham&apos;s went across the middle. { Williams, pp.49–50 } It was decided in 1950 that Chetham&apos;s should become a grammar school, and this change took place two years later. In 1950, Chetham&apos;s amalgamated with Nicholls&apos; Hospital School, { Williams, p.54 } a similar school based in Ardwick which had been established in 1863. While it could take up to 100 boys, by the end of the war there were only 22 and it was considered beneficial for the schools to merge. { Williams, p.55 } [ Later history: since 1952 ] { listed building. } After the change in organisation, Chetham&apos;s could no longer afford to provide education based on scholarships and other allowances, and charged fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, which opened in 1955. { Williams, pp.61–2 } Numbers of boys admitted increased significantly while the number of boarders remained about the same, day pupils increasing the number on roll in 1960 to 230, 64 of which were boarders. { Williams, p.59 } Before becoming a specialist school, Chetham&apos;s had a good reputation for music, { Williams, p.86 } and on this basis the decision was made to become a co-educational music school in 1969. { Williams, p.87 } The former Palatine Hotel, which housed offices and shops, was converted into extra teaching space and practice rooms. In 1969, 50 students were admitted based on musical potential { Williams, p.89 } and by 1972 this had risen to 150, more than half of the entire school. In 1977 the school changed to its present name. { Williams, p.101 } In 1978 the Long Millgate building, the original home of Manchester Grammar School, was purchased to provide additional space. { Hartwell, p.110 } There are plans to build teaching space and a 400-seat concert hall on land next to the school.
