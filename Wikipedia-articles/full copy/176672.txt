Hardy ( CEO ) Lady Gaga ( Creative Director ) Optics Digital camera s, Polaroid Eyewear PLR IP Holdings, LLC www.polaroid.com ] Polaroid Corporation is an American-based international consumer electronics and eyewear company, originally founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land. It is most famous for its instant film camera s, which reached the market in 1948, and continued to be the company&apos;s flagship product line until the February 2008 decision to cease all production in favor of digital photography products. [ Jewell Mark After 60 years, Polaroid quits instant film business Associated Press 2008-02-08 http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/02/08/after_60_years_polaroid_quits_its_instant_film_business/ 2008-02-16 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] The company&apos;s original dominant market was in polarized sunglasses, an outgrowth of Land&apos;s self-guided research in polarization after leaving Harvard University after his freshman year—he later returned to Harvard to continue his research. After Polaroid defeated Kodak in a patent battle, Kodak left the instant camera business on January 9, 1986. Polaroid developed an instant movie system, Polavision, based on the Dufaycolor process. The product arrived on the market when videotape based systems were rapidly gaining popularity. As a result, Polavision was unsuccessful and most of the manufactured product was sold off as a job lot at immense cost to the company. Its underlying technology was later improved for use in the Polachrome instant slide film system. The company also was one of the early manufacturers of digital cameras, with the PDC-2000 in 1996; { Polaroid PDC-2000 Digital Camera } however, they failed to capture a large market share in that segment. They also made 35  mm and multi format scanners, such as Polaroid SpiritScan 4000 35  mm scanner (the first scanner with a 4000 DPI CCD) in 1999, and the Polaroid PrintScan 120 in 2000, the scanners had mixed reception and had heavy competition with Nikon and Minolta. All the line was discontinued after the firm went bankrupt. On October 11, 2001, Polaroid Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Almost all the company&apos;s assets (including the &quot; Polaroid &quot; name itself) were sold to a subsidiary of Bank One. They went on to form a new company, which also operates under the name &quot; Polaroid Corporation &quot;. { &quot; Polaroid and One Equity Partners Complete Asset Acquisition &quot;, New Polaroid Corporation. Press release dated 2002-07-31, retrieved 2006-12-01. } It stopped making Polaroid cameras in 2007 and stopped selling Polaroid film after 2009, to the consternation of many users. { Polaroid Abandons Instant Photography } { Industries Frantic To Find Polaroid Instant Film } The renamed &quot; old &quot; Polaroid now exists solely as an administrative shell. { Front page, Primary PDC website. Retrieved 2006-11-30. } Its bankruptcy was widely believed to be the result of the failure of its senior management to anticipate the effect of digital cameras on its film business. On December 18, 2008, the post-reorganization Polaroid Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. The bankruptcy filing came shortly after the criminal investigation of its parent company, Petters Group Worldwide, and the parent company founder, Tom Petters. { Front page, Bloomberg News.

[ Bankruptcy and the &quot; new &quot; Polaroid Corporation ] [ &quot; Chapter 11 &quot; controversy ] The original Polaroid Corporation filed for federal bankruptcy protection on October 11, 2001. The outcome was that within ten months, most of the business (including the &quot; Polaroid &quot; name itself { &quot; Shareholders &quot;, Primary PDC website. Retrieved 2006-11-30. } and non-bankrupt foreign subsidiaries) had been sold to Bank One &apos;s One Equity Partners (OEP). OEP Imaging Corporation then changed its name to Polaroid Holding Company (PHC). { Frieswick, Kris, &quot; What&apos;s wrong with this picture? &quot;, cfo.com.

Retrieved 2006-11-30. } However, this new company operates using the name of its bankrupt predecessor, Polaroid Corporation. As part of the settlement, the original Polaroid Corporation changed its name to Primary PDC, Inc. Having sold its assets, it was now effectively nothing more than an administrative shell. Primary PDC received approximately 35 percent of the &quot; new &quot; Polaroid, which was to be distributed to its unsecured creditor s (including bondholders { O&apos;Neill, Jerry &quot; The New Polaroid: After Chapter 11 &quot;, &quot; From the October 2002 Issue of Imaging Business &quot; via imaginginfo.com.

[ 2006 As of late 2006 ], Primary PDC remains in existence under Chapter 11 protection, but conducts no commercial business and has no employees. Significant criticism surrounded this &quot; takeover &quot; because the process left executives of the company with large bonuses, while stockholders, as well as current and retired employees, were left with nothing. [ Use of Polaroid brand following bankruptcy ] After the bankruptcy, the Polaroid brand was licensed for use on other products with the assistance of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. In September 2002, World Wide Licenses, a subsidiary of The Character Group plc, was granted the exclusive rights for three years to manufacture and sell digital cameras under the Polaroid brand for distribution internationally. { Press release for camera licensing agreement (PDF), World Wide Licenses Ltd.

On April 27, 2005, Petters Group Worldwide announced its acquisition of PHC. Petters has in the past bought up failed companies with well-known names for the value of those names. The same year, Flextronics purchased Polaroid&apos;s manufacturing operations and the decision was made to send most of the manufacturing to China. { RRPC Newsletter, Issue 15, September 2005. } The &quot; new &quot; Polaroid Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 18, 2008. { &quot; Tom Petters&apos; Polaroid files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy &quot;, Star Tribune.
