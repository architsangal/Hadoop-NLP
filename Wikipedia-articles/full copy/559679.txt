The low, flat ceiling at the west end was built to accommodate a proposed freeway ramp to Interstate 66, which was never built. Service began on March 27, 1976. Farragut North station features unique architecture throughout the system. Its mezzanine stretches across more of the platform and is longer than most, with an open depression looking onto the platform in the middle. There are two elevated &quot; aisles &quot; that serve different escalators and exits. Special buttress-like structures support these stretches of the mezzanine.
