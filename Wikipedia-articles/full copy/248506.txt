[ Royal March the former Italian anthem Marcia Reale ] { None } { Unknown } { 1770 } { Marcha Real.ogg } { La Marcha Real } { Spanish National Anthem in one of its three official versions, the one performed by a Symphonic Orchestra. } [ es La Marcha Real ] ( &quot; The Royal March &quot; ) is the national anthem of Spain. It is one of the few national anthems in the world to have no official lyrics [ http://nationalanthems.me/spain-marcha-real/ Spain - Marcha Real NationalAnthems.me 2011-11-23 ] (together with San Marino ). The anthem, one of the oldest in the world, was first printed in a document dated 1761 and entitled Libro de Ordenanza de los toques militares de la Infantería Española (The Spanish Infantry&apos;s Book of Military Bugle and Fife Calls), by Manuel de Espinosa. Here it is entitled [ es La Marcha Granadera ] ( &quot; March of the Grenadier s &quot; ), although no composer&apos;s name is given. In 1770, King Charles III declared the [ es Marcha Granadera ] to be the official &quot; Honour March &quot; for the Sovereigns and the Royal Family, as it was played at public and ceremonial events, and because it was always played at public events attended by the royal family, Spaniards soon came to regard the [ es Marcha Granadera ] as their national anthem and called it the [ es Marcha Real ], or &quot; Royal March &quot;. Under the Second Spanish Republic (1931 –1939) and the Trienio Liberal (1820-1823), [ es El Himno de Riego ] replaced [ es La Marcha Real ] as the national anthem of Spain. At the conclusion of the Civil War, however, Francisco Franco restored [ es La Marcha Real ] as the country&apos;s national anthem, under its old title of [ es La Marcha Granadera ]. [ Current version ] Official anthem release album cover. The current official version, as described in Royal Decree 1560/1997, { Boletín Oficial del Estado Royal Decree 1560/1997. } is a sixteen-bar long phrase, divided in two sections, each one is made up of four repeated bars (AABB form). Tempo is set to ♩= 76 and key to B flat. There is a short version without the repetitions that is used depending on the occasion when the anthem is performed. The long one is kept for the King, while the short must be performed to the Prime Minister, the Prince, or in sport. There are also three official performances by a symphony orchestra, a military band, and an organ, written by Francisco Grau Vegara and requested by the Government of Spain. All in all, there are six different official adaptations. They all were recorded by the Spanish National Orchestra and the Royal Band as an official recording and released on compact disc for a limited period of time. { Official anthem release album cover. } [ Copyright issues ] As the harmonization of the Marcha Real was written by Bartolomé Pérez Casas in the early 1900s, the copyright has not yet expired. The government bought it from Pérez Casas&apos; estate in 1997 for 130,000,000 peseta s (~ € 781,316) to avoid future legal problems. { Boletín Oficial del Estado Royal Decree 1543/1997. } Until it expires, the copyright belongs to the Spanish Ministry of Culture, and collecting societies charge copyright fees, which has led to criticism. { &quot; El himno da aún mucho dinero &quot;. Crónica. #604. May 27, 2007. &quot; Cuando el himno es de un particular &quot;. Periodista Digital. May 27, 2007. } As a result, many different harmonizations are performed to avoid paying. Nonetheless, the rights to the 1997 Francisco Grau revision were transferred to the government at no charge, although they were not placed in the public domain. { Boletín Oficial del Estado Royal Decree 2027/1998. } [ Lyrics ] Though the [ es Marcha Real ] has no lyrics, words have been written and used for it in the past. One version was used during Alfonso XIII &apos;s reign and another during General Franco&apos;s dictatorship; however, none of them was ever made official. The national anthem has been played without words since 1978, when the lyrics that had been approved by General Francisco Franco were abandoned. { Divisive national anthem lyrics ditched Wed Jan 16, 2008 } [ Lyric competition ] After witnessing a rendition of &quot; You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone &quot; at Anfield in 2007, the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee, Alejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to La Marcha Real ahead of Madrid&apos;s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. { Liverpool fans help inspire Spain to write words to anthem Reuters, 5 June 2007 } { Spain to add lyrics to wordless national anthem } { MSNBC, 26 June 2007 } Politicians, including the PM José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, steered clear of the issue in order not to alienate some Basques, Catalans, or Galicians who tend to identify with their own regions rather than with the Spanish state. { &quot; Lost for Words &quot;, The Economist, Vol 384 Number 8539. } A number of the autonomous communities of Spain have their own anthems.

The bugle call &quot; To the Colors &quot; in Spain is the version played by Bugle band s in Spanish churches in religious occasions and processions organized by civil groups and the parishes. Various versions adapted for the drum and the bugle are used, even though brass instruments play the anthem as well. But in some bugle bands, the B flat version of the anthem (the official one, adapted for the bugle) is played. Being the National Anthem, and in honor of the King and Queen of Spain, it&apos;s a common practice for all to stand once it is played. Even though it is also played in church events, respect for the King and Queen (and the Royal Family as well) is required by everyone in attendance.
