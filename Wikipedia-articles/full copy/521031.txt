[ Peaks ] The best known mountains--for reasons such as high elevation, ease of public access by road or trail (especially the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail ), or with ski resorts or towns nearby--in the range include { Peak elevations taken from } [ Mountain Peaks, Summits, and High Points http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains 17 January 2010 ] : [ 4395 ft m ] [ 4226 ft m ] [ 4083 ft m ] [ 4083 ft m ] [ 3953 ft m ] [ 3940 ft m ] [ 3930 ft m ] [ 3858 ft m ] [ Wheeler, Scott The Man Who Helped Electrify the Jay Peak Ski Area Northland Journal February 2008 ] [ McLean, Dan Investors purchase Jay Peak Burlington Free Press July 1, 2008 ] [ 3763 ft m ] [ 3737 ft m ] [ 3520 ft m ] [ 3471 ft m ] Mount Mansfield,, the highest point in Vermont Killington Peak, Mount Ellen, Camel&apos;s Hump, Mount Abraham, Stratton Mountain (Vermont),, the mountain at which the initial ideas of both the Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail were born, Pico Peak, Jay Peak,, receives the most amount of snowfall on average in the eastern United States Mount Wilson, Glastenbury Mountain, Mount Roosevelt, Mount Cleveland, The Green Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, a range that stretches from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south.

For the most part, however, the Green Mountains, especially the northern sections, support a dense boreal forest between roughly [ 3000 - 3500 ft m ] and treeline. This forest is particularly well established in the Green Mountains and throughout the winter months weathers harsh temperatures, snowfall and winds that would destroy other species. In other words, much of the &quot; green &quot; in Green Mountains is due to this boreal forest. [ Tourism ] Some of the mountains are developed for skiing and other snow-related activities. Others have hiking trails for use in summer. { http://www.summitpost.org/green-mountains-vermont/170967 } Mansfield, Killington, Pico, and Ellen have downhill ski resorts on their slopes. All of the major peaks are traversed by the Long Trail, a wilderness hiking trail that runs from the southern to northern borders of the state and joins the Appalachian Trail for roughly [ 3 ] of its length. [ History ] The Vermont Republic, also known less formally as the Green Mountain Republic, existed from 1777 to 1791, at which time Vermont became the 14th state. Vermont not only takes its state nickname ( &quot; The Green Mountain State &quot; ) from the mountains, it is named after them. The French Verts Monts is literally translated as Green Mountains. This name was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant. The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, originally styled &quot; the University of the Green Mountains, &quot; is referred to as UVM (after the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis). [ Geology and physiography ] The Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.
