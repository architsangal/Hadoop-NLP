{ Delta IV rocket from } { SLC-37B, } { Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida } The Geostationary Satellite system (GOES), operated by the United States National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), supports weather forecasting, severe storm tracking, and meteorology research. Spacecraft and ground-based elements of the system work together to provide a continuous stream of environmental data. The National Weather Service (NWS) uses the GOES system for its United States weather monitoring and forecasting operations, and scientific researchers use the data to better understand land, atmosphere, ocean, and climate interactions. The GOES system uses geosynchronous satellite s which—since the launch of SMS-1 in 1974—have been a basic element of U.S. weather monitoring and forecasting. [ Satellites ] &apos;&apos;&apos;GOES-8&apos;&apos;&apos;, a decommissioned United States weather satellite. Four GOES satellites are currently available for operational use: [ http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goesstatus/spacecraftStatusSummary.asp?spacecraft%3D12 GOES-12 Spacecraft Status Summary NOAA June 29, 2009 ] [ http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goesstatus/spacecraftStatusSummary.asp?spacecraft%3D13 GOES-13 Spacecraft Status Summary NOAA June 29, 2009 ] [ GOES Spacecraft Status Main Page http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goesstatus/ NASA 28 December 2011 ] [ http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goesstatus/spacecraftStatusSummary.asp?spacecraft%3D15 GOES-15 Spacecraft Status Summary NOAA 27 December 2011 ] GOES-12 is designated GOES-South, currently located at 60°W. GOES-13 is designated GOES-East, currently located at 75°W. It provides most of the U.S. weather information. GOES 14 was placed in orbit on 7 July 2009, underwent Post-Launch Testing until December 2009 and then was placed in on-orbit storage at 105° W. GOES 15 is designated GOES-West, currently located at 135°W over the Pacific Ocean. Several GOES satellites are still in orbit, either inactive or re-purposed. GOES-3 is no longer used for weather operations, but is a critical part of the communication links between the United States and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Geostationary satellites cannot ordinarily be seen at all from the poles, but they require station keeping fuel to keep them stationary over the equator. When station keeping fuel runs out, solar and lunar perturbations increase the satellite&apos;s inclination so that its ground track begins to describe a figure-8 in the north-south direction. This usually ends the satellite&apos;s primary mission. But when the inclination is high enough, the satellite may begin to rise above the polar horizons at the extremes of the figure-8, as is the case for GOES-3. A nine-meter dish was constructed at the station, and communication with the satellite is currently possible for about five hours per day. Data rates are around 2.048 Mbit/s bi-directional under optimum conditions. GOES-8 (GOES-East when it was in operation) is in a parking orbit, currently drifting about 4°W daily. [ http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goesstatus/spacecraftStatusSummary.asp?spacecraft%3D8 GOES-8 Spacecraft Status Summary NOAA June 29, 2009 ] It was decommissioned on April 1, 2003, and deactivated on May 5, 2004, after the failure of its propulsion system. [ http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2004/s2217.htm NOAA DEACTIVATES GOES-8 AFTER 10 YEARS OF SERVICE NOAA May 3, 2004 August 25, 2006 ] Communication was lost for 13 days to GOES-12 on December 4, 2007 when it performed a standard station-keeping maneuver. GOES-11 initially took &quot; full disk &quot; images to cover the lost data until a contingency plan could be implemented. [ http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/SATS/SPBULL/MSG3391604.01.txt GOES-12 Status Bulletin December 5, 2007 ] On December 5, 2007, GOES-10 was moved from South America operations to temporarily replace GOES-12 as the GOES-EAST operational satellite. [ http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/blog/ CIMSS GOES Blog December 7, 2007 ] On 9 December, communication with GOES-10 was also temporarily lost, but communication was resumed via a backup antenna. { GOES-10 Status Bulletin } GOES-12 was successfully reactivated and moved back to normal operation following a thrust maneuver on 17 December. [ http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/SATS/SPBULL/MSG3512004.01.txt GOES-12 Status Bulletin December 17, 2007 ] The trouble was traced to a leaking thruster valve, which pushed the satellite incorrectly. Emergency procedures were executed to cut off the valve, and a redundant thruster was activated to restore the location of the satellite. { GOES-M status } GOES-10 was decommissioned on December 2, 2009 and was boosted to a graveyard orbit. It no longer had the fuel for required maneuvers to keep it on station. { Farewell to GOES-10 } It joins GOES 8 and 9 which are already in graveyard orbits. With the cessation of GOES-10&apos;s duties, GOES-13 has replaced GOES-12 as &quot; GOES-East &quot;. GOES-12 was then moved to 60° W and resume South American duties for GOES-10. GOES-11 had a partial failure 6 Dec 2011, was decommissioned on 16 Dec 2011 and was boosted into a graveyard orbit. GOES 15 was moved to 135° W as GOES West. GOES-12 visible light image.

[ Purpose ] Designed to operate in geostationary orbit, 35,790  km (22,240  statute miles) above the earth, thereby remaining stationary with respect to a point on the ground, the advanced GOES I–M spacecraft continuously view the continental United States, neighboring environs of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and Central, South America and southern Canada. The three-axis, body-stabilized spacecraft design enables the sensors to &quot; stare &quot; at the earth and thus more frequently image cloud s, monitor earth&apos;s surface temperature and water vapour fields, and sound the atmosphere for its vertical thermal and vapor structures. Thus the evolution of atmospheric phenomena can be followed, ensuring real-time coverage of short-lived dynamic events, especially severe local storm s and tropical cyclone s —two meteorological events that directly affect public safety, protection of property, and ultimately, economic health and development. The importance of this capability has been exemplified during hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Andrew (1992). The GOES I–M series of spacecraft are the principal observational platforms for covering such dynamic weather events and the near-earth space environment for the 1990s and into the 21st century. These advanced spacecraft enhance the capability of the GOES system to continuously observe and measure meteorological phenomena in real time, providing the meteorological community and atmospheric scientists greatly improved observational and measurement data of the Western Hemisphere. In addition to short-term weather forecasting and space environmental monitoring, these enhanced operational services also improve support for atmospheric science research, numerical weather prediction models, and environmental sensor design and development. Data is received via the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition ground station at Wallops Island, Virginia { GOES-I/M MISSION, Goddard Space Flight Center (Accessed 17 Mar 2008) } The GOES satellites are controlled from the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) located in Suitland, Maryland. During significant weather or other events the normal schedules can be altered to provide coverage requested by the National Weather Service and other agencies. [ National Geophysical Data Center http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html ] GOES spacecraft also provide a platform for the Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI), and space environment monitoring (SEM) instruments. The SEM measures in situ the effect of the sun on the near-earth solar-terrestrial electromagnetic environment, providing real-time data to the Space Environment Services Center (SESC). The SESC, as the nation’s “space weather” service, receives, monitors, and interprets a wide variety of solar-terrestrial data, and issues reports, alerts and forecasts for special events such as solar flares or geomagnetic storms. This information is important to the operation of military and civilian radio wave and satellite communication and navigation systems, as well as electric power networks, and to the mission of geophysical explorers, Shuttle and Space Station astronauts, high-altitude aviators, and scientific researchers. The SXI provides high-cadence monitoring of large scale solar structures to supports SESC&apos;s monitoring mission. [ Payload ] The main mission is carried out by the primary payload instruments, the Imager and the Sounder. The Imager is a multichannel instrument that senses infrared radiant energy and visible reflected solar energy from the Earth&apos;s surface and atmosphere. The Sounder provides data for vertical atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, surface and cloud top temperature, and ozone distribution. Other instruments on board the spacecraft are the ground-based meteorological platform data collection and relay, and the space environment monitor. The latter consists of a magnetometer, an X-ray sensor, a high energy proton and alpha detector, and an energetic particles sensor, all used for in-situ surveying of the near-earth space environment. Satellites numbered 12 and greater also carry a solar x-ray imager (SXI) used for two-dimensional imaging of the Sun. The GOES 13-15 series also have a sun-pointed extreme ultraviolet sensor. { Invertible GOES logo designed for } { Space Systems/Loral by } { Scott Kim } In addition, the GOES satellites carry Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) and Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) receivers, which are used for search-and-rescue purposes by the U.S. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center. [ Satellite designations ] Before being launched, GOES satellites are designated by letters (-A, -B, -C...). Once a GOES satellite is launched successfully, it is redesignated with a number (-1, -2, -3...). So, GOES-A to GOES-F became GOES-1 to GOES-6. Because GOES-G was a launch failure, it never received a number. Since then, GOES-H to GOES-N became GOES-7 to GOES-13. The procurement, design and manufacturing of GOES is overseen by NASA, while all operations of the satellites once in orbit are done by NOAA. GOES spacecraft have been manufactured by Boeing (GOES D-H and N–P) and Space Systems/Loral (A–C and I–M). The two current GOES series (I-M and N-P) are documented in the &quot; GOES I–M Databook &quot; and &quot; GOES N Series Databook &quot;. GOES-13 (which was designated GOES-N prior to orbiting) was launched by a Delta IV rocket from Space Launch Complex 37B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 22:11 GMT May 24, 2006. [ http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/goes-n/main/index.html GOES N Main Page NASA June 27, 2009 ] The launch of GOES-O was delayed several times due to various issues.

In October 2006, NOAA repositioned GOES-10 (originally GOES-K) over the Amazon region, to provide full time coverage for South American countries. Although NOAA currently sends images to South America, the frequency drops from 30-minutes to 3 hours whenever a storm occurs in North America, which is roughly 40% of the time during the hurricane season.

The planned delivery schedule was also slowed down in order to reduce costs. The expected cost is $ 7.69 billion—a $670 million increase from the prior $7 billion estimate. The contract for the constructing the satellites themselves, as well as the magnetometer system, SUVI and GLM, was awarded to Lockheed Martin. The award was challenged by Boeing, who lost the bid; however, the protest was subsequently dismissed. The ABI will be delivered by ITT Exelis. The SEISS will be delivered by Assurance Technology Corporation. XRS and EUVS will be combined into the Extreme Ultra Violet and X-Ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) which will be delivered by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics of the University of Colorado. The contract for the ground system (including data processing) was awarded to a team led by the Weather Systems division of Harris Corporation, including subcontracts to Boeing, Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER), Honeywell, Carr Astronautics, Wyle Laboratories, and Ares.
