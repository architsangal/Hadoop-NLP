He received a shodan from and was an instructor for Ed Parker in American Kenpo Karate before becoming a student of Bruce Lee. { Kelly(2000)p.24 } Inosanto is one of three people allowed by Bruce Lee to teach his Martial Arts system ( Taky Kimura and James Yimm Lee being the other two), and the only one to be given Instructorship in Bruce Lee&apos;s Jeet Kune Do of the third level. Inosanto also studied with dozens of martial arts masters elsewhere in the United States, Southeast Asia, and Europe, including Johny Lacoste (Kali, or Kamot Lihok, lit. &quot; Hand Movement &quot; ), and Chai Sirisute (Muay Thai). { Kelly(2000)p.31 } After Bruce Lee&apos;s death, he has become the principal spokesperson and historian for Jeet Kune Do. He has had minor roles in a number of movies, including Bruce Lee&apos;s uncompleted last film Game of Death (1972). During this time period (1967–75), he also taught physical education at Malaga Cove Intermediate School in Palos Verdes Estates, California. Always a student himself, he continues to train with many highly regarded martial artists. Consequently, he holds Instructor or black belt level ranks in numerous, different martial arts. In addition, he is well known for promoting the Filipino Martial Arts. He is responsible for bringing several obscure forms of the South East Asia Martial Arts into the public eye such as Silat, a hybrid combative form existing in countries as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
