{ serine residue } Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate (PO 4 3- ) group to a protein or other organic molecule. Phosphorylation turns many protein enzymes on and off, thereby altering their function and activity. Protein phosphorylation in particular plays a significant role in a wide range of cellular processes. Its prominent role in biochemistry is the subject of a very large body of research (as of March 2012, the Medline database returns nearly 200,000 articles on the subject, largely on protein phosphorylation). [ Protein phosphorylation ] [ History ] In 1906, Phoebus A. Levene at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research identified phosphate in the protein vitellin (phosvitin), [ The cleavage products of vitellin J. Biol. Chem. 2 1 127–133 1906 http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/2/1/127.pdf Levene PA Alsberg CL, ] and by 1933 had detected phosphoserine in casein, with Fritz Lipmann.

Chem. 98 1 109–114 1932 October http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/98/1/109.pdf Lipmann FA Levene PA, ] However, it took another 20 years before Eugene P. Kennedy described the first ‘enzymatic phosphorylation of proteins’. [ The enzymatic phosphorylation of proteins J. Biol.

Many enzyme s and receptors are switched &quot; on &quot; or &quot; off &quot; by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Reversible phosphorylation results in a conformational change in the structure in many enzyme s and receptors, causing them to become activated or deactivated. Phosphorylation usually occurs on serine, threonine, tyrosine and histidine residues in eukaryotic proteins. Histidine phosphorylation of eukaryotic proteins appears to be much more frequent than tyrosine phosphorylation. [ Phosphorylation of basic amino acid residues in proteins: important but easily missed Acta Biochim Pol 58 2 137–47 2011 21623415 Ciesla J Fraczyk T Rode W, ] In prokaryotic proteins phosphorylation occurs on the serine, threonine, tyrosine, histidine or arginine or lysine residues. [ Ser/Thr/Tyr protein phosphorylation in bacteria - for long time neglected, now well established J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 9 125–31 2005 Deutscher J Saier MH Jr, 10.1159/000089641 16415586 3–4 Saier ] The addition of a phosphate (PO 4 ) molecule to a polar R group of an amino acid residue can turn a hydrophobic portion of a protein into a polar and extremely hydrophilic portion of molecule. In this way it can introduce a conformational change in the structure of the protein via interaction with other hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the protein. One such example of the regulatory role that phosphorylation plays is the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The p53 protein is heavily regulated [ Regulation of p53 Function and Stability by Phosphorylation Mol. Cell. Biol. 19 3 1751–8 1999 March 10022862 83968 Ashcroft M Kubbutat MH Vousden KH, ] and contains more than 18 different phosphorylation sites. Activation of p53 can lead to cell cycle arrest, which can be reversed under some circumstances, or apoptotic cell death. [ p53 in signaling checkpoint arrest or apoptosis Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 6 1 12–8 1996 February 8791489 10.1016/S0959-437X(96)90004-0 Bates S Vousden KH, ] This activity occurs only in situations wherein the cell is damaged or physiology is disturbed in normal healthy individuals. Upon the deactivating signal, the protein becomes dephosphorylated again and stops working. This is the mechanism in many forms of signal transduction, for example the way in which incoming light is processed in the light-sensitive cells of the retina. Regulatory roles of phosphorylation include Phosphorylation of Na + /K + -ATPase during the transport of sodium (Na + ) and potassium (K + ) ions across the cell membrane in osmoregulation to maintain homeostasis of the body&apos;s water content.

Phosphorylation of src tyrosine kinase (pronounced &quot; sarc &quot; ) by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) induces a conformational change in the enzyme, resulting in a fold in the structure, which masks its kinase domain, and is thus shut &quot; off &quot;. [ Babior BM NADPH oxidase: an update Blood 93 5 1464–76 1999 March 10029572 ] Phosphorylation of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, a large membrane-bound, multi-protein enzyme present in phagocytic cells, plays an important role in the regulation of protein-protein interactions in the enzyme. In the late 1990s, it was recognized that phosphorylation of some proteins causes them to be degraded by the ATP-dependent ubiquitin / proteasome pathway. These target proteins become substrates for particular E3 ubiquitin ligases only when they are phosphorylated. [ Signaling networks ] Elucidating complex signaling pathway phosphorylation events can be difficult. In a cellular signaling pathways, a protein A phosphorylates protein B, and B phosphorylates C. However, in another signaling pathway, protein D phosphorylates A, or phosphorylates protein C. Global approaches such as phosphoproteomics, the study of phosphorylated proteins, which is a sub-branch of proteomics, combined with mass spectrometry -based proteomics, have been utilised to identify and quantify dynamic changes in phosphorylated proteins over time. These techniques are becoming increasingly important for the systematic analysis of complex phosphorylation networks. [ Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks Cell 127 3 635–48 2006 November 17081983 10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.026 Olsen JV Blagoev B Gnad F Macek B Kumar C Mortensen P Mann M, ] They have been successfully used to identify dynamic changes in the phosphorylation status of more than 6000 sites after stimulation with epidermal growth factor.

This reveals interesting recurring patterns of interactions - network motifs.

Shales Michael Collins Sean R. ] [ Protein phosphorylation sites ] There are thousands of distinct phosphorylation sites in a given cell since:1) There are thousands of different kinds of proteins in any particular cell (such as a lymphocyte ).2) It is estimated that 1/10 to 1/2 of proteins are phosphorylated (in some cellular state).3) Phosphorylation often occurs on multiple distinct sites on a given protein. Since phosphorylation of any site on a given protein can change the function or localization of that protein, understanding the &quot; state &quot; of a cell requires knowing the phosphorylation state of its proteins. For example, if amino acid Serine-473 ( &quot; S473 &quot; ) in the protein AKT is phosphorylated, AKT is, in general, functionally active as a kinase. If not, it is an inactive kinase. [ Types of phosphorylation ] See also kinase s for more details on the different types of phosphorylation Within a protein, phosphorylation can occur on several amino acid s. Phosphorylation on serine is the most common, followed by threonine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is relatively rare. However, since tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are relatively easy to purify using antibodies, tyrosine phosphorylation sites are relatively well understood. Histidine and aspartate phosphorylation occurs in prokaryotes as part of two-component signaling and in some cases in eukaryotes in some signal transduction pathways. [ Eukaryotic signal transduction via histidine-aspartate phosphorelay J. Cell. Sci. 113 18 3141–50 2000 September 10954413 http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/113/18/3141.pdf Thomason P Kay R, ] [ Detection and characterization ] Antibodies can be used as powerful tools to detect whether a protein is phosphorylated at a particular site. Antibodies bind to and detect phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in the protein. Such antibodies are called phospho-specific antibodies; hundreds of such antibodies are now available. [ http://www.exactantigen.com/review/phospho-antibody.html phospho antibody 2009-01-22 exactantigen.com ] They are becoming critical reagents both for basic research and for clinical diagnosis. Example of posttranslational modification detected on a 2D gel yui (spot boundaries delimited by analysis software, identification by mass spectrometry, P46462 is the protein ID in Expasy) PTM (Posttranslational Modification) isoforms are easily detected on 2D gels. Indeed, phosphorylation replaces neutral hydroxyl groups on serines, threonines, or tyrosines with negatively-charged phosphates with pKs near 1.2 and 6.5. Thus, below pH 5.5, phosphates add a single negative charge; near pH 6.5, they add 1.5 negative charges; above pH 7.5, they add 2 negative charges. The relative amount of each isoform can also easily and rapidly be determined from staining intensity on 2D gels. In some very specific cases, the detection of the phosphorylation as a shift in the protein&apos;s electrophoretic mobility is possible on simple 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels, as it&apos;s described for instance for a transcriptional coactivator by Kovacs et al. [ Kovacs KA Steinmann M Magistretti PJ, Halfon O, Cardinaux JR 2003 Sept. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members recruit the coactivator CREB-binding protein and trigger its phosphorylation J Biol. Chem. 278 38 36959–65 UNITED STATES 0021-9258 12857754 10.1074/jbc.M303147200 ] Strong phosphorylation-related conformational changes (that persist in detergent-containing solutions) are thought to underlie this phenomenon. Most of the phosphorylation sites for which such a mobility shift has been described fall in the category of SP and TP sites (i.e. a proline residue follows the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue). More recently large-scale mass spectrometry analyses have been used to determine sites of protein phosphorylation. Over the last 4 years, dozens of studies have been published, each identifying thousands of sites, many of which were previously undescribed.

However, advanced, highly accurate mass spectrometers are needed for these studies, limiting the technology to labs with high-end mass spectrometers. A detailed characterization of the sites of phosphorylation is very difficult, and the quantitation of protein phosphorylation by mass spectrometry requires isotopic internal standard approaches.

ATP is also synthesized by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis.ATP is synthesized at the expense of solar energy by photophosphorylation in the chloroplast s of plant cells. Phosphorylation of sugar s is often the first stage of their catabolism. It allows cells to accumulate sugars because the phosphate group prevents the molecules from diffusing back across their transporter.
