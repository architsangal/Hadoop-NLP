There, he studied architecture and worked with the fashion house of Paquin after the war. He worked with Elsa Schiaparelli until he became head of Christian Dior &apos;s tailleure atelier in 1947, but was denied work at Balenciaga. Cardin founded his own house in 1950. His career was launched when he designed about 30 of the costumes for &quot; the party of the century &quot;, a masquerade ball at Palazzo Labia in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by the palazzo&apos;s owner, Carlos de Beistegui. He began with haute couture in 1953. Cardin was the first couturier to turn to Japan as a high fashion market when he travelled there in 1959. In 1959, he was expelled from the Chambre Syndicale for launching a ready-to-wear collection for the Printemps department store as the first couturier in Paris, but was soon reinstated. Pierre Cardin - Cobra Table and Chair Cardin resigned from the Chambre Syndicale in 1966 and began showing his collections in his own venue, the &quot; Espace Cardin &quot; (opened 1971) in Paris, formerly the &quot; Théâtre des Ambassadeurs &quot;, near the Embassy of the United States in Paris. The Espace Cardin is also used to promote new artistic talents, like theater ensembles, musicians and others. He was also contacted by Pakistan International Airlines to design uniforms for the flag carrier. The uniforms were introduced in 1966 to 1971 and became an instant hit.

It was also tapered to the body, in contrast with the traditional loose-fitting design; it also had a thicker collar with sharp and pointed cuffs. A straight jacket design was favored by President Ferdinand Marcos.

After a break of 15 years, he showed a new collection to a group of 150 journalists at his bubble home in Cannes.
