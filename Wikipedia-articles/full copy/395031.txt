[ Nambar Enkhbayar ] [ 1958 06 01 y ] { Ulan Bator, } { Mongolia } { Onongiin Tsolmon } { MPRP } { Vladimir Putin in 2005. } Nambaryn Enkhbayar ( [ Намбарын Энхбаяр ] was born on June 1, 1958 in Ulan Bator ) is a Mongolia n political figure. He was the Prime Minister from June 2000 to 2004. He served as a Speaker of the Parliament from 2004 to 2005. He became the President of Mongolia on June 24th, 2005 after winning the May 2005 elections { http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/711253/Nambaryn-Enkhbayar }. He is the first person in the history of Mongolia who has occupied all three seats in the government. Under his 10 years of service, Mongolia had transformed from one of the most underdeveloped countries in central Asia, to one of the fastest growing economies in the world attracting the interest of various investors and companies { http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/711253/Nambaryn-Enkhbayar }. He was the one who reformed his party, Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party (currently Mongolian People’s Party) and directed it towards a democratic, liberal shift, which secured peacefulness of Mongolia’s transition from communism to capitalism. Enkhbayar was a member and then a leader of the MPRP (Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party) since 1992 { http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/711253/Nambaryn-Enkhbayar }. He was also supportive of the idea of socially beneficial FDI, attempting to prevent exploitation of Mongolia’s natural resources and trying to secure a deal which would be benefical for the Mongolian people. In 2009, Enkhbayar was a candidate in the Mongolia presidential elections of 2009, but lost to Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj by a narrow loss of 3.8%. Enkhbayar gave up his seat, however later challenged the results claiming that it was rigged. He stated that he was willing to accept the results at the time in fear of causing unrest. His later arrest adds some validity to his claim. On 13th of April 2012, Enkhbayar was arrested by the IAAC (Independent Authority Against Corruption). This took place less than 2 months before the parliamentary elections in June, 2012, for which Enkhbayar and his party MPRP (Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party) were running. His supporters claim that this was an illegal and politically motivated move, and is a violation of his basic human rights. However the authorities claim that it was a legal action, and Enkhbayar was arrested on valid corruption charges. However, his case had attracted international media attention, and many valid sources, including Amnesty International, claim that this arrest is a violation of his human rights as well as having a political agenda. [ Education and early life ] Nambaryn Enkhbayar was born on 1st of June, 1958 in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. He graduated from secondary school in 1975, and went to the Moscow Institute of Literature in Moscow. He earned an undergraduate degree in literature and language in 1980, and spent a year abroad in Leeds University in England in 1985 to 1986. [ http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/participants/nambaryn-enkhbayar Nambaryn Enkhbayar President of Mongolia Columbia University World Leaders Forum August 22, 2009 ]. There, for the first time, he encountered uncensored media, and was particularly stunned at the contrast of opinions between the Western and Soviet media. Upon arriving back to Ulaanbaatar, Enkhbayar became the head of the Association of Mongolian Writers in 1990, the year that the Mongolian People&apos;s Revolutionary Party relinquished control and multi-party elections were held that July for the first time in Mongolia history { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html }. Enkhbayar holds an English language proficiency certificate from Cambridge University and has translated major Russian and English authors, including Tolstoy and Dickens { http://www.president.mn/show_modules.php?index=bio }. He holds honorary doctorate degrees from a number of universities, and is a well-known translator and columnist { http://www.president.mn/show_modules.php?index=bio }. He married Onon Tsolmon in 1987, and has four children { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html }. [ Political career ] Enkhbayar entered politics in 1990 and became part of the new political order immediately. He served as a vice chair of the government’s arts committee for the first two years of democratic rule { http://www.enotes.com/topic/Nambaryn_Enkhbayar }. In 1992, he was elected to the State Great Khural (Mongolian Parliament) as a member of the MPRP { http://lenta.ru/lib/14189978/ }. Somewhat unusual for a former Soviet satellite state, Mongolia voted to retain the MPRP during its first venture into democratic elections, and Enkhbayar was appointed to serve as the country&apos;s Minister of Culture { http://lenta.ru/lib/14189978/ }. He held that post until 1996, when the Mongolian National Democratic Party ousted the MPRP in elections that year. In 1997, Enkhbayar was elected to lead the MPRP { http://lenta.ru/lib/14189978/ }. In 1999, the country was hit by one of its infamous zud spells, when summer draught and cold weather blizzards resulted in severe food shortages and loss of thousands of livestock { http://fex.ennonline.net/20/famine.aspx }. The current government had responded poorly to the disaster and the MPRP received an unexpected boost from the climatological disaster { http://fex.ennonline.net/20/famine.aspx }. Enkhbayar held onto his seat in the Mongolian parliament, where he held the title of minority leader, and shepherded the party through a triumphant return to the office in 2000, in a landslide election, winning 72 out of 76 seats { http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2219_00.htm }. Under his leadership, MPRP became a member of the Socialist International, an international Institution of 162 political parties and organisations from all continents { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People&apos;s_Party }. With the MPRP in control of the Great Hural once again, Enkhbayar became the country&apos;s Prime Minister { http://lenta.ru/lib/14189978/ }. He embarked on an ambitious plan to improve the infrastructure and encourage foreign direct investment. These included the new Millennium Road, the first to traverse Mongolia&apos;s 600,000 square-mile territory from east to west, and an agreement with a Canadian group to begin gold mining { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html }. The economy had revived through these reforms with GDP increasing by 4% in 2002, and reaching 10% growth rate in 2004 { http://www.gfmag.com/gdp-data-country-reports/218-mongolia-gdp-country-report.html#axzz1tFHOdQQ4 }. In 2004, MPRP lost to Motherland Democratic Coalition, a new political entity. Enkhbayar, retained his seat, and took up the post as the Speaker of the Parliament for one year { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html }. He entered the race for president in the spring of 2005, and campaigned by helicopter to cover the sparsely populated country, where even permanent settlements are often spaced miles away from one another { http://www.thefreelibrary.com/3RD+LD%3A+Enkhbayar+takes+Mongolian+presidential+election.-a0132683431 }. Later that year, he welcomed U.S. President George W. Bush for an official visit. It was the first time an U.S president visit the country in the history of Mongolia { http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200511/21/eng20051121_222937.html }. President Bush&apos;s visit was a response to Enkhbayar&apos;s support and deployment of soldiers to Iraq. Under Enkhbayar’s service, Mongolia has won international respect for its peaceful transition to democracy in the post-Cold War era, and the continuance of multi-party elections despite occasional crises { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html }. In an attempt to expand this transition model, Enkhbayar had tried to forge diplomatic ties with communist North Korea, the world’s most economically, and politically isolated country { http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/10mongolia.aspx }. &quot; Being democratic makes you more stable and makes you more … protected, &quot; Enkhbayar explained to Washington Times writer Bill Gertz. &quot; You feel safer when you are a democracy because you see other countries in the region, North Koreans for example, are not safer, although they are trying to keep their old regime as long as possible. So we think that democracy means a safer security. &quot; { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html } During his exceptional career, Enkhbayar implemented many initiatives, which substantially improved the social and economic conditions in Mongolia { http://www.gfmag.com/gdp-data-country-reports/218-mongolia-gdp-country-report.html#axzz1tFHOdQQ4 }. One of Enkhbayar’s first initiatives, when he became the Prime Minister in 2000, was to bring the Millennium Challenge Compact (MCC) to Mongolia. After years of lobbying the US Government, he managed to qualify Mongolia for the US$ 285 million aid in 2007 { http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071022-3.html }. His other achievements include the record debt forgiveness he negotiated with the Russian Government. In 2004, Russia wrote off 97% of its Soviet-era loans to Mongolia, which it was estimated to amount to US$ 11.3 billion { http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fcgQ9nX0H3gC &amp; pg=PA66 &amp; lpg=PA66 &amp; dq=debt+forgiveness+mongolia+russia &amp; source=bl &amp; ots=MHxo5daz6C &amp; sig=4wlCsSsN5gMxupBTP4RHlnuNehU &amp; hl=en &amp; sa=X &amp; ei=cqmaT97BM-jZ4ASsgJHKBw &amp; ved=0CHAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage &amp; q=debt%20forgiveness%20mongolia%20russia &amp; f=false }. This was the first time since 1920s that Mongolia did not owe debt to its northern neighbour { http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fcgQ9nX0H3gC &amp; pg=PA66 &amp; lpg=PA66 &amp; dq=debt+forgiveness+mongolia+russia &amp; source=bl &amp; ots=MHxo5daz6C &amp; sig=4wlCsSsN5gMxupBTP4RHlnuNehU &amp; hl=en &amp; sa=X &amp; ei=cqmaT97BM-jZ4ASsgJHKBw &amp; ved=0CHAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage &amp; q=debt%20forgiveness%20mongolia%20russia &amp; f=false }. [ July 1st Riots in 2008 ] On July 1st, 2008 a large and violent protest took place outside the building of MPRP. During the 2008 post-election riots several thousand protesters, including the politicians, angry at what many deemed to be a fraudulent election process, participated. The crowd had violent clashes with the police and set the MPRP building on fire. Some rioters started looting the Cultural Palace, which houses a theatre, museum and art gallery. Others attacked a police station in search of weapons. When crowds refused to disperse, the police retaliated by opening fire to cease the protesters. Unfortunately, four people were fatally shot and one person suffocated inside the MPRP building. Many people received injuries and over 700 people were arrested and tried. Enkhbayar was the president at the time, and tried to resolve the situation peacefully. Enkhbayar urged S.Bayar, the acting Prime Minister, to coordinate with Amarbold. The Chief of Police, to reach a peaceful resolution of the conflict. However, both of them declared that they are no longer able to control the crow. As a result, Enkhbayar asked the acting State Khural to announce a state of emergency { http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php/community/88888941-nationalnews-frontpage/7078-former-president-nenkhbayar-releases-classified-documents-from-july-1st-incident- }. The Parliament approved his request and a state of emergency was announced on July 2nd, 2008 { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_riot_in_Mongolia }. Over the following three days Enkhbayar asked the leaders of all political parties to meet and resolve the problems facing the government { http://tv9.mn/index.php?pid=54 &amp; sec=view &amp; id=4126 }. The minutes of the meetings that took place amongst top officials of the different political parties in the days after the riots were later released by Enkhbayar. The documents show high levels of tensions and distrust amongst the members of the meeting, whose parties nevertheless formed a coalition government some months afterwards { http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php/community/88888941-nationalnews-frontpage/7078-former-president-nenkhbayar-releases-classified-documents-from-july-1st-incident- }. In the 2009 presidential election, Enkhbayar was narrowly defeated by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj with just over 3% of the votes. Later, Enkhbayar stated that there elections were rigged, however he did not want to claim that in fear of causing public discontent, similar to July 1st riots { http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_17148-544-2-30.pdf?090721135350 }. In 2011, there MPRP split into two political entities, Mongolian People&apos;s Party (the currently ruling party with a new name), and Mongolian People&apos;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP - keeping the old name) { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People&apos;s_Party }. The break-off MPRP asked Enkhbayar to become their head, valuing his experience and his long dedication to the MPRP party { http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Co-Lh/Enkhbayar-Nambaryn.html }. MPRP was planning to run for Parliament seats in June. }} Raid. [ Arrest ] At 5.50 a.m. on 13 April 2012, Enkhbayar was arrested by the IAAC (Independent Authority Against Corruption). The IAAC had stated that they have been investigating Enkhbayar for over a year, however he never showed for questioning, thus they were forced to arrest him { http://tv9.mn/index.php?pid=54 &amp; sec=view &amp; id=4126 }. Nevertheless, it remains unclear why the arrest wasn’t conducted earlier { http://tv9.mn/index.php?pid=54 &amp; sec=view &amp; id=4126 }. Most people suspect that he was arrested for disclosing a 300 page document relating to July 1st riots { http://www.economist.com/node/21553503 }. This document had recorded meetings between Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj (current President), Sanjaagiin Bayar (leader of the MPRP and Prime Minister then), Dolgorjav, Bold-Erdene and Tsedendamba after July 1st, 2008, discussing the 2008 elections and the responsibility for the subsequent riots { http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php/community/88888941-nationalnews-frontpage/7078-former-president-nenkhbayar-releases-classified-documents-from-july-1st-incident- }. Enkhbayar released only the first half of the report at a press conference held at 12:00. The second part of the report was “classified” even though no matters relating to national security (i.e. espionage, foreign policy and terrorism) were discussed. The first part contained threats and accusations of fraud and corruption between individuals present at the meeting { http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php/community/88888941-nationalnews-frontpage/7078-former-president-nenkhbayar-releases-classified-documents-from-july-1st-incident- }. Here, S.Bayar said he will hold the responsibility for the Government dealing with riots. There was also consent that the elections were rigged and that a re-election should be held. It is alleged, that the second part of the report contained incriminating conversations between some of the aforementioned politicians, many of whom are in top positions within the Government of Mongolia { http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php/community/88888941-nationalnews-frontpage/7078-former-president-nenkhbayar-releases-classified-documents-from-july-1st-incident- }. Enkhbayar’s arrest was conducted in a very extreme manner. At around 7 p.m. on 12th of April, as he arrived from work where he was met with anonymous men who tried to use force on him. They showed no evidence of the fact that they were from law enforcement bodies, and pulled out a a gun. Enkhbayar&apos;s bodyguards managed to fight them off, however they managed to physically assault them and damaged the car { http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ewzEHjWhc }. He managed to escape and immediately called his lawyers. Numerous media stations and more police continuously arrived at the scene throughout the night. Four Members of the Parliament, Ch.Ulaan, D.Ternishdagva, O.Chuluunbat, and Ts.Shinebayar, from the ruling party MPP came to support Enkhbayar during this time. In early morning, about 600 policemen were present { http://tv9.mn/index.php?pid=54 &amp; sec=view &amp; id=4126 } { http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ewzEHjWhc }. On live TV, they broke the door to Enkhbayar’s residence, where they were met with with supporters of Enkhbayar and tried to prevent the policemen from entering, eventually Enkhbayar was detained and taken in by the police. { http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ewzEHjWhc }. The policemen who entered were wearing normal clothes and covered their head with a black mask analogous to those worn by robbers { http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ewzEHjWhc }. They used violence and force on the present members, including the MPs who were present. They have made the filming reporters shut off their video violating the freedom of press article in the Constitution of Mongolia { http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ewzEHjWhc }. Between 13th of April and 6th of May he was in Tuv Aimag prison. There he has been denied legal council or any connection with the outside world, thus his family and friends were not allowed to meet him { http://www.shuud.mn/хөөрхий-дөө-н-энхбаяр/ } { http://www.shuud.mn/хөөрхий-дөө-н-энхбаяр/ }. Many supporters of Enkhbayar have been protesting in and around the capital city, claiming the Police have arrested an innocent man, despite the allegations made against him. { http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-04/13/c_131525633.htm }. On 26th of April, the court ordered a 2 month prison sentence for Enkhbayar, without any trial or court proceedings { http://times.mn/index.php?option=com_content &amp; view=article &amp; id=4039:-2- &amp; catid=3:yariltslaga &amp; Itemid=28 }. His party MPRP had been rallying supporters within Mongolia, and secured a petition with over 80, 000 signatures. However the IAAC and the Sukhbaatar District Court issued no statements on the request of the people. On 2nd of May, Enkhbayar had announced a dry hunger strike in protest of the current government demanding his basic human rights to be recognised, including: his right to a confidential legal council, illegality of the whole procedure and regular meetings with family and friends { http://www.24tsag.mn/content/11511.shtml }. He also put forward a request to stop this blatantly politically motivated operation by the current politicians in fear of the upcoming elections { http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/world/asia/mongolias-democracy-tested-by-ex-presidents-arrest.html?_r=1 &amp; pagewanted=all }. He stated that in case of his death he holds four individuals responsible for his illegal arrest and detainment: Tsakhia Elbegdorj, Sükhbaataryn Batbold, Tsendiin Nyamdorj and D.Dorligjav. Currently they are President, Prime Minister, Minister of Justice and General Prosecutor in Mongolia. His health deteriorated rapidly, and he was taken to the prison hospital { http://www.24tsag.mn/content/11511.shtml }. He lost around 12 kilograms, and there were serious risks of heart or kidney failure, with doctors predicting he might not survive the night on 13th of May { http://www.24tsag.mn/content/11703.shtml }. On 14th of May, Enkhbayar was released on bail officially due to health reasons, however many suspect that the decision was influenced by the mounting international attention Enkhbayar&apos;s case was attracting { http://www.infomongolia.com/ct/ci/4043 }. Amnesty International issued a statement condemning Enkhbayar&apos;s arrest as inhumane and demanded from the Mongolian authorities to comply with international human rights regulations { http://www.amnesty.mn/en/aim-news/amnesty-international-public-statement }. Dianne Feinstein also mentioned the case in a speech to the Senate, stating that Enkhbayar&apos;s arrest seems at the least suspicious and severely halts Mongolia&apos;s democratic progress { http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=c5da8450-7c23-4002-844f-03e7dae8146c }. Furthermore, respectable global media stationsm including The Economist and The Financial Times have criticised the allegations against Enkhbayar and attributed his case as evidence of increasing corruption in Mongolia { http://www.economist.com/node/21553503 } { http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18065896 }. Furthermore, the General Secretary for UN, Ban Ki Moon have made a call to the President Tsakhia Elbegdorj and expressed his concern about the Enkhbayar case { http://www.infomongolia.com/ct/ci/4043 }. [ Sports ] During his service, Enkhbayar was actively involved in sports, among his favourites are mountain-climbing, biking, rowing and horse-riding. He climbed the highest peak in Mongolia, Mt.Khuiten two times { http://ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=500 } with the Mongolian Mountain Climbing Association. Enkhbayar enthusiastically encouraged sports involvement in Mongolia, whilst also participating in various sports exhibitions, and had forged close ties with several sports organizations within and outside Mongolia. [ Religion ] Enkhbayar is a devoted follower of Tibetan Buddhism and has dedicated a lot of time in preaching teachings and encouraging flourishment of Buddhism locally and internationally { http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=9,6649,0,0,1,0 }. He translated several Buddhist texts into Mongolian { http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=9,6649,0,0,1,0 }. While still under communist regime at the time, Enkhbayar indicates the Russian tendency to ask metaphysical questions as the trigger to explore his spiritual path in the Mongolian Buddhist traditions. As a follower of Mahayana Buddhism, Enkhbayar stated that: “As the eldest child in the family, my parents always implied I had to take care of my youngest sisters and of the house, that I had to be actively responsible without their asking. By extension, it helped me feel responsible for my friends, then for society and for my country. Entering politics, becoming a statesman was the way to fulfil that mission.” { http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=9,6649,0,0,1,0 } During his term as a President, Enkhbayar welcomed the Dalai Lama on August, 2006, when the Dalai Lama visited Mongolia and stayed at Enkhbayar’s residence { http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t85486.html }.
