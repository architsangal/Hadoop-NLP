This rapid expansion caused the Universe to cool and resulted in its present continuously expanding state.

While protons and neutrons combined to form the first atomic nuclei only a few minutes after the Big Bang, it would take thousands of years for electrons to combine with them and create electrically neutral atoms. The first element produced was hydrogen, along with traces of helium and lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements would coalesce through gravity to form star s and galaxies, and the heavier elements would be synthesized either within stars or during supernovae. The Big Bang is a well-tested scientific theory which is widely accepted within the scientific community because it is the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for the full range of phenomena astronomers observe. Since its conception, abundant evidence has arisen to further validate the model. [ Wright E.L. 9 May 2009 What is the evidence for the Big Bang? http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html#BBevidence Frequently Asked Questions in Cosmology UCLA, Division of Astronomy and Astrophysics 2009-10-16 ] Georges Lemaître first proposed what would become the Big Bang theory in what he called his &quot; hypothesis of the primeval atom. &quot; Over time, scientists would build on his initial ideas to form the modern synthesis. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on Albert Einstein &apos;s general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. The governing equations had been formulated by Alexander Friedmann. In 1929 Edwin Hubble discovered that the distances to far away galaxies were generally proportional to their redshift s —an idea originally suggested by Lemaître in 1927. Hubble&apos;s observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity. [ Hubble E. 1929 A Relation Between Distance and Radial Velocity Among Extra-Galactic Nebulae http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/1996/hub_1929.html Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 15 3 168–73 1929PNAS...15..168H 10.1073/pnas.15.3.168 522427 16577160 harv ] If the distance between galaxy clusters is increasing today, everything must have been closer together in the past. This idea has been considered in detail back in time to extreme densities and temperature s, [ Gibson C.H. 21 January 2001 http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/GibsonAbstract.pdf The First Turbulent Mixing and Combustion IUTAM Turbulent Mixing and Combustion ] [ Gibson C.H. 2001 Turbulence And Mixing In The Early Universe astro-ph astro-ph/0110012 ] [ Gibson C.H. 2005 The First Turbulent Combustion astro-ph astro-ph/0501416 ] and large particle accelerator s have been built to experiment on and test such conditions, resulting in significant confirmation of this model. On the other hand, these accelerators have limited capabilities to probe into such high energy regimes. There is little evidence regarding the absolute earliest instant of the expansion. Thus, the Big Bang theory cannot and does not provide any explanation for such an initial condition; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the universe going forward from that point on. The observed abundances of the light elements throughout the cosmos closely match the calculated predictions for the formation of these elements from nuclear processes in the rapidly expanding and cooling first minutes of the universe, as logically and quantitatively detailed according to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. After the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, and especially when its spectrum (i.e., the amount of radiation measured at each wavelength) was found to match that of thermal radiation from a black body, most scientists had become fairly convinced that some version of the Big Bang scenario must have occurred.

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the Universe was filled homogeneously and isotropic ally with an incredibly high energy density and huge temperature s and pressure s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10 −37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the Universe grew exponentially. [ Guth A.H. 1998 The Inflationary Universe: Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins Vintage Books 978-0-09-995950-2 ] After inflation stopped, the Universe consisted of a quark–gluon plasma, as well as all other elementary particle s. [ Schewe P. 2005 An Ocean of Quarks http://www.aip.org/pnu/2005/split/728-1.html Physics News Update American Institute of Physics 728 1 harv ] Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quark s and lepton s over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30  million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present Universe. { Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6 } The Universe continued to grow in size and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental force s of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. { Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7 } After about 10 −11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle physics experiments. At about 10 −6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryon s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10 10 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the Universe was dominated by photon s (with a minor contribution from neutrino s ). A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10 9; SI prefix giga- ) kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the Universe&apos;s deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei. As the Universe cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation. After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen ); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation. { Peacock (1999), chapter 9 } { Hubble Ultra Deep Field showcases galaxies from an ancient era when the Universe was younger, denser, and warmer according to the Big Bang theory. } Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, star s, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the Universe. The four possible types of matter are known as cold dark matter, warm dark matter, hot dark matter and baryonic matter. The best measurements available (from WMAP ) show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold ( warm dark matter is ruled out by early reionization [ Spergel D. N. 2003 First year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations: determination of cosmological parameters Astrophysical Journal Supplement 148 1 175 astro-ph/0302209 10.1086/377226 2003ApJS..148..175S 1 Verde L.

Jarosik N. ] ), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%. In an &quot; extended model &quot; which includes hot dark matter in the form of neutrino s, then if the &quot; physical baryon density &quot; Ω b h 2 is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the &apos;baryon density&apos; Ω b expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density Ω c h 2 is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density Ω v h 2 is estimated to be less than 0.0062. Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernova e and the CMB imply that the Universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today&apos;s Universe is in this form. When the Universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity had the upper hand, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the expansion of the Universe to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the cosmological constant term in Einstein&apos;s field equation s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically. All of this cosmic evolution after the inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein&apos;s General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10 −15 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the Universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics. [ Underlying assumptions ] The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of physical law s, and the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order 10 −5. [ Ivanchik A.V. 1999 The Fine-Structure Constant: A New Observational Limit on Its Cosmological Variation and Some Theoretical Consequences Astronomy and Astrophysics 343 459 1999A &amp; A...343..439I harv astro-ph/9810166 Potekhin A. Y. Varshalovich D. A. ] Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars while extrapolation to cosmological scales has been validated by the empirical successes of various aspects of the Big Bang theory. { Detailed information of and references for tests of general relativity are given in the article } { tests of general relativity. } If the large-scale Universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10 −5 via observations of the CMB. { This ignores the } { dipole anisotropy at a level of 0.1% due to the peculiar velocity of the solar system through the radiation field. } [ March 2012 ] The Universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level. [ Goodman J. 1995 Geocentrism Reexamined Physical Review D 52 4 1821 10.1103/PhysRevD.52.1821 harv astro-ph/9506068 1995PhRvD..52.1821G ] [ FLRW metric ] [ Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric Metric expansion of space ] General relativity describes spacetime by a metric, which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a coordinate chart or &quot; grid &quot; that is laid down over all spacetime. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, which uniquely singles out the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW metric). This metric contains a scale factor, which describes how the size of the Universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system the grid expands along with the Universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the Universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance ( comoving distance ) remains constant, the physical distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the Universe. [ d&apos;Inverno R. 1992 Chapter 23 Introducing Einstein&apos;s Relativity Oxford University Press 0-19-859686-3 ] The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our Universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space. [ Horizons ] [ Cosmological horizon ] An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of horizons. Since the Universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never &quot; catch up &quot; to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our Universe. Our understanding of the Universe back to very early times suggests that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the Universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the Universe continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well. { Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3 } [ History ] [ History of the Big Bang theory ] [ Timeline of cosmology ] [ Etymology ] Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the term Big Bang during a 1949 radio broadcast. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative &quot; steady state &quot; cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.

In 1912 Vesto Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a &quot; spiral nebula &quot; (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were &quot; island universes &quot; outside our Milky Way.

Independently deriving Friedmann&apos;s equations in 1927, Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the Universe.

This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshift s had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as Hubble&apos;s law. [ Christianson E. Edwin Hubble: Mariner of the Nebulae 1995 Farrar, Straus and Giroux 0-374-14660-8 ] Lemaître had already shown that this was expected, given the Cosmological Principle. [ Peebles P.J.E. Ratra B.

[ Kragh H. 1996 Cosmology and Controversy Princeton University Press Princeton (NJ) 0-691-02623-8 ] This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, Monsignor Georges Lemaître, was a Roman Catholic priest.

A beginning in time was &quot; repugnant &quot; to him. [ Nature The End of the World: from the Standpoint of Mathematical Physics Sir Arthur Eddington A.

If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.

One was Fred Hoyle &apos;s steady state model, whereby new matter would be created as the Universe seemed to expand. In this model the Universe is roughly the same at any point in time.

Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the Universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory. Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology have been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as COBE, [ Boggess N.W. 1992 The COBE Mission: Its Design and Performance Two Years after the launch Astrophysical Journal 397 420 10.1086/171797 harv 1992ApJ...397..420B 1 Mather J.

If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional velocity of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the cosmic distance ladder. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble&apos;s law is observed: v = H 0 D, where [ 1.3 1.4 ] v is the recessional velocity of the galaxy or other distant object, D is the comoving distance to the object, and H 0 is Hubble&apos;s constant, measured to be km / s / Mpc by the WMAP probe. Hubble&apos;s law has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle —or the Universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson and Walker. The theory requires the relation v = HD to hold at all times, where D is the comoving distance, v is the recessional velocity, and v, H, and D vary as the Universe expands (hence we write H 0 to denote the present-day Hubble &quot; constant &quot; ). For distances much smaller than the size of the observable Universe, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity v. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the Universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected. { Peacock (1999), chapter 3 } That space is undergoing metric expansion is shown by direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble&apos;s law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshift s are extremely isotropic and homogenous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the Universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions. Measurements of the effects of the cosmic microwave background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. [ Srianand R. Petitjean P. Ledoux C. The microwave background temperature at the redshift of 2.33771 Nature 408 6815 931–935 astro-ph/0012222 2000Natur.408..931S 10.1038/35050020 European Southern Observatory December 2000 http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-27-00.html 2000 ] Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the Universe. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is explainable only if the Universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

Freedman Measuring and Modeling the Universe Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series Cambridge University Press 291 0-521-75576-X astro-ph/0305591 ] In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the microwave band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMB predictions: the radiation was found to be consistent with an almost perfect black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725  K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978. The surface of last scattering corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after recombination, the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles. Peaking at around [ 372 14 kyr ], the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent. { COBE satellite is the most-precisely measured } { black body spectrum in nature. } [ White M. 1999 Anisotropies in the CMB Proceedings of the Los Angeles Meeting, DPF 99 UCLA 1999dpf..conf.....W astro-ph/9903232 ] { The } { data point s and } { error bars on this graph are obscured by the theoretical curve. } In 1989 NASA launched the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE). Its findings were consistent with predictions regarding the CMB, finding a residual temperature of 2.726  K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.725  K) and providing the first evidence for fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 10 5. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the Nobel Prize for their leadership in this work. During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of the Universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies. In early 2003 the first results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models, but are consistent with the inflation theory in general. The Planck space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based cosmic microwave background experiments are ongoing. [ Abundance of primordial elements ] [ Big Bang nucleosynthesis ] Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of helium-4, helium-3, deuterium and lithium-7 in the Universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of photon s to baryon s. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for [ Helium 4 ] / [ Hydrogen ], about 10 −3 for [ Hydrogen 2 ] / [ Hydrogen ], about 10 −4 for [ Helium 3 ] / [ Hydrogen ] and about 10 −9 for [ Lithium 7 ] / [ Hydrogen ]. { Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4 } The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for [ Helium 4 ], and off by a factor of two [ Lithium 7 ]; in the latter two cases there are substantial systematic uncertainties. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to &quot; tune &quot; the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. [ Steigman G. 2005 Primordial Nucleosynthesis: Successes And Challenges harv 10.1142/S0218301306004028 International Journal of Modern Physics E [Nuclear Physics] 15 1–36 astro-ph/0511534 2006IJMPE..15....1S ] Indeed there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young Universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of stellar nucleosynthesis products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than [ Helium 3 ], and in constant ratios, too. [ Galactic evolution and distribution ] [ Galaxy formation and evolution Large-scale structure of the cosmos Structure formation ] { near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the } { Milky Way. The galaxies are color coded by } { redshift. } Detailed observations of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars provide strong evidence for the Big Bang. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and supercluster s. Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early Universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.

The composition of the gas matches theoretical predictions, providing direct evidence in support of the modern cosmological explanation for the origins of elements in the universe. The researchers discovered the two clouds of pristine gas by analyzing the light from distant quasars, using the HIRES spectrometer on the Keck I Telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. They saw absorption lines in the spectrum where the light was absorbed by the gas, and that allows them to measure the composition of the gas.

Throughout the historical development of the subject, problems with the Big Bang theory were posed in the context of a scientific controversy regarding which model could best describe the cosmological observations. With the overwhelming consensus in the community today supporting the Big Bang model, many of these problems are remembered as being mainly of historical interest; the solutions to them have been obtained either through modifications to the theory or as the result of better observations. [ April 2012 ] The core ideas of the Big Bang—the expansion, the early hot state, the formation of helium, the formation of galaxies—are derived from many observations that are independent from any cosmological model; these include the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background, large scale structure, and the Hubble diagram for Type Ia supernova e. Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently the subject to the most active laboratory investigations. [ Direct Searches for Dark Matter B. Sadoulet http://www8.nationalacademies.org/astro2010/DetailFileDisplay.aspx?id%3D225 Astro2010: The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey 12-3-2012 The National Academies ] Remaining issues, such as the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter, are not fatal to the dark matter explanation as solutions to such problems exist which involve only further refinements of the theory. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. [ For a Comprehensive Space-Based Dark Energy Mission R. Cahn http://www8.nationalacademies.org/astro2010/DetailFileDisplay.aspx?id%3D243 Astro2010: The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey 12-3-2012 The National Academies ] On the other hand, inflation and baryogenesis remain somewhat more speculative features of current Big Bang models: they explain important features of the early universe, but could be replaced by alternative ideas without affecting the rest of the theory. { If inflation is true, baryogenesis must have occurred, but not vice versa. } [ March 2012 ] Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently unsolved problems in physics. [ Horizon problem ] [ Horizon problem ] The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel faster than light. In a Universe of finite age this sets a limit—the particle horizon —on the separation of any two regions of space that are in causal contact. { Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8 } The observed isotropy of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the Universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature. A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the Universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the Universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable Universe are well inside each other&apos;s particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation. Heisenberg&apos;s uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the Universe. Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB. If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon. [ Flatness problem ] [ Flatness problem ] { geometry of the Universe is determined by whether the } { Omega cosmological parameter is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a } { closed Universe with positive curvature, a } { hyperbolic Universe with negative curvature and a } { flat Universe with zero curvature. } The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric. The Universe may have positive, negative or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the critical density, positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be flat. The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the Universe today remains very close to flat. { Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the Universe towards a flat state; however, our Universe remained close to flat for several billion years, before the dark energy density became significant. } Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10 −43 seconds, the fact that the Universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires some explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes(the time of nucleosynthesis), the Universe density must have been within one part in 10 14 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today. [ Dicke R.H. Peebles P.J.E The big bang cosmology—enigmas and nostrums General Relativity: an Einstein centenary survey Hawking, S.W. (ed); Israel, W. (ed) Cambridge University Press 504–517 ] A resolution to this problem is offered by inflationary theory. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that its curvature would have been smoothed out. Thus, it is theorized that inflation drove the Universe to a very nearly spatially flat state, with almost exactly the critical density. [ Dark energy ] [ Dark energy ] Measurements of the redshift – magnitude relation for type Ia supernova e indicate that the expansion of the Universe has been accelerating since the Universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the Universe consists of a component with large negative pressure, dubbed &quot; dark energy &quot;. Dark energy is indicated by several other lines of evidence. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the Universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the Universe must have almost exactly the critical density of mass/energy. But the mass density of the Universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the &quot; missing &quot; energy density. Dark energy is also required by two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the Universe, one using the frequency of gravitational lens es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the large-scale structure as a cosmic ruler. Negative pressure is a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a cosmological constant and quintessence. Results from the WMAP team in 2008, which combined data from the CMB and other sources, indicate that the contributions to mass/energy density in the Universe today are approximately 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. The energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the Universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the Universe expands. Therefore matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the Universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant. In the ΛCDM, a leading model of the Big Bang, [ April 2012 ] dark energy is explained by the presence of a cosmological constant in the general theory of relativity. [ April 2012 ] However, the size of the constant that properly explains dark energy is surprisingly small relative to naive estimates based on ideas about quantum gravity. [ April 2012 ] Distinguishing between the cosmological constant and other explanations of dark energy is an active area of current research. [ April 2012 ] [ Dark matter ] [ Dark matter ] { pie chart indicating the proportional composition of different energy-density components of the Universe, according to the best } { ΛCDM model fits roughly 95% is in the exotic forms of dark matter and } { dark energy } During the 1970s and 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the Universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryon ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the Universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the Universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter was initially controversial, it is now indicated by numerous observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters. [ Keel B. Dark Matter http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/darkmatter.html 2007-05-28 ] The evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, and no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.

Grand unification theories predicted topological defect s in space that would manifest as magnetic monopole s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early Universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that searches have never found any monopoles. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable Universe in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness. { Kolb and Turner, chapter 8 } A resolution to the horizon, flatness, and magnetic monopole problems alternative to cosmic inflation is offered by the Weyl curvature hypothesis.

However, observations suggest that the Universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the Universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. [ Sakharov A.D. 1967 Violation of CP Invariance, C Asymmetry and Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe Zhurnal Eksperimental&apos;noi i Teoreticheskoi Fiziki, Pisma 5 32 harv ] (Translated in Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters 5, 24 (1967).) All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effect is not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry. [ Globular cluster age ] In the mid-1990s observations of globular cluster s appeared to be inconsistent with the Big Bang theory. Computer simulations that matched the observations of the stellar populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15  billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.7  billion year age of the Universe. This issue was partially resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar wind s, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. [ Navabi A.A. Riazi N. 2003 Is the Age Problem Resolved? Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy 24 1–2 3 10.1007/BF03012187 harv 2003JApA...24....3N ] There remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, but it is clear that observations of globular clusters no longer appear inconsistent with the Big Bang theory. [ The future according to the Big Bang theory ] [ Ultimate fate of the universe ] Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the Universe. If the mass density of the Universe were greater than the critical density, then the Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch. { Kolb and Turner, 1988, chapter 3 } Alternatively, if the density in the Universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out leaving white dwarf s, neutron star s, and black hole s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the Universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero —a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the Universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death. Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible Universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the Universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the Universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.

Little is known about the earliest moments of the Universe&apos;s history. The equations of classical general relativity indicate a singularity at the origin of cosmic time, although this conclusion depends on several assumptions. Moreover, general relativity must break down before the Universe reaches the Planck temperature, and a correct treatment of quantum gravity may avoid the would-be singularity. [ Hawking S.W.
