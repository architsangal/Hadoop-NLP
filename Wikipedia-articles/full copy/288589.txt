Konami is famous for popular video game series such as Castlevania, Contra, Dance Dance Revolution, Gradius, Frogger, Metal Gear, Pro Evolution Soccer, Silent Hill and Yu-Gi-Oh!. The company was founded in 1969 as a jukebox rental and repair business in Osaka, Japan, by Kagemasa Kōzuki, the still-current chairman and president. The name &quot; Konami &quot; is a conjunction of the names Kagemasa Kozuki (current chairman and president), Yoshinobu Nakama, and Tatsuo Miyasako. [ August 2009 ] Konami is currently headquartered in Tokyo and additionally operates health and physical fitness clubs in Japan. Konami also operates United States activities in El Segundo, California for video games and Paradise, Nevada for the casino gaming industry. Its Australian gaming operations are located in Sydney, Australia, and distribution of Konami&apos;s games in Australia is handled by Mindscape Australia. [ History ] On March 21, 1969, Kagemasa Kozuki (current chairman of the board and CEO) founded a jukebox rental/repair business in Osaka. On March 19, 1973, Kozuki transformed the business into Konami Industry Co., Ltd. and began work on manufacturing &quot; amusement machines &quot; for arcades. Their first actual game machine was not created until 1978, and they began exporting products to the United States the following year. They began to achieve success with hit arcade games such as 1981&apos;s Frogger, Scramble, and Super Cobra, many of which were licensed to other companies for stateside release, including Stern Electronics and Gremlin Industries. In May 1980, the headquarters was moved to Toyonaka, Osaka. In March 1981, the Konami logo was established. A new logo with the name in italics was released in 1986 and was altered in 1998 from italics to Roman text. In 2003, Konami introduced a new logo on the company&apos;s 30th anniversary since its establishment. The company also introduced the new tagline &quot; びっくり:Bikkuri &quot;, which means &quot; Be Creative &quot;. { 2003 Konami Group Report April 1, 2002 - March 31, 2003 } [ January 2012 ] In October 1982, Konami began manufacturing and selling PC games. In November 1982, Konami of America, Inc. (currently Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc.) was established in Torrance, California. It relocated to Wood Dale, Illinois in 1984 and in 1999 it relocated again to Redwood City, California, leaving a location in Illinois open strictly for the manufacturing of Konami&apos;s arcade video games. In 2003, Konami of America closed down their arcade division due to heavy losses; the entire Buffalo Grove, Illinois location was shut down along with it. All machine inquiries and new machines would thereafter be handled by Betson Enterprises. As of 2007, Konami Corporation of America has moved its U.S head office once again from Redwood City to Konami Digital Entertainment&apos;s office in El Segundo, California. In November 1983, Konami began manufacturing and selling MSX games. In May 1984, Konami Ltd. (currently Konami Digital Entertainment B.V.) was established in the United Kingdom. In October 1984, Konami was listed on the Second Section of the Osaka Securities Exchange (specially designated stocks in the second section). Subsequent stock listings include Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (2/1988), London Stock Exchange (9/1999), New York Stock Exchange (9/2002), and the Nikkei Stock Average (Nikkei 225)(10/2003). In December 1984, Konami GmbH (currently Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH) was established in Germany. In April 1985, Konami began manufacturing and selling Family Computer ( &quot; Famicom &quot; ) video games. This new business was, in addition to their arcade market, from which many games were later ported. Konami began to achieve great success when the Famicom took off, being released in the United States as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Many of the NES/Famicom&apos;s bestselling titles were produced by Konami, including Gradius, the Castlevania series, the Contra series, and Metal Gear. Konami was one of the most active and prolific third party development studios for the NES, which led to conflict with Nintendo of America &apos;s licensing restrictions. During the heyday of the NES, Nintendo of America controlled the production of all licensed NES software titles, and limited third party developers to a maximum of five titles per year. Several companies found a way around this restriction by founding quasi-independent subsidiary corporations, effectively doubling the number of games that they could release during the year. In the case of Konami, this subsidiary was known as Ultra Games, and many of Konami titles were published in North America under their banner, including Metal Gear, Gyruss, Skate or Die!, the first two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games and Snake&apos;s Revenge (a sequel to the original Metal Gear made specifically for the western market). In Europe, faced with a similar restriction placed by Nintendo &apos;s European branch, Konami established Palcom Software Ltd. to the same end. By the early 1990s, Nintendo of America had relaxed many of its licensing restrictions, and, no longer needed, Ultra was reabsorbed into Konami&apos;s official American branch in 1992. In December 1987, Konami Kosan Co., Ltd. (currently Konami Real Estate, Inc.) was established. In May 1991, Konami Technology Development Center (currently Amusement Content Business&apos;s Kobe Office) opened in Kobe. In June 1991, Konami Industries Co., Ltd., was renamed to Konami Co., Ltd.

In December 1999, the official registered address of Konami&apos;s headquarters was changed from Kobe to Tokyo. In January 2000, Konami received a licence of manufacturing and sales of gaming machines from the U.S. state of Nevada. In June 2000, Konami Software Shanghai, Inc. was established. In July 2000, Konami Co., Ltd. was renamed to Konami Corporation. In August 2000, Konami Computer Entertainment Sapporo, Inc. merged with Konami Computer Entertainment Yokohama, Inc., and the new company was named Konami Computer Entertainment Studios, Inc. On September 21, 2000, Konami and Universal Studios announced that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive ( Vivendi Games ) handling the production of the games. In October 2000, Konami Marketing, Inc., was established and began operations. In February 2001, People Co., Ltd. (later renamed Konami Sports &amp; Life Co., Ltd.) became Konami&apos;s subsidiary through a friendly TOB takeover bid and Konami entered the health &amp; fitness business. On May 14, 2001, Konami made a deal with Universal Interactive to team up by producing and distributing some more titles, rather than just the Crash Bandicoot titles.

[ Video games ] [ List of Konami games ] Konami has created and produced some of the biggest and most memorable video games over the past 25 years. Genre-defining titles attributed to Konami include the vampire-hunting side scroller Castlevania series, the survival horror Silent Hill series, the action/shooter Contra series, the platform/adventure Ganbare Goemon series, the espionage action Metal Gear series, the console role-playing Suikoden series, the music-oriented Bemani series (which includes Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, GuitarFreaks, DrumMania, and Pop&apos;n Music, among others) and the dating simulation Tokimeki Memorial series. Konami is particularly notable for its arcade shoot &apos;em up games such as Gradius, Life Force, Time Pilot, Gyruss, Parodius, Axelay, and TwinBee. Konami&apos;s games based on cartoon licenses, especially the Batman: The Animated Series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Tiny Toon Adventures series, but other American productions like The Simpsons, Bucky O&apos;Hare, G.I. Joe and The Goonies and French production ( Asterix ) all have seen release at some point in the past by Konami either on arcades and/or video game consoles. Recent cinematically styled franchises from Konami are the continuing Silent Hill survival horror franchise, and the Metal Gear series, which underwent a public renaissance with Metal Gear Solid. Another successful franchise is Winning Eleven, the spiritual sequel to International Superstar Soccer, which is extremely popular in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Europe, where it is sold by the name Pro Evolution Soccer. And in Japan, it is known for the extremely popular Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū series baseball series and the Zone of the Enders games. The company has also recently picked up Saw from Brash Entertainment when the game&apos;s production had been suspended due to financial issues. [ 2009-02-05 http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12266 Saw videogame picked up by Konami? 2009-02-06 ] Konami is also known for its password, the Konami Code, which traditionally gives many power-up s in its games. Although variants also exist, as in the Parodius series, and button naming can differ depending on the controller used, the classic Famicom or NES combination is: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A. Although use of this code in more recent Konami productions has been sparse. [ Marketing ] Konami is represented by the goroawase number &quot; 573 &quot;. &quot; Five &quot; in Japanese is go, changed to the voiceless form ko; &quot; 7 &quot; in Japanese is nana shortened to na; &quot; 3 &quot; in Japanese is mittsu, shortened to mi; &quot; 573 &quot; = ko-na-mi. This number appears in many Konami telephone numbers and as a high score in Konami games like Dance Dance Revolution (which also featured songs with a max combo of the number) as an example; in some other games like Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, the number is occasionally used as minor self-reference to the company. [ Movie production ] In 2006, Konami started producing movies based on their popular franchises. Konami produced the &apos;&apos;Silent Hill&apos;&apos; movie (released in 2006) and has announced that they will produce a &apos;&apos;Metal Gear Solid&apos;&apos; movie.
