The first successful VfR test firing with liquid fuel (five minutes) was at the Heylandt Works on January 25, 1930; and additional rocket experiments were conducted at a farm near Bernstadt, Saxony. [ Wade Mark Mirak http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/mirak.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica astronautix.com 2009-09-14 ] Space travel and rocketry gained popularity in Germany, following the June 1923 publication of the book Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen ( [ By Rocket into Planetary Space ] ) and the expanded 1929 work Wege zur Raumschiffahrt (Ways to Spaceflight). The VfR was founded by Johannes Winkler, with Max Valier and Willy Ley following participation as expert advisers for Fritz Lang &apos;s early science fiction film Frau im Mond (The Woman in the Moon). Ley and Oberth had hoped to receive funding from Lang for a real life experimental rocket launch coinciding with the movie&apos;s premier. { The Nazi Rocketeers, Dreams of Space and Crimes of War ( } { ISBN 0811733874 pp 4 and 27. See extensive bibliography there. } Valier had assisted in Fritz von Opel &apos;s rocket-powered publicity stunt s for the Opel company. In September 1930, before Hitler came to power, the VfR contacted the German army for funding. Rockets were one of the few fields of military development not restricted by the Versailles treaty at the end of the world war, 11 years earlier. They received permission from the municipality to use an abandoned ammunition dump at Reinickendorf, the Berlin rocket launching site ( [ Raketenflugplatz Berlin ] ). For three years the VfR fired increasingly powerful rockets of their own design from this location. Following the unsuccessful Mirak rocket s, the most powerful rocket of the Repulsor series (named for a spaceship in a German novel) [ Collins Martin 2007 After Sputnik: 50 Years of the Space Age New York Smithsonian Books 978-0-06-089781-9 16 ] reached altitudes over 1  km (3,000  ft). In the Spring of 1932; Capt Walter Dornberger, his commander (Captain Ritter von Horstig), and Col Karl Heinrich Emil Becker viewed a (failed) VfR firing; and Dornberger subsequently issued a contract for a demonstration launch. Wernher Von Braun who was then a young student and had joined the group two years earlier was in favor of the contract [ Ordway Frederick I, III Frederick I.

The society&apos;s demise was also the result of an inability to find funding, and Berlin&apos;s civic authorities becoming concerned with rocketry experiments so close to the city. The only known VfR rocket artifact is a rejected aluminum Repulsor nozzle which member Herbert Schaefer took to the US when he emigrated in 1935 and which he donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1978.
