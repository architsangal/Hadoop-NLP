[ SNORKS AND POPPLES The New York Times May 1, 1988 http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/01/books/snorks-and-popples.html?scp%3D2%26amp%3Bsq%3Dsnorks%26amp%3Bst%3Dcse 2010-10-20 Elizabeth Bailey ] [ Synopsis ] The Snorks are a race of small, colorful beings that live happily in the underwater world of Snorkland. They have snorkel s on their heads, which are used to propel them swiftly through the water. As evidenced by the cartoon series, when a Snork becomes excited their tube makes a &quot; snork &quot; sound. They have much of the same technology as contemporary humans, adapted to their own aquatic environment. The Snorks use clams as currency. According to the Snork back-story, which was described in the show&apos;s first opening theme, a few ventured to the surface (which the Snorks believe is &quot; outer space &quot; ) in 1643, and watched a Royal Navy ship being attacked by pirates. The captain wound up in the water, and that was the first contact between the species when the Snorks saved his life, to which the captain then expressed his gratitude by writing a book about the Snorks, although very few humans believe in the existence of the Snorks. Since then, Snorks have adopted several human habits, such as wearing clothes. There are a few episodes which have human encounters with the Snorks. [ Characters ] [ Main Snorks ] Allstar Seaworthy (voiced by Michael Bell ) - An athletic, yellow -skinned, male Snork, generally considered to be the hero of the series. He is smart, brave and generous, usually serving as the leader of his gang during their various adventures. Allstar has a big interest, and excels, in science and inventions, much like his uncle, Dr. Galeo Seaworthy. Whenever AllStar reaches a &quot; light bulb moment &quot;, his belt buckle would start to spin, giving him a &quot; starbright idea &quot;. He is Casey&apos;s love interest, and used to be best friends with Junior when they were younger. He has a baby sister named Smallstar. Allstar has once joked that he will never understand female Snorks in the episode &quot; Learn to Love Your Snork &quot; when he fails to understand why Casey is upset. Casey Kelp (voiced by B.J. Ward ) - A light-pink-skinned, female Snork with reddish hair tied up into bunches by green hair bows. Usually wears a midriff green shirt and matching pants. Intelligent, brave, and kind-hearted, she dislikes bullies or being bullied and will stand up for herself as well as others. Also pretty good at drawing. Once upset about her &quot; giant &quot; snork and goes out of her way to hide/shrink it. She is Allstar&apos;s love interest and Daffney&apos;s best friend. In season 4, however, she has a big crush on a star Snorkball player named Stevie and eventually becomes his date for the school prom, making her relationship with Allstar seem nonexistent. Wellington Wetworth, Jr. aka &quot; Junior &quot; (voiced by Barry Gordon ) - An orange -skinned, male Snork with bluish hair who is a spoiled snob that takes after his parents, especially his Governor father. Before Bigweed becomes the villain in season 3, Junior is seen as minor villain-like, due to his rude attitude towards other Snorks, especially Allstar and his gang. He constantly seeks wealth, status, and to outperform Allstar, whom he frequently calls &quot; Allwet &quot;, in everything. Usually learns his lesson at the end of the episode. Used to be best friends with Allstar when he was younger until standing up for himself went to his head. During the first two seasons, he appears to have a crush on Casey, but starting from season 3 he is often seen with Daffney, and hangs out more with Allstar&apos;s gang. Daffney Gillfin (voiced by Nancy Cartwright impersonating Mae Questel ) - A pretty, coral -colored, dark-haired female Snork who wears a bob haircut and a red star-shaped hairpin. Always concerned with her looks, but has a good heart deep down. She won the title of Miss Junior Snorkland in a beauty pageant with the help of Yucky, a baby rainbow swamp fish (much like the ugly duckling ). With a talent in fine arts, Daffney becomes star of the show as the understudy for Tallulah Bankfish (a famous Broadway theatre actress from New Snork City) in a play, and has entered a piece of sculpture for an art show. She is best friends with Casey and Dimmy&apos;s love interest before he is written out. Also has a good relationship with Jo-Jo (who once calls Daffney &quot; Alberta Einsnork &quot; ), and Lil Seaweed, with whom she shares fashion tips and works as fellow trapeze artists in a circus once. Tooter Shelby (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker ) - A green -skinned, good-natured male Snork with dark green hair who is affected by aphasia and can &quot; communicate &quot; only through &quot; tooting &quot;. His parents do not share this language disorder, although Tooter&apos;s mom has a lisp. Nevertheless, he is well loved by his friends who seem to have no problem understanding him. He has the ability to communicate with some of the sealife. Has once fallen in love with another tooting Snork named Tadah. Dimitris &quot; Dimmy &quot; Finster (voiced by Brian Cummings ) - An athletic, orange-skinned, male Snork, Dimmy fancies himself to be a comedian as well as a fighter, but his attempts usually lead to awkward results. Has learned ballet from Daffney to improve his Snorkball skills. He also has a big appetite, and hates being called by his full name. He is Allstar&apos;s good friend and Daffney&apos;s love interest, although he is temporarily replaced by Jo-Jo as Daffney&apos;s date to the debutante ball and becomes jealous. Once had a crush on a little mermaid whom he saved from a storm and the evil Dr. Strangesnork. From the beginning of the season 3, he is written out of the storylines for unknown reasons, but he does make some cameo appearances. [ Minor Snorks ] Occy (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker ) - Allstar&apos;s red male pet octopus. He was once owned by Junior until the latter abandoned him. Occy never gets along with Junior and will go out of his way to embarrass and/or chase Junior. Conversely, Occy is very loyal to Allstar. A multi-instrumentalist, Occy has held a sold-out concert to help Allstar raise money for the heavily-in-debt Dr. Galeo. Corky (voiced by Rob Paulsen ) - An orange-skinned, male Snork. He works as the Snork Patrol Officer, a dedicated defender of Snorkland and quite a workaholic. He drives a multi-functional submarine, and his home is filled with all kinds of medals he has won for heroic achievements. He is liked by all Snorks and gets along well with Allstar and his friends. Fengy - A dogfish and Jo-Jo&apos;s companion since he was a child. Willie Wetworth (voiced by Fredricka Weber) - An orange-skinned boy Snork, younger brother of Junior, who often picks on him yet is still someone Willie looks up to and whose words Willie often repeats. He is the opposite of Junior — nice, kind, warm-hearted, and well liked by all. He is friends with Smallstar. Governor Wellington Wetworth (voiced by Frank Nelson in Season 1 and 2, Barry Gordon in Season 3) - An orange-skinned, male Snork with lavender colored hair. Vain and egocentric, Governor Wetworth is a stereotypical politician who generally evades blames and takes undue credit, thus disliked by the majority of Snorks. As Junior and Willie&apos;s father, he wants Junior to follow in his steps and often turns a blind eye to Junior&apos;s misbehavior until trouble arises. Dislikes Dr. Galeo, Allstar and his gang for stealing the spotlight. He is also a younger brother to Captain Long John, a kindly, old pirate who&apos;s friends with AllStar and Casey. Governor Wetworth often forgets and messes up his public speeches. Occasionally shows a good side of himself by donating to charity and encouraging Junior to earn his own money for buying a car. Dr. Galeo Seaworthy (voiced by Clive Revill ) - A purple -skinned, bespectacled male Snork with white hair and a moustache. A scientist and inventor, he has saved Snorktown numerous times from villains and disasters with his contraptions, whose occasional kinks also serve as a running gag throughout the series. He is Allstar&apos;s uncle, brother to Dr. Strangesnork, and a friend to Allstar&apos;s gang, often providing them with various devices for their adventures. He has successfully built a time machine which helps his prehisnorkic friend Ork get back home. Smallstar Seaworthy (voiced by Gail Matthius ) - A yellow-skinned, female, infant Snork. She is Allstar&apos;s baby sister and friends with Willie. She appears to be very naughty and has once vandalized Governor Wetworth&apos;s monument and doodled on his face with Casey&apos;s red crayon. The Council of Elders (voiced by Peter Cullen and Michael Bell ) - A group of 4 Snork Elders who are the true leaders of Snorkland and are mostly seen in the shadows. They are known to keep Governor Wellington Wetworth in check. [ Supporting Snorks ] [ SNIP Snip (disambiguation) ] Mr. Seaworthy (voiced by Bob Holt ) - A yellow-skinned, male Snork. He is Allstar and Smallstar&apos;s father, and manager of the Snorkland Steam Plant, responsible for providing energy for buildings and automobiles, as well as heat for heating and cooking needs for the residents of Snorktown. Mrs. Seaworthy (voiced by Edie McClurg ) - A bespectacled, yellow-skinned, pink-haired female Snork, Allstar and Smallstar&apos;s mother.

Grandpa Wetworth is a smart trickster that acts as if he knows less than what he does. He&apos;s an elderly male that is young at heart and in spirit, as well as being technologically savvy. Junior always tries to surpass him in tricks but Grandpa Wetworth is always one step ahead. He&apos;s liked by all and likes Allstar and his friends. Ms. Seabottom (voiced by Edie McClurg ) - A yellow-skinned, bespectacled female Snork. She is a high school teacher and appears to be the only teacher to take the students on field trips. SNIP and SNAP - A pair of robo-Snorks, with SNIP being male and SNAP female. They were created by Bigweed in order to get rid of Corky and thus taking over Snorkland. They pretend to be UFOs upon first appearance. After successfully framing Corky and making him leave, they allow Bigweed and Lil Seaweed to take over Snorkland. Then with a change of heart and SNAP being dismantled by a furious Lil Seaweed, SNIP helps Corky and Allstar&apos;s gang get rid of Bigweed and Lil Seaweed. Later, Dr. Galeo manages to rebuild SNAP and create a communication device that allows SNIP and SNAP to make sounds of basic words. [ Villains ] Finneus (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker ) - An orange catfish with black stripes. He&apos;s Dr. Strangesnork&apos;s sidekick and companion from childhood. He&apos;s always reminding Dr. Strangesnork of everything that he forgets. Lil Seaweed (voiced by B.J. Ward ) - Bigweed&apos;s female sidekick who wears a red hair bow and makeup. Same species as Bigweed with similar magical abilities but on a lower level. About the same age as Allstar and his friends.

The Great Snork Nork (voiced by Frank Welker ) - An indigo-colored vampire Snork and the Snork equivalent of Count Dracula. Unlike others, his snork is on the front of his face, turning downward. He has fangs and sleeps like a bat, hanging upside-down from the ceiling. He hates and avoids light at all cost. He has magical abilities and can hurl electrical bolts from his hands. He wants to take over Snorkland and is always accompanied by two sidekicks, who are miniature versions of him minus the magical abilities. The Snork-Eaters (Various Voices) - Large red creatures known to prey off Snorks. The only thing that scares them is a type of fish called Snork-Eater Eaters, with tiny bodies and enormous mouths. In addition, King Neptune also has the power to banish Snork-Eaters. [ Others ] Serena the Mermaid - A Snork-sized tiny mermaid with long blond hair. She is saved from a storm and later from Dr. Strangesnork by Dimmy, and is transformed into regular mermaid size by Dr. Strangesnork&apos;s enlarging machine. No longer worried about her size, she returns with her friends to the mermaid world after giving Casey one of her hair accessories and kissing Dimmy on the cheek. King Neptune - A character from Roman mythology serving as the ruler of the sea. He&apos;s portrayed as a merman who controls the rise and fall of tides with a magical conch shell.

Ebb - A good-natured, cream-colored Snork with a protruding front tooth who snorks and talks backwards. Shunned for his eccentricities in his hometown, Ebb left and settled down in a deserted, run-down reef in Snorkland. Initially mistaken by Allstar and his gang to be a faceless Snork monster, he befriends them and becomes an excellent snorkerang player. However, his new home is set to be rebuilt into a clamdominium by Governor Wetworth. Allstar&apos;s gang then plays a trick and makes the place appear haunted, and Ebb accidentally &quot; saves &quot; the Governor&apos;s life by chasing the &quot; monsters &quot; away. He is thus rewarded with a nice reef-top apartment for his &quot; heroic deeds &quot;. Ork - A prehisnorkic Snork with long red hair, who has been frozen in an ice cube for two million years and discovered by Dr. Galeo, Daffney and Jo-Jo. The Snork equivalent of a Stone Age caveman, Ork has poor grammar skills, dresses like Jo-Jo, and is deeply homesick when trapped in the &quot; modern &quot; Snorkland. However, having lived in the modern days for two months, he experiences a bit of a &quot; culture shock &quot; when he finally returns home via Galeo&apos;s time machine. Claiming that things are no longer what he remembers them to be, Ork decides to go back to Snorkland with his new friends. The Snork-Eater Eater - A small yellow fish that can commune with the Snorks. Its mouth can be opened and expanded to a great extent, catered specifically to devouring Snork-Eaters. [ Episode list ] [ Season 1 (1984) ] Season 1 ran from September 15, 1984 to December 8, 1984. Several title cards from Season 1 were lost in syndication for some unknown reason. The first season had a narration opening starting off with a random man narrating about a mythical legend about mysterious underwater sea creatures rescuing Spanish Captain Ortega. [ Snorks Season one intro http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DOuLlEWwl9S0%26amp%3Bfeature%3Drelated ] It was used exclusively on NBC in 1984. &quot; I first discovered Capt. Ortega&apos;s logbook in a monastery overlooking the ocean. On the morning of February 13, 1634, Captain Ortega anchored his ship behind a barrier reef. That night, they were attacked by pirates. The ship set afire sank into the lagoon. Ten days later, the Captain was found. Delirious, still clutching his logbook, he described a world of tiny, underwater creatures no bigger than his thumb. No one believed him, but you know, there&apos;s something about Captain Otega&apos;s story. That makes me believe it&apos;s true. &quot; A chorus begins singing &quot; Snork along, it&apos;s a snorkfilled celebration &quot;, which then yields to Tooter blowholing the title.
