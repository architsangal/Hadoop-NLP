[ all ] There are a number of Communist parties active in various countries across the world, and a number who used to be active. The formation of Communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the formation of the Communist Third International by the Russian Bolsheviks. Undoubtedly the most important of these parties were those of the Soviet Union and the People&apos;s Republic of China. Some Communist parties have names such as Workers World Party, Socialist Party, Progressive Party, etc. Most, but not all, of the parties on this list are those that were aligned with either Moscow or Beijing during the Cold War and their offshoots. Groups currently and exclusively participating in the Trotskyist tradition are not included in the listing.
