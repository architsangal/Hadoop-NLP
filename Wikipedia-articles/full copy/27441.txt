It is located north of mainland Europe, midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. The group of islands range from 74° to 81° north latitude (inside the Arctic Circle ), and from 10° to 35° east longitude. Spitsbergen is the largest island, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. The administrative center is Longyearbyen, and other settlements include the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research community of Ny-Ålesund and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. The archipelago is administered by the Governor of Svalbard. The islands were first used as a whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. This act also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol are the only mining companies remaining on the islands. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries. Two major research facilities are the University Centre in Svalbard and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway to the rest of Europe. The archipelago features an Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas at the same latitude. The flora take advantage of the long period of midnight sun to compensate for the polar night. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also features polar bears, reindeer and marine mammal s. Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, environment. Sixty percent of the archipelago is glacier, and the islands feature many mountains and fjord s.

All settlements are located on Spitsbergen, except the meteorological outposts on Bjørnøya and Hopen. The Norwegian state took possession of all unclaimed land, or 95.2% of the archipelago, at the time the Svalbard Treaty entered into force; Store Norske owns 4%, Arktikugol owns 0.4%, while other private owners hold 0.4%. Svalbard is located in the north-western corner of the Eurasian Plate. To the south and east, the seabed is shallow at [ 200 to 300 m ], while to the north and west it sinks down to about [ 4 km ]. North of Svalbard there is pack ice and the North Pole, and to the south mainland Norway. The Russian archipelago Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya are located to the east, Greenland is to the west. Being located north of the Arctic Circle, Svalbard experiences both midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter. At 74° north, the midnight sun lasts 99 days and polar night 84 days, while the respective figures at 81° are 141 and 128 days. { Torkilsen (1984): 96–97 } In Longyearbyen, midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August, and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February. In winter, the combination of full moon and reflective snow can give additional light. Glaciation covers [ 36502 km2 on ] or 60% of Svalbard; 30% is barren rock while 10% is vegetated. { Umbreit (2005): 3 } The largest glacier is Austfonna ( [ 8412 km2 s on ] ) on Nordaustlandet, followed by Olav V Land and Vestfonna. During summer, it is possible to ski from Sørkapp in the south to the north of Spitsbergen, with only a short distance not being covered by snow or glacier. Kvitøya is 99.3% covered by glacier. { Torkildsen (1984): 102–104 } The landforms of Svalbard were created through repeated ice age s, where glaciers cut the former plateau into fjord s, valleys and mountains. { Umbreit (2005): 4–6 } The tallest peak is Newtontoppen ( [ 1713 m on s ] ), followed by Perriertoppen ( [ 1712 m on s ] ), Ceresfjellet ( [ 1675 m on s ] ), Chadwickryggen ( [ 1640 m on s ] ) and Galileotoppen ( [ 1637 m on s ] ).

Traditional Norse accounts exist of a land known as Svalbarð—literally &quot; cold shores &quot; —although this may have referred to Jan Mayen, or a part of eastern Greenland. { Torkildsen (1984): 25–26 } { Arlov (1996): 46 } Contemporary understanding was that both Svalbard and Greenland were connected to Continental Europe. { Arlov (1996): 26 } The archipelago may in that period have been used for fishing and hunting. { Torkildsen (1984): 26 } The Dutchman Willem Barentsz made the first indisputable discovery of Svalbard in 1596, in an attempt to find the Northern Sea Route. { Torkildsen (1984): 30 } { Arlov (1996): 39–40 } In 1604, an English ship landed at Bjørnøya and started hunting walrus; annual expeditions followed. { Torkildsen (1984): 32 } { Arlov (1996): 62 } From 1611, Spitsbergen became a base for whaling, where they targeted the bowhead whale. Because of the lawless nature of the area, English, Danish, Dutch and French companies and authorities tried to use force to keep out other countries&apos; fleets. { Torkildsen (1984): 34–36 } { Arlov (1996): 63–67 } Smeerenburg was one of the first settlements, established by the Dutch in 1619. { Torkildsen (1984): 37 } Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, a few individuals started to overwinter. Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic. { Torkildsen (1984): 39 } By the late 17th century, Russian hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as the polar bear and fox. { Torkildsen (1984): 40 } After British ships destroyed most of the Russian fleet in 1812, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and became non-existent from the 1820s. { Torkildsen (1984): 44 } Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s, but was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left. { Torkildsen (1984): 47 } Whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s. { Torkildsen (1984): 50 } { Longyearbyen in 1925 } By the 1890s, Svalbard had become a destination for Arctic tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were being used as a base for Arctic exploration. { Arlov (1996): 239 } The first mining was done along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all-year operations. { Arlov (1996): 249 } Production in Longyearbyen commenced by American interests in 1908; { Arlov (1996): 261 } and Store Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part by buying American interests. { Arlov (1996): 273 } Discussions to establish the sovereignty of the archipelago commenced in the 1910s, { Arlov (1996): 288 } but were interrupted by World War I. { Arlov (1996): 294 } On 9 February 1920, following the Paris Peace Conference, the Svalbard Treaty was signed, granting full sovereignty to Norway. However, all signatory countries were granted non-discriminatory rights to fishing, hunting and mineral resources. { Arlov (1996): 305–306 } The treaty took effect on 14 August 1925, at the same time as the Svalbard Act regulated the archipelago and the first governor, Johannes Gerckens Bassøe, took office. { Arlov (1996): 319 } The archipelago has traditionally been known as Spitsbergen, and the main island itself as West Spitsbergen. From the 1920s, Norway renamed the archipelago Svalbard, and the main island became Spitsbergen. { Umbriet (2005): XI–XII } Kvitøya, Kong Karls Land, Hopen and Bjørnøya were not regarded as part of the Spitsbergen archipelago.

The German Operation Zitronella took this garrison by force in 1943, and at the same time destroying the settlements at Longyearbyen and Barentsburg. { Arlov (1996): 402–403 } After the war, the Soviet Union proposed common Norwegian and Soviet administration and military defense of Svalbard. This was rejected in 1947 by Norway, which two years later joined NATO. The Soviet Union retained high civilian activity on Svalbard, in part to ensure that the archipelago was not used by NATO. { Arlov (1996): 407–408 } After the war, Norway had re-established operations at Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, { Torkildsen (1984): 206 } while the Soviet Union had established mining in Barentsburg, Pyramiden and Grumant. { Torkildsen (1984): 202 } The mine at Ny-Ålesund had several fatal accidents, killing 71 people while it was in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963.

Barentsburg is the only remaining Russian settlement, after Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998 (although as of April 2010, a small Russian community of 15 to 20 people exists at Pyramiden, involved mainly in dismantling and transporting usable equipment to Barentsburg). A company town, all facilities are owned by Arktikugol, which operates a coal mine, although operation has been halted since 2006. In addition to the mining facilities, Arktikugol has opened a hotel and souvenir shop, catering to tourists taking day trips or hikes from Longyearbyen. The village features facilities such as a school, library, sports center, community center, swimming pool, farm and greenhouse.

The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, a part of the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway&apos;s right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.

Kramer in } { The New York Times September 15, 2010, accessed September 16, 2010 } [ Economy ] [ Economy of Svalbard ] { glacier } The three main industries on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism and research. In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK  2,008 million, tourism NOK  317 million and research NOK  142 million. In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK  494,700—23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there are only a few privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution. Since the resettlement of Svalbard in the early 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks. In 2011 a 20 year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.

Cruise ships generate a significant portion of the traffic, including both stops by offshore vessels and expeditionary cruises starting and ending in Svalbard. Traffic is strongly concentrated between March and August; overnights have quintupled from 1991 to 2008, when there were 93,000 guest-nights. Research on Svalbard centers around Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the most accessible areas in the high Arctic. Norway grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg.

Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a seedbank to store seeds from as many of the world&apos;s crop varieties and their botanical wild relatives as possible. A cooperation between the government of Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust, the vault is cut into rock near Longyearbyen, keeping it at a natural [ −6 C 0 ] and refrigerating the seeds to [ −18 C 0 ].

Photo taken at 03:00 in the morning, mid-April. Within Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Ny-Ålesund, there are road systems, but they do not connect with each other. Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter—both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg ( [ 45 km s on ] ) and Pyramiden ( [ 100 km s on ] ) is possible by snowmobile by winter, or by ship all year round. All settlements have ports and Longyearbyen has a bus system. { Umbriet (1997): 63–67 } Svalbard Airport, Longyear, located [ 3 km 0 ] from Longyearbyen, is the only airport offering air transport off the archipelago. Scandinavian Airlines has daily scheduled services to Tromsø and Oslo; there are also irregular charter services to Russia. [ Direkteruter Avinor http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/svalbard/direkteruter Norwegian 9 September 2009 ] Lufttransport provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to Ny-Ålesund Airport and Svea Airport for Kings Bay and Store Norske; these flights are in general not available to the public.

[ http://retro.met.no/observasjoner/svalbard/normaler_for_kommune_2111.html?kommuner Temperaturnormaler for Spitsbergen i perioden 1961 - 1990 Norwegian Meteorological Institute 24 March 2010 Norwegian ] The North Atlantic Current moderates Svalbard&apos;s temperatures, particularly during winter, giving it up to [ 20 C-change 0 ] higher winter temperature than similar latitudes in Russia and Canada. This keeps the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year. The interior fjord areas and valleys, sheltered by the mountains, have larger temperature differences than the coast, giving about [ 2 C-change 0 ] warmer summer temperatures and [ 3 C-change 0 ] colder winter temperatures. On the south of Spitsbergen, the temperature is slightly higher than further north and west. During winter, the temperature difference between south and north is typically [ 5 C-change 0 ], while about [ 3 C-change 0 ] in summer. Bear Island has average temperatures even higher than the rest of the archipelago. { Torkilsen (1984): 98–99 } Svalbard is the meeting place for cold polar air from the north and mild, wet sea air from the south, creating low pressure and changing weather and fast winds, particularly in winter; in January, a strong breeze is registered 17% of the time at Isfjord Radio, but only 1% of the time in July. In summer, particularly away from land, fog is common, with visibility under [ 1 km ] registered 20% of the time in July and 1% of the time in January, at Hopen and Bjørnøya. Precipitation is frequent, but falls in small quantities, typically less than [ 400 mm ] in western Spitsbergen. More rain falls in the uninhabited east side, where there can be more than [ 1000 mm ]. [ Nature ] [ Environment of Svalbard ] { Long-tailed Skua } In addition to humans, four primarily terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the archipelago: the Arctic Fox, the Svalbard reindeer, polar bear s and accidentally introduced Southern Vole —which is only found in Grumant. [ http://www.dirnat.no/attachment.ap?id%3D1043 Protected Areas in Svalbard Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management 24 March 2010 Norwegian ] Attempts to introduce the Arctic Hare and the muskox have both failed. { Umbreit (2005): 33 } There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whale s, dolphin s, seals and walrus es. Polar bears are the iconic symbol of Svalbard, and one of the main tourist attractions. { Torkildsen (1984): 174 } While protected, anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self defense, as a last resort, should they attack. { Umbriet (2005): 132 } Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground. The Svalbard reindeer (R. tarandus platyrhynchus) is a distinct sub-species, and while previously almost extinct, hunting is permitted for both it and the Arctic Fox. There are a limited number of domesticated animals in Russian settlements. { Torkildsen (1984): 165 } { Polar bear } About thirty species of bird are found on Svalbard, most of which are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabird s, with about 20 million individuals during late summer. The most common are Little Auk, Northern Fulmar, Thick-billed Murre and Black-legged Kittiwake. Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List. Particularly Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic Tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed: the Snow Bunting and the Wheatear. Rock Ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter. { Torkilsen (1984): 162 } Remains of Predator X from the Jurassic period have been found; it is the largest dinosaur-era marine reptile ever found—a pliosaur estimated to have been almost [ 15 m on ] long.

Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the archipelago. { Torkilsen (1984): 144 } Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. { Umbreit (2005): 29–30 } While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. { Torkilsen (1984): 101 } The growing season is very short, and may only last a few weeks. { Umbreit (2005): 32 } There are seven national parks in Svalbard: Forlandet, Indre Wijdefjorden, Nordenskiöld Land, Nordre Isfjorden Land, Nordvest-Spitsbergen, Sassen-Bünsow Land and Sør-Spitsbergen. [ http://www.dirnat.no/nasjonalparker/ Norges nasjonalparker Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management 24 March 2010 Norwegian ] The archipelago has fifteen bird sanctuaries, one geotopic protected area and six nature reserves—with Nordaust-Svalbard and Søraust-Svalbard both being larger than any of the national parks. Most of the nature reserves and three of the national parks were protected in 1973, with nearly all the remaining protected occurring in the 2000s.
