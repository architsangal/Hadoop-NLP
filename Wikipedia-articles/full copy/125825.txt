[ Industrial history ] Situated at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh rivers, Phillipsburg once benefited from being a major transportation hub. Long gone is the era of canal shipping and many of the important freight railways that served the area have gone bankrupt or bypass the city on long distance routes. Phillipsburg was served by five major railroads: 1. Central Railroad Company Of New Jersey (CNJ) 2. Lehigh &amp; Hudson River (L &amp; HR) 3. Lehigh Valley (LV) 4. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western (DL &amp; W) and 5. Pennsylvania (PRR). Phillipsburg served as the western terminus of the Morris Canal for approximately 100 years from the 1820s to 1920s, which connected the city by water to the industrial and consumer centers of the New York City area, with connections westward via the Lehigh Canal across the Delaware. [ Economic revival ] Most of the manufacturing jobs have left Warren County&apos;s largest city. In 1994, the New Jersey Legislature designated Phillipsburg as an Urban Enterprise Zone community. This zoning offers tax incentives and other benefits to Phillipsburg-based businesses, as well as a 3½% sales tax rate, reduced from the 7% rate charged statewide. { Geographic &amp; Urban Redevelopment Tax Credit Programs: Urban Enterprise Zone Employee Tax Credit, State of } { New Jersey, backed up by the } { Internet Archive as of May 25, 2009.

[ April 2010 ] Phillipsburg also has been selected as a site for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Heritage Center (jointly with Netcong ), a museum designed to help preserve and showcase the state&apos;s transportation history. { Phillipsburg&apos;s Historic CNJ Station, accessed August 30, 2006. } [ Railway ] The Belvidere and Delaware River Railway still serves the city&apos;s remaining industry and connects to the national rail network via a connection with Norfolk Southern in the city.
