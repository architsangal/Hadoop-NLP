[ History ] [ December 2008 ] [ History of the Galveston Bay Area ] The city was originally founded as Evergreen in 1898 along the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, when John Henry Kipp and James H. Bradford subdivided their lots to establish a township. The area was also called Shell Siding after the oyster shell midden s lining the bay, in some places [ 20 to 30 ft ] deep. Indian burial grounds were later found in these shell middens. Kipp petitioned for a post office, but was denied as there was already an Evergreen, Texas (now incorporated into Cleveland, Texas ). Residents were polled and Kemah, the Karankawa word for &quot; wind in face &quot;, &quot; face wind &quot;, or &quot; facing the wind &quot;, was chosen. Kemah was granted a post office in 1907. Commercial fishing has long been a significant area industry and a part of the community&apos;s identity, as demonstrated by the annual &quot; Blessing of the Fleet &quot; event that continues today. Agriculture was also important to the community&apos;s early prosperity. From the 1920s to the 1950s Kemah became a significant tourist destination resulting from investment by the Maceo crime syndicate which ran Galveston during this time. The syndicate created a lavish casino district along the boardwalk featuring venues such as the Chili Bowl and the Kemah Den. [ Grande Dame of the Gulf Texas Monthly December 1983 168 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DLywEAAAAMBAJ ] During the 1950s the state Attorney General and the Texas Rangers finally shut down the Galveston vice empire. Kemah&apos;s casinos were closed and its tourism base declined drastically. During the 1950s a major commercial shrimp fishing fleet was established in the town as the Clear Creek Channel was opened. Though Hurricane Carla severely damaged the city in 1961, the city rebuilt and the fishing business revived. During the 1970s, in part as a result of the establishment of the Johnson Space Center on Clear Lake, tourism began to re-emerge as pleasure boats began to fill the lake. [ History of Kemah Kemah Historical Society 2 April 2010 ] Kemah has significantly revived as a tourist and recreation destination, especially since the new Kemah Boardwalk, owned by Landry&apos;s Restaurants, was developed in the late 1990s.
