[ April 2010 ] [ Audio sample Eve of Destruction by Barry McGuire.ogg ] &quot; Eve of Destruction &quot; is a protest song written by P. F. Sloan in 1965. Several artists have recorded it, but the best-known recording was by Barry McGuire. This recording was made between July 12 and July 15, 1965 and released by Dunhill Records. The accompanying musicians were top-tier LA session player s : P.F. Sloan on guitar, Hal Blaine (of Phil Spector &apos;s &quot; Wrecking Crew &quot; ) on drums, and Larry Knechtel on bass. The vocal track was thrown on as a rough mix and was not intended to be the final version, but a copy of the recording &quot; leaked &quot; out to a DJ, who began playing it. { Monday, 10 October 2005 4.24 p.m. NZ time Eve of… | barrymcguire&apos;s Xanga Site - Weblog } The song was an instant hit and as a result the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded. [ Background ] The song had initially been presented to The Byrds as a Dylanesque potential single, but they rejected it. The Turtles, another LA group who often recorded The Byrds&apos; discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead. Their version was issued as an album track shortly before McGuire&apos;s version was cut. It eventually hit number 100 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; Hot 100 in 1970. The song was also recorded by Jan and Dean on their album Folk &apos;n Roll in 1965, and by The Grass Roots on their first album Where Were You When I Needed You in 1966. McGuire also mentioned that &quot; Eve of Destruction &quot; was recorded in one take on a Thursday morning (from words scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper), and he got a call from the record company at 7:00 the following Monday morning, telling him to turn on the radio—his song was playing. [ August 2011 ] The song is a grave warning of imminent apocalypse, and considered by some to be the epitome of a protest song. It expressed the frustrations and fears of young people in the age of the Cold War, Vietnam, the nuclear arms race, and the civil rights movement. It also mentions &quot; You&apos;re old enough to kill, but not for votin&apos;. &quot;, referencing the movement to lower the voting age to eighteen. Barry McGuire became a born-again Christian, and as a result renounced the song for many years, refusing to perform it. Though he is now known primarily as a singer of contemporary Christian songs, McGuire has resumed singing &quot; Eve of Destruction &quot; in recent years, often updating the lyrics to refer to such events as the Columbine High School massacre. Barry McGuire updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line &quot; Selma, Alabama &quot;, replaced by the words &quot; Columbine, Colorado &quot;, referring to the student massacre of 1999. On March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show Spicks and Specks, performing an updated version of &quot; Eve of Destruction &quot;, with new lines such as &quot; You&apos;re old enough to kill/ you just started voting &quot; and &quot;...can live for ten years in space &quot;. The reference to &quot; Red China &quot; was also removed, and in its place were the more generic &quot; Now think of all the hate, still living inside us/ its never too late, to let love guide us &quot;. [ Reception ] In the first week of its release, the single was at number 103 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; charts. By August 12, Dunhill released the LP, Nick Featuring Eve of Destruction. The LP reached its peak of number thirty-seven on the Billboard album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to number one on the chart, and repeated the feat on the Cashbox chart, where it had debuted at number thirty.

Post-Industrial psychedelic rock outfit Psychic TV released &quot; Eve Ov Destruction &quot; as a limited edition single in the late 1980s. In 2003, the reggae singer Luciano recorded a version of the song. The band Bishop Allen also released a song titled &quot; Eve of Destruction &quot; on their 2003 album, &quot; Charm School &quot; which takes its chorus from this song. The Temptations &apos; song &quot; Ball of Confusion (That&apos;s What the World Is Today) &quot; mentions the song title. The song was briefly featured on Stephen King &apos;s 1994 miniseries The Stand. With a burning Des Moines, Iowa as a backdrop, Larry Underwood sits atop the hood of a car, belting out the song to amuse himself until interrupted by another survivor of the superflu. It also appeared in The Simpsons episode GABF16, &quot; The Girl Who Slept Too Little &quot;, and was also featured in Michael Winterbottom &apos;s 1997 film Welcome to Sarajevo. A Joey Scarbury cover was played repeatedly in the original airing of The Greatest American Hero episode &quot; Operation Spoil Sport &quot; to encourage the hero to prevent an automated nuclear strike being triggered by a renegade U.S. general (the aliens who provided the hero&apos;s super-powers commandeered his car radio and tuned it to stations playing the song). Due to copyright issues, the song does not appear in the DVD version of the episode. A French translation is used in the closing credits of Michael Moore &apos;s film Sicko. An Italian version, &quot; Questo vecchio pazzo mondo &quot; ( &quot; This old crazy world &quot; ), was recorded by Gino Santercole in 1967; a 1984 recording by Adriano Celentano was included in his album I miei americani (a collection of US hits translated into Italian).

The song is played during the fourth season finale of The A-Team, &quot; The Sound of Thunder, &quot; when the team returns to Vietnam and flashbacks recall their tours of duty. The song is featured in the fourth level of the Vietnam War Video game Men of Valor. While the song is playing, the main character&apos;s lieutenant is dying of his wound on the battlefield. The song, like many other popular songs of the day, gave its name to a gun truck used by United States Army Transportation Corps forces during the Vietnam war. The truck is on display at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum and is believed to be the only surviving example of a Vietnam era gun truck.

The song also makes reference to Selma, Alabama where Bloody Sunday took place. (The version by Jan and Dean substitutes &quot; Watts, California &quot; in the lyrics, in apparent reference to the Watts Riots.) &quot; Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space, but when you return, it&apos;s the same old place. &quot; This refers to the June 1965 mission of Gemini 4, which lasted just over four days. According to Sloan, the lyric &quot; The pounding of the drums the pride and disgrace &quot; relates to the Kennedy assassination.

The indie rock group Bishop Allen performs a version of &quot; Eve of Destruction &quot; borrowing heavily from the original, but with an even more sharply apocalyptic theme. It includes the lyrics &quot; And if this moment is gone in a flash/ And my hand in yours becomes ash in ash &quot;, followed in the next verse by an imagining of rejection from Heaven: &quot; Then we&apos;ll have a dance, yeah a dance, on the head of a pin/ Then God will grin, and shoo us away &quot;.
