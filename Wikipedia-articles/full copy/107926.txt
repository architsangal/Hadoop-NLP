The Luiseño were the earliest known inhabitants. Their pictograph s can be found on rocks on the Santa Ana Mountains and in Temescal Valley and artifacts have been found all around Lake Elsinore and in the local canyons and hills. Overlooked by the expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza, the largest natural lake in Southern California, was first seen by the Spanish Franciscan padre Juan Santiago, exploring eastward from the Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1797. In 1810, the water level of the Laguna Grande was first described by a traveler as being little more than a swamp about a mile long. { Water-supply paper, Volumes 425-429 By Geological Survey (U.S.), History of Elsinore Lake, p.255 } Later in the early 19th century the lake grew larger, providing a spot for Mexican rancheros, American trappers, the expedition of John C. Frémont and the immigrants during the California Gold Rush to camp and water their animals as they traveled along the southern shore of the lake on what later became the Southern Immigrant Trail and the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail. On January 7, 1844, Julian Manriquez acquired the land grant to Rancho La Laguna, a tract of almost [ 20000 acre km2 ] which included the lake and an adobe being built near the lake on its south shore at its western corner that was described by Benjamin Ignatius Hayes who stayed there overnight January 27, 1850. { Benjamin Ignatius Hayes, Edited and published by Marjorie Tisdale Wolcott, &apos;&apos;Pioneer notes from the diaries of Judge Benjamin Hayes, 1849-1875&apos;&apos;, Los Angeles, Priv. print., 1929. pp. 64-65 } In 1851 Abel Stearns acquired the rancho and sold it in 1858 to Augustin Machado. Augustin Machado built a seven room adobe ranch house and an outbuilding on the southwest side of the lake. Soon after, Rancho La Laguna became a regular stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail route between Temecula [ 20 mi km ] to the south and the Temescal station [ 10 mi km ] to the north. Over the years a framed addition and a second story were added and it was used as a post office for the small settlement of Willard at the turn of the century. The buildings stood until they were razed in 1964, at what is now 32912 Macy Avenue. Today three palm trees still grow in front of the site along Macy Avenue in front of the property. { Mildred Brooke Hoover, &apos;&apos;Historic Spots in California&apos;&apos;, Third Edition, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1966. p.390 } { Historical Topograpic Map, Elsinore, Edition Date: 1901, Scale 1/125000 } As a result of the Great Flood of 1862, the level of the lake was very high and the Union Army created a post at the lake to graze and water their horses. In the great 1862-65 drought, most of the cattle in Southern California died and the lake level fell, especially during 1866 and 1867, when practically no rain fell. However, the lake was full again in 1872 when it overflowed down its outlet through Temescal Canyon. { Water-supply paper, Volumes 425-429 By Geological Survey (U.S.), History of Elsinore Lake, p.255] } While most of the old Californio families lost their Ranchos during the great drought, the La Laguna Rancho remained in the hands of the Machado family until 1873 when most of it was sold to an Englishman Charles A. Sumner. Juan Machado retained [ 500 acre km2 1 ] on the northwest corner of the lake where his adobe still stands near the lake at 15410 Grand Avenue. After 1872 the lake again evaporated to a very low level, but the great rains in the winter of 1883-84 filled it to overflowing in three weeks. Descriptions of the lake at this time say that large willow trees surrounding the former low water shore line stood [ 20 ft m ] or more below the high-water level and were of such size that they must have been thirty or more years old. This indicated that the high water of the 1860s and 1870s must have been of a very short duration. { Water-supply paper, Volumes 425-429 By Geological Survey (U.S.), History of Elsinore Lake, p.255 } On October 5, 1883, Franklin H. Heald and his partners Donald Graham and William Collier bought the remaining rancho intending to start a new town. In 1884 the California Southern Railroad built a line from Colton through the Cañon de Rio San Jacinto (now Railroad Canyon) to link with San Diego and a rail station La Laguna appeared near the corner of what is now Mission Trail Road and Diamond Drive. On April 9th, 1888, Lake Elsinore became the 73rd city to be incorporated in California, just 33 years after California became a state of the union. Originally Lake Elsinore became a city in San Diego County and later part of Riverside County upon its creation in 1893. It was named Elsinore after the Danish city in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot; Hamlet &quot;, which is now its sister city. { Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service Northrop N-3PB carrying out a test flight over Lake Elsinore, California, 1941. } The rainfall until 1893 was greater than normal, and the lake remained high and overflowed naturally on three or four occasions during that time. The lake water was purchased by the Temescal Water Company for the irrigation of land in Corona, California. Its outlet channel was deepened, permitting gravity flow down the natural channel of Temescal Canyon to Corona for a year or more after the water level sank below the natural elevation of its outlet. As the lake surface continued to recede, a pumping plant was installed and pumping was continued a couple of seasons, but the concentration of salts in the lake, due to the evaporation and lack of rainfall, soon made the water unfit for irrigation and the project was abandoned by the company. Crescent Bath House, or &quot; The Chimes &quot;, 2006 From the beginning, the mineral springs near the lake attracted visitors seeking therapeutic treatments. In 1887, the Crescent Bath House now known as &quot; The Chimes &quot; was built, it still stands in historic downtown and is a registered national historic site. By 1888, the economy was supported by coal and clay mining at what became the town of Terra Cotta, gold mining in the Pinacate Mining District, ranching and the agriculture of fruit and nuts. After 1893 the lakes water level sank almost continuously for nearly ten years, with a slight rise every winter. Heavier precipitation, beginning in 1903, gradually filled the lake to about half the depth above its minimum level since 1883. Then in January, 1916, a flood rapidly raised the level to overflowing. Lake Elsinore was a popular destination in the first half of the 1900s for celebrities to escape the urban Hollywood scene. Many of their homes still stand on the hills surrounding the lake, including Aimee&apos;s Castle, a unique Moorish styled house built by Aimee Semple McPherson. Also actor Bela Lugosi, known for his lead role in Universal Pictures &apos; film, Dracula, built a home that still exists in the city&apos;s Country Club Heights district. The lake also hosted teams for Olympic training and high speed boat racing in the 1920s. The lake went dry in the mid 1930s but refilled by 1938. During World War II the lake was used to test seaplanes and a Douglas Aircraft plant making wing assemblies for B-17 bombers was located in the city. { Tom Hudson, Lake Elsinore Valley, its story 1776-1977, 2nd Ed., Published by author, 1988. ISBN 0-931700-01-9 } The lake ran dry during most of the 1950s and was refilled in the early 1960s. Despite its relatively small African-American population, it has the distinction of electing the first black mayor in the state of California. Tom Yarborough was elected in 1966, three years before Douglas Dollarhide became the mayor of Compton. More than a week of heavy rains in 1980 flooded the lake, destroying surrounding homes and businesses. Since then there has been a multi-million dollar project put into place to maintain the water supply at a consistent level allowing for homes to be built close to the lake. Overflow water in the Lake spills out via Aberhill Creek, a tributary of Temescal Creek. In 2007 there was an aeration system added to help with the lake&apos;s ecosystem. Rapid population growth in the mid 2000&apos;s altered the appearance and image of Lake Elsinore from a small lakeside town of 3,800 people in 1976 to a bedroom community of upper middle-class professionals. The city was ranked as the 12th fastest growing city in California between 2000 and 2008 [ Pacific Standard Magazine http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/how-foreclosures-feasted-on-some-cities-not-others-38928/ 27 April 2012 ]. There are now over 51,821 residents as of the 2010 census and formerly open hillsides have been converted into housing tracts. [ State &amp; County QuickFacts http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0639486.html 2010 U.S. Census United States Census Bureau 15 April 2012 ] [ Geography ] { Pacific Clay Products Company mine in background. } { According } to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 41.7  square miles (108.0  km²) of which 36.2  square miles (93.8  km²) of it is land and 5.5  square miles (14.2  km²), or 13.14%, is water. Lake Elsinore, originally Laguna Grande, is the largest natural freshwater lake in Southern California and is situated at the lowest point within the [ 750 sqmi km2 on ] San Jacinto Watershed at the terminus of the San Jacinto River, where its headwaters are found on the western slopes of San Jacinto Peak with its North Fork, and Lake Hemet with its South Fork. Lake levels are healthy at 1,244 feet (above sea level) with a volume of [ 30000 acre.ft m3 on ] { http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/board_info/agendas/2002/july/0718-12.doc STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD } that often fluctuate, although much has been done recently to prevent the lake from drying up, flooding, or becoming stagnant. At [ 1255 ft m ], the lake would spill into the outflow channel on its northeastern shore, known properly as Temescal Wash, flowing northwest along I-15, which feeds Temescal Creek, which dumps into the Santa Ana River just northwest of the City of Corona. It then flows to Orange County, out to the Pacific Ocean just south of Huntington State Beach. Lake Elsinore is bordered by the Elsinore Mountains to the west, which are a part of the larger Santa Ana Mountain Range, and receive a few inches of snowfall a few days each year. Included in the Santa Ana Mountains is the Cleveland National Forest and El Cariso. Lake Elsinore is north-west of Murrieta and the northern portion is part of the Temescal Canyon. [ Districts ] Lake Elsinore is a city which encompasses a large geographical area. To better distinguish the wide range of neighborhoods, the city is organized into 11 districts. Each district beholds its own unique geography, culture, age, and history which together make Lake Elsinore a very diverse and culturally rich city. They are the Alberhill, Ballpark, Business, Countryclub Heights, East Lake, Historic, Lake Edge, Lake Elsinore Hills, Lake View, North Peak, and Riverview Districts. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Revised 2011-12-13 } Wildflowers &amp; California Poppies in the Alberhill District [ Alberhill ] The Alberhill District is characterized by rolling terrain, vacant land, and the newly constructed Alberhill Ranch neighborhood. Much of the topography in the central areas, east and west of Lake Street, has been substantially altered as a result of the Alberhill District’s long history of extractive/mining activities. Mining operations in the Alberhill District began roughly the same time that the region’s first railroad, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, was completed in the 1880s. A segment of the railroad originally passed through the central portion of the Alberhill District. These events helped shape the growth of the District. Mining operations have continued to exist since the late 19th century and occupy a significant portion of the Alberhill District. Through the years, Pacific Clay Products Company has purchased the local mines and has become the sole operating clay mine in the region. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ Ballpark ] The Ballpark District takes its name from the Lake Elsinore Diamond Stadium, a first class minor league baseball stadium constructed in 1994. It is home to the Lake Elsinore Storm professional baseball team, an affiliate of the San Diego Padres. The area was once the site of the first train depot in Lake Elsinore, however no train tracks or structures from that era remain. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ Business ] The developed area within the Business District is relatively new and has the strongest concentration of industrial and commercial uses within the City. In addition it is composed of several big-box retailers, the Lake Elsinore Outlets, the lake&apos;s outlet channel, Temescal Creek, and marshlands. It is bordered by Country Club Heights to the west and Interstate 15 to the east, with a small portion extending to the east side of I-15. Sections of the Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Santa Fe Railroads that passed through the Business District during the 1800’s have been removed. In addition, a historic ranching and homesteading site with previous ranching and homesteading activities is located nearby the route where the railroad once existed. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } Aimee&apos;s Castle [ Country Club Heights ] The Country Club Heights District is distinctly marked by its steep hillsides, views of the lake and the City, and is a key part of Lake Elsinore’s history. The issues mentioned above have presented development constraints for Country Club Heights since its historic beginnings dating back to 1912. The area was the target of an elaborate land scheme promoted in Los Angeles. The Mutual Benefit and Loan Society of Los Angeles acquired two pieces of dry, “hill-land” within a few miles north of “town-land” that the Press claimed was not worth ten cents an acre. The Mutual Benefit and Loan Society offered to give a 25x100-foot lot to anyone who asked; however, the person receiving the lot had to pay ten dollars for a membership in the society, and one dollar per month dues for five years. In 1923, the Clevelin Realty Corporation, headed by Henry Schultz, began selling additional lots in Country Club Heights and launched an unprecedented for its size real estate sales promotion in the area. Later, in 1925, W.R. Covington and Associates of Santa Monica purchased 650 feet of lake frontage and three blocks of slightly improved land across Poe Street from Warm Springs Park. A clubhouse, swimming pool, and other facilities projected to cost $200,000 were built on this property. No records have been found to provide the date when a fire destroyed the clubhouse, but remnants of the burned structure and surrounding trees examined in 1942 indicate that the fire must have occurred soon after the building was constructed. Noteworthy sites in the Country Club Heights District include the Bredlau Castle, built on a hilltop of Country Club Heights in 1926 by Henry Schultz, who had originated the Clevelin development. The beautiful building overlooking the lake was the site for many social gatherings. The Castle is over 9,000 square feet, including a hidden room with a sliding bookcase door that was used during Prohibition. In October of 1928, Aimee Semple McPherson, a renowned, noted evangelist, built a palatial home in Country Club Heights, which has since won fame as “Aimee’s Castle.” Aimee’s Castle served as the evangelist’s part-time home until 1939 when it passed to new ownership. Since then it has changed hands many times and is rumored to be owned by actor Johnny Depp. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ East Lake ] The East Lake District is partially developed and contains the newly constructed Summerly neighborhood. It is a generally flat area that does not contain any registered historic structures. However, portions of the East Lake District were utilized during prehistoric times by Native American Indians as flaking and grinding stations. In addition, an historic ranching and homesteading site is located just outside the East Lake District along the border with Lakeland Village to the southwest. More recently, the East Lake District has also been home to popular motocross, skydiving, glider planes, and hang gliding activities. Throughout the City’s history, Lake Elsinore has alternated between severe floods and droughts. Most of the East Lake District lies within a 100-year floodplain adjacent to and southeast of the lake. As a result, the East Lake District has been significantly impacted during wet seasons and high water levels in the lake. Major floods occurred in 1884 and in 1916. In 1969, 7 inches of rain fell in 11 days and severely flooded the lake’s shores. The East Lake District’s proximity to the lake and flood storage is a key consideration in all planned development and several projects have been implemented to prevent the lake from flooding again. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ Historic District ] The Historic District has been the focal point of the City since its incorporation in 1888. Today, several registered and non-registered historic buildings exist, including the Crescent Bath House, also known as &quot; The Chimes. &quot; The neighborhoods in this area are the oldest in the city and its commercial strip along Main Street is considered to be Downtown. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ Lake Edge District ] The Lake Edge District area has had a long and eventful history with the lake as a focal point for the Native Americans, Europeans, Mexicans, early founders of the City, and the multitude of visitors and locals that continue to come to its shores for entertainment and recreation. Many developments occurred along or within proximity of the lake’s edge during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Today, the Lake Edge District encompasses the City’s oldest standing structure, the Adobe Machado House. The preservation of this structure is a high priority for the City. Another structure of interest is the former Elsinore Naval Military Academy building located along Grand Avenue at the southwestern boundary. A newly constructed campground, marina, and boat lunch is underway and expected to open soon. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } Birds on Lake Elsinore, 2007 [ Lake Elsinore Hills ] The Lake Elsinore Hills District encompasses a large and varied terrain including broad plains, rolling hills, steep slopes, sensitive habitats, and watercourses with elevations ranging from1,300 to 2,170 feet above the sea level. Many areas of the Lake Elsinore Hills District are not readily accessible or able to be developed and have remained vacant. Two large bodies of water locatedwithin close proximity of the Lake Elsinore Hills District are the City’s lake to the southwest and Canyon Lake to the east, which is located within the City of Canyon Lake. Some of the higher elevations offer beautiful panoramic views of the City’s lake and the Santa Ana Mountains. The neighborhoods in this district include Tuscany Hills, Canyon Hills, and Rosetta Canyon. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ Lake View ] The northwestern areas of the Lake View District offer beautiful views of the lake and the neighboring mountains and are characterized by high elevations, steep slopes, and a series of canyons. The remaining areas of the Lake View District are relatively flat in the lower elevations which do not include significant topographic features. Historically, the northern portion of the Lake View District has remained mostly undevelopedwith the exception of the La Laguna Estates neighborhood above McVicker Canyon Park. Similar to the areas further north, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and abundant mining opportunities extant in the late19th century, brought both residents and visitors to the area. Historic ranching and homesteading, including Torn Ranch, were generally located to the northwest of Machado Street, which was an important roadway lined with beautiful Deodar trees. Most of the lower lying areas of the Lake View District to the north have been recently developed and primarily include single-family homes. Other neighborhoods in this area include Northshore and Lake Terrace which were both formerly orange groves. Another area in this district at the intersection of Riverside and Lakeshore Drives has long been to referred to as &quot; Four-Corners &quot; by local residents. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ North Peak ] The North Peak District is located at the foothills of the San Jacinto Mountains and reflects three basic topographical conditions. The southern areas adjacent to State Highway 74 consist of gently rolling hills and small valleys. The central areas contain an enclosed valley. The northern areas primarily contain relatively flatter topography surrounded by rolling hillsides. Several historic mining locations and historic ranching and homesteading sites lie within the North Peak District, but most of the area remains pristine. The landscape and character of the area may soon change as a result of proposed development. The future master plannedcommunities within the North Peak Specific Plan encompass a large share of the North Peak District’s acreage in the central and northern areas. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ Riverview ] The Riverview District is a combination of steep terrain and flat areas nestled between a knoll with steep slopes, a major watercourse, and the lake. Higher elevations and steep slopes are located in the northwest areas of the Riverview District which function as a physical border with most of the adjacent Historic District. The San Jacinto River (floodway), located within the Riverview District along the eastern and southern areas, is the City’s major watercourse. The river flows southwest from Canyon Lake through the Lake Elsinore Hills District, the Riverview District, and ultimately empties into the lake. { City of Lake Elsinore General Plan Adopted 2011-12-13 } [ lakeelsinorepano.jpg 1425px View of Lake Elsinore from the Santa Ana Mountains looking east. ] [ Climate ] Lake Elsinore, generally has year-round pleasant weather: { Lake Elsinore, CA: Weather Facts Retrieved 2009-05-07 } [ 115 °F on on ] [ 10 °F on ] On average, the warmest month is July.

[ Services ] [ Public Safety ] The Riverside County Sheriff&apos;s Department serves the entire Lake Elsinore Valley (including the nearby suburbs of Lakeland Village and Sedco Hills, and the newly-incorporated City of Wildomar ) from its regional station in downtown Lake Elsinore (the city once had its own police department, but it was disbanded in 1979 for budgetary reasons). The City of Lake Elsinore contracts for fire protection and emergency medical services(EMS) with the Riverside County Fire Department through a cooperative agreement with CAL FIRE ( California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ). The City of Lake Elsinore currently has 3 paramedic engines operating out of its 3 stations and a 4th station currently under construction in Rosetta Canyon. The fire department also maintains a volunteer company which covers a rescue squad out of Station 94. The volunteers also cover reserve engines when the engines are available. Fire station 10 is located downtown next to the post office which also has 2 Cal Fire engines for supplemental protection. Fire station 85 is located at McVicker Park and fire station 94 is located on the east side of the city off of Railroad Canyon Road. Rosetta Canyon station 97 will open sometime in the future.

The grand prix was canceled indefinitely soon afterwards. In 1996 several dirt bike riders, with a hint of nostalgia, decided to lobby the City of Lake Elsinore to revive the Grand Prix. Promising that the violent motorcycle gang crowd drawn to the Grand Prix in the 1970s had gone and that dirt bike motorcycle riding was more of a family event, the city allowed the event to resume on a provisional basis. In 1973 Honda named its CR250M Elsinore—the first motorcycle designed by Honda for the dirt rather than a modified street bike—after the Elsinore GP race venue.
