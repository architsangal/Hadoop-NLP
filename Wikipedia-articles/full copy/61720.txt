It is the third-largest incorporated city and the fourth most populous urban area in Japan. (Tokyo is not a single incorporated city - see Tokyo for more information on the definition and makeup of Tokyo.) Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan&apos;s major port s along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, Chiba, and Kitakyushu. It is also the center of Japan&apos;s third largest metropolitan region, known as the Chūkyō Metropolitan Area. As of 2000, Chūkyō Metropolitan Area has 8.74 million people, of which 2.27 million live in the city of Nagoya. [ Population of Japan Japanese Statistics Bureau 2000 http://www.stat.go.jp/English/data/kokusei/2000/final/hyodai.htm 2007-04-20 ] [ History ] [ Etymology ] The city&apos;s name was historically written as 那古野 or 名護屋 (both read as Nagoya). One possible etymology for the city&apos;s name is the adjective なごやか (nagoyaka), meaning &apos;peaceful&apos;. The name Chūkyō (中京) is also used (chū (middle) + kyō (capital)), since it is the main city of the central Chūbu region. Various things are named after Chūkyō, for example the Chūkyō Industrial Area, Chūkyō Metropolitan Area, Chūkyō Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse. [ Foundation ] { Atsuta Shrine dates back to c. 100 CE and houses the holy sword } { Kusanagi, one of the imperial regalia of Japan } { Nagoya Castle was constructed as the seat of the } { Owari branch of the ruling } { Tokugawa clan } [ November 2009 ] (The Japanese names in this section are written with the family name first. For example, in the name Oda Nobunaga, the family name is Oda.) Oda Nobunaga and his proteges Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari province from Kiyosu around seven kilometers to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya. [ Tokugawa period ] Nagoya Castle, a new, large castle, was constructed partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle During the construction, the entire town of around 60,000 people, including the temples and shrines, moved from Kiyosu to the new, planned town around Nagoya Castle. [ Kiyosu Castle http://www.city.kiyosu.aichi.jp/en/sightseeing01.html 2007-05-01 ] Around the same time not far away, the ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a way station called Miya (the Shrine) on the important Tōkaidō, a road that linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town thus developed around the temple to support travelers. The combination of these two castle and shrine towns forms what we now call Nagoya. [ Industrialisation ] Through the following years Nagoya became an industrial hub for the surrounding region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries in the area included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningyo. Part of the modernization efforts of the Meiji Restoration saw a restructuring of Japan&apos;s provinces into prefectures and the government changed from family rule to that by government officials. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. [ World War II and modern era ] grid patterned streets Nagoya was the target of U.S. air raids during World War II, beginning on December 13, 1944 with an attack on a Mitsubishi war industries plant. The bombing of Nagoya in World War II continued through the spring of 1945, and included large scale firebombing. Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945.

In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the Ise-wan Typhoon. [ Why Nagoya was a target in WWII ] The population of Nagoya was estimated to be 1,500,000 ranking third among Japanese cities. It was one of the 3 largest industrial areas in Japan and was the center of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of all its workers are engaged in some phase of aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193,194,198, 2010, and 1729) lie within the city itself, while others (notable 240 and 1833) lie to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that the above-mentioned units produce between 40% and 50% of the total output of Japanese combat aircraft and combat aircraft engines. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles, and processed foods during WWII. Nagoya, the heart of the enemy aircraft industry was the target for two of the Bomber Command’s attacks. Two incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, left 5.9 square miles of the city devastated. The XXI Bomber Command established a new AAF record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission – 3,162 tons of incendiaries on Nagoya. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the total area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city. { 21st Bomber Command, Tactical Mission Report NO. 44, ocr.pdf, March 20, 1945. } [ April 2012 ] [ Geography ] { Kiso Three Rivers and Nagoya from Mount Sanpo and Mount Yoro } Nagoya lies north of Ise Bay on the Nōbi Plain. The city was built on low-level plateau s to ward off water damage. The plain is one of the fertile lands of Japan, which allowed for the development of agriculture. The Kiso River flows to the west along the city border, the Shōnai River comes in from the northeast and takes a southern towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made Hori River was constructed as a canal in the 1610 and flows from north to south, and is a part of the Shōnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade to develop with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at Ōdaka into the bay. The geographic location and the position of the city in the centre of Japan allowed it to develop economically and politically over the centuries. [ Sightseeing ] Nagoya&apos;s two most famous sightseeing spots are Atsuta Shrine and Nagoya Castle. Atsuta Shrine is known as the second-most venerable shrine in Japan, after Ise Shrine. It is said to enshrine the Kusanagi sword, one of the three imperial regalia of Japan, but it is not on display to the public. It holds around 70 festivals in a year, and many people visit the shrine year-round. Also, the shrine has over 4,400 national treasure s representing its 2,000 year history. [ Golden tiger-headed carp 金の鯱 Kin no Shachihoko ] Nagoya Castle was built in 1612. Although a large part of it burned down in the fires of World War II, the castle was restored in 1959, adding some modern amenities such as elevators.

The Nagoya City Archives have a large collection of documents and books. Tsuruma Central Library is a public library and Nagoya International Center has a collection of foreign-language books. [ Culture ] Culture runs deep in Nagoya, as it was a major trading city and political seat of the Owari lords, the most important house of the Tokugawa clan. The Owari lords actively encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu, the 7th lord of Owari, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived a lavish lifestyle. Under his rule, famous actors and actresses began to come to Nagoya, creating a bustling city life. The patronage of the arts and culture was emulated and supported by the wealthy merchants of the city. The cultural life continued to flourish after the end of the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the modern Meiji era. The destruction brought on by World War II however was unprecedented in the history of the city. Many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed during the American bombing raids and subsequent fires, grave losses of Japan&apos;s cultural heritage. Nevertheless the economical and thus financial power of the region and the city in the post-war years has reconstructed and rekindled the artistic and cultural scene. [ Museums ] The Tokugawa Art Museum houses some of the finest art treasures of Japan Nagoya has a wide array of different kinds of museums, ranging from the traditional to modern art, from handicrafts to industrial high-tech, from natural to scientific museums.

The Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra gives its performances there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras from abroad. [ Cultural Path ] The civic authorities try to promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as important cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a &quot; Cultural Path &quot; was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This old residential area has some historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taisho era and are protected historical sites. [ Festivals ] { Ōsu } Apart from the main national festivals and holidays, there are festivals in Nagoya which are unique to the city and region. Major events include the Atsuta Festival at Atsuta Shrine in June, the Port Festival at Nagoya Port in July, the Nagoya Castle Summer Festival in August at Nagoya Castle and the Nagoya Festival held in October at the Hisaya Ōdori Park.

[ Dialect ] The [ Nagoya dialect 名古屋弁 Nagoya-ben ] is a dialect of the Japanese language spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on the city of Nagoya. It is also called [ Owari dialect 尾張弁 Owari-ben ] since the area was formerly part of Owari Province. The Nagoya dialect is relatively near to standard Japanese and has proximities to the Kansai dialect, albeit with its own distinct pronunciation and vocabulary. [ Handicrafts ] The industry of Japanese handicrafts in the city dates back hundreds of years and is still kept alive today. Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from the Bungo Province in Kyushu, known for their tie-dyed fabric technique. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari lords and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods of Nagoya. In the tie-dyed fabric technique, only the base fabric is dyed, leaving a parts that were tied together as white spots. This highly specialised process takes half to one year to complete a piece of cloth. Straps for geta clog s : wooden clogs called geta were the shoes of the feudal era. The lords of Owari devised their own unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be woven by local weavers. The technique has been passed from generation to generation. The making of these specially designed cotton straps for wooden clogs began when the lord of the Owari clan devised his own unique pattern and ordered it to be woven by a local weaver. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet. Shippo: the technique for enamelware called shippo was introduced to Japan from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns used look almost transparent and are often used on pottery. Candles: for Japanese candles wax is taken from a wax tree, and painted around a rope made out of grass and Japanese paper ( washi ) over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the wick tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns. Yuzen: the art of silk dyeing was introduced to Nagoya by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of the Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured. Sekku Ningyo: these are festival dolls, introduced by markets that were held all over Japan during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank amongst the top producers of festival dolls in the country. [ Cuisine ] Nagoya is known for unique local cuisine Nagoya meshi. Some famous Nagoya foods: toriwasa : Because of the quality of the meat, sashimi can also be made of Nagoya kōchin, from the flesh, livers, hearts, and gizzards. { uirō : rice dumpling made by mixing rice flour with a little sugar and then steaming the mixture in a steamer.
