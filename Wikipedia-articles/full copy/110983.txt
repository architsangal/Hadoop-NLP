They profited from a commercial pier and an inn that served the stagecoach traffic on the Green Bay Road. Along with several other investors in 1867, former Chicago mayor Walter S. Gurnee purchased and subdivided the land near the railway depot on the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad line that had been completed a decade earlier. As president of the railroad company, Gurnee made a practice of buying land near stations on the route as sure investments. While he had planned to settle in Glencoe, financial insolvency forced him to return to his hometown in New York. Upon Gurnee&apos;s failure, Alexander Hammond bought [ 520 acre km2 1 ] and formed the Glencoe Company with plans for an exclusive residential community. The charter included the building of a school and a church and the hiring of a teacher and a pastor. After some early financial problems, the settlement had grown to 536 homes by 1885. The late 19th century and early 20th century saw many elegant homes built in Glencoe. In addition to several structures by Frank Lloyd Wright, there are houses designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw, David Adler, Robert E. Seyfarth and George Washington Maher among others. Glencoe has a Village Manager form of government. It had one of the first Public Safety Departments (combined police/fire/paramedic). It adopted the first zoning code in Illinois in 1921. Its land-use plan adopted in 1940 has been adhered to with minor changes since then. Most all nonconforming uses have been eliminated through attrition and developed to allowed uses shown outlined on the 1940 zoning land-use map. It is predominately single family with no industrial uses. It has a small cohesive central business district that provides most basic services including post office, library, Village Hall, performing arts theatre, train station (to Chicago), and other shopping needs. In the last 20 years the village has experienced increasing tear-downs of smaller homes that have been replaced with larger homes, spurring debate on historic preservation, the impact of an increasingly wealthy demographic and rising property taxes. During this time major reconstruction has been completed of its street and sidewalk network. The business district has had brick sidewalks and period street lights installed. Many public buildings have been or are being remodelled and/or additions made to including the public schools, Village Hall, Library, Park District Community Center, and refrigerated outdoor ice rink. The private golf clubs (Lake Shore Country Club and Skokie Country Club) have seen major club building remodeling, additions, and reconstruction. [ In fiction ] Glencoe was the setting for the 1983 film Risky Business starring Tom Cruise. However, the picture was actually filmed in neighboring Highland Park.

The Glencoe train station is featured in scenes from Clint Eastwood &apos;s Flags of Our Fathers as well as She&apos;s Having a Baby, by John Hughes. Glencoe in the 1970s and 1980&apos;s is fondly recalled as the backdrop of the coming of age memoir &quot; Lake Effect &quot;, by author Rich Cohen, introducing his readers to his famous &quot; Jamie Drew &quot; character, based on the real-life exploits of fellow native and renaissance-man, Mark Varouxakis.
