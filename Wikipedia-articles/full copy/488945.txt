Animal ia Mollusca Bivalvia Heterodonta Veneroida Dreissenoidea Dreissenidae Dreissena D. polymorpha Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771 ] The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is a small freshwater mussel. This species was originally native to the lakes of southeast Russia [ M. S. Hoddle http://cisr.ucr.edu/quagga_zebra_mussels.html Quagga &amp; Zebra Mussels Center for Invasive Species Research, UC Riverside 2010-06-29 ] being first described in 1769 by a German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in the Ural, Volga and Dnieper rivers. They are still found nearby, as Pontic ( Black Sea ) and Caspian (Caspian Sea) species. { Lisický M. J. 1991. Mollusca Slovenska [The Slovak molluscs]. VEDA vydavateľstvo } { Slovenskej akadémie vied, Bratislava, 344 pp. } However, it has been accidentally introduced in many other areas, and has become an invasive species in many different countries worldwide. Zebra mussels superficially resemble marine mussels in the family Mytilidae, and like them, are attached to solid substrates with a byssus. However, zebra mussels are not at all closely related to the mytilids; they are much more closely related to the Veneridae, the Venus clams. Zebra mussels get their name from a striped pattern which is commonly seen on their shells, though not all shells bear this pattern. They are usually about the size of a fingernail, but can grow to a maximum length of nearly [ 2 in cm on ]. [ The National Atlas of the United States of America http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/biology/a_zm.html Zebra Mussels Nationalatlas.gov 2009-09-17 2010-06-29 ] The shape of the shell is also somewhat variable.

Ormond Lock on the Arkansas River Zebra mussel-encrusted Vector Averaging Current Meter from Lake Michigan Zebra mussels are filter feeder s. When in the water, they open their shells to admit detritus. As their shells are very sharp, they are known for cutting people&apos;s feet, resulting in the need to wear water shoe s wherever they are prevalent. Since their colonization of the Great Lakes, they have covered the undersides of docks, boats, and anchors. They have also spread into streams and rivers nationwide. In some areas they completely cover the substrate, sometimes covering other freshwater mussels. They can grow so densely that they block pipelines, clogging water intakes of municipal water supplies and hydroelectric companies. Recent research has found that zebra mussels don&apos;t attach to cupronickel alloys, which can be used to coat intake and discharge grates, navigational buoys, boats, and motors where the species tend to congregate. Zebra mussels are believed to be the source of deadly avian botulism poisoning that has killed tens of thousands of birds in the Great Lakes since the late 1990s. Because they are so efficient at filtering water, they tend to accumulate pollutants and toxins. For this reason, although they are edible, most experts recommend against consuming zebra mussels.

This cleansing also increases water visibility and filters out pollutants. Each quagga and zebra mussel filters about [ 1 USqt l ] of water a day when confined to small tanks.
