He invented the sport of basketball in 1891 and is often credited with introducing the first football helmet. He wrote the original basketball rulebook, founded the University of Kansas basketball program, and lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of both the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Men&apos;s Division I Basketball Championship (1939). Born in Canada, Naismith studied physical education in Montreal before moving to the United States, where he developed basketball in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. { Dr. Porter. Basketball: a biographical dictionary (2005) p 346 } Naismith also studied medicine in Denver, taking his MD in 1898 before moving to the University of Kansas. After a decade (1898–1907) serving there as a faculty member and part-time basketball coach during the sport&apos;s fledgling years, he became the Kansas Jayhawks &apos; athletic director. He became a U.S. citizen in 1925. { Rob Rains and Hellen Carpenter, James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball (Temple University Press, 2009) p 105; David L. Porter, Basketball: a biographical dictionary (2005) p. 347 } Naismith&apos;s contributions to basketball have earned him several posthumous honours, such as in the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Legends Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame and the FIBA Hall of Fame. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he is a member of the original Hall of Fame class, was named in Naismith&apos;s honour. Naismith was also a National Guard chaplain with the First Kansas Infantry Regiment. He taught his soldiers basketball to control their excess energy. His effort helped increasing Soldiers&apos; morale and even lowered the rate of disciplinary actions among soldiers. [ Early years ] { Almonte, } { Ontario } Naismith was born in 1861 in Ramsay Township (now part of Mississippi Mills, Ontario ). [ Laughead George Dr. James Naismith, Inventor of Basketball Kansas Heritage Group http://www.kansasheritage.org/people/naismith.html 2008-09-30 ] Struggling in school but gifted in farm labour, Naismith spent his days outside playing catch, hide-and-seek, or duck on a rock, a medieval game in which a person guards a large drake stone from opposing players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. To play duck on a rock most effectively, Naismith soon found out that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought which later proved essential for the invention of basketball. { In the late 1930s he played a role in what became the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball. } [ Dr. James Naismith Naismith Museum And Hall of Fame http://www.naismithmuseum.com/naismith_drjamesnaismith/main_drjamesnaismith.htm 2008-09-30 ] Orphaned early in his life, Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte. Then he enrolled in Almonte High School, from which he graduated in 1883. James Naismith never had a middle name and never signed his name with the &quot; A &quot; initial. The &quot; A &quot; was added by someone in the administration at the University of Kansas. Dr. Naismith&apos;s only surviving child in 1982 also stated that his father never had a middle initial &quot; A &quot;. The Basketball Hall of Fame also clarifies this as does other members of his family and personal friends of his.Noted historian Curtis J. Phillips has done extensive research on the subject. [ McGill University ] In the same year, Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal. Although described as a slight figure, standing 5 foot 10 ½ and listed at 168 pounds, [ Dodd Hellen Naismith January 6, 1959 James Naismith&apos;s Resume Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame http://hoophall.com/history/naismith-resume.html 2008-09-30 http://web.archive.org/web/20071119053704/http%3A//www.hoophall.com/history/naismith-resume.html November 19, 2007 ] he was a talented and versatile athlete, representing McGill in Canadian football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer and gymnastics. He played center on the football team, introduced the first football helmet into regular play and won multiple Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances.

From 1891 on, Naismith taught physical education and became the first McGill director of athletics, but then left Montreal to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. [ Springfield College: Invention of &quot; Basket Ball &quot; ] At Springfield YMCA, Naismith struggled with a rowdy class which was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh New England winter and thus was perpetually short-tempered. Under orders from Dr. Luther Gulick, head of Springfield YMCA Physical Education, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an &quot; athletic distraction &quot; : Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape and explicitly emphasized to &quot; make it fair for all players and not too rough. &quot; In his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of those times ( rugby, lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey and baseball ); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player&apos;s heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game duck on a rock. Naismith christened this new game &quot; Basket Ball &quot; and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.

In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: &quot; When Mr. Stubbins brot [sic ] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor&apos;s platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men &amp; tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon. &quot; [ Naismith James James Naismith Handwritten Manuscript Detailing First Basketball Game Heritage Auction Galleries http://sports.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No%3D706%26amp%3BLot_No%3D19007%26amp%3Btype%3Dprte-pr11136b%26amp%3Bic%3D 2008-09-30 ] In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also, following each &quot; goal &quot; a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.

By 1893, basketball was introduced internationally by the YMCA movement. From Springfield, Naismith went to Denver where he acquired a medical degree and in 1898 he joined the University of Kansas faculty at Lawrence, Kansas after coaching at Baker University. There is some evidence that Dr. Naismith borrowed components for the game of basketball from Lambert G. Will. [ Baruth Philip Basketball Inventor http://www.vpr.net/episode/33157/ Basketball Inventor Vermont Public Radio 27 March 2011 ] This evidence disputes the claim that Dr. Naismith was the sole inventor of the game.

Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played only two current Big 12 schools: Missouri (twice) and Kansas State (once). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program&apos;s history to have a losing record (55–60).

When Dean Smith retired as head Basketball coach at North Carolina he was the winningest coach in college basketball history, #2 was Adolph Rupp (Kentucky) and #3 was Allen. The three coaches have joined Naismith as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame. By the turn of the century, there were enough college teams in the East of the U.S. that the first intercollegiate competitions could be played out. Although his sport continuously grew, Naismith long regarded his game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical education. However, basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, USA. As the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reports, Naismith was also neither interested in self-promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports.

In 1935, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (created by Naismith&apos;s pupil Phog Allen) collected money so that the 74-year old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. There, Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams; United States, for the Gold Medal, Canada, for the Silver Medal, and Mexico, for their Bronze medal win.

When Naismith returned he commented that seeing the game played by many nations was the greatest compensation he could have received for his invention. In 1937, Naismith played a role in the formation of the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball, which later became the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).

Naismith died in 1939 after he suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage and was buried in Lawrence, Kansas. Posthumously, his masterwork &quot; Basketball  — its Origins and Development &quot; was published in 1941. In Lawrence, Kansas, James Naismith has a road named in his honour, Naismith Drive, which runs in front of Allen Fieldhouse (the official address of Allen Fieldhouse is 1651 Naismith Drive), the university&apos;s basketball facility. It is a separated, four-lane road that runs north and south from University Drive south to its end at 24th street, just south of the KU campus.
