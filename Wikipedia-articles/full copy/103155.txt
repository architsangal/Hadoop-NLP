Migrations were catalyzed by profound changes within the Roman Empire and on its &quot; barbarian frontier &quot;. The migrants who came first were Germanic tribes such as the Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Suebi, Frisii and Franks; they were later pushed westwards by the Huns, Avars, Slavs, Bulgars and Alans. { Bury, J. B., The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians, Norton Library, 1967. } Later migrations (such as the Arab conquest and Viking, Magyar, Moorish, Turkic, and Mongol invasions ) also had significant effects (especially in North Africa, the Iberian peninsula, Anatolia and Central and Eastern Europe ); however, they are outside the scope of the Migration Period. [ Chronology ] [ Ostrogoths Visigoths Burgundians Alans Lombards Angles Saxons Jutes Suebi Alamanni Gepids Vandals ] [ &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Origins of the Germanic Tribes &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; Origins of Germanic tribes ] Germanic peoples moved out of southern Scandinavia, Denmark and adjacent lands between the Elbe and Oder rivers after 1000 BC. The first wave moved westward and southward (pushing the resident Celts west to the Rhine River by about 200 BC) and moving into southern Germany up to the Roman province of Gaul by 100 BC, where they were stopped by Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar. It is this western group who was described by the Roman historian Tacitus (56 – 117 AD) and Julius Caesar (100 - 44 BC). A later wave of German tribes migrated eastward and southward from Scandinavia between 600 and 300 BC to the opposite coast of the Baltic Sea, moving up the Vistula near the Carpathians. During Tacitus&apos; era they included lesser-known tribes such as the Tencteri, Cherusci, Hermunduri and Chatti; however, a period of federation and intermarriage resulted in the familiar groups known as the Alamanni, Franks, Saxons, Frisians and Thuringians. { Bury, Invasion, Ch. 1. } [ &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; The first phase &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; First phase ] The Migration Period may be divided into two phases.The first phase, occurring between 300 and 500 AD, is partly documented by Greek and Latin historians but difficult to verify archaeologically. It puts Germanic peoples in control of most areas of the then- Western Roman Empire. [ April 2011 ] The Visigoths entered Roman territory (after a clash with the Huns ) in 376. The following year in Marcianopolis, the escort to Fritigern (their leader) was killed while meeting with Lupicinus. { cf. } [ Wolfram 2001 127ff. ] The Visigoths rebelled, eventually invading Italy and sacking Rome in 410, before settling in Iberia and founding a kingdom which lasted for 200 years. They were followed into Roman territory by the Ostrogoths, led by Theodoric the Great, who settled in Italy. In Gaul the Franks (a fusion of western Germanic tribes whose leaders had been aligned with Rome since the third century AD) entered Roman lands gradually and peacefully during the fifth century, and were accepted as rulers by the Roman-Gaulish population. Fending off challenges from the Allemanni, Burgundians and Visigoths, the Frankish kingdom became the nucleus of the future France and Germany.The initial Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain occurred during the fifth century, when Roman Britain no longer existed. { cf. } [ Dumville 1990 ] [ &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; The second phase &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; Second phase ] The second phase took place between 500 and 700 and saw Slavic tribes settling in central and eastern Europe (particularly in eastern Magna Germania ), gradually making it predominantly Slavic. [ September 2010 ] In 567, the Avars and the Lombards destroyed much of the Gepid Kingdom. The Lombards, a Germanic people, settled in northern Italy in the region now known as Lombardy. The Bulgars (people of Turkic or Iranic origin who were present in far eastern Europe since the second century) conquered the eastern Balkan territory of the Byzantine Empire in the seventh century. During the early Byzantine–Arab Wars the Arab armies attempted to invade southeast Europe via Asia Minor during the late seventh and early eighth centuries, but were defeated at the siege of Constantinople by the joint forces of Byzantium and the Bulgars. During the Khazar–Arab Wars, the Khazars stopped the Arab expansion into Europe across the Caucasus. At the same time, the Moors (consisting of Arab s and Berbers ) invaded Europe via Gibraltar ( conquering Hispania —the Iberian Peninsula —from the Visigothic Kingdom in 711), before being halted by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732. These battles largely fixed the frontier between Christendom and Islam for the next millennium. The following centuries saw the Muslims successful in conquering Sicily and parts of southern Italy from the Christians. [ &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Causes &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; Climatic factors ] A number of contemporary historical references worldwide refer to an extended period of extreme weather during 535–536. Evidence of this cold period is also found in dendrochronology and ice cores. The causes and consequences of this cold period are debated. [ &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Modern discourse &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; Discussions ] [ Barbarian identity ] The analysis of barbarian identity and how it was created and expressed during the Migration Age has elicited discussion among scholars. Herwig Wolfram (an historian of the Goths), { Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr. History of the Goths (1979) 1988:5 } in discussing the equation of migratio gentium with Völkerwanderung, observes that Michael Schmidt introduced the equation in his 1778 history of the Germans. Wolfram observed that the significance of gens as a biological community was shifting even during the early Middle Ages; &quot; to complicate matters, we have no way of devising a terminology that is not derived from the concept of nationhood created during the French Revolution &quot;. The &quot; primordialistic &quot; { Anthony D. Smith, The Ethnic Origins of Nations (Oxford, 1966) pp. 6ff, coined the term to separate these thinkers from those who view ethnicity as a situational construct, the product of history, rather than a cause, influenced by a variety of political, economic, and cultural factors. } paradigm prevailed during the 19th century. Scholars such as German linguist Johann Gottfried Herder viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities, using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups. [ Noble 2006 29 ] He believed that the Volk were an organic whole, with a core identity and spirit evident in art, literature and language. These were seen as intrinsic characteristics unaffected by external influences, even conquest. [ Kulikowski 2007 46 ] Language, in particular, was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity. They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry. { This was influenced by the &apos;family tree&apos; model (Stammbaun) of linguistics, in that relationships between related languages being the result derivation from a } { common ancestor. This model still is very influential in linguistics } The Romantic ideal that there had once been a single German, Celtic or Slavic people who originated from a common homeland and spoke a common tongue helped provide a conceptual framework for political movement s of the 18th and 19th centuries such as German nationalism and Pan-Slavism. Beginning in the 1960s a reinterpretation of archaeological and historic evidence prompted scholars (such as Goffart and Todd) to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity, maintaining that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the Germani; [ Halsall 2008 17 ] [ Todd 8–10 ] { There is no indication that the Germani possessed a feeling that they were a &quot; separate people, nation, or group of tribes &quot; } [ Noble 29 ] a similar theory has been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups. { Eg see The Celtic World, Miranda Green (1996), Page 3 and The Making of the Slavs. Floring Curta (2001) } This theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a prima facie interpretation of Graeco-Roman sources, which grouped together many tribes under such labels as Germani, Keltoi or Sclavenoi (encouraging their perception as distinct peoples. Modernists argue that the uniqueness perceived by specific groups was based on common political and economic interest s, rather than biological or racial distinctions. The role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity was ephemeral, since large-scale language shifts have been common in history. { Archaeology and LanguageL:Correlating Archaeological and Linguistic Hypotheses. &quot; The Eurasian Spread Zone and the Indo-European Dispersal. &quot; } { Johanna Nichols. Pg 224 } Modernists propose the idea of &quot; imagined communities &quot;; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs, rather than changeless lines of blood kinship. [ Kulikowski 2007 48 ] The process of forming tribal units was called &quot; ethnogenesis &quot;, a term coined by Soviet scholar Julian Bromley. [ Halsall 2008 15 ] The Austrian school (led by Reinhard Wenskus) popularized this idea, which influenced medievalists such as Herwig Wolfram, Walter Pohl and Patrick Geary. [ Halsall 2008 17 ] It argues that the stimulus for forming tribal polities was perpetuated by a small nucleus of people, known as the Traditionskern ( &quot; kernel of tradition &quot; ), who were a military or aristocratic elite. This core group formed a standard for larger units, gathering adherents by employing amalgamative metaphors such as kinship and aboriginal commonality and claiming that they perpetuated an ancient, divinely-sanctioned lineage. [ Geary 2003 77 ] A capable soldier would be able to assume the group identity without being born into the &quot; tribe &quot;. “A victorious campaign confirmed [the leaders&apos;] right to rule and drew [to] them an ever-growing people who accepted and shared in their identity”. In time, these heterogeneous armies grew into a new people possessing &quot; a strong belief in a common biological origin &quot;. [ Curta 2001 16 ] Halsall argues that no objectively-definable criterion can be consistently used to distinguish ethnic group s from one another: language, social customs, geographic habitation, religion or a common origin. &quot; The only common factor in defining ethnicity is belief: in the reality of your group and the difference to others &quot;. [ Halsall 2008 37 ] Walter Pohl highlights the dynamic nature of group identity, proposing that during the Migration Period people could live in circumstances of &quot; ethnic ambiguity &quot;. Given that ethnicity was important for the upper classes, they could adopt multiple ethnicities to secure the allegiance of their partners and followers: a phenomenon referred to as &quot; situational ethnicity &quot;. To advance socially, one needed to &quot; grow into a dominating group with high prestige, to copy its lifestyle &quot;. [ Pohl 1998 17 ] The process of assimilation could produce &quot; a wide variety of transitional stages &quot;. [ Pohl 1998 16, 17 ] Followers could also disband from larger units. Factions arose, challenging the right to lead the people and uphold their traditions. Conversely defeat by an external power could mean the end of a ruler and his people, who were absorbed into the victorious confederacy. [ Geary 2003 78 ] “Seen in this light, ‘ethnic’ identity among barbarians was extraordinarily fluid, as new groups emerged and old ones disappeared &quot;. Peter Heather suggests that constructionism and modernism represent two extremes of the spectrum of possibilities. The process of assimilation and appropriation of new group identity varied from group to group. He alludes to literary sources, which describe two contrasting models of interaction: the &apos;&apos;Sclavenes&apos;&apos; were prepared (after a given period) to accept prisoners as full and free members of their tribal groups; on the other hand, the Huns (although incorporating non-Hun groups) kept them separate and subordinate. Rather than being aristocratic kernels, he argues that the identity of tribal groups was maintained by a contingent of &quot; notables &quot; and freemen. He clarifies that while groups like the Goths were multi-ethnic, full assimilation was not the rule. [ Heather 1998 93 ] He proposes that conquered groups held a subordinate status either as otherwise-autonomous tribute-payers or as disadvantaged strata within mixed settlements. Even when a homogeneous material culture arose, disparate groups were likely to preserve their unique identity and language. [ Heather 1998 92 ] Whatever the case, this process of building large-scale group identity was particularly evident along the Roman frontier, prompted by the example of Roman provincial life and the threat of Roman attack. [ Kulikowski 2007 41 ] Ethnicity was a complex, subjective and multi-layered process, and the Migration Period saw groups rise and fall. Confederations like the Huns and the Vandals arose, to vanish abruptly within a few generations. Other, previously-obscure groups (like the Angles and the Franks) created enduring polities. Even ancient groups like the Goths (who existed from late antiquity until the Middle Ages ) underwent profound transformation. Given constant migrations, changing allegiances, and new cultural appropriations, all that remained constant was their Gothic name. [ Geary 2003 118 ] As Thomas Noble states, &quot; tribes are no longer imagined to have been &quot; marching for centuries at a time in ordered ranks with homogeneous ethnic compositions &quot; from a distant, localized homeland across Europe into a settlement on Roman soil. &quot; The common, track-filled map of the Völkerwanderung may illustrate such [a] course of events, but it misleads. Unfolded over long periods of time, the changes of position that took place were necessarily irregular...(with) periods of emphatic discontinuity. For decades and possibly centuries, the tradition bearers idled, and the tradition itself hibernated. There was ample time for forgetfulness to do its work &quot;. [ Noble 2006 97 ] [ &quot; Invasion &quot; versus &quot; migration &quot; ] Several explanations have been given for the appearance of &quot; barbarians &quot; on the frontier: weather and crops, population pressure, a &quot; primeval urge &quot; to push into the Mediterranean or the &quot; domino effect &quot; (whereby the Huns fell upon the Goths who, in turn, pushed other Germanic tribes before them). Entire barbarian tribes (or nations) flooded into Roman province s, ending classical urbanism and beginning new types of rural settlements. { Guy Halsall. The Barbarian Invasions in Fouracre. The New Cambridge Medieval History. Ch. 2 } French and Italian scholars viewed this as a catastrophic event: the destruction of a civilization and the beginning of a &quot; Dark Age &quot; which set Europe back a millennium. In contrast, German and English historians saw it as the replacement of a &quot; tired, effete and decadent Mediterranean civilization &quot; with a &quot; more virile, martial, Nordic one &quot;. Rather than &quot; invasion &quot;, German and Slavic scholars use the term &quot; migration &quot; ( [ Völkerwanderung ], [ Stěhování národů ] and [ népvándorlás ] ), aspiring to the idea of a dynamic and “wandering Indo-Germanic people”. [ Noble 236 ] Guy Halsall argues that barbarian movement was the result of the fall of the Roman Empire, not its cause. Archaeological finds confirm that Germanic and Slavic tribes were settled agriculturalists [ Noble 247 ] that were merely &quot; drawn into the politics of an empire already falling apart for quite other causes &quot;. The Crisis of the Third Century caused significant changes within the Roman Empire, in both its western and eastern portions. [ Curta 2001 120 ] { the archaeological evidence of late fourth and fifth century-century barbarian graves between the Rhine and Loire suggests that a process of small-scale cultural and demographic change took place on both side of the Roman frontier. Can we envisage Roman-Slavic relations in a similar way? } In particular, economic fragmentation removed many of the political, cultural and economic forces which held the empire together. [ Halsall 2006 42 ] The rural population in Roman provinces was distant from the emperor, and there was little to differentiate them from other peasants across the Roman frontier. In addition, Rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries to defend itself. This &quot; barbarisation &quot; of the Empire was paralleled by changes within barbaricum. The Roman Empire played a vital role in building up barbarian groups along its frontier. Propped up with imperial support and gifts, armies of allied chieftains served as buffers against hostile barbarian groups. The disintegration of Roman economic power weakened groups formerly dependent on Roman gifts for maintenance of their own power. With the arrival of the Huns, this prompted many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons. [ Halsall 2006 49 ] The barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied by region; for example, in Aquitaine the provincial administration was largely self-reliant. Halsall argues that local rulers simply &quot; handed over &quot; military rule to the Ostrogoths, acquiring the identity of the newcomers. [ Halsall 2006 51 ] In Gaul the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy; the Franks and Alemanni were pulled into the ensuing &quot; power vacuum &quot;, [ Halsall 2006 50 ] resulting in conflict. In Spain local aristocrats maintained independent rule for some time, raising their own armies against the Vandals. Meanwhile, the Roman withdrawal from lowland England resulted in conflict between Saxons and the Brythonic chieftains (whose power retreated westward). The Eastern Roman Empire attempted to maintain control of the Balkan provinces, despite a thinly-spread imperial army with local militias and an extensive re-fortification of the Danubian limes. The grandiose program of fortifications collapsed, worsening the impoverished conditions of the local populace and resulting in colonization by Slavic warriors and their families. [ Curta 2001 120–180 ] Halsall and Noble argue that the changes which took place were the result of breakdown in Roman political control, which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule. Instead of large-scale migrations, there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families (who usually numbered in the tens of thousands). This process involved active, conscious decision-making by Roman provincial populations. Collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces; this explains dramatic cultural changes seen in the absence of large numbers of barbarian migrants. [ Halsall 2006 50–52 ] Ultimately, the Germanic groups in the Western Roman Empire were accommodated without &quot; dispossessing or overturning indigenous society &quot; and maintained a structured and hierarchical (albeit degenerate) form of Roman administration. [ Noble 251 ] Paradoxically, they lost their unique identity as they were absorbed into Latinhood. This contrasted with the situation in the east, where Slavic tribes maintained a more &quot; spartan and egalitarian &quot; [ Barford 2001 46 ] existence bound to the land &quot; even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces &quot;. [ Pohl1998 20 ] Their organization was not based on Roman models, and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success. Thus, their effect was more thorough than what the Goths, Franks or Saxons ever achieved. [ Geary 2003 146 ] [ Ethnicity ] Based on the belief that particular types of artifacts (generally elements of personal adornment found in a funerary context) are thought to determine the race or ethnicity of the person buried, the &quot; Culture-History &quot; school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the Urheimat (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources. [ Pohl1998 17–23 ] As a consequence, the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples. [ Kulikowski 2007 61 ] Influenced by constructionism, process-driven archaeologists rejected the Culture-Historical doctrine; [ Kulikowski 2007 61 ] they marginalized the discussion of ethnicity altogether, and focused on the intragroup dynamics which generated such material remains. Moreover, they argued that adoption of new cultures could occur through trade in or internal political developments rather than military takeovers. Many scholars take a more moderate position. While recognizing that artifacts do not possess an inherent &quot; ethnic ascription &quot;, some artifacts may have been used as &quot; emblems in identity and otherness – of belonging and exclusions &quot;. [ Kulikowski 2007 62 ] Peter Heather suggests that although shifts in culture should not solely rely on migratory explanations, there is no reason to a priori rule them out (especially if there is evidence from literary sources). [ Heather 1998 17–18 ] Profound changes in culture (and language) could occur through the influx of a ruling elite with minimal (or no) impact on overall population composition, { Wording from Y Chromosome Evidence for Anglo-Saxon Mass Migration. Michael E. Weale et al. &amp; references therein } especially if it occurs when the indigenous population is receptive to such changes.
