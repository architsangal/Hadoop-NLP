Thomas Nuttall, Naturalist: Explorations in America, 1808-1841. Harvard Univ. Press, Cambridge, MA } Nuttall was born in the village of Long Preston, near Settle in the West Riding of Yorkshire and spent some years as an apprentice printer in England. Soon after going to the United States he met Professor Benjamin Smith Barton in Philadelphia. Barton encouraged his strong interest in natural history. [ The Genera of North American Plants ] In 1810 he travelled to the Great Lakes and in 1811 travelled on the Astor Expedition led by William Price Hunt on behalf of John Jacob Astor up the Missouri River. Nuttall was accompanied by the English botanist John Bradbury, who was collecting plants on behalf of Liverpool botanical gardens. Nuttall and Bradbury left the party at the trading post with the Arikara Indians in South Dakota, and continued further upriver with Ramsay Crooks. In August they returned to the Arikara post and joined Manuel Lisa &apos;s group on a return to St. Louis. Although Lewis and Clark had travelled this way previously, many of their specimens had been lost. Therefore many of the plants collected by Nuttall on this trip were unknown to science. The imminent war between Britain and America caused him to return to London via New Orleans. In London he spent time organising his large plant collection and discussing his experiences with other scientists. [ Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and of Canada ] In 1815 he returned to America and after spending some more time collecting published The Genera of North American Plants in 1818. From 1818 to 1820 he travelled along the Arkansas and Red Rivers, returning to Philadelphia and publishing his Journal of Travels into the Arkansas Territory during the year 1819. In 1825 he became curator of the botanical gardens at Harvard University. He published his Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and of Canada (1832 and 1834). In 1834 he resigned his post and set off west again on an expedition led by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, this time accompanied by the naturalist John Kirk Townsend. They travelled through Kansas, Wyoming and Utah, and then down the Snake River to the Columbia. Nuttall then sailed across the Pacific Ocean to the Hawaiian Islands in December. He returned in the spring of 1835 and spent the year botanizing in the Pacific Northwest, an area already covered by David Douglas. On his return trip he stopped off in San Diego, where he met Richard Henry Dana, Jr.. The character of &apos;old curious&apos; in Dana&apos;s book Two Years Before the Mast is based on Nuttall. From 1836 until 1841 Nuttall worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. During this time he made contributions to the Flora of North America being prepared by Asa Gray and John Torrey. { Dupree, A. Hunter. 1952. Thomas Nuttall’s controversy with } { Asa Gray. Rhodora 54:293-303. } The death of his uncle then required Nuttall to return to England. By terms of his uncle&apos;s will, to inherit the property, Nuttall had to remain in England for nine months of each year. His North American Sylva: Trees not described by F. A. Michaux, which was the first book to include all the trees of North America, was finished just before he left the US in December, 1841. He died in St Helens, Lancashire and is buried in Christ Church in the nearby village of Eccleston [ Named after him ] Various plants and birds were named after Nuttall, including Nuttall&apos;s Woodpecker Picoides nuttallii by his friend William Gambel, and Yellow-billed Magpie Pica nuttalli and Common Poorwill Phalaenoptilus nuttallii by John James Audubon. { Richard and Barbara Mearns - Audubon to Xantus ISBN 0-12-487423-1 } He is also commemorated in the Pacific Dogwood Cornus nuttallii, Nuttall&apos;s Larkspur, Nuttall&apos;s Oak Quercus texana, the Catclaw briar Mimosa nuttallii, Nuttall&apos;s violet Viola nuttallii, and Nuttall&apos;s Rayless Goldenrod Bigelowia nuttallii [ USDA PLANTS Profile http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol%3Dbinu2 18 May 2012 ]. [ Nutt. Nuttall, Thomas ] The Nuttall Ornithological Club of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named after him. [ Nuttall Ornithological Club http://www.nuttallclub.org/History.htm 29 March 2012 ] The World Register of Marine Species lists 44 marine genera and species named after him with the epithet nuttalli { Species with the epithet nuttalli } [ References ] [ External links ] [ Nuttall, Thomas 1900 x ] [ Nuttall, Thomas English botanist and ornithologist 5 January 1786 Long Preston, Yorkshire, England 10 September 1859 St Helens, Lancashire ] Category:1786 births Category:1859 deaths Category:Harvard University staff Category:People from Craven (district) Category:Botanists active in North America Category:Pteridologists Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:English botanists Category:English zoologists Category:British ornithologists de:Thomas Nuttall es:Thomas Nuttall eo:Thomas Nuttall fr:Thomas Nuttall hu:Thomas Nuttall pt:Thomas Nuttall ru:Наттолл, Томас fi:Thomas Nuttall sv:Thomas Nuttall zh:托马斯·纳托尔
