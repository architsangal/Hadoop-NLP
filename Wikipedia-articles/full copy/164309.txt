&apos;&apos;Snake&apos;&apos; on a TRS-80 Color Graphics Adapter Snake is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades and has maintained popularity since then, becoming something of a classic. After it became the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones in 1998, Snake found a massive audience. The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the &quot; walls &quot; that surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake&apos;s head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake&apos;s body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress, and cannot make the snake go in reverse. However, Snake has had many variations since its release, depending on the game&apos;s platform. These variations involve the modification of certain rules e.g. the lethality of contact with walls.

Snake by John Cox from Computer Concepts was different in that the snake was controlled using the left and right arrow keys relative to the direction it was heading in. The snake increases in speed as it gets longer, and there are no &quot; lives &quot;, making achieving a high score or reaching higher levels relatively difficult as one mistake means starting from the beginning.
