He was the son of William Adam (1689 –1748), the country&apos;s foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William&apos;s death. In 1754 he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the &quot; Adam Style &quot;, and his theory of &quot; movement &quot; in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the Kings Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. { Pevsner, p. 237 } He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses. { Adam silver (1953). Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London. Her Majesty&apos;s stationery Office ( } { HMSO ), p. 1. } He served as the Member of Parliament for Kinross-shire (1768–74).

Adam was born on the 3 July 1728 at Gladney House in Kirkcaldy, Fife, although the family moved to Edinburgh later that same year. As a child he was noted as having a &quot; feeble constitution &quot;. { Fleming, p. 76 } From 1734 at the age of six Adam attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh { Graham, p. 2 } where he learned Latin (from the second year lessons were conducted in Latin) { Graham, p. 4 } until he was fifteen, he was taught to read works by Virgil, Horace, Sallust and parts of Cicero and in his final year Livy { Graham, p. 4 }. In autumn 1743 he matriculated at Edinburgh University { Graham, p. 26 }, and compulsory classes for all students were: the Greek language, logic, metaphysics and Natural philosophy { Graham, p. 26 }. Students could choose three elective subjects, Adam attended classes in mathematics, taught by Colin Maclaurin, and anatomy, taught by Alexander Monro &apos;&apos;primus&apos;&apos; { Graham, p. 27 }. His studies were interrupted by the arrival of Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Highlanders, who occupied Edinburgh during the 1745 Jacobite rising. At the end of the year, Robert fell seriously ill for some months, and it seems unlikely that he returned to university, having completed only two years of study. { Fleming, pp. 79-80 } On his recovery from illness in 1746, he joined his elder brother John as apprentice to his father. He assisted William Adam on projects such as the building of Inveraray Castle and the continuing extensions of Hopetoun House. William&apos;s position as Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance also began to generate much work, as the Highlands were fortified following the failed Jacobite revolt. Robert&apos;s early ambition was to be an artist rather than architect, and the style of his early sketches in the manner of Salvator Rosa are reflected in his earliest surviving architectural drawings, which show picturesque gothic follies. { Fleming, p. 81 } William Adam died in June 1748, and left Dowhill, a part of the Blair Adam estate which included a tower house, to Robert. [ Architectural practice in Edinburgh ] { Hopetoun House, designed by William Adam and modified by the Adam Brothers } On William Adam&apos;s death, John Adam inherited both the family business and the position of Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance. He immediately took Robert into partnership, later to be joined by James Adam. The Adam Brothers&apos; first major commission was the decoration of the grand state apartments on the first floor at Hopetoun House, followed by their first &quot; new build &quot; at Dumfries House. For the Board of Ordnance, the brothers were the main contractor at Fort George, a large modern fort near Inverness designed by military engineer Colonel Skinner. Visits to this project, begun in 1750, would occupy the brothers every summer for the next ten years, and, along with works at many other barracks and forts, provided Robert with a solid foundation in practical building. { Fleming, pp. 85-86 } In the winter of 1749–1750, Adam travelled to London with his friend, the poet John Home. He took the opportunity for architectural study, visiting Wilton, designed by Inigo Jones, and the Queens Hermitage in Richmond by Roger Morris. His sketchbook of the trip also shows a continuing interest in gothic architecture. { Fleming, p. 85 } Among his friends at Edinburgh were the philosophers Adam Ferguson and David Hume and the artist Paul Sandby whom he met in the Highlands. Other Edinburgh acquaintances included Gilbert Elliot, William Wilkie, John Home and Alexander Wedderburn. { Kedleston Hall. The south front by Robert Adam, based on the } { Arch of Constantine in Rome } [ Grand Tour ] On 3 October 1754, Robert Adam in the company of his brother James (who went as far as Brussels) set off from Edinburgh for his Grand Tour, stopping for a few days in London, where they visited the Mansion House, London, St Stephen Walbrook { Graham, p. 47 }, St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, Windsor, Berkshire, in the company of Thomas Sandby who showed them his landscaping at Windsor Great Park and Virginia Water Lake { Graham, p. 48 }. They sailed from Dover arriving in Calais { Graham, p. 50 } on the 28 October 1754 { Graham, p. 52 }. He joined Charles Hope-Weir, brother of the Earl of Hopetoun in Brussels { Graham, p. 54 } and together they travelled to Rome { Graham, p. 49 }. Hope agreed to take Adam on the tour at the suggestion of his uncle, the Marquess of Annandale, who had undertaken the Grand Tour himself. They travelled on to Italy together, before falling out in Rome over travelling expenses and accommodation. Robert Adam stayed on in Rome until 1757, studying classical architecture and honing his drawing skills. His tutors included the French architect and artist Charles-Louis Clérisseau, and the Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Here, he became acquainted with the work of the pioneering classical archaeologist and art historian, theorist Johann Joachim Winckelmann. On his return journey, Adam and Clerisseau spent time intensively studying the ruins of Diocletian&apos;s Palace at Spalato in Dalmatia (now known as Split, in modern Croatia ). { C.M. Hogan, &quot; Diocletian&apos;s Palace &quot;, The Megalithic Portal, A. Burnham ed, 6 Oct 2007 } These studies were later published as Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia in 1764. [ Architectural practice in London ] He returned to Great Britain in 1758 and set up in business in London with his brother James Adam. They focused on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, and Robert designed a number of country houses in this style, { Roth, p. 397 } but Robert evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classical Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. { Roth, p. 402 } The Adam brothers&apos; success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their design. [ Public life ] { Pulteney Bridge, } { Bath } Adam was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1758 and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1761, the same year he was appointed Architect of the King’s Works (jointly with Sir William Chambers ). His younger brother James succeeded him in this post when he relinquished the role in 1768 in order to devote more time to his elected office as Member of Parliament for Kinross-shire. [ Architectural style ] Robert Adam rejected the Palladian style, as introduced to England by Inigo Jones, and advocated by Lord Burlington, as &quot; ponderous &quot; and &quot; disgustful &quot;. { Glendinning and McKechnie, p. 106 } However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from classical antiquity, during his four-year stay in Europe. Through the adoption of classical motifs, Adam developed a new style of architectural decoration. The Adam brothers&apos; principle of &quot; movement &quot; was largely Robert&apos;s conception, although the theory was first written down by James. &quot; Movement &quot; relied on dramatic contrasts and diversity of form, and drew on the picturesque aesthetic. The first volume of the Adam brother&apos;s Works (1773) cited Kedleston Hall, designed by Robert in 1761, as an outstanding example of movement in architecture. By contrasting room sizes and decorative schemes, Adam applied the concept of movement to his interiors also. His style of decoration, described by Pevsner as &quot; Classical Rococo &quot;, drew on Roman &quot; grotesque &quot; stucco decoration. { Pevsner, p. 238 } [ Influence ] Adam designed bookcase 1776 Robert Adam&apos;s work had influenced the direction of architecture across the western world. In North America, the Federal style owes much to neoclassicism as practised by Adam. In Europe, Adam notably influenced Charles Cameron, the Scotsman who designed Tsarskoye Selo and other Russian palaces for Catherine the Great. { Glendinning &amp; McKechnie, p. 108 } However, by the time of his death, Adam&apos;s neoclassicism was being superseded in Britain by a more severe, Greek phase of the classical revival, as practiced by James &quot; Athenian &quot; Stuart. The Adam brothers employed several draughtsmen who would go on to establish themselves as architects, including George Richardson, and the Italian Joseph Bonomi, who Robert originally hired in Rome. [ Written works ] During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam (in 1773-1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822). [ Death and burial ] Adam had long suffered from stomach and bowel problems, { Graham, Roderick (2009) Arbiter of Elegance: A Biography of Robert Adam, Birlinn, ISBN 978-1-84158-802-5, pp. 328-329 } probably caused by a peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. While at home - 11 Albermarle Street, London - on 1 March 1792, one of the ulcers burst, and on 3 March Adam died. The funeral was held on 10 March; he was buried in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey. The pall-bearer s were several of his clients: Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch; George Coventry, 6th Earl of Coventry; James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale; David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield; Lord Frederick Campbell and Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet. Knowing he was dying, he drafted his will on 2 March 1792. Having never married, Adam left his estate to his sisters Elizabeth Adam and Margaret Adam. His obituary appeared in the March 1792 edition of The Gentleman&apos;s Magazine { Graham, p. 330 }. This is an extract: It is somewhat remarkable that the Arts should be deprived at the same time of two of their greatest ornaments, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr Adam: and it is difficult to say which of them excelled most in his particular profession... Mr Adam produced a total change in the architecture of this country: and his fertile genius in elegant ornament was not confined to the decoration of buildings, but has been diffused to every branch of manufacture. His talents extend beyond the lie of his own profession: he displayed in his numerous drawings in landscape a luxuriance of composition, and an effect of light and shadow, which have scarcely been equalled...to the last period of his life, Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of genius and refinement of taste: for in the space of one year preceeding his death, he designed eight great public works, besides twenty five private buildings, so various in their style, and so beautiful in their composition, that they have been allowed by the best judges, sufficient of themselves, to establish his fame unrivalled as an artist. He left nearly 9,000 drawings, 8,856 of which (by both Robert and James Adam) were subsequently purchased in 1821 for £200 by the architect John Soane and are now at the Soane Museum in London. { page 11, The Adam Brothers in Rome: Drawings from the Grand Tour, A.A.
