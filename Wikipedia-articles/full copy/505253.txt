This page lists the regular polytope s in Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic spaces. The Schläfli symbol notation describes every regular polytope, and is used widely below as a compact reference name for each. The regular polytopes are grouped by dimension and subgrouped by convex, nonconvex and infinite forms. Nonconvex forms use the same vertices as the convex forms, but have intersecting facets. Infinite forms tessellate a one lower dimensional Euclidean space. Infinite forms can be extended to tessellate a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space is like normal space at a small scale, but parallel lines diverge at a distance. This allows vertex figures to have negative angle defects, like making a vertex with 7 equilateral triangle s and allowing it to lie flat. It cannot be done in a regular plane, but can be at the right scale of a hyperbolic plane. [ Overview ] This table shows a summary of regular polytope counts by dimension.

[ Tessellations ] The classical convex polytopes may be considered tessellation s, or tilings, of spherical space. Tessellations of euclidean and hyperbolic space may also be considered regular polytopes. Note that an &apos;n&apos;-dimensional polytope actually tessellates a space of one dimension less. For example, the (three dimensional) platonic solids tessellate the &apos;two&apos;-dimensional &apos;surface&apos; of the sphere. [ One-dimensional regular polytope ] There is only one polytope in 1 dimensions, whose boundaries are the two endpoints of a line segment, represented by the empty Schläfli symbol {}. [ Two-dimensional regular polytopes ] The two dimensional polytopes are called polygon s. Regular polygons are equilateral and cyclic. A p-gonal regular polygon is represented by Schläfli symbol {p}. Usually only convex polygon s are considered regular, but star polygon s, like the pentagram, can also be considered regular. They use the same vertices as the convex forms, but connect in an alternate connectivity which passes around the circle more than once to complete. Star polygons should be called nonconvex rather than concave because the intersecting edges do not generate new vertices and all the vertices exist on a circle boundary. [ Convex ] The Schläfli symbol {p} represents a regular &apos;&apos;p&apos;&apos;-gon.

They are called star polygon s and share the same vertex arrangement s of the convex regular polygons. In general, for any natural number n, there are n-pointed non-convex regular polygonal stars with Schläfli symbols {n/m} for all m such that m &lt; n/2 (strictly speaking {n/m}={n/(n−m)}) and m and n are coprime.

This has infinitely many vertices and edges. Its Schläfli symbol is {∞}, and Coxeter diagram [ node_1 infin node ].... 320px... [ Three-dimensional regular polytopes ] In three dimensions, polytopes are called polyhedra : A regular polyhedron with Schläfli symbol \{p,q\} has a regular face type \{p\}, and regular vertex figure \{q\}. A vertex figure (of a polyhedron) is a polygon, seen by connecting those vertices which are one edge away from a given vertex. For regular polyhedra, this vertex figure is always a regular (and planar) polygon. Existence of a regular polyhedron \{p,q\} is constrained by an inequality, related to the vertex figure&apos;s angle defect : 1/p + 1/q &gt; 1/2 : Polyhedron (existing in Euclidean 3-space) 1/p + 1/q = 1/2 : Euclidean plane tiling &lt; math &gt; 1/p + 1/q &lt; 1/2 &lt; /math &gt; : Hyperbolic plane tiling By enumerating the permutation s, we find 5 convex forms, 4 nonconvex forms and 3 plane tilings, all with polygons \{p\} and \{q\} limited to: \{3\}, \{4\}, \{5\}, {5/2}, and \{6\}. Beyond Euclidean space, there is an infinite set of regular hyperbolic tilings. [ Convex ] The convex regular polyhedra are called the 5 Platonic solid s. The vertex figure is given with each vertex count. All these polyhedra have an Euler characteristic (χ) of 2.

This tiling is related to a 2-faced dihedron, {p,2}, on the sphere. [ Euclidean star-tilings ] There are no regular plane tilings of star polygon s. There are many enumerations that fit in the plane (1/p + 1/q = 1/2), like {8/3,8}, {10/3,5}, {5/2,10}, {12/5,12}, etc., but none repeat periodically. [ Hyperbolic tilings ] Tessellations of hyperbolic 2-space can be called hyperbolic tiling s. There are infinitely many regular tilings in H 2. As stated above, every positive integer pair {p,q} such that 1/p  +  1/q &lt; 1/2 gives a hyperbolic tiling. In fact, for the general Schwarz triangle (p,  q,  r) the same holds true for 1/p  +  1/q  +  1/r &lt; 1. There are a number of different ways to display the hyperbolic plane, including the Poincaré disc model which maps the plane into a circle, as shown below. It should be recognized that all of the polygon faces in the tilings below are equal-sized and only appear to get smaller near the edges due to the projection applied, very similar to the effect of a camera fisheye lens.

The patterns {m/2, m} and {m, m/2} continue for odd m &lt; 7 as polyhedra : when m = 5, we obtain the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron, and when m = 3, we obtain the tetrahedron.

A vertex figure (of a polychoron) is a polyhedron, seen by the arrangement of neighboring vertices around a given vertex. For regular polychora, this vertex figure is a regular polyhedron. An edge figure &apos;&apos; is a polygon, seen by the arrangement of faces around an edge. For regular polychora, this edge figure will always be a regular polygon. The existence of a regular polychoron \{p,q,r\} is constrained by the existence of the regular polyhedra \{p,q\}, \{q,r\}.

[ Five-dimensional regular polytopes and higher ] In five dimensions, a regular polytope can be named as \{p,q,r,s\} where \{p,q,r\} is the hypercell (or teron ) type, \{p,q\} is the cell type, \{p\} is the face type, and \{s\} is the face figure, \{r,s\} is the edge figure, and \{q,r,s\} is the vertex figure. A 5-polytope has been called a polyteron, and if infinite (i.e. a honeycomb ) a tetracomb. A vertex figure (of a 5-polytope) is a polychoron, seen by the arrangement of neighboring vertices to each vertex. An edge figure (of a 5-polytope) is a polyhedron, seen by the arrangement of faces around each edge. A face figure (of a 5-polytope) is a polygon, seen by the arrangement of cells around each face. A regular polytope \{p,q,r,s\} exists only if \{p,q,r\} and \{q,r,s\} are regular polychora. The space it fits in is based on the expression: &lt; math &gt; &lt; 1 &lt; /math &gt; : Spherical 4-space tessellation or 5-space polytope = 1 : Euclidean 4-space tessellation &gt; 1 : hyperbolic 4-space tessellation Enumeration of these constraints produce 3 convex polytopes, zero nonconvex polytopes, 3 4-space tessellations, and 5 hyperbolic 4-space tessellations. There are no non-convex regular polytopes in five dimensions or higher. Higher-dimensional polytopes have sometimes received names. 6-polytopes have sometimes been called polypeta, 7-polytopes polyexa, 8-polytopes polyzetta, and 9-polytopes polyyotta. [ Convex ] In dimensions 5 and higher, there are only three kinds of convex regular polytopes.

[ Tessellations of hyperbolic 6-space and higher ] Even allowing for infinite (Euclidean) facets and/or vertex figures, there are no regular tessellations of hyperbolic space of dimension 6 or higher. [ Apeirotopes ] An apeirotope is, like any other polytope, an unbounded hyper-surface. The difference is that whereas a polytope&apos;s hyper-surface curls back on itself to close round a finite volume of hyperspace, an apeirotope does not curl back. Some people regard apeirotopes as just a special kind of polytope, while others regard them as rather different things. [ Two dimensions ] A regular apeirogon is a regular division of an infinitely long line into equal segments, joined by vertices. It has regular embeddings in the plane, and in higher-dimensional spaces. In two dimensions it can form a straight line or a zig-zag. In three dimensions, it traces out a helical spiral. The zig-zag and spiral forms are said to be skew. [ Three dimensions ] An apeirohedron is an infinite polyhedral surface. Like an apeirogon, it can be flat or skew. A flat apeirohedron is just a tiling of the plane. A skew apeirohedron is an intricate honeycomb-like structure which divides space into two regions. There are thirty regular apeirohedra in Euclidean space. [ McMullen Schulte 2002 Section 7E ] These include the tessellations of type \{4,4\}, \{6,3\} and \{3,6\} above, as well as (in the plane) polytopes of type: \{\infty,3\}, \{\infty,4\} and \{\infty,6\}, and in 3-dimensional space, blends of these with either an apeirogon or a line segment, and the &quot; pure &quot; 3-dimensional apeirohedra (12 in number) See also regular skew polyhedron. [ Four and higher dimensions ] The apeirochora have not been completely classified as of 2006. [ Abstract polytopes ] The abstract polytope s arose out of an attempt to study polytopes apart from the geometrical space they are embedded in. They include the tessellations of spherical, euclidean and hyperbolic space, tessellations of other manifold s, and many other objects that do not have a well-defined topology, but instead may be characterised by their &quot; local &quot; topology. There are infinitely many in every dimension. See this atlas for a sample. Some notable examples of abstract polytopes that do not appear elsewhere in this list are the 11-cell and the 57-cell.
