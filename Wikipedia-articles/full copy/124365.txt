[ http://factfinder2.census.gov Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Indian Springs CDP, Nevada U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder March 12, 2012 ] [ History ] Indian Springs is named for the artesian spring that provides the area with water. Over the years the spring has been used by Native Americans, the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad from 1906–1919, and later as an artist colony. Since the 1940s when the United States Army Air Forces established a training facility here, Indian Springs has been home for many military groups. Prior to being renamed as Creech Air Force Base in 2005, the field was known as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Air Field. In 1982 the USAF Thunderbirds Air Demonstration Squadron suffered a crash at the base. The &quot; Diamond Crash &quot; caused the deaths of four pilots. One of the town&apos;s main roads, Sky Road, was named by William J. Brady in memory of his friend Sky, who was also an Indian Springs resident. The land surrounding the creek and lake was called &quot; The Ranch &quot;. The owners rented out old ranch houses and allowed a tanker truck from the Nevada Test Site to fill up regularly with fresh water from the creek/spring, for the workers at the Nevada Test Site to drink. The problem was that the same truck was also used to haul leaded gasoline to the site. So, the drinking water was contaminated with gasoline. [ March 2012 ] (The ranch owners didn&apos;t know about the contamination; they were doing a good thing.) Visitors to Indian Springs will see trailers from an era gone by, including the &quot; Atomic View Trailer Court &quot;. Some of the same people who lived in Indian Springs during the 1950s still live there today.
