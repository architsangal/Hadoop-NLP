As of the United States 2000 Census, the village population was 7,606. Students attend the Northport-East Northport Union Free School District. The village of Northport sits along New York State Route 25A in the Town of Huntington, on Long Island&apos;s picturesque North Shore. It is known for its bucolic main street which still bears trolley rails from a long discontinued streetcar that brought people to the village from the Long Island Rail Road station in East Northport. Main Street ends at the village dock and village green, site of numerous &quot; concerts in the park &quot; on summer evenings. It has a number of fine restaurants and ice cream parlors, antique stores, as well as an old-style barbershop, and other independent retailers. Northport&apos;s old world charm and sense of community make it a very desirable residential location in Western Suffolk County with around an hour commute to New York City. [ History ] [ European settlement ] The original inhabitants of the area now known as Northport were the Matinecocks, one of 13 Native American tribes of Long Island. The Matinecocks called this land &quot; Opcathontyche &quot;, which meant &quot; wading place creek &quot;.

[ About Northport Northport Chamber of Commerce http://www.northportny.com/about.php 2007-02-08 ] With land that was well suited for farming, the early settlers grazed cattle on pastures around the harbor. The area soon became known as Great Cow Harbor. [ Little Bob The Many Names of Northport Northport History Northport Historical Society http://www.theliconnection.com/editorials/760 2007-02-08 ] (The nearby hamlet of Centerport was known as Little Cow Harbor.) The oldest house still standing in Northport, the Skidmore House on Main Street, was built in 1761. In 2009 the house was put up for sale, sparking the village to pass a historical preservation law. [ Fischler Marchelle On Long Island, Protecting These Old Houses New York Times New York Times Company 10 March 2010 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/realestate/14Lizo.html?emc%3Deta1 13 March 2010 ] [ Growth, change, and shipbuilding ] Woodbine Avenue and Northport Harbor, circa 1900 In the early 19th century Great Cow Harbor was still a rural farming community. By the 1830s the village contained only eight dwellings. [ Bayles Richard Mather Historical and Descriptive Sketches of Suffolk County and Its Towns, Villages, Hamlets, Scenery, Institutions, and Important Enterprises: With a Historical Outline of Long Island, from Its First Settlement by Europeans 1874 162–164 http://books.google.com/?id%3DQGPEBAjYLn0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA162 The Author ] But a new industry of shipbuilding brought rapid change and growth. The village shifted away from its farming roots as shipbuilding became the community&apos;s primary industry. By 1837 the village was being referred to as Northport. The 1860 census listed Northport&apos;s population at 1,016. By 1874 it had become the most flourishing village in all of Suffolk County&apos;s north shore, with three ship yards, five sets of marine railways, two hotels, and at least six general stores. Northport&apos;s shipbuilding boom lasted fifty years but waned at the end of the century as steel-hulled ships began replacing the wooden vessels produced in the village. [ Railroads and trolleys ] Main Street, sometime between 1902 and 1909 On April 25, 1868 the Long Island Railroad opened a station within the village of Northport. [ PRR Chronology, 1868 The Pennsylvania Railroad Technical &amp; Historical Society June 2004 http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1868%20June%2004.wd.pdf PDF 2007-02-08 ] This was an essential transportation link for the village, especially for the growing commuter population. However, just a few years later the LIRR decided to move the Northport station to a new location in Larkfield to facilitate further railway extension to Port Jefferson. The new railway station located on Larkfield Road was opened on January 13, 1873 [ PRR Chronology, 1873 The Pennsylvania Railroad Technical &amp; Historical Society February 2005 http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1873%20Feb%2004.pdf PDF 2007-02-08 ] and retained the station name of Northport. To avoid confusion with the former station located in the village of Northport, train conductors would refer to the station in Larkfield as &quot; East of Northport &quot; because the station was located east of the Northport railway junction which directed trains north to the station located in the village. Despite the fact that Larkfield was primarily south of Northport, the area became known thereafter as East Northport. [ East Northport: East Was Added When The Trains Came Long Island, Our History Newsday http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-historytown-hist0056%2C0%2C3509522.story 2007-02-12 ] The original rail spur to Northport would then be known as the Northport Branch.After the old bypassed village station closed in 1899, Northport decided to build a 2½ mile trolley line to take commuters between Main Street and the new Northport station located in Larkfield. The new commuter trolley opened in mid-April 1902. The trolley would eventually become obsolete with the invention of the automobile and the trolley made its last scheduled commuter run on August 19, 1924.

Over the years Northport has expanded from its original borders, annexing other established communities. Around the Revolutionary War, a concentration of 31 families began settling 1½ miles east of Northport, around where Main Street and Route 25A now intersect [ 40.8995 -73.3296 region:US_type:landmark inline ]. This settlement was originally known as Red Hook and changed names to Vernon Valley in 1820. By 1874 Vernon Valley had a population of around 150 inhabitants. Vernon Valley became part of Northport in the mid-20th century. [ New York Legislative Document J.B.

[ Modern Northport ] Northport Memorial Park at the edge of Northport Harbor After nearly a century of heavy commercial use, the waterfront which had supported the community for generations, had fallen into decay by the 1920s. The village decided to purchase the land along the harbor and created Northport Memorial Park in 1932, which is a defining feature of Northport today. In 1967, the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) opened the Northport Power Station, which is currently the largest oil-fired electric generating station on the East coast.

[ Gas- and Oil-Fired Plants in New York Power Plants Around The World May 24, 2006 http://www.industcards.com/st-other-usa-ny.htm 2007-12-04 ] The Northport Trolley which had ceased operations in 1924 enjoyed a popular revival in the 1970s and 1980s, transporting weekend tourists along Main Street. Unlike the original electric trolleys, this nostalgic replica was horse driven. It also ran on rubber automobile tires rather than utilizing the original rails which still remain a visible element of Main Street to this day. In 1984 Northport garnered nationwide media attention as the site of a gruesome satanic murder by high school dropout Ricky Kasso. [ Manning Gregg The Ultimate Crime http://www.real-crime.co.uk/Murder1/dock.html#Kasso 2007-11-01 ] Long after the crime, the unfortunate events have been recounted in books [ St. Clair David Say You Love Satan Dell October 1, 1987 http://www.amazon.com/Say-Love-Satan-David-Clair/dp/0440175747 0-440-17574-7 ] and movies, [ Satan in the Suburbs The New York Times http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/307491/Satan-in-the-Suburbs/overview 2007-11-01 ] from which the village of Northport has suffered a negative reputation for satanism.

[ Geography ] Northport Village Dock in Northport Harbor Northport is located at [ 40 54 10 N 73 20 39 W type:city ] (40.902803, -73.344069). [ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of [ 2.5 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 2.3 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and [ 0.2 sqmi km2 ] of it (9.02%) is water. Most of the village is made up of the low, steep hills of Long Island&apos;s northern terminal moraine. To the west is the highly sheltered Northport Harbor, to the north is Long Island Sound, and to the east are woods and marshland. A prominent feature of Northport is Steer’s Pit (known simply as &quot; The Pit &quot; to locals ), a large land depression carved into the cliffs adjacent to Northport Harbor and just south of the enormous LIPA smokestacks. This unusual geographic feature is the result of sand mining operations by the Steers and Steers Company. Mining began in 1923 and ceased in the 1950s.

[ May 2008 ] The area has since been utilized for home and condo use and a portion of the Pit is a park used by local youth soccer and baseball leagues. The Northport Fire Department also maintains a training facility in the Pit that is the site of the annual firemen fair in the summer.
