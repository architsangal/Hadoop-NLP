[ Background ] Subliminal was born in Tel Aviv, Israel to a Persian Jewish mother and Tunisian Jewish father. Subliminal started performing music at age 12, and at age 15 met Yoav Eliasi. The two quickly became friends as a result of their mutual love of hip-hop. In 1995 the two began performing in Israeli clubs geared toward a hip-hop audience, wearing baggy clothes and gold chains. They quickly developed a following among the nation&apos;s youth, and soon put out their first album, &quot; The Light From Zion &quot;. After the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000 the two began writing patriotic songs. They became known as creators of &quot; Zionist hip-hop &quot;, a label still applied to them. In further contrast to the generally rebellious, &quot; outlaw &quot; nature of most hip-hop, they also praise army service and eschew drugs and smoking. Subliminal&apos;s being the son of Jewish refugees is at the core of his hard-line politics. &quot; In Tunisia, my father grew up with his family locking all the doors and windows whenever performing a Jewish ceremony -- out of fear of attacks. &quot; Both parents, he says, &quot; ran for their lives &quot; to Israel, where they spent decades recovering from the persecution they had faced. { Israeli Rapper Takes U.S. : Rolling Stone } [ June 2011 ] Subliminal and Ha&apos;Tzel also helped discover the Arab Israeli rapper Tamer Nafar; they collaborated but eventually fell out over Subliminal and Nafar&apos;s political disagreement. The bitter end of their musical relationship is chronicled in the documentary film, Channels of Rage. In 2006 Subliminal collaborated with contratenor David D&apos;Or for the song &quot; Ten Koah &quot; ( &quot; Give Me Strength &quot; ) on Subliminal&apos;s hip hop album, Just When You Thought it Was Over.

At many of his concerts, Subliminal begins by calling to the audience, “Who is proud to be a Zionist in the state of Israel, put your hands in the air! Hell yeah!” { Joshua Mitnick, “Israeli Hip-Hop Takes on Mideast Politics,” USA Today, November 6, 2003. http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-11-06-hiphop-usat_x.htm. } Subliminal can be seen at many of his concerts wearing American hip hop clothing and a large Star of David chain necklace. Journalist Joshua Mitnick writes that with Subliminal’s patriotic, 2002 chart-topping album “Ha’or v’Ha’tzel” (The Light and the Shadow), he transformed the Star of David into a fashion statement and helped integrate the music of urban America into the fold of Israeli pop… For Subliminal, the music has generated tens of thousands of record sales. For Israeli teens, it has given voice to their outrage at the state of affairs in their country. Hip-hop, a quintessentially American art form, is helping bolster national morale in a country bruised by… years of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians. Subliminal uses hip hop to identify with and inspire Israeli teenagers through a new, global medium. Though the messages in his songs are not new, Israeli teenagers that listen to his music grew up in Israel decades after the establishment of the country. Subliminal and his group attempt to instill a new sense of Zionism to teenagers in the 21st-century. He uses hip hop, writing lyrics and portraying images reflective of life in the country, to communicate with teenagers today. [ Quotes ] [ When we talk politics with Arabs in Israel, they say, &apos;My grandfather used to live in Tel Aviv, and now it&apos;s owned by Jewish people -- we want to come back,&apos; &quot; he says. &quot; I respond, &apos;My parents came from Iran and Tunisia, but nobody is going to give our property back to us. It&apos;s all been confiscated... We have this little sandbox we call Israel. We give our hearts and lives to make it a proud country. Every one serves in the Israeli Defense Force in order for Israel to survive. You have half of the globe. What the fuck do you want from us? Go live in Saudi Arabia. ] [ Discography ] [ Studio albums ] Ha&apos;Or m&apos;Zion (האור מציון, &quot; The Light From Zion &quot; ) (2000) Ha&apos;Or Ve&apos;HaTzel with HaTzel (האור והצל, &quot; The Light and the Shadow &quot; ) 2002 TACT All-Stars with Mishpacha TACT (תאקט אול סטארז, &quot; TACT All-Stars &quot; ) (2004) Bediuk Kshe&apos;Chashavtem she&apos;Hakol Nigmar (בדיוק כשחשבתם שהכל נגמר, &quot; Just When You Thought It Was All Over &quot; ) (2006) Jew-niversal (2011) [ Singles ] [ With TACT ] Non-album singles Shir Shel Rega Eḥad ( Hebrew : שיר של רגע אחד, &quot; Song of One Moment &quot; ) (2005) Yoter mi&apos;Zeh Anaḥnu lo Tzrikhim ( Hebrew : יותר מזה אנחנו לא צריכים, &quot; We don&apos;t need more than this &quot; ) featuring Itzik Shamli (2006) From TACT All-Stars Hineni/Viens Ici ( Hebrew : הנני/Viens Ici, &quot; Here I am &quot; ) featuring Francky Perez (2004) Lama ( Hebrew : למה, &quot; Why? &quot; ) (2004) Prahim ba&apos;Kaneh ( Hebrew : פרחים בקנה, &quot; Flowers in the Turrets &quot; ) (2004) Peace in the Middle East ( Hebrew : שלום במזרח התיכון, &quot; Peace in the Middle East &quot; ) (2005) [ Solo ] From Bediuk Kshe&apos;Hashavtem she&apos;Hakol Nigmar Hamakom Hamushlam ( Hebrew : המקום המושלם, &quot; The Perfect Place &quot; ) (2006) Classit u&apos;Parsi ( Hebrew : קלסית ופרסי, &quot; Classic and Persian &quot; ) featuring Joe Budden and Miri Ben-Ari (2006) Toro ( Hebrew : טורו, &quot; Toro &quot; ) featuring Alon de Loco (2006) In Tel Aviv ( Hebrew : אין תל אביב, &quot; In Tel Aviv &quot; ) featuring Wyclef Jean and The Shadow (2006) Lifamim ani Margish ( Hebrew : לפעמים אני מרגיש, &quot; Sometimes I Feel &quot; ) featuring David Broza (2006) [ Non-album singles ] Adon Olam Ad Matai?
