Also known as E, Everett is known for writing songs tackling subjects such as death, mental illness, loneliness and unrequited love. [ Biography ] Mark Oliver Everett is the son of physicist Hugh Everett III, originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory and of the use of Lagrange multipliers for general engineering optimizations. As a child, Everett developed a love of toy instruments; this fondness would continue into adulthood and provide an integral part of his idiosyncratic sound. [ December 2009 ] In 1987, Everett moved from his family home in Virginia and resettled in California. Here, Everett began his professional musical career with two major-label albums: A Man Called E and Broken Toy Shop. The pseudonym &quot; E &quot; was used for both of these early recordings. While it may have caused some confusion in record stores and radio stations, the single-letter name gave the press a playful handle. This playfulness was evident in a review by the eminent writer Daniel Levitin which began: &quot; Excellent eponymous effort, energizingly eclectic. Early enthusiasm effectively ensures E&apos;s eminence. &quot; [ Levitin, D. J.

Everett made a documentary about both his father&apos;s theory and his own relationship with his father entitled Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives for the BBC that was aired on the PBS series NOVA in 2008. [ Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/ BBC 2011-06-18 ] Everett&apos;s father, Hugh, died in 1982. His sister, Elizabeth, long troubled by schizophrenia, committed suicide in 1996, and in 1998 his mother, Nancy Everett née Gore, died of lung cancer. Following these tragedies, Everett and the Eels released Electro-Shock Blues in 1998. The release, whose sound alternates between furious indefatigableness, black humor, and strikingly authentic desperation, gained almost unanimous critical praise. [ February 2009 ] Blues was followed by 2000&apos;s Daisies of the Galaxy, a gentler-in-tone addition to the Eels&apos; oeuvre that hinted that perhaps Everett&apos;s recovery had begun. Still, death continued to haunt Everett; his cousin, Jennifer Lewis née Gore, was a flight attendant on the plane that struck The Pentagon during the September 11, 2001 attacks. { Eels website } { washingtonpost.com: America At War } The plane struck the side of the Pentagon where his father had worked, and Everett remarks in his autobiography that he wonders whether the plane hit his father&apos;s old office.

The song What is this note? on the Souljacker album is in tribute to the happy days in the early days of the marriage. The marriage ended after 5 years. Although he titled his autobiography Things the Grandchildren Should Know, he doesn&apos;t have any children of his own. { The Sunday Times review of &apos;&apos;Things the Grandchildren Should Know&apos;&apos; } [ Career ] Everett&apos;s early solo work and Eels collaborations were hailed by critics for their innovative combination of various instruments and styles. [ February 2009 ] Everett has used everything from a toy piano in his early &quot; Symphony for a Toy Piano in G Minor &quot; to hammers on a radiator as percussion in 1998&apos;s &quot; Cancer for the Cure &quot;. Despite his constant denials, he is suspected of being the man behind MC Honky, who released the album I Am the Messiah in 2003. [ December 2009 ] Everett&apos;s music has also been featured on a number of films, including American Beauty ( &quot; Cancer for the Cure &quot; ), Road Trip ( &quot; Mr. E&apos;s Beautiful Blues &quot; ), Holes ( &quot; Eyes Down, &quot; &quot; Mighty Fine Blues &quot; ), Shrek ( &quot; My Beloved Monster &quot; ), Shrek 2 ( &quot; I Need Some Sleep &quot; ), Shrek The Third ( &quot; Royal Pain &quot; and &quot; Losing Streak &quot; ),Shrek the Halls ( &quot; The Stars Shine in the Sky Tonight &quot; ), Hellboy II: The Golden Army ( &quot; Beautiful Freak &quot; ),The Big White (Last Stop;This Town) Hot Fuzz ( &quot; Souljacker, pt.1 &quot; ), as well as most of the music in Yes Man. During 2005, Everett and his ad hoc Eels went on tour promoting his album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. It was during this recording that he worked with long-time hero and influence Tom Waits. In November 2007, Everett published his autobiography, entitled Things the Grandchildren Should Know. { Little, Brown Publishing } { The Independent, review of &apos;Things the Grandchildren Should Know&apos; } The 2007 BBC Scotland / BBC Four television documentary &quot; Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives &quot;, followed Everett as he talked to physicists and his father&apos;s former colleagues about his father&apos;s theory. { BBC4 to explore parallel universe Broadcast, November 5, 2007 } { The rock star and the quantum mechanic bbc.co.uk Monday, November 26, 2007 } The documentary won a Royal Television Society award on March 19, 2008. { Eels News eelstheband.com Thursday, March 20, 2008 } The documentary was shown in lieu of a support act during their UK and US tours in the spring of 2008. In the U.S., the PBS program Nova has broadcast the documentary in October 2008. The seventh Eels studio album— Hombre Lobo : 12 Songs of Desire—was released on June 2, 2009. On January 19, 2010, Everett released his eighth Eels album, entitled End Times, which deals with themes of aging and divorce.
