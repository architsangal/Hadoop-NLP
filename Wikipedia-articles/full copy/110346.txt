[ History ] [ 2009a ] [ Early years ] Americus, Georgia was named and chartered by Sen. Lovett B. Smith in 1832. For its first two decades, Americus was a small courthouse town. The arrival of the railroad in 1854 and, three decades later, local attorney Samuel H. Hawkins&apos; construction of the only privately financed railroad in state history, made Americus the eighth largest city in Georgia into the 20th century. It was known as the &quot; Metropolis of Southwest Georgia, &quot; a reflection of its status as a cotton distribution center. In 1890, Georgia&apos;s first chartered electric street car system went into operation in Americus. One of its restored cars is on permanent display at the Lake Blackshear Regional Library, a gift from the Robert T. Crabb family who acquired the street car in the 1940s. The town was already graced with an abundance of antebellum and Victorian architecture when local capitalists opened the Windsor Hotel in 1892. A five-story Queen Anne edifice, it was designed by a Swedish architect, Gottfried L. Norrman, in Atlanta. Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech from the balcony in 1917 and soon to be New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in the dining room in 1928. On January 1, 1976, the city center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Americus Historic District. The district boundaries were extended in 1979. [ Into the 20th century ] For the local minority community, Rev. Dr. Major W. Reddick established the Americus Institute for thirdinary Education (1897–1932). Booker T. Washington was a guest speaker there in May 1908. Rev. Alfred S. Staley was responsible for locating the state Masonic Orphanage in Americus, which served its function from 1898 to 1940. Both men engineered the unification of the General Missionary Baptist Convention of Georgia in 1915, the former as president and the latter as recording secretary. The public school named in honor of A.S. Staley was designated a National School of Excellence in 1990. Two other institutions of higher learning were also established in Americus, the Third District Agricultural and Mechanical School in 1906 (now Georgia Southwestern State University ), and the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School in 1948 (now South Georgia Technical College ). South Georgia Technical College is located on the original site of Souther Field. In World War I, an Army Air Service training facility, Souther Field (now Jimmy Carter Regional Airport ), was commissioned northeast of the city limits. Charles A. Lindbergh, the &quot; Lone Eagle, &quot; bought his first airplane and made his first solo flight there during a two-week stay in May 1923. Recommissioned for World War II, Souther Field was used for RAF pilot training (1941–1942) { Gilbert S. Guinn, The Arnold Scheme: British Pilots, The American South and the Allies Daring Plan, History Press, 2007 } as well as US pilot training before ending the war as a German prisoner-of-war camp. The town was incorporated in 1832, and the name Americus was picked out of a hat.

A plaque at Thomas Bell Stadium commemorates his contribution to the local baseball program. [ Americus and the Civil Rights Movement ] Koinonia Farm, an interracial Christian community, was organized near Americus in 1942. Founder Clarence Jordan was a mentor to Millard and Linda Fuller, who founded Habitat for Humanity International at Koinonia in 1976 before moving into Americus the following year. In 2005, they founded the The Fuller Center for Housing, also in Americus. Koinonia Farm is currently located southwest of Americus on Hwy. 49. The Civil Rights Era in Americus was a time of great turmoil; violent opposition to Koinonia by racist elements led to the bombing of a store uptown in 1957. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spent a weekend in the courthouse jail in 1961, after an arrest in Albany. The &quot; Sumter Movement &quot; to end racial segregation was organized and led by Rev. Joseph R. Campbell in 1963. As a direct result, two Georgia laws were subsequently declared unconstitutional by a federal tribunal meeting in Americus. Color barriers were first removed in 1965 when J.W. Jones and Henry L. Williams joined the Americus police force. Lewis M. Lowe was elected as the first black city councilman ten years later. With their election in 1995, Eloise R. Paschal and Eddie Rhea Walker broke the gender barrier on the city&apos;s governing body. In 1971, the city was featured in a Marshall Frady article, &quot; Discovering One Another in a Georgia Town, &quot; in Life magazine. The portrayal of the city&apos;s school integration was relatively benign, especially considering the community&apos;s history of troubled race relations. Americus&apos; nadir in this respect had occurred in 1913, when a young black man named Will Redding murdered Police Chief W.C. Barrow in a fit of rage and was then lynched by a white mob.

The EF-3 tornado was up to one mile wide, and carved a 38-mile path of destruction through the city and surrounding residential areas. { http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ffc/html/pns3107.txt } It destroyed parts of Sumter Regional Hospital, forcing the evacuations of all of the patients there. There were two fatalities at a Hudson Street residence near the hospital; all SRH patients were evacuated safely. The hospital, however, faces major reconstruction issues and may not be re-opened until 2010. A makeshift medical facility has opened in a parking lot adjacent to the damaged hospital structure. Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue said, &quot; It was worse [ that ] I had feared. The hospital was hit, but the devastation within the area of Sumter County and Americus was more than I imagined. The businesses around the hospital are totally destroyed. Power is still not restored in many places. It&apos;s just a blessing frankly that we didn&apos;t have more fatalities than we did. &quot; { WALb.com News, Weather and Sports for Albany, Valdosta and Thomasville. Leading the way for South Georgia. | Sumter hospital shows tornado&apos;s worst punch } Over 500 homes were affected, with around 100 completely destroyed. Several businesses throughout the town were seriously damaged or destroyed as well. Among the businesses suffering major damage were Winn Dixie supermarket, Wendy&apos;s, Zaxby&apos;s, McDonald&apos;s, Domino&apos;s Pizza, and several local businesses. The Winn Dixie was completely destroyed. Domino&apos;s Pizza has since reopened, as well as Winn Dixie. President George W. Bush visited the area on March 3, calling what he saw &quot; tough devastation. &quot; [ Notable people ] Prominent citizens of Americus include: Griffin Bell Gen. Howell Cobb Gen.
