[ the village in Nepal Seram, Nepal ] [ Seram Island Ceram_tpc_1967.jpg ID Seram.PNG South East Asia Molucca Islands 17100 52nd Binaiya 3019 Indonesia 434,113 2010 25.4 ] Seram (formerly Ceram, also called Seran or Serang) is the largest and main island of Maluku province of Indonesia, despite Ambon Island &apos;s historical importance. It is located just north of smaller Ambon Island. The chief port/town is Masohi, the new provincial capital. [ Geography and geology ] Seram is traversed by a central mountain range, the highest point of which, Mount Binaiya, is covered with dense rain forest s. Its remarkably complex geology is due to its location at the meeting of several tectonic microplates, that has been described as &quot; one of the most tectonically complex areas on Earth &quot;. [ Cooper Ian Seram Geology http://www.ee.usyd.edu.au/suss/Bulls/37%282%29/seramgeology.html http://web.archive.org/web/20020106064535/http%3A//www.ee.usyd.edu.au/suss/Bulls/37%282%29/seramgeology.html January 6, 2002 ] Seram actually falls on its own microplate that has been twisted around by 80° in the last 8 million years [ Linthout Kees Hendrik Helmers Pliocene obducted, rotated and migrated ultramafic rocks and obduction-induced anatectic granite, SW Seram and Ambon, Eastern Indonesia Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences January–February 1994 9 1-2 95–109 10.1016/0743-9547(94)90068-X ] by the relatively faster movement of the Papua microplate. Meanwhile, along with the northward push of the Australian Plate, this has resulted in the uplift that gives north-central Seram peaks of over 3000m. The population of the island in the 2010 Census was 434,113 people, administered among 3 regencies, Maluku Tengah Regency had 170,392 people on Seram island itself { http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/8103.pdf } and 191,306 on the lesser islands (majority on Ambon Island ), the entirety of Seram Bagian Barat Regency and Seram Bagian Timur Regency. { http://www.bps.go.id/aboutus.php?sp=0 &amp; kota=81 } [ Ecology ] Seram island is remarkable for its high degree of localised bird endemism. { BirdLife International : Saving Asia&apos;s threatened birds, 2003, retrieved 19 May 2010 } From the 117 species of bird on the island, 14 are endemic, including the Eclectus Parrot, Purple-naped Lory, Salmon-crested Cockatoo, Lazuli Kingfisher, Sacred Kingfisher, Grey-necked Friarbird and Moluccan King Parrot. { Inonesian Ministry of Forestry, retrieved 19 May 2010 } The mammals found on Seram include Asian species ( Murid rodents ) as well as Australasian marsupial s. The montane area of Seram supports the greatest number of endemic mammals of any island in the region. It harbors 38 mammal species and includes nine species that are endemic or near endemic, several of which are limited to montane habitats. These include the Seram Bandicoot, Moluccan Flying Fox, Seram Flying-fox, Manusela Mosaic-tailed Rat, Spiny Ceram Rat and the Ceram Rat, all considered threatened. { WWF: Seram rain forests, retrieved 19 May 2010 } Saltwater crocodile s exist within some of the island&apos;s rivers, including the Salawai River. In the eastern part of the island, Manusela National Park has been established in 1997, covering an area of 1,890  km² (11% of the island). [ History ] Most central Moluccans consider Seram to be their original ancestral home and it is still known colloquially as Nusa Ina (Mother Island). { http://www.ema-huaresi.com/homepage.htm } { Lonely Planet Indonesia 7th Edition, page 840 } In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Seram was generally within the sphere of influence of Ternate, although it was often ruled more directly by the Ternaten vassal state of Buru. Portuguese missionaries were active there in the 16th century. Dutch trading post s were opened in the early 17th century, and the island came under nominal Dutch control c. 1650. In the 1780s, Seram provided a key base of support for Prince Nuku of Tidore &apos;s long-running rebellion against Dutch rule. From 1954 until 1962 the island&apos;s mountain terrain was the scene of an armed guerilla struggle against Indonesian rule by the counter revolutionary Republic of South Moluccas movement led by Soumokil. [ Administration ] Seram includes three of the regencies within the province of Maluku. West Seram (Kabupaten Seram Bagian Barat), capital at Dataran Hunipopu, had a population (2003) of 140,657; and Eastern Seram (Kabupaten Seram Bagian Timur), capital at Dataran Hunimoa, had a population (2003) of 78,336. The Central Maluku Regency (Kabupaten Maluku Tengah), with its capital at Masohi, includes the middle part of Ceram, as well as some other smaller islands. [ Religion ] View from a boat towards Tulehu, on the North Seram coast Seram has been traditionally associated with the animism of the indigenous Alfur (or Nuaulu ), a West Melanesian people who reputedly retained a custom of headhunting until the 1940s. { Lonely Planet Indonesia, 8th edition p762 } Today, however, most of the population of Seram today is either Muslim or Christian due to both conversion and immigration. Seram was affected by the violent inter-religious conflict that swept Maluku province starting in late 1998, resulting in tens of thousands of displaced persons across the province { http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/ambon/amron-01.htm } but after the Malino II Accord agreement tempers cooled. Seram has been peaceful for many years but towns like Masohi remain informally divided into de facto Christian and Muslim sections.Around 7,000 people belonging to the Manusela tribe follow Hinduism. { Note: the Indonesia definition of Hinduism is a complex legal matter; in effect Hinduism was a supercategory used to define non Islamic and Christian religions hence any pagan style religion. This is not to say that it is not related to Hinduism at its root, however. } [ Economy ] Copra, resin, sago, and fish are important products. Oil is produced in the northeast near Bula by CITIC Seram Energy [ Oil http://www.citicresources.com/eng/business/oil.htm#Seram Seram Non-Bula Block, Indonesia CITIC Resources Holdings Limited ] who took over from KUFPEC (Indonesia) Limited in 2006. { http://www.kufpec.com/KUFPEC/en-US/Operations/SouthEastAsia/Indonesia/ } The Oseil oil field is located onshore in the northeast of the island in the Seram Non-Bula Production Sharing Contract area. The discovery well was drilled in 1993. As of end 2010 the Seram Non-Bula Block had estimated proven oil reserves of 9.7 million barrels. Most production comes from the Jurassic Manusela carbonate formation.
