It is located on the border of the Negev and Judean Desert s, [ 25 km mi 1 us ] west of the Dead Sea and [ 45 km mi 1 us ] east of the city Beersheba. The city is home to a diverse population of 23,400 including Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, both secular and religious, Bedouins and Black Hebrew s, as well as native-born Israelis and new immigrants. The city is notable for its clean, dry air and serves as a major attraction to asthmatics worldwide. [ Kantor SZ, Frank M, Hoch-Kantor D, et al.

Arad&apos;s population grew significantly with the Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s, and peaked in 2002 at 24,500 residents. The city has seen a decline in population ever since. As the second-largest city in Israel in terms of jurisdiction, Arad contains a number of large public places and facilities, such as the ruins of Tel Arad, the Arad Park, an airfield serving domestic flights, and Israel&apos;s first legal race circuit. It is also well known for its annual music festival, which was one of the most popular annual music events in the country until 1995. [ History ] [ Tel Arad ] Arad is named after the Biblical Canaan ite town located at Tel Arad (a Biblical archaeology site famous for the discovery of ostraca ) which is located approximately [ 8 km mi 1 us ] west of modern Arad. The Bible (Judges 1:16) describes it as a Canaanite stronghold whose king kept the Israelites from moving from the Negev to the Judean Mountains, although Tel Arad was destroyed over 1,200 years before the arrival of the Israelites. However, Shoshenq I &apos;s chronicles seem to mention a settlement in Tel Arad. During the Byzantine period, the location was still correctly identified by Eusebius, and the name Arad was preserved by the Bedouins. [ Foundation ] The first modern attempt to settle the area was made by the Yishuv, the body of Jewish residents in Mandate Palestine, on 23 February 1921, when the British Mandate government allowed released soldiers from the Jewish Legion to settle in the area. Nine men and two women attempted the task, but after four months were forced to leave because water was not found in the area. [ Vilnai, Ze&apos;ev Zev Vilnay Arad Ariel Encyclopedia Volume 7 1979 6002–6003 Am Oved Israel ] It was not until 15 November 1960, when a planning unit (and a full committee on 29 December) were appointed by the Israeli cabinet to examine the possibility of settlement in the northeastern Negev desert and the Arad area. An initial budget of 50,000 Israeli lira s was given to the project which was to be under the leadership of Aryeh Eliav. On 31 January 1961, the final location of the new city was decided ( [ 3.5 km mi 1 us ] southwest of Mount Kidod), as well as details about road and water connections. During March 1961, a full city plan for 10,000 and then 20,000 residents was conceived, along with a corresponding map. Yona Pitelson served as the chief architect of the city and was instrumental in its design.

Building blocks were constructed in a way that protected large inside areas from desert sun and winds. Higher density residential areas were also built first in order to give residents the feel of a city and shorten walking distances.

The town itself, however, was officially founded in 1962 by a group of young Israelis, most of them ex- kibbutz and ex- moshav members, who were seeking an environment free of the urban ills of overcrowding, traffic, noise, and pollution.
