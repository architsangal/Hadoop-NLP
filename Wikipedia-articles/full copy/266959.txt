During World War II, it was called RAF Ringway and from 1975 until 1986 Manchester International Airport. The airport is owned and managed by the Manchester Airports Group (MAG), a holding company owned by the ten metropolitan borough councils of Greater Manchester, with Manchester City Council owning the largest stake. A Category 10 airport, [ Manchester Airport is &apos;ready&apos; for A380 Super Jumbo http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8929000/8929091.stm BBC News 19 August 2010 1 September 2010 ] the airport comprises three terminal s, a goods terminal and a railway station. It is the only British airport other than London Heathrow to have two runways over 3,000 metres in length. The airport regularly handled Concorde and currently houses the British Airways G-BOAC flagship Concorde at the Manchester Runway Visitor Park. Ringway, which the airport was named after, still exists as a few buildings and church at the southern edge of the airport. Vacant land exists for expansion, and the £649,000,000 Manchester Airport City scheme aims to create logistics, manufacturing, office and hotel space adjacent to the airport. [ History ] [ History of Manchester Airport ] For history of Ringway before the airport started, see Ringway, Manchester. { Wythenshawe are now, as around 1925 } Manchester Airport (earlier called Ringway Airport) started construction on 28 November 1935 and opened partly in June 1937 and completely on 25 June 1938, in Ringway parish north of Wilmslow. Its north border was Yewtree Lane (on this map, the lane between Firtree Farm and The Grange, east of the crossroads marked &quot; Ringway &quot; ). Its southeast border was a little west of Altrincham Road (Styal) (the lane from Oversleyford running northeast then east into the Styal area.) During World War II it was the base for RAF Ringway, and was important in military aircraft production and training parachutist s. After World War II, the base reverted to a civilian airport it gradually expanded to its present size. Historically, Manchester has consistently been the busiest airport after London Heathrow for a number of decades following World War II. [ Southend Airport&apos;s revival gets under way It is hoped this will be the beginning of a comeback for the airport, which, during the Sixties, was Britain’s third-busiest, behind Heathrow and Manchester http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9175631/Southend-Airports-revival-gets-under-way.html The Telegraph 30 March 2012 5 April 2012 ] In 1972 the M56 motorway opened to the airport. In 1993 the airport railway station opened. In 1997 to 2001 its second runway was built, and caused large-scale protests in the area. [ Future airport expansion ] As part of the Government&apos;s &apos; The Future of Air Transport &apos; White Paper, Manchester Airport published its master plan on its proposed expansion up until 2030. Demolition of older buildings, such as old storage buildings, the old Alpha Catering Building and Males Garage, to the east of Terminal 3 has already begun. This is to make way for a new apron and taxiway towards runway 05L/23R, and an eastwards extension of Terminal 3, which is planned to provide an extra fifteen covered stands. A full-length parallel taxiway may also be added to the second runway and more crossing points added across the first runway to improve ground movements of aircraft. Passenger flow on Terminal 1&apos;s gating piers is due to be realigned, with plans to redesign the piers such that departures and arrivals do not contraflow on the same level, allowing for larger seating areas at the gates, express retail outlets and a dedicated lounge and gating area for future Airbus A380 flights. Currently, Gate 12B, Pier B has been upgraded to accommodate the A380, the only gate at the airport capable of handling this aircraft so far. An early phase of this has seen the removal of the South Bay remote aircraft stands, constructed in 1962, and situated between taxiways Juliet and Kilo and as a consequence the more recent re-alignment of taxiway Juliet into an extended taxiway Bravo. Terminal 2 is due to receive a major extension, to encompass current remote stands to the west. A satellite terminal is also projected for Terminal 2. Between twelve and fifteen covered aircraft stands will be made available by this. An air side link for transferring passengers between Terminals 1 and 2 is at the planning stage, designed in an effort to boost Manchester&apos;s chances of becoming a major hub airport and minimize missed connections. All terminals have undergone a retail and airport security refurbishment programme, completed in summer 2009. The security control areas have new X-ray machine s and passenger authenticity control systems, which will ensure a higher and faster passenger throughput, whilst improving the security at the airport. In Terminal 1, the security area has been increased to 14 lanes, from the prior 6-lane flow. The new security control areas are now in operation in all terminals. Terminal 2&apos;s security zone is now located on a newly constructed upper level, whilst Terminal 1&apos;s security zone has been moved closer to the check-in zones. Consequently, the land side retail shopping concourse before security has been removed in both terminals, to accommodate the expanded two-zone air-side departure area, which directs passengers through large duty-free shop ping areas as they move from the zone 1 shopping areas immediately after security to zone 2, the food courts and gates. The new terminal layouts allow an increase in passenger numbers and a quicker, easier flow of passenger movement. Terminal 3 acquired an extra security control area in November 2007, located near check-in zone C. This was dedicated to passengers travelling to CTA destinations. In January 2008, the usage was extended to all Terminal 3 passengers, with the exception of those destined for Frankfurt, Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport and Brussels. This new security control area is now used for all departures from Terminal 3; the old security area has now closed and the area which it once covered is now part of the Terminal 3 airside departure lounge; housing the retail outlets Accessorize and Dixons Travel. On 27 April 2008, it was announced that the Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which owns Manchester Airport and the regional airports at East Midlands and Bournemouth, planned to sell its majority stake of 87% in the smaller Humberside Airport, which it has run since 1999. The money raised from the sale would go into developments and expansion at its other airports, a large proportion of which will most probably be used to fund the above expansion of Manchester. [ http://www.uk-airport-news.info/humberside-airport-news-260408.htm Humberside Airport to be sold Uk-airport-news.info 4 April 2010 ] However, this decision was later revised, and MAG decided to keep Humberside for the immediate future. There also plans to create a business centre to help encourage businesses to set up in Manchester. [ Terminals and destinations ] [ Manchester Airport panorama.jpg 700px A panorama of Manchester Airport showing much of Terminal 1 and a portion of Terminal 3 (back right) as well as the control tower and taxiway. ] [ Terminals ] Manchester Airport has three passenger terminals (Terminals 1, 2 and 3). Terminals 1 and 2 are linked by the &apos;&apos;skylink&apos;&apos;, with travelators to aid passengers with the 10–15 minute walk. Terminal 3 is linked to Terminal 1 and the skylink by a covered walkway. The skylink also connects the terminals to the airport railway station complex (known as &quot; The Station &quot; ) and the Radisson BLU Hotel. The skylink started construction in 1996 and opened 1997. Expansion to the Radisson Hotel was completed in 1998 when the hotel opened. { skylink &apos;&apos; } The airport provides regular direct flights to destinations worldwide by over 60 airlines. North American carriers at Manchester include American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and US Airways. The only scheduled UK operator serving the USA market is Virgin Atlantic. Airlines serving the Asian market include Air Blue, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Pakistan International Airlines, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines. Manchester was an international hub for BMI which offered several destinations from Terminal 3, however the airline withdrew its routes from Manchester to North America and the Caribbean, including to Chicago and Las Vegas during early 2009. { Bmi to end Manchester-Chicago services } The airport viewed from the south Scheduled airlines with a base at Manchester include: EasyJet, Flybe, Jet2, Monarch, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic. Charter airlines with a base at Manchester include: Monarch, Strategic Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines, one of the most popular destanaion in Zaknthos airport Dioynios Solomos - ICAO - LGZA - IATA - ZTH and Thomson Airways. Manchester Airport offers flights to over 190 destinations across the globe and 65 tour operators utilise the facility. [ http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/terminalrelaunches Flagship terminal relaunches at Manchester Airport 14 July 2009 Manchester Airport ] Many of Manchester&apos;s overseas routes are served by charter flights to holiday destinations, some being seasonal. The proportion of scheduled passengers passing through Manchester has increased from 43% in 1991 to 68% during 2009. { UK CAA Airport Statistics } Manchester also offers more destinations than some of the biggest airports in the US, including New York, Chicago and Dallas, although it is still slightly behind the three biggest &apos;hubs&apos; in the global aviation network – Atlanta, Frankfurt am Main and Amsterdam – which each offer more than 250 destinations. However, Manchester serves more foreign destinations than Atlanta and Frankfurt (but not Amsterdam), although being much smaller in terms of total passengers handled. [ Terminal 1 ] Terminal 1, AC tower and short stay parking complex. Terminal 1 is mostly used by Star Alliance airline members such as Lufthansa and Swiss International Air Lines as well as other scheduled and charter operations. It was opened in 1962 by the Duke of Edinburgh, handling scheduled &amp; charter European flights. It is also the base for EasyJet, Jet2 and Thomas Cook Airlines. Some other European scheduled airlines such as Germanwings and Aer Lingus also operate flights from the terminal. The terminal has 29 stands, of which 15 have airbridges, and is the largest of the three terminals. Terminal 1&apos;s current capacity is around 11 million passengers a year. compared with an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers when it first opened. [ http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/alldocs/10F56C819A51454E8025739300388C1D/%24File/Masterplan.pdf masterplan – jan – new PDF 4 April 2010 ] In summer 2009, a £50 million redevelopment programme for Terminal 1 was completed. [ http://www.uk-airport-news.info/manchester-airport-news-030709.html Manchester Airport £50m overhaul complete 4 July 2009 UK Airport News ] As part of the overhaul, which took over 2 years, a new £14 million 14-lane security area opened during April 2008. The terminal&apos;s arrivals area has since been revamped with additional catering and retail facilities. Terminal 1&apos;s departure lounge has been expanded with a greater choice of shops and restaurants, following the virtual elimination of the landside area, and additional executive lounges have been added. Following the 2007 smoking ban, the indoor ventilated smoking room in the departure lounge was closed, however this was replaced in 2010 by a rooftop smoking terrace to allow passengers to smoke after passing through security. This comes after a proposed terminal re-alignment at the airport, with Terminal 1 becoming the scheduled international terminal. Emirates currently operate the only A380 service out of Manchester from Terminal 1. [ Terminal 2 ] Terminal 2 Terminal 2 is mostly used by SkyTeam airline members and long haul and charter airlines flying to international destinations only. It opened in 1993, handling scheduled European and Intercontinental flights. It is also the base for Strategic Airlines, Thomson Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Monarch &apos;s largest scheduled flight base. Some European scheduled airlines such as Air Malta and Tunisair also operate flights from the terminal. Terminal 2 has 20 gates, of which 14 have airbridges. The design of the terminal makes it capable of extensive expansion; planning permission already exists for an extension providing additional gates, together with the construction of a satellite pier. Terminal 2&apos;s current capacity is around 8 million passengers a year, this will be extended to ultimately handle 25 million passengers a year. In 2007, an £11 million project commenced to redevelop Terminal 2 by improving security facilities and enhancing retail and catering services. This has resulted in the elimination of the landside shopping area to allow for an expanded airside departure lounge. The ground level arrivals area has also been redeveloped with improved catering and retail facilities. Like Terminal 1, following the 2007 smoking ban, the indoor ventilated smoking room in the departure lounge was closed, however this was replaced in 2009 by an external smoking area at Gate 300 to allow passengers to smoke after passing through security. The departure lounge also has an unsupervised children&apos;s play area at Gate 212. Terminal 2&apos;s new upper-level security area opened during July 2008 and the entire terminal redevelopment completed during autumn 2009. [ Terminal 3 ] Terminal 3 Terminal 3 is mostly used by airlines who offer domestic routes. It was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in May 1989 and handles the majority of domestic routes from Manchester as well as some scheduled European flights and a few intercontinental flights. It is also the base for BMI, Flybe and Ryanair. Some European scheduled airlines like Adria Airways, Air France and Brussels Airlines as well as International airlines like American Airlines also operate flights from the terminal. Terminal 3 was known in succession as &quot; Terminal 1 – British Airways &quot;, &quot; Terminal 1A &quot; and &quot; Terminal 3 – British Airways and Domestic &quot;. In June 1998, British Airways opened their new £75 million terminal facility designed by Grimshaw Architects, a major extension to Terminal 3, and were the primary user of the terminal along with their partner airlines. However, more recently they have scaled down operations from Manchester Airport with the sale of their BA Connect subsidiary to Flybe; the ending of their franchise agreement with GB Airways and the retraction of their daily New York-JFK service in October 2008, after 54 years of operation. This leaves a BA operation serving only London Heathrow and Gatwick from Manchester. Since taking over BA Connect &apos;s select routes, Flybe has gone on to add several more destinations.

There is [ 550000 sqft on ] of warehouse and office space on site, including a chiller unit for frozen products and a border inspection post. There are three aircraft maintenance hangars, with five transit sheds, operated by British Airways Regional Cargo, Swissport Cargo, Menzies World Cargo, Plane Handling and Servisair. There are over 100 freight forwarding companies on site. Freight throughput at the airport grew from 94,000 tonnes in 1997 to the peak at 165,000 tonnes in 2007, but then declined to around 107,000 tonnes in 2011, making Manchester the fourth-busiest UK airport for freight behind London Heathrow, East Midlands and London Stansted. [ Runways ] Manchester Airport has two parallel runway s, one [ 3048 m on 0 ] and the other [ 3050 m on 0 ] in length. The original main runway, then designated 06/24 and initially [ 3300 ft on 0 ] in length, dates back to 1941 [ Scholefield 1998 17 ] when the airport was used as an RAF base and a military aircraft assembly centre. It was extended in stages from 1952, reaching its current length in 1981 to attract long-haul international traffic. As demand and aircraft movements both increased during the mid-1990s, mainly due to the newly completed Terminal 2, the airport studied the option of a second full-length runway. A consultation process began and planning permission was approved in 1997, with construction work starting the same year. The second runway, initially designated 06R/24L, opened in February 2001 [ http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/manweb.nsf/Content/AirportSummary Fact Sheet: Airport Summary Manchester Airport 4 April 2010 ] at a cost of £172 million, and was the first full-length commercial runway to open in Britain for over 20 years. The site where the second runway was constructed was on the southern airfield boundary, which is near the village of Styal in the Cheshire countryside. The project was deemed controversial because of the destruction of natural wildlife habitats { Flight path to destruction } [ April 2010 ] and because of the added flight paths which lead to and from the second runway. This results in aircraft flying low over the residential areas of Knutsford [ http://archive.knutsfordguardian.co.uk/2007/12/19/300005.html Knutsford Guardian – Residents wait for airport to pay out Archive.knutsfordguardian.co.uk 19 December 2007 4 April 2010 ] and Stockport when landing or taking off, in particular landing aircraft which do not follow &apos;Preferred Noise Routes&apos;.

During the quieter off-peak times which occur during the day, the airport reverts to single runway operations, where the original runway, 05L/23R, is used to accommodate both landing aircraft and those taking off. On some occasions when the airport is not busy, air traffic control can authorise light to medium aircraft to takeoff from the halfway point of the runway. Runway 05R/23L is non-active during this time (10.30am-4pm and 8pm-6.30am) with fewer local residential areas being affected by the operation of only one runway. [ Security ] Manchester Airport is policed by the Greater Manchester Police. Several security-related incidents have occurred at the airport in recent years.

In 2004, the BBC &apos;s Whistleblower programme revealed security failures at the airport, including faulty metal detectors and a lack of regular random baggage checks. In 2005, police used a taser on a man spotted acting suspiciously, on the apron, after he appeared to resist arrest. On 6 June 2006, Aabid Hussain Khan, 21, of West Yorkshire and a 16-year-old boy were arrested at the airport and later charged under Section 57 of the Terrorism Act, for conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause public nuisance by using poisons or explosives. [ Ground transport ] { Class 185 arriving at } { Manchester Airport Railway Station } [ Rail ] Manchester Airport railway station, opened in May 1993, [ Scholefield 1998 138 ] forms part of The Station and is located between Terminals 1 and 2. It is linked to the terminals using a Skylink moving walkway. Trains are operated either by Northern Rail or TransPennine Express and connect the airport to Manchester Piccadilly Station and other railway stations mainly throughout northern England, including Crewe, Wigan and Southport, but some trains come from as far as Edinburgh. A third rail platform was completed in December 2008 to allow for an increase in rail capacity. In 2009 Network Rail stated that the creation of the third platform has meant that the capacity at Manchester airport will become constrained by the layover of the trains and congestion at the throat. To solve this issue they have recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich in the 2019 to 2024 period. { http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/StrategicBusinessPlan/RoutePlans/2009/Route%2020%20-%20North%20West%20Urban.pdf } [ Bus and coach ] The Station is the airport&apos;s ground transport interchange and brings bus, coach and rail passengers under one roof. Over 300 trains, 100 coaches and 500 buses a day use the facility. Buses serve many locations throughout Greater Manchester, including the 24-hour bus service Skyline ( service 43 ), [ http://www.tfgm.com/upload/routemaps/43_28152.pdf Service 43 timetable Transport for Greater Manchester 11 May 2011 PDF ] which runs every 10 minutes (every 30 minutes at night) to Manchester city centre via Wythenshawe, Northenden, Withington, Fallowfield and Rusholme. There is also Skyline (service 19) operating every hour to Altrincham via Wythenshawe and Sale.

The M56 is the main route used by traffic to reach the airport. There are also minor local roads serving the airport from the north ( Wythenshawe ) and the east ( Heald Green ). The M56/A538 road junction serves the World Freight Terminal, to the west of the airport. The A538 runs east-west serving the local towns of Altrincham and Wilmslow. Taxi ranks are situated by arrivals at all three terminals. Passengers driving to the airport can use the drop-off areas outside the terminal buildings, but when picking up passengers the airport requires that they park in the short stay car parks provided for a fee. Long stay car parks are situated both on and off site. [ Parking ] The airport&apos;s official short-stay car parking can be found in the multi-storey car park s adjacent to Terminals 1, 2 and 3. In July 2007 the airport introduced a &apos;No Waiting&apos; restriction on all access roads surrounding the terminals. This was a direct result of the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack and so all pick-ups must take place by using the short-stay car parks. In 2009/2010 Terminal 1&apos;s multi-storey car park was refurbished. Each level of the car park is colour coded. The floor, walls, ceiling and supports have all received a repaint with every parking space having a sensor and green light above it, with empty parking bays indicated by the green light. Official long-stay on- airport parking from Manchester Airport is located near the terminals and serviced by a regular courtesy bus. There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3, and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2. In 2009, the airport opened JetParks – two long-stay car parks less than a mile from the terminals. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is serviced by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes. The airport also operates a Shuttle Park for long-stay car parking, which is also served by a regular courtesy bus, and is located just off the airport site to the east of Terminal 3. There are several privately operated car parks within a short distance of the airport, served by shuttle bus. [ Tram ] The Manchester Metrolink light rail system has had plans to extend to the airport for many years. When the idea of a congestion charge was mooted, part of the scheme was to have extended the Metrolink to the airport. However, when this was rejected the future of the scheme was in doubt. In 2009, it was announced that the line to the airport will finally be built. The airport line will be one spur of the line from St Werburgh&apos;s Road, to East Didsbury and Manchester Airport. The Metrolink line is due to open in 2012 and Manchester Airport&apos;s tram station is due to open in 2016. [ Effect on the area; criticism ] Expansion of the airport caused closures of public roads in the area. [ http://members.aol.com/pp3office/arthpr.htm Save Arthurs wood Press statements 31 December 2006 ] Between 1997 and 1999 three protest camp s were set up to oppose the building of the second runway, the felling of nearby trees on land owned by the National Trust in Styal, Cheshire and air transportation in general.

There were four fatalities – two of the three crew on board and two of the three passengers. The subsequent investigation found that the crash resulted from a loss of engine power, caused by ice forming in the carburettor intakes, attributable to the captain&apos;s failure to use the heat controls. An extended undercarriage and snow on the wings may have also been contributory factors. On 14 March 1957, British European Airways Flight &quot; Bealine 411 &quot; operated by Vickers Viscount 701 (Registration G-ALWE) inbound from Amsterdam crashed into houses in Shadow Moss Road, Woodhouse Park. The aircraft was on final approach to Runway 24 at Manchester Airport, and the crash was due to a flap failure, caused by fatigue of a wing bolt.
