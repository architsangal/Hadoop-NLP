The 25 Big Boys were the only locomotives to have the 4-8-8-4 wheel arrangement, which combined two sets of eight driving wheels with a four-wheel leading truck for stability entering curves and a four-wheel trailing truck to support the large firebox. [ Design ] Union Pacific Railroad (UP) introduced the Challenger -type ( 4-6-6-4 ) locomotives in 1936 on its main line across Wyoming. For most of the way, the maximum grade is 0.82% in either direction, but the climb eastward from Ogden, Utah, into the Wasatch Range (Wahsatch, on the railroad) reached 1.14%. Hauling a 3,600-short ton (3,300 t) freight train demanded doubleheading and helper operations, and adding and removing the helper engines from a train slowed operations down. The answer was to design a new locomotive, but for such locomotives to be worthwhile they had to be faster and more powerful than slow mountain luggers like the earlier compound 2-8-8-0 s that UP tried after World War I. To avoid locomotive changes, the new class would need to pull long trains at sustained speed — [ 60 mph km/h -1 us ] —once past the mountain grades. Led by Otto Jabelmann, the UP&apos;s design team worked with Alco to re-examine the Challengers, which had been designed by A.H. Fetters. They found that the goals could be achieved by making several changes to the Challenger design, including enlarging the firebox to about [ 235 x 96 in m 1 ] (about [ 155 sqft m2 on / ] ), lengthening the boiler, adding four driving wheels and reducing the size of the driving wheels from [ 69 to 68 in m 3 on ]. The Big Boys are articulated, like the Mallet locomotive design. They were designed for stability at [ 60 mph km/h -1 ]. They were built with a heavy margin of reliability and safety, as they normally operated well below that speed in freight service. Peak horsepower was reached at about [ 35 mph km/h on ]; optimal tractive effort, at about [ 10 mph km/h on ]. [ Operation ] { backhead (controls) of 4017 at the } { National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, WI } Twenty-five Big Boys were built, in two groups of ten and one of five. All burned coal, and had large grates to burn the low-quality Wyoming coal from mines owned by the railroad. As an experiment, Locomotive #4005 was converted to burn oil, but unlike a similar effort with the Challenger types, this was not successful, and the locomotive was soon changed back to coal. The cited reason for this failure was the use of a single burner, which created unsatisfactory and uneven heating in the Big Boy&apos;s large firebox. It is unknown why multiple burners were not employed, though with dieselization in full swing after 1945 the company probably lost interest in further development of steam. Postwar increases in the price of both coal and labor and the efficiency of diesel-electric motive power foretold a limited life for the Big Boys, but they were among the last steam locomotives taken out of service. Towards the end of the 4000s&apos; career (in the late 1950s) it was found that they could still pull more than their rated tonnage of 3,600 tons (3,300 t). Their ratings were increased several times until they regularly pulled [ 4450 ST t us ] up the Wasatch grade, unassisted. The last revenue train hauled by a Big Boy ended its run early in the morning on July 21, 1959. Most were stored operational until 1961, and four remained in operational condition at Green River, Wyoming until 1962. Their duties were assumed by diesels and turbines. [ Preservation ] Big Boy #4023 on permanent display in Omaha, Nebraska The Big Boy is well-represented among preserved steam locomotives in the United States. All except numbers 4005 and 4017 are in the open without protection from the elements. The dry air of Southern California has helped #4014 to remain well preserved, assisted by care of the local chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society. The Steamtown example is also said to be in good condition, though the harsher weather of the northeast has taken its toll. The Forney Museum of Transportation in Denver moved the 4005 to a renovated building in January 2001. Thanks to considerable fundraising and volunteer efforts, number 4017 now resides with other pieces of railroad equipment in a climate-controlled shed at the museum in Green Bay. Number 4023 is the only known Big Boy to move by highway since preservation, to the new Kenefick Park in Omaha. Number 4018 is planned to be moved to a new location north of Dallas in Frisco, Texas. There are no operable Big Boys and no plans to return any to running condition. { Steamtown National Historic Site } Eight of the 25 Union Pacific Big Boys still exist: [ 41 08 12.30 N 104 47 59.4 W inline Big Boy 4004 ] [ 39 46 37.38 N 104 58 13.8 W inline Big Boy 4005 ] [ 38 34 19.73 N 090 27 40.0 W inline Big Boy 4006 ] [ 41 24 26.96 N 075 40 10.8 W inline Big Boy 4012 ] [ 34 05 01.44 N 117 46 14.44 W inline Big Boy 4014 ] [ 44 29 02.70 N 088 02 55.1 W inline Big Boy 4017 ] [ 32 46 58.32 N 096 45 49.4 W inline Big Boy 4018 ] [ 41 13 55.7 N 095 55 4.1 W inline Big Boy 4023 ] 4004: Holliday Park, Cheyenne, Wyoming 4005: Forney Transportation Museum, Denver, Colorado 4006: Museum of Transportation, St. Louis, Missouri 4012 : Steamtown National Historic Site, Scranton, Pennsylvania 4014: Railway and Locomotive Historical Society, Southern California Chapter, Fairplex, Pomona, California 4017: National Railroad Museum, Green Bay, Wisconsin 4018: Museum of the American Railroad, Dallas, Texas 4023: Kenefick Park, Omaha, Nebraska [ Current and Past Scale Model Manufactures ] Rivarossi HO and N scale Märklin and Trix HO scale http://www.maerklin.de/produkte/frontend/index.php?artikel_nr= &amp; stichwort=big+boy &amp; baureihe= &amp; spur=all &amp; gruppe=all &amp; untergruppe=all &amp; merkmale=all &amp; epoche=all &amp; anzeigen_y=1 &amp; sCountryCode=en &amp; bShowLogo=1 &amp; fromSLIMSITE= &amp; anzeigen.x=25 &amp; anzeigen.y=5 Athearn N scale Bowser Manufacturing HO scale [ References ] [ 1950-52 Locomotive Cyclopedia of American Practice C.B.
