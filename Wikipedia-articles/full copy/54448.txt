[ Medicine December 2009 ] [ Insulin resistance med 1173 Insulin+Resistance C18.452.394.968.500 ] Insulin resistance (IR) is a physiological condition where the natural hormone insulin becomes less effective at lowering blood sugars. The resulting increase in blood glucose may raise levels outside the normal range and cause adverse health effects, depending on dietary conditions. [ Insulin resistance http://www.medicinenet.com/insulin_resistance/article.htm ] Certain cell types such as fat and muscle cells require insulin to absorb glucose. When these cells fail to respond adequately to circulating insulin, blood glucose levels rise. The liver helps regulate glucose levels by reducing its secretion of glucose in the presence of insulin. This normal reduction in the liver’s glucose production may not occur in people with insulin resistance. [ http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090621143236.htm www.sciencedaily.com ] Insulin resistance in muscle and fat cells reduces glucose uptake (and also local storage of glucose as glycogen and triglycerides, respectively), whereas insulin resistance in liver cells results in reduced glycogen synthesis and storage and a failure to suppress glucose production and release into the blood. Insulin resistance normally refers to reduced glucose-lowering effects of insulin. However, other functions of insulin can also be affected. For example, insulin resistance in fat cells reduces the normal effects of insulin on lipids and results in reduced uptake of circulating lipids and increased hydrolysis of stored triglyceride s. Increased mobilization of stored lipids in these cells elevates free fatty acid s in the blood plasma. Elevated blood fatty-acid concentrations (associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus Type 2), reduced muscle glucose uptake, and increased liver glucose production all contribute to elevated blood glucose levels. High plasma levels of insulin and glucose due to insulin resistance are a major component of the metabolic syndrome. If insulin resistance exists, more insulin needs to be secreted by the pancreas. If this compensatory increase does not occur, blood glucose concentrations increase and type 2 diabetes occurs.

Fatigue. Brain fogginess and inability to focus. High blood sugar. Intestinal bloating – most intestinal gas is produced from carbohydrates in the diet, mostly those that humans cannot digest and absorb. Sleepiness, especially after meals. Weight gain, fat storage, difficulty losing weight – for most people, excess weight is from high fat storage; the fat in IR is generally stored in and around abdominal organs in both males and females. It is currently suspected that hormones produced in that fat are a precipitating cause of insulin resistance. Increased blood triglyceride levels. Increased blood pressure. Many people with hypertension are either diabetic or pre-diabetic and have elevated insulin levels due to insulin resistance. One of insulin&apos;s effects is to control arterial wall tension throughout the body. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with cardiovascular disease. Depression. Due to the deranged metabolism resulting from insulin resistance, psychological effects, including depression, are not uncommon. Acanthosis nigricans. Increased hunger. [ Associated Risk Factors ] Several associated risk factors include: [ October 2010 ] Insulin receptor mutations ( Donohue Syndrome ) LMNA mutations ( Familial Partial Lipodystrophy ) Insulin resistance may also be caused by the damage of liver cells having undergone a defect of insulin receptors in hepatocytes. { being Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian. } &gt; 40–45 years of age; obesity; your body storing fat predominantly in the abdomen, as opposed to storing it in hips and thighs. sedentary lifestyle, lack of physical exercise hypertension; high triglyceride level ( Hypertriglyceridemia ); low level of &quot; good cholesterol &quot;; pre-diabetes, your sugar levels in blood have been too high in the past, i.e. your body has previously shown slight problems with its production and usage of insulin ( &quot; previous evidence of impaired glucose homeostasis &quot; ); having developed gestational diabetes during past pregnancies; giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (a bit over 4 kilograms) [ December 2011 ] Obesity and Overweight (BMI &gt; 25); Metabolic syndrome (Hyperlipidemia + HDL cholesterol level &lt; 0.90  mmol/L or triglyceride level &gt; 2.82  mmol/L); Hypertension ( &gt; 140/90 mmHg) or arteriosclerosis; Liver pathologies; Infection ( Hepatitis C ); Haemochromatosis; Gastroparesis; Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); { Hypercortisolism (e.g., } { steroid use or } { Cushing&apos;s disease ); } [ Yasuda K, Hines E 3rd, Kitabchi AE Hypercortisolism and insulin resistance: comparative effects of prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone on insulin binding of human erythrocytes JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY &amp; AMP; METABOLISM 55 5 1982 910–915 http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/55/5/910 6749880 ] { Medication (e.g., } { glucosamine, } { rifampicin, } { isoniazid, } { olanzapine, } { risperidone, } { progestogen s, } { corticosteroid s, } { glucocorticoid s, } { methadone, many } { antiretroviral s ). } [ Causes ] [ Diet ] It is well known that insulin resistance commonly coexists with obesity. However, causal links between insulin resistance, obesity, and dietary factors are complex and controversial. It is possible that one of them arises first, and tends to cause the other; or that insulin resistance and excess body weight might arise independently as a consequence of a third factor, but end up reinforcing each other. Some population groups might be genetically predisposed to one or the other. Dietary fat has long been implicated as a driver of insulin resistance. Studies on animals observed significant insulin resistance in rats after just 3 weeks on a high-fat diet.

W. Jenkins A. B. Daley E. A. Chisholm D. J. Storlien L. H. ] Large quantities of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated (omega-6) fats all appear to be harmful to rats to some degree, compared to high-starch chow, but saturated fat appears to be the most effective at producing IR.

B. Chisholm D. J. Pascoe W. S. Khouri S. Kraegen E. W. ] This is partly caused by direct effects of a high-fat diet on blood markers, but, more significantly, ad libitum high-fat diet has the tendency to result in caloric intake that&apos;s far in excess of animals&apos; energy needs, resulting in rapid weight gain. In humans, statistical evidence is more equivocal. Being insensitive to insulin is still positively correlated with fat intake, and negatively correlated with dietary fiber intake.

The effect of dietary fat is largely or completely overridden if the high-fat diet is modified to contain nontrivial quantities (in excess of 5–10% of total fat intake) of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids.

The effect is thought to explain relatively low incidence of IR, type 2 diabetes, and obesity in polar foragers such as Alaskan Eskimos consuming their ancestral diet (which is very high in fat, but contains substantial amounts of omega-3).

Unlike their omega-6 counterparts (which can be cheaply produced from a variety of sources, such as corn and soybeans), major sources of omega-3 fatty acids remain relatively rare and expensive. Consequently, the recommended average intake of omega-3 for adult men in the United States is only 1.6  grams/day, or less than 2% of total fat; the actual average consumption of omega-3 in the United States is around 1.3  grams/day, almost all of it in the form of ALA; EPA and DHA contributed less than 0.1  grams/day.

Several recent authors suggested that the intake of simple sugars, and particularly fructose, is also a factor that contributes to insulin resistance.

F. ] Yet another proposed mechanism involves the phenomenon known as leptin resistance. Leptin is a hormone that regulates long-term energy balance in many mammals. An important role of leptin is long-term inhibition of appetite in response to formation of body fat. This mechanism is known to be disrupted in many obese individuals: even though their leptin levels are commonly elevated, this does not result in reduction of appetite and caloric intake. [ http://leptinresearch.org/pdf/rsh_leptin_resistance_and_obesity.pdf Leptin Resistance and Obesity ] Leptin resistance can be triggered in rats by ad libitum consumption of energy-dense, highly palatable foods over a period of several days.

Roncal C. Cheng K.-Y. Johnson R. J. Scarpace P. J. ] the actual consumption by humans in a typical Western diet is several times lower.) Once leptin signalling has been disrupted, the individual becomes prone to further overeating, weight gain, and insulin resistance. As elevated blood glucose levels are the primary stimulus for insulin secretion and production, habitually excessive carbohydrate intake is another likely contributor. This serves as a major motivation behind the low-carb family of diets. Furthermore, carbohydrates are not created equal (for example, the blood glucose level response to a fixed quantity of carbohydrates in baked potato es is about twice the response to the same quantity of carbohydrates in pumpernickel bread). Integrated blood glucose response to a fixed quantity of carbohydrates in a meal is known as glycemic index. Some diets are based on this concept; they assume that consumption of low-GI foods is less likely to result in insulin resistance and obesity. However, small to moderate amounts of simple sugars (i.e., sucrose, fructose, and glucose) in the typical developed-world diet seem to not have a causative effect on the development of insulin resistance.

Since insulin is the primary hormonal signal for energy storage into fat cells, which tend to retain their sensitivity in the face of hepatic and skeletal muscle resistance, IR stimulates the formation of new fatty tissue and accelerates weight gain.

Some scholars go as far as to claim that neither insulin resistance, nor obesity are really metabolic disorders per se, but simply adaptive responses to sustained caloric surplus, intended to protect bodily organs from lipotoxicity (unsafe levels of lipids in the bloodstream and tissues): &quot; Obesity should therefore not be regarded as a pathology or disease, but rather as the normal, physiologic response to sustained caloric surplus... As a consequence of the high level of lipid accumulation in insulin target tissues including skeletal muscle and liver, it has been suggested that exclusion of glucose from lipid-laden cells is a compensatory defense against further accumulation of lipogenic substrate. &quot; [ http://www.uoguelph.ca/hhns/grad/courses/HHNS6700F10WeeklyReadings/UngerandScherer.pdf Gluttony, sloth and the metabolic syndrome: a roadmap to lipotoxicity Roger H.

Consumption of fast food has been proposed as a fundamental factor behind the metabolic syndrome epidemic and all its constituents. An American study has shown that glucosamine (often prescribed for joint problems) may cause insulin resistance.

Cortisol counteracts insulin, and contributes to hyperglycemia-causing hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral utilization of glucose which eventually leads to insulin resistance.

Division New York ] [ 17426391 ] Although inflammation is often caused by cortisol, inflammation by itself also seems to be implicated in causing insulin resistance. Mice without JNK1 -signaling do not develop insulin resistance under dietary conditions that normally produce it.

As short term overdosing of insulin causes short term insulin resistance, it has been hypothesized that chronic high dosing contributes to more permanent insulin resistance. [ October 2010 ] [ Molecular ] Insulin resistance has been proposed at a molecular level to be a reaction to excess nutrition by superoxide dismutase in cell mitochondria that acts as an antioxidant defense mechanism. This link seems to exist under diverse causes of insulin resistance. It is also based on the finding that insulin resistance can be rapidly reversed by exposing cells to mitochondrial uncoupler s, electron transport chain inhibitors, or mitochondrial superoxide dismutase mimetics. [ Hoehn KL Salmon AB Hohnen-Behrens C Turner N Hoy AJ Maghzal GJ Stocker R Van Remmen H Kraegen EW Insulin resistance is a cellular antioxidant defense mechanism Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 106 42 17787–17792 2009 19805130 2764908 10.1073/pnas.0902380106 ] [ Disease ] Recent research and experimentation has uncovered a non-obesity related connection to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. It has long been observed that patients who have had some kinds of bariatric surgery have increased insulin sensitivity and even remission of Type 2 diabetes. It was discovered that diabetic / insulin resistant non obese rats whose duodenum has been surgically removed also experienced increased insulin sensitivity and remission of Type 2 diabetes. This suggested similar surgery in humans, and early reports in prominent medical journals (January 8) are that the same effect is seen in humans, at least the small number who have participated in the experimental surgical program. The speculation is that some substance is produced in that portion of the small intestine that signals body cells to become insulin resistant. If the producing tissue is removed, the signal ceases and body cells revert to normal insulin sensitivity. No such substance has been found as yet, so its existence remains speculative. [ October 2010 ] Insulin resistance has also been linked to PCOS ( p oly c ystic o vary s yndrome) as either causing it or being caused by it. Further studies are in progress. [ January 2011 ] [ HCV and Insulin Resistance ] Hepatitis C also makes people three to four times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. [ Milner KL Van Der Poorten D Trenell M Jenkins AB Xu A Smythe G Dore GJ Zekry A Weltman M Chronic hepatitis C is associated with peripheral rather than hepatic insulin resistance Gastroenterology 138 3 932–941.e3 2010 19962985 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.11.050 http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100309102519.htm Science Daily March 10, 2010 ] In addition, &quot; people with Hepatitis C who develop diabetes probably have susceptible insulin-producing cells, and would probably get it anyway -- but much later in life. The extra insulin resistance caused by Hepatitis C apparently brings on diabetes at 35 or 40, instead of 65 or 70. &quot; [ Pathophysiology ] Any food or drink containing glucose (or the digestible carbohydrates that contain it, such as sucrose, starch, etc.) causes blood glucose level s to increase. In a normal metabolism, the elevated blood glucose level makes beta (β) cells in the Islets of Langerhans, located in the pancreas, release insulin into the blood. The insulin, in turn, makes insulin-sensitive tissues in the body (primarily skeletal muscle cells, adipose tissue, and liver ) absorb glucose, and thereby lower the blood glucose level. The beta cells reduce insulin output as the blood glucose level falls, allowing blood glucose to settle at a constant of approximately 5   mmol/L (mM) (90  mg/dL). In an insulin-resistant person, normal levels of insulin do not have the same effect in controlling blood glucose levels. During the compensated phase on insulin resistance insulin levels are higher, and blood glucose levels are still maintained. If compensatory insulin secretion fails, then either fasting (impaired fasting glucose) or postprandial (impaired glucose tolerance) glucose concentrations increase. Eventually, type 2 diabetes occurs when glucose levels become higher throughout the day as the resistance increases and compensatory insulin secretion fails. The elevated insulin levels have additional effects (see insulin ) that cause further abnormal biological effects throughout the body. [ October 2010 ] The most common type of insulin resistance is associated with overweight and obesity in a condition known as metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance often progresses to full Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This is often seen when hyperglycemia develops after a meal, when pancreatic β-cells are unable to produce sufficient insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels ( euglycemia ) in the face of insulin resistance. The inability of the β-cells to produce sufficient insulin in a condition of hyperglycemia is what characterizes the transition from insulin resistance to Type 2 diabetes mellitus. [ McGarry JD Banting lecture 2001: dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism in the etiology of type 2 diabetes Diabetes 51 1 7–18 2002 11756317 10.2337/diabetes.51.1.7 ] Various disease states make body tissues more resistant to the actions of insulin. Examples include infection (mediated by the cytokine TNFα ) and acidosis. Recent research is investigating the roles of adipokine s (the cytokine s produced by adipose tissue ) in insulin resistance. Certain drugs may also be associated with insulin resistance (e.g., glucocorticoid s ). [ October 2010 ] Insulin itself leads to a kind of insulin resistance; every time a cell is exposed to insulin, the production of GLUT4 (type four glucose receptors) on the cell&apos;s membrane decreases somewhat. [ 10.1073/pnas.90.2.512 Flores-Riveros JR McLenithan JC Ezaki O Lane MD Insulin down-regulates expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) gene: effects on transcription and mRNA turnover Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 90 2 512–516 1993 8421683 45693 ] In the presence of a higher than usual level of insulin (generally caused by insulin resistance), this down-regulation acts as a kind of positive feedback, increasing the need for insulin. Exercise reverses this process in muscle tissue, [ MacLean PS Zheng D Jones JP Olson AL Dohm GL Exercise-induced transcription of the muscle glucose transporter (GLUT 4) gene Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 292 2 409–414 2002 11906177 10.1006/bbrc.2002.6654 ] but if it is left unchecked, it can contribute to insulin resistance. Elevated blood levels of glucose – regardless of cause – lead to increased glycation of protein s with changes, only a few of which are understood in any detail, in protein function throughout the body. [ Koga M, Kasayama S Clinical impact of glycated albumin as another glycemic control marker Endocrine Journal 57 9 2010 751–762 http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/endocrj/57/9/57_751/_article 20724796 10.1507/endocrj.K10E-138 ] [ Puddu A, Viviani GL Advanced glycation endproducts and diabetes. Beyond vascular complications Endocrine, Metabolic &amp; amp; Immune Disorders Drug Targets 11 2 2011 132–140 21476962 ] Insulin resistance is often found in people with visceral adiposity (i.e., a high degree of fatty tissue within the abdomen – as distinct from subcutaneous adiposity or fat between the skin and the muscle wall, especially elsewhere on the body, such as hips or thighs), hypertension, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia involving elevated triglycerides, small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles, and decreased HDL cholesterol levels. With respect to visceral adiposity, a great deal of evidence suggests two strong links with insulin resistance. First, unlike subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose cells produce significant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ), and Interleukins -1 and -6, etc. In numerous experimental models, these proinflammatory cytokines disrupt normal insulin action in fat and muscle cells, and may be a major factor in causing the whole-body insulin resistance observed in patients with visceral adiposity. Much of the attention on production of proinflammatory cytokines has focused on the IKK-beta/ NF-kappa-B pathway, a protein network that enhances transcription of inflammatory markers and mediators that can cause insulin resistance. Second, visceral adiposity is related to an accumulation of fat in the liver, a condition known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The result of NAFLD is an excessive release of free fatty acids into the bloodstream (due to increased lipolysis), and an increase in hepatic glucose production, both of which have the effect of exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance and increasing the likelihood of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. [ October 2010 ] Insulin resistance is also often associated with a hypercoagulable state (impaired fibrinolysis ) and increased inflammatory cytokine levels. [ Nagaev I, Bokarewa M, Tarkowski A, Smith U 2006 Human resistin is a systemic immune-derived proinflammatory cytokine targeting both leukocytes and adipocytes PLoS ONE 1 1 e31 10.1371/journal.pone.0000031 Valcarcel Juan 17183659 1762367 ] Insulin resistance is also occasionally found in patients who use insulin. In this case, the production of antibodies against insulin leads to lower-than-expected glucose level reductions (glycemia) after a specific dose of insulin. With the development of human insulin and analogues in the 1980s and the decline in the use of animal insulins (e.g., pork, beef), this type of insulin resistance has become less common. This form of insulin resistance is not what is being referred to in the metabolic syndrome. [ October 2010 ] Magnesium (Mg) is present in living cells and its plasma concentration is remarkably constant in healthy subjects. Plasma and intracellular Mg concentrations are tightly regulated. Among the controlling mechanisms, insulin seems to be one of the most important. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that insulin may modulate the shift of Mg from extracellular to intracellular space. Intracellular Mg concentration has also been shown to be effective in modulating insulin action (mainly oxidative glucose metabolism), offset calcium-related excitation-contraction coupling, and decrease smooth cell responsiveness to depolarizing stimuli. Poor intracellular Mg concentrations, as found in Type 2 diabetes mellitus and in hypertensive patients, may result in a defective tyrosine-kinase activity at the insulin receptor level and exaggerated intracellular calcium concentration. Both events are responsible for impairment in insulin action, and a worsening of insulin resistance in noninsulin-dependent diabetic and hypertensive patients. By contrast, in T2DM patients daily Mg administration, restoring a more appropriate intracellular Mg concentration, contributes to improve insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The benefits deriving- from daily Mg supplementation in T2DM patients are further supported by epidemiological studies showing that high daily Mg intake are predictive of a lower incidence of T2DM. [ October 2010 ] [ Diagnosis ] [ Fasting insulin levels ] A fasting serum insulin level of greater than the upper limit of normal for the assay used (approximately 60 pmol/L) is considered evidence of insulin resistance. [ October 2010 ] [ Glucose tolerance testing (GTT) ] During a glucose tolerance test, which may be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus, a fasting patient takes a 75  gram oral dose of glucose. Blood glucose levels are then measured over the following 2 hours. [ October 2010 ] Interpretation is based on WHO guidelines. After 2 hours a Glycemia less than 7.8  mmol/L (140  mg/dl) is considered normal, a glycemia of between 7.8 to 11.0  mmol/dl (140 to 197  mg/dl) is considered as Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and a glycemia of greater than or equal to 11.1  mmol/dl (200  mg/dl) is considered Diabetes Mellitus. [ October 2010 ] An OGTT [ November 2011 ] can be normal or mildly abnormal in simple insulin resistance. Often, there are raised glucose levels in the early measurements, reflecting the loss of a postprandial (after the meal) peak in insulin production. Extension of the testing (for several more hours) may reveal a hypoglycemic &quot; dip, &quot; which is a result of an overshoot in insulin production after the failure of the physiologic postprandial insulin response. [ October 2010 ] [ Measuring insulin resistance ] Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp The gold standard for investigating and quantifying insulin resistance is the &quot; hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, &quot; so-called because it measures the amount of glucose necessary to compensate for an increased insulin level without causing hypoglycemia. [ Defronzo RA Tobin JD Andres R Glucose clamp technique: a method for quantifying insulin secretion and resistance The American journal of physiology 237 3 E214–23 1979 382871 ] It is a type of glucose clamp technique. The test is rarely performed in clinical care, but is used in medical research, for example, to assess the effects of different medications. The rate of glucose infusion is commonly referred to in diabetes literature as the GINF value. [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term%3D17957034 Current approaches for assessing insulin sensitivity and resistance in vivo: advantages, limitations, and appropriate usage Muniyappa R Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 2008 17957034 10.1152/ajpendo.00645.2007 294 1 E15–E26, 1 Lee S. Chen H. Quon M. J. ] The procedure takes about 2 hours. Through a peripheral vein, insulin is infused at 10-120 mU per m 2 per minute. In order to compensate for the insulin infusion, glucose 20% is infused to maintain blood sugar levels between 5 and 5.5  mmol/l. The rate of glucose infusion is determined by checking the blood sugar levels every 5 to 10 minutes. Low-dose insulin infusions are more useful for assessing the response of the liver, whereas high-dose insulin infusions are useful for assessing peripheral (i.e., muscle and fat) insulin action. The rate of glucose infusion during the last 30 minutes of the test determines insulin sensitivity. If high levels (7.5  mg/min or higher) are required, the patient is insulin-sensitive. Very low levels (4.0  mg/min or lower) indicate that the body is resistant to insulin action. Levels between 4.0 and 7.5  mg/min are not definitive and suggest &quot; impaired glucose tolerance, &quot; an early sign of insulin resistance. This basic technique can be significantly enhanced by the use of glucose tracers. Glucose can be labeled with either stable or radioactive atoms. Commonly-used tracers are 3- 3 H glucose (radioactive), 6,6 2 H-glucose (stable) and 1- 13 C Glucose (stable). Prior to beginning the hyperinsulinemic period, a 3h tracer infusion enables one to determine the basal rate of glucose production. During the clamp, the plasma tracer concentrations enable the calculation of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, as well as the production of glucose by the body (i.e., endogenous glucose production). Modified Insulin Suppression Test Another measure of insulin resistance is the modified insulin suppression test developed by Gerald Reaven at Stanford University. The test correlates well with the euglycemic clamp with less operator-dependent error. This test has been used to advance the large body of research relating to the metabolic syndrome. Patients initially receive 25 mcg of octreotide (Sandostatin) in 5 ml of normal saline over 3 to 5 min IV as an initial bolus, and then are infused continuously with an intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0.27 μgm/m 2 /min) to suppress endogenous insulin and glucose secretion. Insulin and 20% glucose is then infused at rates of 32 and 267  mg/m 2 /min, respectively. Blood glucose is checked at zero, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and then every 10 minutes for the last half-hour of the test. These last 4 values are averaged to determine the steady-state plasma glucose level (SSPG). Subjects with an SSPG greater than 150  mg/dl are considered to be insulin-resistant. [ Alternatives ] Given the complicated nature of the &quot; clamp &quot; technique (and the potential dangers of hypoglycemia in some patients), alternatives have been sought to simplify the measurement of insulin resistance. The first was the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), and a more recent method is the Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Both employ fasting insulin and glucose levels to calculate insulin resistance, and both correlate reasonably with the results of clamping studies. Wallace et al. point out that QUICKI is the logarithm of the value from one of the HOMA equations. [ 10.2337/diacare.27.6.1487 Wallace TM Levy JC Matthews DR Use and abuse of HOMA modeling Diabetes Care 27 6 1487–1495 2004 15161807 ] [ Management ] The primary treatment for insulin resistance is exercise and weight loss. Low- glycemic load diet has also been shown to help.

By contrast, growth hormone replacement therapy may be associated with increased insulin resistance.

Exenatide has not been approved in the UK except for use in diabetics, but often improves insulin resistance in healthy individuals by the same mechanism as it does in diabetics. [ October 2010 ] The Diabetes Prevention Program showed that exercise and diet were nearly twice as effective as metformin at reducing the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes.
