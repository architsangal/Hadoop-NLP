{ Posadas } { Oaxaca, Mexico celebrating Las Posadas by breaking a traditional star-shaped Piñata. } Las Posadas is a nine-day celebration with origins in Spain, now celebrated chiefly in Mexico, Guatemala and parts of the Southwestern United States { http://www.santafedecor.com/Newsletters/Archive/SW-Luminiarias-Farolitos.htm } { http://peace.mennolink.org/articles/advadvreading.html }, beginning December 16th and ending December 24th, on evenings (about 8 or 10 PM). [ Etymology ] Posada is Spanish for &quot; lodging &quot;, or &quot; accommodation &quot;; it is said in plural because it is celebrated more than one day in that period. The nine day novena represents the nine months of pregnancy. [ History ] The procession has been a tradition in Mexico for 400 years. While its roots are in Catholicism, even Protestant Latinos follow the tradition. It may have been started in 1538 by Friar San Ignació de Loyola or Friar Pedro de Gant in Mexico.

[ Reenactment ] A street in Mexico decorated in preparation of the nightly Posada procession Typically, each family in a neighborhood will schedule a night for the Posada to be held at their home, starting on the 16th of December and finishing on the 24th. Every home has a nativity scene and the hosts of the Posada act as the innkeeper s. The neighborhood children and adults are the pilgrims (los peregrinos), who have to request lodging by going house to house singing a traditional song about the pilgrims. All the pilgrims carry small lit candles in their hands, and four people carry statuettes of Joseph leading a donkey, on which Mary is riding. The head of the procession will have a candle inside a paper lampshade. At each house, the resident responds by refusing lodging (also in song), until the weary travelers reach the designated site for the party, where Mary and Joseph are finally recognized and allowed to enter. Once the &quot; innkeepers &quot; let them in, the group of guests come into the home and kneel around the Nativity scene to pray (typically, the Rosary ). Latin American countries have continued to celebrate this holiday to this day, with very few changes to the tradition. In some places, the final location may be a church instead of a home. Individuals may actually play the various parts of Mary (María) and Joseph with the expectant mother riding a real donkey ( burro ), with attendants such as angels and shepherds acquired along the way, or the pilgrims may carry images of the holy personages instead. Children may carry poinsettias.

Sometimes it is performed right before the Misa de Gallo (Midnight Mass), or on each of the nine nights. The main difference with the original is that actors portray Mary and Joseph instead of statues, and they sing the lines requesting for accommodation. The lines of the &quot; innkeepers &quot; are also sung, but sometimes they respond without singing. Another difference is that the lyrics are not in Spanish but in one of the local languages, such as Tagalog. Nicaragua has an event, called La Gritería (The Shoutings), which happens only one day, on December 7, in honor of La Purísima Virgen (The Purest Virgin). The people go out on the street, sing to the Virgin and then visit their neighbors for food, drink and gifts. Cuba also has something similar, called Parrandas (Though it is more like a Carnaval in atmosphere). They began in the 18th centry when Father Francisco Vigil de Quiñones, the priest of the Grand Cathedral of Remedios, in order to get the people to come to midnight masses the week before Christmas had the idea to put together groups of children and provide them with jars, plates and spoons so they could run around the village making noise and singing verses. The idea persisted over the years and with time it gain complexity ending in the street party that has remained till these days.
