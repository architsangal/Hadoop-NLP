Although nearby Colorado Springs is sometimes called &quot; the Springs &quot;, some residents of Manitou or of westside Colorado Springs refer to both cities together as &quot; the Springs &quot;. The main road through the center of town was one of the direct paths to Pikes Peak, which is visible from Manitou Springs. The downtown area continues to be of interest to travelers, particularly in the summer, as the downtown area consists of many one-story, adjoining, small shops, restaurants, and pubs, as well as a creekside city park with a children&apos;s playground made from unusual materials. Among other services, shops cater to tourist interests such as clothing, candy, souvenirs, and outdoor recreation. [ History ] [ February 2011 ] Manitou Springs derives its name from two dozen mineral spring s situated throughout the area, many of which have drinking spigots for the public. The minerals present at each location change the flavor of the local water. Originally known as Manitou, the town tried to change the name to Manitou Springs in 1885, but the proper paperwork was not filed. In early 1935 the voters officially approved the name change to Manitou Springs, and the change was endorsed by the Colorado Secretary of State later that same year. In the early 1900s, the town became known as a health destination for people suffering from tuberculosis. The clean mountain air and mineral springs waters were part of a healthy retreat for people arriving by rail from across the country. In the 1970s, Woodland Park, [ 19 mi km ] up Ute Pass, built a sewage treatment plant on top of the fault line that forms the pass. As a result, many of the springs were made undrinkable during the bulk of the 1980s, but this has since largely been corrected. Since the recent 2008 construction, Manitou has new springs to offer.
