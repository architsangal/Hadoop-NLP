[ the AOL publishing language Rainman ] [ 1988 12 16 ] { 133 minutes } { English Italian } { $25 million } { $412,800,000 } Rain Man is a 1988 drama film written by Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass and directed by Barry Levinson. It tells the story of an abrasive and selfish yuppie, Charlie Babbitt, who discovers that his estranged father has died and bequeathed all of his multimillion-dollar estate to his other son, Raymond, an autistic savant of whose existence Charlie was unaware. The film stars Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt, Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbitt and Valeria Golino as Charlie&apos;s girlfriend, Susanna. Morrow created the character of Raymond after meeting Kim Peek, a real-life savant; his characterization was based on both Peek and Bill Sackter, a good friend of Morrow who was the subject of Bill, an earlier film that Morrow wrote. { Barry Morrow&apos;s } { audio commentary for Rain Man from the DVD release. } Rain Man received overwhelmingly positive reviews at the time of its release, praising Hoffman&apos;s role and the wit and sophistication of the screenplay. The film won four Oscars at the 61st Academy Awards (March 1989), including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Actor in a leading role for Hoffman. Its crew received an additional four nominations. [ 0095953 ] The film also won the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.

Charlie travels to Cincinnati, Ohio, to settle the estate, where he learns an undisclosed trustee is inheriting $3 million on behalf of an unnamed beneficiary, while all he is to receive is a classic Buick Roadmaster convertible and several prize rose bushes. Eventually he learns the money is being directed to a mental institution, which is the home of his autistic brother, Raymond ( Dustin Hoffman ), of whose existence Charlie was previously unaware. This leads Charlie to ask the question that permeates the movie: &quot; Why didn&apos;t somebody tell me I had a brother? &quot; Although Raymond has autism, he also has superb recall, albeit usually with little understanding of the subject matter, but has no skill in mathematics (in those scenes he merely remembers the answers, and with no understanding of currency.) He is said to be a savant by some doctors. He is frightened by change and adheres to strict routines (for example, his continual repetition of the &quot; Who&apos;s on First? &quot; sketch). Except when he is in distress, he shows little emotional expression and avoids eye contact. Numbed by learning that he has a brother and determined to get what he believes is his fair share of the Babbitt estate, Charlie takes Raymond on what becomes a cross-country car trip (due to Raymond&apos;s fear of flying) back to Los Angeles to meet with his attorneys. Charlie intends to start a custody battle in order to get Raymond&apos;s doctor, Dr. Gerald R. Bruner ( Jerry Molen ), to settle out of court for half of Sanford Babbitt&apos;s estate so that the mental institution can maintain custody of Raymond. Susanna, disgusted by Charlie&apos;s self-centeredness and his attempts at using his brother as a pawn to gain the money, leaves Charlie in Cincinnati and disappears. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns about Raymond&apos;s autism, which he initially believes is curable — resulting in his frequent frustration with his brother&apos;s antics. He also learns about how his brother came to be separated from his family, as a result of an accident when he was left alone with Charlie when Charlie was a baby. Raymond also sings &quot; I Saw Her Standing There &quot; by The Beatles like he did when Charlie was young, prompting Charlie to realize that Raymond is the protective figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named &quot; Rain Man. &quot; Charlie proves to be sometimes shallow and exploitative, as when he learns that Raymond has an excellent memory and takes him to Las Vegas to win money at blackjack by counting cards. However, towards the end of their trip Charlie finds himself becoming protective of Raymond, and grows to love him truly. Charlie finally meets with his attorney to try to get his share of his inheritance, but then decides that he no longer cares about the money and really just wants to have custody of his brother. However, at a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist and Dr. Bruner, Raymond is unable to decide exactly what he wants. Eventually, the psychiatrist presses Raymond to make the decision, upsetting him and leading Charlie to request that the doctor back off. Raymond is allowed to go back home to Cincinnati. Charlie, who has gained a new brother and mellowed considerably, promises Raymond as he boards an Amtrak train that he will visit in two weeks. [ Production ] { general store in } { Cogar, Oklahoma was used in a scene from the film. } Roger Birnbaum was the first studio executive to give the film a green-light; he did so immediately after Barry Morrow pitched the story. Birnbaum received &quot; special thanks &quot; in the film&apos;s credits. Agents at CAA sent the script to Hoffman and Bill Murray, envisioning Murray in the title role and Hoffman in the role eventually portrayed by Cruise. Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg, and Sydney Pollack were directors also involved in the film. { Bass&apos; audio commentary for Rain Man from the DVD release. } Principal photography included nine weeks of filming on location. { Rain Man, Variety, December 14, 1988 } Almost all of the principal photography occurred during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike; one key scene that was affected by the lack of writers was the film&apos;s final scene. Bass delivered his last rough cut of the script only hours before the strike started and spent no time on the set. [ Release ] [ Critical reception ] Rain Man was overall positively received by critics. It garnered an 87% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 7.7/10. [ Rain Man (1988) http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rain_man/ Rotten Tomatoes July 4, 2010 ] Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Rain Man a &quot; becomingly modest, decently thought-out, sometimes funny film &quot;; Hoffman&apos;s performance was a &quot; display of sustained virtuosity... [which] makes no lasting connections with the emotions. Its end effect depends largely on one&apos;s susceptibility to the sight of an actor acting nonstop and extremely well, but to no particularly urgent dramatic purpose. &quot; { December 1988 review from &apos;&apos;The New York Times&apos;&apos; } Canby considered the &quot; film&apos;s true central character &quot; to be &quot; the confused, economically and emotionally desperate Charlie, beautifully played by Mr. Cruise. &quot; Amy Dawes of Variety wrote that &quot; one of the year&apos;s most intriguing film premises... is given uneven, slightly off-target treatment &quot;; she calls the road scenes &quot; hastily, loosely written, with much extraneous screen time, &quot; but admired the last third of the film, calling it a depiction of &quot; two very isolated beings &quot; who &quot; discover a common history and deep attachment. &quot; One of the film&apos;s harshest reviews came from New Yorker magazine critic Pauline Kael : &quot; Everything in this movie is fudged ever so humanistically, in a perfunctory, low-pressure way. And the picture has its effectiveness: people are crying at it. Of course they&apos;re crying at it — it&apos;s a piece of wet kitsch. &quot; { Kael, Pauline. } [ rain-man/critic-reviews ] {, } { The New Yorker (Feb. 1989) } [ Commercial performance ] Rain Man debuted on December 16, 1988, and was the second on the weekend&apos;s box office receipts (behind Twins ), with $7 million.

While it is true that the company has neither lost a jet airliner nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63 people. To this date, the last fatal accident suffered by Qantas was in 1951. The scene in which Raymond reels off a list of statistics of fatal airline crashes was cut by most airlines when showing the film in-flight--except for Qantas, which even promoted one of the movie&apos;s writers to first class when he traveled on their airline.
