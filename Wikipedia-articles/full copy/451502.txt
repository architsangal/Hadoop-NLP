It was drilling an exploration well in the Grand Banks area, [ 267 km ] east of St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland, for Mobil Oil of Canada, Ltd. (MOCAN) with 84 crew members on board when it sank. There were no survivors of the accident. [ History and design ] Ocean Ranger was designed and owned by Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company, Inc. (ODECO) of New Orleans. The vessel was a self-propelled large semi-submersible design with a drilling facility and living quarters. It was capable of operation beneath [ 1500 ft ] of ocean water and could drill to a maximum depth of [ 25000 ft ]. It was described by ODECO as the world&apos;s largest semi-submersible oil rig to date.

It had twelve [ 45000 lb on ] anchors.

It was floating on two [ 122 m ft on ] long pontoons that rested [ 24 m ft ] below the surface. [ CBC News The Storm http://archives.cbc.ca/environment/extreme_weather/topics/349/ Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 2002-02-25 2010-07-25 ] The vessel was approved for &apos;unrestricted ocean operations&apos; and designed to withstand extremely harsh conditions at sea, including [ 100 kn km/h on ] winds and [ 110 ft 0 on ] waves. Prior to moving to the Grand Banks area in November 1980, it had operated off the coasts of Alaska, New Jersey and Ireland. The joint Federal-Provincial Royal Commission on the Ocean Ranger Marine Disaster found that the crew were not trained, the safety equipment was inadequate, there were no safety protocols for the supply ship, and that the rig itself had a number of design flaws. [ Sinking ] On 26 November 1981, Ocean Ranger commenced drilling well J-34, its third well in the Hibernia Oil Field. Ocean Ranger was still working on this well in February 1982 when the incident occurred. Two other semi-submersible rigs were also drilling nearby: the Sedco 706, [ 8.5 mi km ] NNE, and the Zapata Ugland, [ 19.2 mi km ] N of Ocean Ranger. On 14 February 1982, the rigs received reports of an approaching storm linked to a major Atlantic cyclone from NORDCO Ltd, the company responsible for issuing offshore weather forecasts. The usual method of preparing for bad weather involved hanging-off the drillpipe at the sub-sea wellhead and disconnecting the riser from the sub-sea blowout preventer. Due to surface difficulties and the speed at which the storm developed, the crew of Ocean Ranger were forced to shear the drillpipe after hanging-off, after which they disconnected the riser in the early evening. At about 1900 hours local time, the nearby Sedco 706 experienced a large rogue wave which damaged some items on deck and caused the loss of a life raft. Soon after, radio transmissions were heard from Ocean Ranger, describing a broken portlight (a porthole window) and water in the ballast control room, with discussions on how best to repair the damage. Ocean Ranger reported experiencing storm seas of [ 55 ft m ], with the odd wave up to [ 65 ft m ], thus leaving the unprotected portlight at [ 28 ft m ] above mean sea level vulnerable to wave damage. Some time after 2100 hours, radio conversations originating on Ocean Ranger were heard on the Sedco 706 and Zapata Ugland, noting that valves on Ocean Ranger&apos;s ballast control panel appeared to be opening and closing of their own accord. The radio conversations also discussed the [ 100 kn km/h on ] winds and waves up to [ 65 ft m ] high. Through the remainder of the evening, routine radio traffic passed between Ocean Ranger, its neighbouring rigs and their individual support boats. Nothing out of the ordinary was noted. At 0052 hours local time, on 15 February, a Mayday call was sent out from Ocean Ranger, noting a severe list to the port side of the rig and requesting immediate assistance. This was the first communication from Ocean Ranger identifying a major problem. The standby vessel, the M/V Seaforth Highlander, was requested to come in close as countermeasures against the 10—15 degree list were proving ineffective. The onshore MOCAN supervisor was notified of the situation, and the Canadian Forces and Mobil-operated helicopters were alerted just after 0100 hours local time. The M/V Boltentor and the M/V Nordertor, the standby boats of the Sedco 706 and the Zapata Ugland respectively, were also dispatched to Ocean Ranger to provide assistance. At 0130 hours local time, Ocean Ranger transmitted its last message: &quot; There will be no further radio communications from Ocean Ranger. We are going to lifeboat stations. &quot; Shortly thereafter, in the middle of the night and in the midst of severe winter weather, the crew abandoned the rig. The rig remained afloat for another ninety minutes, sinking between 0307 and 0313 hours local time. All of Ocean Ranger sank beneath the Atlantic: by the next morning all that remained was a few buoys. Her entire complement of 84 workers – 46 Mobil employees and 38 contractors from various service companies – drowned with her. [ Hope Fades For 84 On Rig Giniger, Henry The New York Times 17 February 1982 http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/17/world/hope-fades-for-84-on-rig-18-on-soviet-freighter-die.html?scp%3D9%26amp%3Bsq%3Docean%20ranger%26amp%3Bst%3Dcse 9 May 2011 ] Whilst the rig was provided with an Emergency Procedures Manual which detailed evacuation procedures, it is unclear how effectively the rig evacuation was carried out. There is evidence that at least one lifeboat was successfully launched with up to 36 crew inside, and witnesses on the M/V Seaforth Highlander reported seeing at least 20 crew members in the water at the same time, indicating that at least 56 crew successfully evacuated the rig. [ April 2010 ] The United States Coast Guard report speculated that &apos;these men either chose to enter the water directly or were thrown into the water as a result of unsuccessful lifesaving equipment launching&apos;. Rescue attempts by the standby vessels were hampered by the adverse weather conditions and the conclusion that the standby boats were neither equipped nor configured to rescue casualties from a cold sea. As a result of the severe weather, the first helicopter did not arrive on scene until 0230 hours local time, by which time most if not all of Ocean Ranger&apos;s crew had succumbed to hypothermia and drowned. Over the next week, 22 bodies were recovered from the North Atlantic. Autopsies indicated that those men had died as a result of drowning while in a hypothermic state. In related activity the following day, the container ship Mekhanik Tarasov was struck by the same weather conditions as Ocean Ranger, approximately sixty-five miles to the east. The battered Soviet freighter listed dramatically for hours before sinking with a heavy loss of life.

The rig had capsized bow-first, turning over and striking the sea floor with the forward ends of the rig&apos;s pontoons. The United States Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation report on the disaster summarised the chain of events as follows: A large wave appeared to cause a broken portlight; The broken portlight allowed the ingress of sea water into the ballast control room; The ballast control panel malfunctioned or appeared to malfunction to the crew; As a result of this malfunction or perceived malfunction, several valves in the rig&apos;s ballast control system opened due to a short-circuit, or were manually opened by the crew; Ocean Ranger assumed a forward list; As a result of the forward list, boarding seas began flooding the forward chain lockers located in the forward corner support columns; The forward list worsened; The pumping of the forward tanks was not possible using the usual ballast control method as the magnitude of the forward list created a vertical distance between the forward tanks and the ballast pumps located astern that exceeded the suction available on the ballast system&apos;s pumps; Detailed instructions and personnel trained in the use of the ballast control panel were not available; At some point, the crew blindly attempted to manually operate the ballast control panel using brass control rods; At some point, the manually operated sea valves in both pontoons were closed; Progressive flooding of the chain lockers and subsequent flooding of the upper deck resulted in a loss of buoyancy great enough to cause the rig to capsize. A Canadian Royal Commission spent two years looking into the disaster. The commission concluded that Ocean Ranger had design and construction flaws, particularly in the ballast control room, and that the crew lacked proper safety training, survival suit s and equipment. The Canadian Royal Commission also concluded that inspection and regulation by United States and Canadian government agencies was ineffective. In addition to key recommendations for Canada &apos;s offshore oil and gas industry, the commission recommended that the federal government invest annually in research and development for search and rescue technologies, such as improving the design of lifesaving equipment—a commitment that has been met in every fiscal year since 1982.
