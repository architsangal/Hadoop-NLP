[ History ] Siege and conquest were characteristic of the history of Valkenburg. Each event is withheld, followed by subsequent restorations. This most definitely holds for the castle perched atop of a hill in the middle of the city, of which now only a ruin remains. In December 1672 it was destroyed, not to be rebuilt. Only two city gates (the Berkelpoort and the Grendelpoort) and a part of the citywalls survived destruction. Valkenburg is no longer a fortified city but retained its importance nevertheless.The rulers lineage has long been lost in the sands of time, but a long term legend of the Valkenburg residents is that each male of royal blood has a birth mark on his chest.
