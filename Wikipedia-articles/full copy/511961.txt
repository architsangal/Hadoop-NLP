The Portuguese alphabet, [ 2009 yes ], consists of the following 23 or 26 Latin letters : Note: [ http://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Cultura/Interior.aspx?content_id%3D1124835 Ministro da Cultura quer Acordo vigorando antes de janeiro de 2010 Minister of Culture wants Agreement enforced before January 2010 Portuguese Sapo Portugal ] Letters K, W and Y were included in the alphabet used in Brazil, East Timor, Macau, Portugal and five countries in Africa when the 1990 Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement went into legal effect, since January 1, 2009.. In Brazil, the Orthographic Agreement went into legal effect since January 1, 2009. However, they were used before 1911 (see the article on spelling reform in Portugal ). Majuscule Forms (also called uppercase or capital letters) A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Minuscule Forms (also called lowercase or small letters) a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z In addition, the following characters with diacritic s are used: Á á, Â â, Ã ã, À à, Ç ç, É é, Ê ê, Í í, Ó ó, Ô ô, Õ õ, Ú ú. These are not, however, treated as independent letters in collation, nor do they have entries of their own in Portuguese dictionaries. When two words differ only in the presence or absence of a diacritic, the one without it is collated first. The trema on Ü was used in Brazilian Portuguese up to December 31, 2008. With the 1990 Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement going into effect in Brazil on January 1, 2009, the diaeresis may only appear in borrowed words, in personal names, and in words derived from them. [ Letter names and pronunciations ] Only the most frequent sounds are given below, since a listing of all cases and exceptions would be too cumbersome. Portuguese is a pluricentric language, and the pronunciation of some of the letters is different in European Portuguese (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP). Apart from these variations, the pronunciation of most consonants is fairly straightforward, and similar to French or Catalan pronunciation. Only the consonants r, s, x, z, the digraphs ch, lh, nh, rr, and the vowels may require special attention from English speakers. Although many letters have more than one pronunciation, their phonetic value is often predictable from their position within a word; this is normally the case for the consonants (except x). Since only five letters are available to write the fourteen vowel sounds of Portuguese, the orthography of the vowels is more complex, but even in this case pronunciation is predictable to a degree. Knowing the main inflectional paradigms of Portuguese can be helpful in this regard. In the following table and in the remainder of this article, the phrase &quot; at the end of a syllable &quot; can be understood as &quot; before a consonant, or at the end of a word &quot;. For the letter r, &quot; at the start of a syllable &quot; means &quot; at the beginning of a word, or after l, n, s &quot;. For letters with more than one common pronunciation, their most common phonetic values of are given on the left side of the semicolon; sounds to the right of it occur only in a limited number of positions within a word. Sounds separated by &quot; ~ &quot; are allophone s or dialect al variants. The names of the letters are masculine.

Allophonically affricated before the sound (spelled i, or sometimes e), in BP. May become an approximant, when unstressed before another vowel. Silent at the start or at the end of a word. Also part of the digraphs ch, lh, nh. See below. Not part of the official alphabet. Used only in foreign words, personal name s, and hybrid words derived from them. Vocalized to at the end of syllables, in BP. Usually silent or voiceless at the end of syllables (word-final n is fully pronounced by some speakers in a few learned words ). See also the section on Nasalization, below. At the start of syllables (in all dialects) or at the end of syllables (in some dialects of BP), a single r is pronounced (see the notes on the Consonants below, for variants of this sound). Elsewhere, it is pronounced. Word final rhotics may also be silent when the last syllables is stressed, in casual speech, especially in Brazil (states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro ) and some African countries. A single s is pronounced voiced between vowels. [ Alternative names ] Alternative name for w in Portugal: duplo vê. Alternative names for y: ípsilo or i grego in Brazil and Portugal; ipsilão or ipsilone in Brazil. [ Consonants ] [ /ʁ/ ] [ [r] ] [ [χ] ] [ [h] ] The phoneme transcribed here as has various dialectal variants, of which the main are the alveolar trill in Portugal and Africa, and the voiceless uvular fricative or the voiceless glottal fricative, in Brazil. For further information, see Guttural &apos;&apos;r&apos;&apos;: Portuguese. [ /s/ ] [ /z/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] [ /ʒ/ ] [ /s/ ] [ /z/ ] [ /ˈistu/ ] [ /ˈmezmu/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] [ /ʒ/ ] [ /ˈiʃtu/ ] [ /ˈmeʒmu/ ] The opposition between the four sibilants,,, is neutralized at the end of syllables. In that position, they are alveolar in most of Brazil: occurs before voiceless consonant s or at the end of an utterance, while occurs before voiced consonants: e.g. isto, mesmo. (This is like in English.) In most of Portugal, and in Rio de Janeiro and some northeastern states of Brazil, syllable-final sibilants are postalveolar: the voiceless postalveolar fricative occurs before a voiceless consonant or at the end of an utterance, while the voiced postalveolar fricative occurs before a voiced consonant: isto, mesmo. [ /ʃ/ ] [ /ks/ ] [ /z/ ] [ /s/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] The traditional pronunciation of the letter x between vowels is, but in loanwords from Latin or Greek it may represent other sounds: (the most common), (in words that begin with ex- or hex- followed by a vowel, and in compounds made from such words), or (in a very small number of words, such as trouxe and próximo). It is always pronounced at the beginning of words and after consonants. [ Diacritics and basic digraphs ] Portuguese makes use of six diacritic s to expand the Latin alphabet, one of which is the cedilla, placed below the letter c to indicate that it is pronounced [ /s/ ] before the vowels a, o, or u, because of a historical palatalization. Digraphs are pairs of letters which represent a single sound, different from the sum of their components. Neither letters with diacritics nor digraphs are included in the alphabet. They are always pronounced the same way. [ s ] [ ʃ ] [ ʎ ] [ ɲ ] [ ʁ ] [ s ] [ /ʁ/ ] Grapheme Pronunciation ç ch lh nh rr ss The digraph ch is pronounced as an English sh. The digraphs lh and nh, of Occitan origin, denote palatal consonant s which do not exist in English, but can be approximated by li, ni in words such as million, onion, pronounced quickly. The digraphs rr and ss are only used between vowels. The pronunciation of the digraph rr varies with dialect (see the note on the phoneme, above). [ Silent letters ] As in other languages of western Europe, the letter u is normally silent in the graphemes gu and qu, when it comes before a front vowel : [ /ɡ/ ] [ /ɡu/ ] [ /k/ ] [ /ku/ ] gu is pronounced before e or i, and elsewhere; qu is pronounced before e or i, and elsewhere. There are, however, a few such words in which the vowel u is pronounced. These exceptions used to be indicated with a trema (güe, güi, qüe, qüi) in the Brazilian spelling, but not in the European orthography. Most of them were learned latinism s, such as freqüência/frequência &quot; frequency &quot;, argüição/arguição &quot; questioning &quot;, qüinqüelíngüe/quinquelingue &quot; in five languages &quot; (conjectured to be the Portuguese word with the most diacritics). As part of the Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement (celebrated in 1990 in Lisbon, Portugal), the trema was retired and removed from every vernacular word in BP spelling and only retained for personal names, borrowings or derivations from borrowings. The graphemes sç and xs are pronounced as one sound [ /s/ ] in BP, but as two sounds [ /ʃs/ ] in standard EP (often reduced to [ /ʃ/ ] in casual speech). In BP, the letter pairs sc and xc are also pronounced [ /s/ ] before e or i. In standard EP, they are pronounced [ /ʃs/ ]. [ Vowels ] The vowels in the pairs [ /a, ɐ/ ], [ /e, ɛ/ ], [ /o, ɔ/ ] only contrast in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, each element of the pair occurs in complementary distribution with the other. Stressed [ /ɐ/ ] appears mostly before the nasal consonants m, n, nh, followed by a vowel, and stressed [ /a/ ] elsewhere, although they have a limited number of minimal pair s in EP. [ Diacritics ] The pronunciation of the accented vowels is fairly stable, except that they become nasal in certain conditions. (See the section on Nasalization, for further information about this regular phenomenon.) In other cases, nasal vowel s are marked with a tilde. [ a ] [ ɐ ] [ ɐ̃ ] [ a ] [ ɛ ] [ e ] [ ɐ ] [ i ] [ i ] [ ɔ ] [ o ] [ õ ] [ u ] Grapheme Pronunciation á â ã à é ê, í ó ô õ ú ===Diphthongs=== The pronunciation of each diphthong is also fairly predictable, but one must know how to distinguish true diphthongs from adjacent vowels in hiatus, which belong to separate syllables. For example, in the word saio [ /ˈsai̯u/ ], the i forms a diphthong with the previous vowel, but in saiu, [ /saˈiu̯/ ] or [ /sɐˈiu̯/ ], it forms a diphthong with the next vowel. As in Spanish, a hiatus may be indicated with an acute accent, distinguishing homographs such as saia [ /ˈsai̯ɐ/ ] and saía, [ /saˈiɐ/ ] or [ /sɐˈiɐ/ ]. [ /ai ~ ɐi/ ] [ /au/ ] [ /ei ~ e ~ ɐi/ ] [ /eu/ ] [ /ɛi ~ ɐi/ ] [ /ɛu/ ] [ /oi/ ] [ /ou ~ o/ ] [ /ɔi/ ] [ /ɔu/ ] [ /ui/ ] [ /iu/ ] [ /ɐ̃ĩ/ ] [ /ɐ̃ũ/ ] [ /õĩ/ ] 1 When followed by a vowel before the stressed syllable, in central Portugal. 2 In central Portugal. Oral Grapheme Pronunciation Grapheme Pronunciation ai, ái 1 au, áu ei, êi 2 eu, êu éi 2 éu oi ou ói óu ui iu Nasal Grapheme Pronunciation Grapheme Pronunciation ãe, ãi ão õe - [ Nasalization ] When a syllable ends with m or n, this consonant is not fully pronounced, but merely indicates the nasalization of the vowel which precedes it. At the end of words, this sometimes produces a nasal diphthong. [ /ɐ̃/ ] [ /ɐ̃ũ/ ] [ /ẽ/ ] [ /ɐ̃ĩ ~ ẽĩ/ ] [ /ĩ/ ] [ /õ/ ] [ /ɐ̃ĩ ~ ẽĩ/ ] [ /ũ/ ] 1 at the end of a syllable 2 at the end of a word 3 at the end of a syllable or word 4 before final s, for example in the words bens and parabéns Monophthongs Diphthongs Grapheme Pronunciation Grapheme Pronunciation -an, -am, -ân, -âm 1 -am 2 -en, -em, -ên, -êm 1 -em, -ém 2 -in, -im, -ín, -ím 3 -en-, -én- 4 -on, -om, -ôn, -ôm 3 -êm 2 -un, -um, -ún, -úm 3 The grapheme -en- is also pronounced as a nasal diphthong in a few compound words, such as bendito (bem + dito), homenzinho (homem + zinho), and Benfica. [ Personal names ] The use of diacritics in personal names is generally restricted to the letter-diacritic combinations above, and often also by the applicable Portuguese spelling rules. Portugal is more restrictive than Brazil in what concerns given names. They must be either Portuguese or adapted to the Portuguese orthography and sound, and should also be easily discerned as either a masculine or feminine name by a Portuguese speaker. There are lists of previously accepted names, and names not included therein must be subject to consultation of the national director of registries. { Portal do Cidadão (Portuguese) } Brazilian birth registrars, on the other hand, are likely to accept names containing any (Latin) letters or diacritics, limited only to the availability of such characters in their typesetting facility. [ Keyboard layout ] Keyboard layout for Portuguese (Portugal) Keyboard layout for Portuguese (Brazil) There are two QWERTY -based keyboard layout s used for Portuguese. Additionally, there are two variants of the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard designed for Brazilian Portuguese [ September 2011 ]. Typewriters in Portuguese-speaking countries generally have a separate extra key for Ç, and a dead key for each diacritic except the cedilla; so that Á is obtained by typing first the acute accent, then the letter A. The same thing happens with computer keyboards, except when using an &quot; English – International &quot; keyboard layout, where to type Ç one should first type the acute accent and then the letter C. The Brazilian keyboards are specified in the ABNT NBR 10346 variant 2 (alphanumeric) and NBR 10347 (numeric portion) standards.
