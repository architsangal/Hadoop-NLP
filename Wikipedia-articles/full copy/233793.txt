The outer two are traditional inline tube slides while the centre three are body speed slides. } A water slide (also referred to as flumes, water chutes, or hydroslides [ December 2010 ] ) is a type of slide designed for warm-weather or indoor recreational use at water park s. Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size. Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide, or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide. A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually at the top and the bottom of the slide to monitor so that if someone gets hurt they will be treated immediately. [ Traditional water slides ] A simple body slide. { Gold Coast, } { Australia. } [ Body slides ] As the name suggests, body slides feature no mat and require the person to sit directly on the surface of the slide. There are a variety of types of body slides including simple flumes, speed slides, bowls and AquaLoops - the latter three are explained below. [ Inline tube slides ] Some slides are designed to be ridden with a tube which typically seats between 2 and 3 riders inline. Similar to a traditional body slide, these slides include many twists and turns and come in a variety of types including bowls, funnels and half-pipes. [ 21st Century water slides ] [ AquaLoop ] [ AquaLoop ] The first known existence of a looping water slide was at Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey in the mid-1980s.

They are typically made of a thick strong PVC or vinyl and nylon, and are inflated using an electric or gasoline powered blower.

There are small sized inflatable water slides for private house uses or larger inflatable water slides for school, picnic, corporate, or carnival style use. There are also swimming pool water slides which users can set up to slide straight into a pool.
