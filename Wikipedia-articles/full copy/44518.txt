[ February 2009 Ossip Zadkine ] Orpheus (1956) { Rotterdam during renovation in 2005 } [ Ossip Zadkine ] Ossip Zadkine ( [ Осип Цадкин ]; July 14, 1890 – November 25, 1967) was a Belarusian-born artist who lived in France. He is primarily known as a sculptor, but also produced painting s and lithographs. [ Early years and career ] Zadkine was born as Yossel Aronovich Tsadkin ( [ Иосель Аронович Цадкин ] ) { Aleksandr Lisov &quot; Zadkine and Vitebsk &quot; : Archival materials reported in this article state that Iosel-Shmuila Aronovich Tsadkin, born on January 28, 1888 (sic!), was of Jewish faith and studied in the Vitebsk City Technical School between 1900 and 1904, including two years in one class with would-be artists Marc Chagall (then Movsha Shagal) and Victor Mekler (then Avigdor Mekler). Thus, his father did not convert to the Russian Orthodox religion and information about his mother&apos;s Scottish extraction becomes dubious. } { L. Khmelnitskaya &apos;Marc Chagall&apos;s Circle in Vitebsk&apos; } in Vitebsk (now Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire ). His father was Jew ish and had converted to the Russian Orthodox religion; his mother was of Scottish ancestry. { http://www.artfact.com/artist/zadkine-ossip-8msm3kxqfu } After attending art school in London, Zadkine settled in Paris about 1910. There he became part of the new Cubist movement (1914-1925). He later developed his own style, one that was strongly influenced by African art. Zadkine served as a stretcher-bearer in the French Army during World War I, and was wounded in action. He spent the World War II years in America. His best-known work is probably the sculpture &quot; The Destroyed City &quot; (1951-1953), represents a man without a heart, a memorial to the destruction of the center of the Dutch city Rotterdam in 1940 by the German Luftwaffe.

It stands opposite a 12th century church that is itself of interest. Zadkine lived in Arques for a number of years, and while there, carved an enormous and powerful Christ on the Cross and Pieta that are featured in the church. The 12th century church and the 20th century cubist-influenced sculptures exist in dramatic and surprising harmony.
