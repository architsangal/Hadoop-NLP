[ December 14, 2006 http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp ZIP Code Lookup JavaScript / HTML United States Postal Service December 14, 2006 ] [ Geography ] Indian Hills is located at [ 39 37 53 N 105 15 39 W type:city ] (39.631254, -105.260712) [ 1 ]. The community extends along the Parmalee Gulch and Myers Gulch Roads between Colorado State Highway 74 at Kittredge, Colorado, and U.S. Route 285 at Turkey Creek. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of [ 4.7 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ History ] John D. Parmalee (1813–1885) came to Colorado in 1860 and settled in Mount Vernon. In 1866, he was granted a charter for a toll road between Morrison and Bradford Junction (Conifer); the Denver and Turkey Creek Toll Road opened in 1870. Parmalee also operated sawmills and shingle mills in the area. He was later commissioned to build a road from Turkey Creek to Bergen Park, along what is known as Parmalee Gulch.

Eden (1848–1932), who became tollgate keeper from 1877 to 1883. In 1886, Eden sold the road to Jefferson County. Eden bought properties in the northern end of Parmalee Gulch, which became known as Eden Park. In time he acquired more than [ 1000 acre km2 ], attracting the interest of developers. With the Panic of 1893 and crash in silver prices, the development foundered and Eden recovered the property. He continued to farm the area, raising cattle, horses, hay, and potatoes. George W. Olinger (1882–1954), [ http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page%3Dgr%26amp%3BGRid%3D37937383 George Washington Olinger Find a Grave 2011-10-29 ] son of mortuary founders John and Emma Olinger, became interested in the area in 1918, and purchased the Eden property in 1921. Olinger planned a development to be called &quot; Indian Hills, &quot; and built a golf course on part of Eden&apos;s land. The first filing was recorded at Jefferson County in June 1923, making Indian Hills the community&apos;s official name. Filings were named to recall the association with original inhabitants: Arrowhead Park, Ute &amp; Cherokee Village, and Shawnee Village. &quot; Eden Park &quot; became the fifth filing of Olinger&apos;s development, and was platted in 1926. Models of summer cabins were built of logs, and small lots were sold to Denver residents seeking summer homes in the mountains.
