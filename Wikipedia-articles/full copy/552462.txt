In 2007 &apos;A&apos; reunited for a one-off gig, and have been touring sporadically ever since, most recently with Bowling for Soup, on their October 2010 UK tour. [ History ] The band known as &apos;A&apos; formed in Suffolk, England in the late 80s, as &apos;Grand Designs&apos;. The band was founded by twins, Jason and Adam Perry, and their friend Mark Chapman, with bassist Stevie Swindon, and the twins&apos; younger brother Giles Perry joining in the early 90s. The members cited their influences as: Rush, The Beach Boys, Van Halen and the Beastie Boys. [ How Ace Are Buildings and A vs. Monkey Kong ] After changing their name to &apos;A&apos; in 1993, and abandoning their early progressive rock -inspired sound for a more punk rock style, they signed a European recording contract with British ( Warner Bros. Records ) in 1996 and released their debut LP How Ace Are Buildings in 1997. Also in 1997, the band briefly appeared in the music video for &quot; Anthem &quot; by The Wildhearts. The band found a healthy underground reception and even had a couple of low-charting singles in the UK. After the mild success brought to the band by How Ace Are Buildings, bassist Stevie Swindon decided to quit the band. He was replaced by bassist and future BBC Radio 1 Rock Show DJ Daniel P Carter. A licensing agreement for the American music market was reached with the North Carolina -based Mammoth Records. Future releases would be distributed in the U.S. and Canada by Mammoth. A second album &apos;A&apos; Vs. Monkey Kong followed in 1999. The band then toured the world and enjoyed a small degree of success worldwide, especially in Germany. They released a live album, Exit Stage Right in 2000. [ Hi-Fi Serious and commercial success ] Hi-Fi Serious was their third album, released in 2002. It was preceded by their biggest single to date, &quot; Nothing &quot;, which saw the band reach the UK top ten for the first time, hitting number 9, and the further top 20 hit &quot; Starbucks &quot;, named after the coffee chain. The release of the album was highly anticipated, and charted at #18. The tour following Hi-Fi Serious saw the band playing their largest venues to date, headlining the 5,000 capacity Brixton Academy as part of their &apos;Inner-City Sumo&apos; Tour. At the end of the year they won the Kerrang! award for &quot; Best British Band &quot;. In 2004, their single &quot; Nothing &quot; was added to Beyblade &apos;s Let It Rip! official soundtrack. In 2007, &quot; Something&apos;s Going On &quot; and &quot; The Distance &quot; were added to the Surf&apos;s Up video game soundtrack. [ Teen Dance Ordinance ] { Teen Dance Ordinance promotional poster } &apos;A&apos; released their fourth album, Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO), on June 27, 2005. The album had been recorded two years earlier, but was heavily delayed due to Jason Perry&apos;s illness and disputes with the record company. It featured a more straight-rock sound and displayed an almost complete absence of the keyboards and sampling that marked the early sound of the band. Unlike their last two albums, Teen Dance Ordinance was not released in the US. Hollywood Records agreed early on to release it in the US, but ultimately did not. The album charted at a disappointing #95 on the UK charts. [ Hiatus ] Since the release of Teen Dance Ordinance in 2005, the band had been working on other projects. Jason Perry spent time writing, recording, and touring with Matt Willis, formerly of Busted, and has now become a successful producer, working with the likes of The Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, and McFly.

Carter posted on the forums: &apos;A&apos; was some of the greatest times I have ever had playing music and I love those boys. I don&apos;t think I am &apos;too good&apos; to be playing in &apos;A&apos; and its not because I am too busy with my job at Radio 1. Its simply that when we drew a line in the sand and said we were done, I felt like we were. We played the one off show a while back and though it was fucking great whilst we were playing, as soon as it was finished I felt a bit confused as to what had just happened. So, to cease any speculation and so no one thinks there is any weirdness, I won&apos;t be playing the shows because I am trying to sort out my new band and focus on that for a little bit... If there are going to be more &apos;A&apos; shows in the future, I may play them, I may not, depends if they still want me after John has shown his bass skills, but whatever happens I will be at the London show watching my brothers play some rocking tunes and I will sing along. The end.
