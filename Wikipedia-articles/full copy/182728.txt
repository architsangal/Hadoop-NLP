For the era, it offered a comfortable, relatively quiet passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 service debut. } However, a year after entering commercial service, Comet airframe s began suffering catastrophic metal fatigue, with three of them tearing apart during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the cause; the first incident had been incorrectly blamed on an onboard fire. Design flaws including window shape and installation methodology were ultimately identified, and the Comet was extensively redesigned with changes including oval windows and structural reinforcement. Rival manufacturers meanwhile developed their own aircraft and heeded the lessons learned from the Comet. Although sales never fully recovered, the improved Comet  2 and the prototype Comet  3 culminated in the redesigned Comet  4 series, which debuted in 1958 and subsequently enjoyed a productive career of over 30  years. The Comet was adapted for a variety of military roles, such as surveillance and VIP, medical and passenger transport; the most extensive modification resulted in a specialised maritime patrol aircraft variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrods remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until they were retired in June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet&apos;s first flight. [ 2 ] [ Development ] [ Origins ] Design studies for the DH 106 Comet 1944–1947 (artist&apos;s impression) On 11 March 1943, the Cabinet of the United Kingdom formed the Brabazon Committee to determine Britain&apos;s airliner needs after the conclusion of the Second World War. { Trischler and Helmuth 2003, p. 88. } One of its recommendations was for a pressurised, transatlantic mailplane that could carry [ 1 lt out on ] of payload at a cruising speed of 400  mph (640  km/h). { Birtles 1970, p. 124. } Challenging the widely held scepticism of jet engines as too fuel-hungry and unreliable, [ During the same era, both Lockheed with their Lockheed L-188 Electra and Vickers with the ground-breaking Vickers Viscount discounted the advantages of &quot; pure &quot; jet power to develop turboprop -powered airliners. Kodera et al. 2010, p. 16. N ] committee member Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, head of the de Havilland company, used personal influence and his company&apos;s expertise with jet aircraft to specify a turbojet -powered design. The committee accepted the proposal, calling it the &quot; Type IV &quot; (of five designs), [ The &quot; Type IV &quot; Specifications issued on 3 February 1943 provided for a &quot; high-speed mail-carrying airliner, gas-turbine powered. &quot; Jones 2010, p. 60. N ] and awarded a production contract to de Havilland under the designation Type 106 in February 1945. { Jackson 1988, p. 453. } First-phase development of the DH 106 focused on short and intermediate range mailplanes with a small passenger compartment and as few as six seats, before being redefined as a long-range airliner with a capacity of 24 seats. Out of all the Brabazon designs, the DH 106 was seen as the riskiest both in terms of introducing untried design elements and for the financial commitment involved. Nevertheless, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) found the Type IV&apos;s specifications attractive, and initially proposed a purchase of 25 aircraft; in December 1945, when a firm contract was laid out, the order total was revised to 10. { Jones 2010, p. 62. } [ left 21% &quot; During the next few years, the UK has an opportunity, which may not recur, of developing aircraft manufacture as one of our main export industries. On whether we grasp this opportunity and so establish firmly an industry of the utmost strategic and economic importance, our future as a great nation may depend. &quot; ] A design team was formed in 1946 under the leadership of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; [ From 1944–1946, the design group prepared submissions on a three-engined twin-boom design, a three-engined canard design with engines mounted in the rear, and a tailless design that featured a swept wing and four &quot; podded &quot; engines. N ] all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108 s [ The Ministry of Supply&apos;s order for DH 108s was listed as Operational Requirement OR207 to Specification E.18/45. N ] to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. { Watkins 1996, p. 39. } During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. { Darling 2001, p. 11. } The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106&apos;s power controls. In September 1946, prior to the completion of the DH 108s, BOAC requests necessitated a redesign of the DH 106 from its previous 24-seat configuration to a larger 36-seat version. [ BOAC&apos;s requested capacity increase was known as Specification 22/46. N ] With no time to develop the technology necessary for a proposed tailless configuration, Bishop opted for a more conventional 20-degree swept-wing design [ The wing was drastically redesigned from a 40˚ sweep. N ] with unswept tail surfaces, married to an enlarged fuselage accommodating 36 passengers in a four-abreast arrangement with a central aisle. Replacing previously specified Halford H.1 Goblin engines, four new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon s were to be incorporated in pairs buried in the wing roots; Halford H.2 Ghost engines were eventually applied as an interim solution while the Avons cleared certification. The redesigned aircraft was named the DH 106 Comet in December 1947. [ The name &quot; Comet &quot;, previously used by the de Havilland DH.88 racing aircraft, was revived. Jackson 1988, p. 356. N ] Revised first orders from BOAC and British South American Airways [ British South American Airways merged with BOAC in 1949. N ] totaled 14 aircraft with a projected delivery schedule set for 1952. { Jones 2010, pp. 62–63. } [ Testing and prototypes ] Because the Comet represented a new category of passenger aircraft, more rigorous testing was a development priority. From 1947 to 1948, de Havilland conducted an extensive research and development phase, including the use of several stress test rigs at Hatfield for small components and large assemblies alike. Sections of pressurised fuselage were subjected to high-altitude flight conditions via a large decompression chamber onsite, [ The fuselage sections and nose simulated a flight up to 70,000 ft at a temperature of -70˚C, with 2,000 lb pressure applications at 9 lb pressure/square in. Birtles 1970, p. 125. N ] and tested to failure. However, tracing fuselage failure points proved difficult with this method, and de Havilland ultimately switched to conducting structural tests with a water tank that could be safely configured to increase pressures gradually. { &quot; Tank Test Mk 2. &quot; Flight, 1955, pp. 958–959. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. } The entire forward fuselage section was tested for metal fatigue by repeatedly pressurising to [ 2.75 psi kPa ] overpressure and depressurising through more than 16,000 cycles, equivalent to about 40,000  hours of airline service. { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 30. } The windows were also tested under a pressure of [ 12 psi kPa on ], [ 4.75 psi kPa on ] above the normal service ceiling of [ 36000 ft m on ]. One window frame survived [ 100 psi kPa on ], about 1,250 percent over the maximum pressure it was expected to encounter in service. Comet 1 prototype at Hatfield on 4 October 1949 The first prototype DH 106 Comet (carrying Class B markings G-5-1) was completed in 1949, and was initially used to conduct ground tests and brief early flights. { Darling 2001, p. 18. } The prototype&apos;s maiden flight took place on 27 July 1949 out of Hatfield Aerodrome and lasted 31  minutes. { Dick and Patterson 2010, pp. 134–137. } { Green and Swanborough April 1977, p. 174. } At the controls was de Havilland chief test pilot John Cunningham, a famous night-fighter pilot of the Second World War, along with co-pilot Harold &quot; Tubby &quot; Waters, engineers John Wilson (electrics) and Frank Reynolds (hydraulics), and flight test observer Tony Fairbrother. { Prins 1998, p. 43. } The prototype was registered G-ALVG just before it was publicly displayed at the 1949 Farnborough Airshow prior to the start of flight trials. A year later, the second prototype G-5-2 made its maiden flight. The second prototype was registered G-ALZK in July 1950 and it was used by the BOAC Comet Unit at Hurn from April 1951 to carry out 500 flying hours of crew training and route proving. { Swanborough 1962, p. 45. } Australian airline Qantas also sent its own technical experts to observe the performance of the prototypes, seeking to quell internal uncertainty about its prospective Comet purchase. { Gunn 1987, p. 268. } Both prototypes could be externally distinguished from later Comets by the large two-wheeled main landing gear, which was replaced on production models by sets of four-wheeled bogie s. [ Design ] [ Overview ] Interior of an ex Dan-Air Comet 4C at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune The Comet was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by four jet engines; it had a four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many unique or innovative design elements, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. { Francis 1950, p. 99. } Two pairs of turbojet engines (Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s, on the Comet 1s) were buried into the wings. { Francis 1950, pp. 100–101. } The Comet was approximately the length of the later Boeing 737, but carried fewer people in a significantly more spacious environment. The earliest BOAC Comet 1s used an arrangement of 36 seats on [ 45 in mm on ] centres; the Comet 1As flown by Air France had 11 rows of seats with four seats to a row. { Cookman, Aubery O. Jr. &quot; Commute by Jet. &quot; Popular Mechanics, 93(4), April 1950, pp. 149–152. } BOAC installed expressely-designed reclining &quot; slumberseats &quot; which provided greater leg room in front and behind, { Hill 2002, p. 27. } while large picture window views and table seating accommodations for a row of passengers afforded a &quot; feel of comfort and luxury &quot; atypical of transportation of the period. { Smith 2010. 30(4), pp. 489, 506. } Amenities included a galley that could serve hot and cold food and drinks, a bar, and separate men&apos;s and women&apos;s toilets. { Francis 1950, p. 98. } Provisions for emergency situations included several life raft s stored in the wings near the engines, and individual life vest s were stowed under each seat. One of the most striking aspects of travelling by Comet was the quiet, &quot; vibration-free flying &quot; as touted by BOAC. { Walker 2000, p. 69. } [ BOAC flight crew revelled in standing a pen on end and pointing that out to passengers; invariably, the pen remained upright throughout the entire flight. Windsor-Liscombe, Rhodri. &quot; Usual Culture: The Jet. &quot; Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies (Toronto: York University), Number 11, Spring 2004. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. N ] For passengers used to propeller-driven airliners, smooth and quiet jet flight was a novel experience (although passengers of today would consider the Comet noisy, particularly when seated aft of the wing). { Francis 1950, p. 100. } [ Avionics and systems ] The Comet was outfitted with advanced avionics systems, several of which were ground-breaking in civil aviation. One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot&apos;s ease of control and the safety of the aircraft by preventing aerodynamic forces changing the directed positions and placement of the aircraft&apos;s control surfaces. { Abzug and Larrabee 2002, pp. 80–81. } Additionally, a large number of the control surfaces, such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges. { Darling 2001, p. 2. } The Comet 4 navigator&apos;s station The Comet had a total of four hydraulic system s, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. { Darling 2001, pp. 16–17. } The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. { Darling 2001, p. 40. } Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. { Darling 2001, p. 17. } The majority of hydraulic components were centered in a single avionics bay. { Darling 2001, p. 45. } A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet&apos;s fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than contemporary methods. { &quot; F.R. equipment speeds refuelling. &quot; Flight, 11 May 1951. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. } For ease of training and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the layout of the cockpit&apos;s flight controls with a degree of similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC. { Darling 2001, p. 18. } The cockpit included full dual-controls for the captain and first officer, while a flight engineer controlled various key systems, including fuel, air conditioning, and electrical systems. { Darling 2001, pp. 35–36. } In 1953, Sud-Est &apos;s design bureau, while working on the Sud Aviation Caravelle, licensed several design features from de Havilland, building on previous collaborations on earlier licenced designs, including the DH 100 Vampire; [ The Sud-Est SE 530/532/535 Mistral (FB 53) was a single-seat fighter-bomber version of the de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, used by L&apos;Armée de l&apos;Air. Watkins 1996, pp. 181–182. N ] the nose and cockpit layout of the Comet 1 was grafted onto the Caravelle. { Motem 1990, p. 143. } The cockpit instrumentation was significantly altered for the Comet 4, on which an improved layout focusing on the onboard navigational suite was introduced. { Darling 2001, pp. 40–41. } [ Fuselage ] The Comet 1&apos;s circular fuselage and engine intakes Diverse geographical destinations and cabin pressurisation alike on the Comet demanded the use of a high proportion of alloys, plastics, and other materials new to civil aviation across the aircraft in order to meet certification requirements. { &quot; Comet Engineering: The Performance of Airframe, Engines, and Equipment in Operational Service. &quot; Flight International, 1 May 1953, p. 551. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. } The Comet&apos;s thin metal skin was composed of advanced new alloys [ Fuselage alloys detailed in Directorate of Technical Development 564/L.73 and DTD 746C/L90. N ] and was both riveted and chemically bonded, which saved weight and reduced the risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets. { &quot; Comet Enters Service. &quot; Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. Retrieved: 1 November 2010. } The chemical bonding process was accomplished using a new adhesive, Redux, which was liberally used in the construction of the wings and the fuselage of the Comet; it also had the advantage of simplifying the manufacturing process. { Moss, C. J. &quot; Metal to Metal Bonding – For Aircraft Structures: Claims of the Redux Process. &quot; Flight International, 8 February 1951, p. 169. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. } When several of the fuselage alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led to the introduction of widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise. { Jefford 2001, pp. 123–125. } Operationally, the design of the baggage/cargo holds led to considerable difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handler s at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards from the top of the baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo had also to be retrieved in a similar, slow manner at the arriving airport. { Birtles 1970, p. 132. } { Jones 2010, p. 67. } [ Engines ] [ Propulsion ] The Comet 1 was powered by two pairs of [ 5050 lbf kN on ] de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1 turbojet engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Two hydrogen peroxide -powered de Havilland Sprite booster rockets were originally intended to be installed to boost takeoff under hot and high altitude conditions from airports such as Khartoum and Nairobi. { Francis 1950, pp. 98–102. } These were tested on 30 flights, but the Ghosts alone were considered powerful enough and some airlines concluded that rocket motors were impractical. Sprite fittings were retained on production aircraft. { Gunn 1987, p. 269. } Comet 1s subsequently received more powerful [ 5700 lbf kN on ] Ghost DGT3 series engines. { Imperial War Museum Duxford } Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet&apos;s embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engine s and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. { Francis 1950, pp. 101–102. } The engines were outfitted with baffle s to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions. { Darling 2001, pp. 35, 46. } Placing the engines within the wings had the advantage of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. Early-model Comets only required low levels of maintenance, the de Havilland Ghost engines being a key contributing factor. { &quot; Ghost engine. &quot; Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. Retrieved: 1 November 2010. } However, the Comet&apos;s buried engine configuration resulted in increased structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure. { Francis 1950, p. 103. } On the Comet 2 onwards, the Ghost engines were replaced by the newer and more powerful [ 7000 lbf kN on ] Rolls-Royce Avon AJ.65 engines. To achieve optimum efficiency with the new powerplants, the air intakes were enlarged to increase mass air flow. Upgraded Avon engines were introduced on the Comet 3, and the Avon-powered Comet 4 was highly praised for its takeoff performance from high altitude locations such as Mexico City. { &quot; Comet Gets Stronger Engines. &quot; Popular Science, 160(6), June 1952, p. 142. } [ Operational history ] [ Introduction ] The earliest production aircraft, registered G-ALYP ( &quot; Yoke Peter &quot; ), first flew on 9 January 1951 and was subsequently loaned to BOAC for development flying by its Comet Unit. { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 31. } On 22 January 1952, the fifth production aircraft, registered G-ALYS, received the first Certificate of Airworthiness awarded to a Comet, six months ahead of schedule. { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 34. } On 2 May 1952, as part of BOAC&apos;s route-proving trials, G-ALYP took off on the world&apos;s first jetliner [ The Avro Canada C102 Jetliner, for which it was coined, first used the term; &quot; jetliner &quot; later became a generic term for all jet airliners.

In August 1953, BOAC scheduled London to Tokyo flights by Comet for 35 hours, compared to 85 hr 35 min using Argonaut piston aircraft; Pan American World Airways &apos; DC-6B eastbound around-the-world service, Flight 2, was scheduled for 46 hr 45 min. In its first year of service, Comets carried a total of 30,000 passengers. As the aircraft could be profitable with a passenger load factor as low as 43 percent, commercial success was widely expected. { Walker 2000, p. 25. } The Comet&apos;s Ghost engines were smooth, relatively simple, fuel-efficient above 30,000  ft (9,144  m), [ Depending on weight and temperature, cruise fuel consumption was 6 to 10 kg per nautical mile, the higher figure being at the lower altitude needed at high weight. N ] had low maintenance costs, and enabled operations above weather that competitors had to fly through. At the height of its early flying career, BOAC&apos;s Comet 1 fleet was flying routes such as London to Singapore, London to Tokyo, and London to Johannesburg several times a week. { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 22 (Route map illustration). } By 1953, the Comet appeared to have achieved success for de Havilland. { Schnaars 2002, p. 71. } In addition to BOAC, two French airlines, Union Aéromaritime de Transport and Air France, launched jet services to West Africa and the Middle East with the Comet 1A, an upgraded variant with greater fuel capacity. { Schnaars 2002, p. 70. } { &quot; Preludes and Overtures: de Havilland Comet 1 &quot;. Flight, 4 September 1953. Retrieved: 30 May 2012. } A slightly longer version of the Comet 1 with more powerful engines, the Comet 2, was being developed, { Darling 2001, p. 20. } and orders were placed by Air India, { Cacutt 1989, p. 146. } British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Japan Air Lines, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, and Panair do Brasil. American carriers Capital Airlines, National Airlines, and Pan American World Airways placed orders for the planned Comet 3, an even larger, longer-range version for trans-Atlantic operations. { Darling 2005, p. 128. } { Proctor et al. 2010, p. 23. } Qantas expressed considerable interest in operating the Comet 1, but concluded that the aircraft lacked the fuel capacity and takeoff performance to serve the London to Canberra route and that a purchase was not justified until further development had taken place. { Gunn 1987, pp. 268–270. } [ Early hull losses ] On 26 October 1952, the Comet suffered its first hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome&apos;s Ciampino airport failed to become airborne and ran into rough ground at the end of the runway. Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, being delivered to Australia, also failed to become airborne on takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. { &quot; Comet Accident Record. &quot; Aviation Safety Network. Retrieved: 22 September 2010. } { &quot; CF-CUN &quot; Ed Coates&apos; Civil Aircraft Photograph Collection. Retrieved: 18 February 2011. } The accident was the first fatal crash of a jet airliner, as well as the Comet&apos;s first accident to result in fatalities. Canadian Pacific subsequently cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A, and never operated the type in commercial service. BOAC Comet 1 at London Heathrow in 1953 prior to a scheduled flight Both early accidents were originally attributed to pilot error, as over-rotation had led to a loss of lift from the leading edge of the aircraft&apos;s wings. It was later determined that the Comet&apos;s wing profile experienced a loss of lift at a high angle of attack, and its engine inlets also suffered a lack of pressure recovery in the same conditions. As a result, de Havilland re-profiled the wings&apos; leading edge with a pronounced &quot; droop &quot;, { Withun 1976, p. 85. } and wing fence s were added to control spanwise flow. { Birtles 1970, p. 127. } A fictionalised investigation into the Comet&apos;s takeoff accidents was the subject of the 1959 novel, Cone of Silence by Arthur David Beaty, a former BOAC captain. Cone of Silence was made into a film in 1960, and Beaty also recounted the story of the Comet&apos;s takeoff accidents in a chapter of his 1984 non-fiction work, Strange Encounters: Mysteries of the Air. { Beaty 1984, pp. 113–114. } The Comet&apos;s second fatal accident occurred on 2 May 1953, when a BOAC Comet 1, registered G-ALYV, crashed in a severe thundersquall six minutes after taking off from Calcutta-Dum Dum (now Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport ), India, { Darling 2005, p. 36. } killing all 43 on board. Witnesses observed the wingless Comet on fire plunging into the Indian Ocean, leading investigators to suspect structural failure. [ India Court of Inquiry ] After the loss of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine the cause of the accident. [ The court acted under the provisions of Rule 75 of the Indian Aircraft Rules 1937. Walker 2000, p. 37. N ] A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left-hand elevator spar failure in the stabiliser. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G force s during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, which subsequently precipitated the loss of the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls also led to a belief that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause. { Lo Bao 1996, p. 7. } The inquiry&apos;s recommendations revolved around the enforcement of stricter speed limits during turbulence, and two significant design changes also resulted: all Comets were equipped with weather radar and the &quot; Q feel &quot; system was introduced, which ensured that control column forces (invariably called stick forces) would be proportional to control loads. This artificial feel was the first of its kind to be introduced in any aircraft. The Comet 1 and 1A had been criticised for a lack of &quot; feel &quot; in their controls, { Job 1996, p. 14. } and investigators suggested that this might have contributed to the pilot&apos;s alleged over-stressing of the aircraft; { Darling 2001, p. 26. } de Havilland&apos;s chief test pilot John Cunningham contended, however, that the Comet flew smoothly and was highly responsive in a manner consistent with the manufacturer&apos;s other aircraft. { Faith 1996, pp. 63–64. } [ Cunningham: &quot; [the Comet] flew extremely smoothly and responded to the controls in the best way de Havilland aircraft usually did. &quot; N ] [ Comet disasters of 1954 ] [ BOAC Flight 781 South African Airways Flight 201 ] Fuselage fragment of G-ALYP at the Science Museum in London Rome&apos;s Ciampino airport, the site of the first Comet hull loss, was again the origin of more disastrous Comet flights just over a year later.

The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led to the loss of DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire. { &quot; Report of the Public Inquiry into the causes and circumstances of the accident which occurred on the 10 January 1954, to the Comet aircraft G-ALYP, Part IX (d). &quot; geocities.com.

No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, [ On 4 April, Lord Brabazon wrote to the Minister of Transport, &quot; Although no definite reason for the accident has been established, modifications are being embodied to cover every possibility that imagination has suggested as a likely cause of the disaster. When these modifications are completed and have been satisfactorily flight tested, the Board sees no reason why passenger services should not be resumed. &quot; N ] and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft&apos;s grounding on BOAC&apos;s operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954. { Birtles 1970, pp. 128–129. } On 8 April 1954, Comet G-ALYY ( &quot; Yoke Yoke &quot; ), on charter to South African Airways, was on a leg from Rome to Cairo (of a longer route, SA Flight 201 from London to Johannesburg), when it crashed in the Mediterranean near Naples with the loss of all 21 passengers and crew on board. The Comet fleet was immediately grounded once again and a large investigation board was formed under the direction of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). Prime Minister Winston Churchill tasked the Royal Navy with helping to locate and retrieve the wreckage so that the cause of the accident could be determined. The Comet&apos;s Certificate of Airworthiness was revoked and Comet 1 line production was suspended at the Hatfield factory while the BOAC fleet was permanently grounded, cocooned and stored. [ Cohen Committee Court of Inquiry ] BOAC Comet 1 cocooned and stored in the maintenance area at London Heathrow in September 1954 On 19 October 1954, the Cohen Committee was established to examine the causes of the Comet crashes. Chaired by Lord Cohen, the committee tasked an investigation team led by Sir Arnold Hall, Director of the RAE at Farnborough, to perform a more detailed investigation. Hall&apos;s team began considering fatigue as the most likely cause of both accidents, and initiated further research into measurable strain on the aircraft&apos;s skin. With the recovery of large sections of G-ALYP from the Elba crash and BOAC&apos;s donation of an identical airframe, G-ALYU, for further examination, an extensive &quot; water torture &quot; test eventually provided conclusive results. This time, the entire fuselage was tested in a dedicated water tank that was built specifically at Farnborough to accommodate its full length. Stress around the window corners was found to be much higher than expected, while stresses on the skin were generally more than previously expected or tested. { Atkinson et al. 1962, p. 9. } This was due to stress concentration, a consequence of the windows&apos; square shape, which caused levels of stress to be two or three times than that across the rest of the fuselage. { Atkinson et al. 1962, pp. 4, 6, 27. } In water tank testing, engineers subjected G-ALYU to repeated re-pressurisation and over-pressurisation, and on 24 June 1954, after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), { &quot; Comet. &quot; RAF Museum. Retrieved: 3 September 2010. } G-ALYU burst open. Hall, Geoffrey de Havilland and Bishop were immediately called to the scene, where the water tank was drained to reveal that the fuselage had ripped open at a corner of the forward port-side escape hatch cutout. A further test reproduced the same results. { Withun 1976, p. 87. } Based on these findings, Comet 1 structural failures could be expected at anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 cycles. Before the Elba accident, G-ALYP had made 1,290 pressurised flights, while G-ALYY had made 900 pressurised flights before crashing. Dr. P.B. Walker, Head of the Structures Department at the RAE, said he was not surprised by this, noting that the difference was about three to one, and previous experience with metal fatigue suggested a total range of nine to one between experiment and outcome in the field could result in failure. The RAE also reconstructed about two-thirds of G-ALYP at Farnborough and found fatigue crack growth from a rivet hole at the low-drag fibreglass forward aperture around the Automatic Direction Finder, which had caused a catastrophic breakup of the aircraft in high altitude flight. { &quot; Summary: Aircraft Investigation. &quot; Aircraft Engineering, 37, 1965, p. 38. } The punch rivet construction technique employed in the Comet&apos;s design had exacerbated its structural fatigue problems; the aircraft&apos;s windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting could cause the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet. Principal investigator Hall accepted the RAE&apos;s conclusion of design and construction flaws as the likely explanation for G-ALYU&apos;s structural failure after 3,060 pressurisation cycles. [ Hall: &quot; In the light of known properties of the aluminium alloy D.T.D. 546 or 746 of which the skin was made and in accordance with the advice I received from my Assessors, I accept the conclusion of RAE that this is a sufficient explanation of the failure of the cabin skin of Yoke Uncle by fatigue after a small number, namely, 3,060 cycles of pressurisation. &quot; Report of the Public Inquiry into the causes and circumstances of the accident which occurred on the 10 January 1954, to the Comet aircraft G-ALYP, Part XI (a. 69). N ] The Cohen inquiry closed on 24 November 1954, and although the inquiry had &quot; found that the basic design of the Comet was sound &quot;, de Havilland nonetheless began a refit programme to strengthen the fuselage and wing structure, employing thicker gauge skin and replacing all square windows and panels with rounded versions. { Davies and Birtles 1999, pp. 30–31. } [ Resumption of service ] Dan-Air Comet 4s at Gatwick Airport, c. 1976 Following the structural problems of the early series, all remaining Comets were withdrawn from service, while de Havilland launched a major effort to build a new version that would be both larger and stronger. All outstanding orders for the Comet 2 were cancelled by airline customers. { Darling 2001, p. 33. } The square windows of the Comet 1 were replaced by the oval versions used on the Comet 2, which first flew in 1953, and the skin sheeting was thickened slightly. Remaining Comet 1s and 1As were either scrapped or modified with oval window rip-stop doublers (a thick, structurally strong ring of material that prevents a crack from spreading further). All production Comet 2s were also modified to alleviate the fatigue problems (most of these served with the RAF as the Comet C2), while a programme to produce a Comet 2 with more powerful Avons was delayed. The prototype Comet 3 first flew in July 1954, and was tested in a non-pressurised state pending completion of the Cohen inquiry. The Comet would not resume commercial airline service until 1958. { Swanborough 1962, pp. 47–48. } Development flying and route proving with the Comet 3 allowed accelerated certification of what was destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the Comet 4. All airline customers for the Comet 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the Comet 4. BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. { &quot; Capital Comet. &quot; Canadian Aviation, 29(9-12), 1956, p. 51. } Capital&apos;s order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings (lacking the pinion (outboard wing) fuel tanks of the Comet 4). The Comet 4 completed its first flight on 27 April 1958, received its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958, and was first delivered to BOAC the following day. { Lo Bao 1996, p. 11. } { Walker 2000, pp. 187–188. } The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland on westward North Atlantic crossings). { Aerolíneas Argentinas Comet 4 at Kennedy Airport in 1965 } While BOAC gained publicity from being the first to provide transatlantic jet service, by the end of the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 along the same route, { &quot; The Comet&apos;s chance to shine. &quot; The New Scientist, 4(98), 2 October 1958, p. 940. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. } and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective to operate than the Comet. { Haddon-Cave 2009, p. 16. } After analysing effective route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor and, by 1958, entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707. { Lo Bao 1996, p. 12. } The Comet 4 was ordered by two additional customers: Aerolíneas Argentinas took delivery of six Comet 4s from 1959 to 1960, using them between Buenos Aires and Santiago, while East African Airways received three new Comet 4s from 1960 to 1962 and operated them to Kenya, Tanzania, and Ugandan destinations. { Darling 2005, p. 114. } Capital Airlines&apos; order for Comet 4s and Comet 4As was cancelled following the carrier&apos;s financial problems and subsequent takeover by United Airlines. The Comet 4A was instead built for BEA as the Comet 4B, featuring a further fuselage stretch of 38  in (97  cm) and seating for 99 passengers. The first Comet 4B flew on 27 June 1959 and BEA began Tel Aviv to London-Heathrow services on 1 April 1960. Olympic Airways was the only other customer to order the type. { Jackson 1987, p. 459. } The last Comet 4 variant, the Comet 4C, first flew on 31 October 1959 and entered service with Mexicana in 1960. { &quot; Comet 4Cs for Mexicana. &quot; Flight International, 76, 6 November 1959, p. 491. Retrieved: 26 April 2012. } The Comet 4C featured the Comet 4B&apos;s longer fuselage coupled with the longer wings and extra fuel tanks of the original Comet 4, which gave it a longer range than the 4B. It found the greatest customer acceptance of all Comet variants, with East African Airways, Kuwait Airways, Middle East Airlines, Misrair (later United Arab Airlines), and Sudan Airways ordering the type. { Howard, Paul. &quot; De Havilland DH.106 Comet 4C, OD-ADT, MEA – Middle East Airlines. &quot; Air-Britain Photographic Images Collection. Retrieved: 19 November 2010. } { cockpit } In 1959 BOAC began shifting its Comet operations from transatlantic services to other routes, and released the Comet to associate companies, thus making the Comet 4&apos;s ascendancy as a premier airliner relatively brief. Besides the 707 and DC-8, the imminent introduction of the Vickers VC10 allowed competing aircraft to assume the high-speed, long-range passenger service role initially pioneered by the Comet. { Lo Bao 1996, p. 13. } In 1960, as part of a government-backed consolidation of the British aerospace industry, de Havilland itself was acquired by Hawker Siddeley, within which it became a wholly-owned division. { &quot; De Havilland - Post War &quot;, rafmuseum.org.uk. Retrieved: 30 May 2012 } In the 1960s orders gradually declined, with a total of 76 Comet 4s being delivered from 1958 to 1964. In 1965 BOAC retired its Comet 4s from revenue service, while other operators continued commercial passenger flights with the Comet until 1981. Dan-Air played a significant role in the fleet&apos;s later history and, at one time, owned all 49 remaining airworthy civil Comets. { Swanborough 1980, p. 35. } On 14 March 1997, a Comet 4C registered XS235 and named Canopus, which had been acquired by the British Ministry of Technology and used for radio, radar and avionics trials, made the last documented production Comet flight. { Walker 2000, p. 169. } [ Variants ] [ Comet 1 ] DH106 Comet 1 preserved in the colours of BOAC G-APAS, this aircraft also served with the RAF as XM823, now at RAF Cosford The square-windowed Comet 1 was the first model produced, a total of 12 aircraft in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115  ft (35.05  m), and overall length 93  ft (28.35  m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000  lb (47.628  kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried. { Walker 2000, p. 190. } An updated Comet 1A was offered with higher-allowed weight, greater fuel capacity, and water-methanol injection; 10 were produced.

[ DH 111 Comet Bomber ] Originally proposed in 1948 as the &quot; PR Comet &quot;, a &quot; high-level photo reconnaissance &quot; adaptation of the Comet 1, de Havilland further developed a bomber variant to Air Ministry specification B35/46 as the DH 111 Comet Bomber with a submission to the Air Ministry on 27 May 1948. The substantially altered airframe powered by four [ 5700 lbf kN on ] Ghost DGT3 engines, was designed to carry nuclear bombs, and featured a narrowed fuselage along with a bulbous nose to accommodate the H2S Mk IX radar; the crew of four would be housed in a pressurised cockpit under a large bubble canopy. Additional fuel tanks carrying [ 2400 impgal l ] were built into the fuselage to attain a range of [ 3350 miles km ]. The DH 111 proposal was evaluated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment but serious concerns regarding weapons storage led to a negative RAE review. The capability of the proposed V bomber trio also made the DH 111 redundant and further development work at de Havilland was abandoned on 22 October 1948. { Walker 2000, pp. 171–172. } [ Comet 2 ] Comet C2, &apos;&apos;XK671&apos;&apos; Aquila at RAF Waterbeach, showing engines buried in wings and revised round windows The Comet 2 had a slightly larger wing, higher fuel capacity and more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon engines, which all improved the aircraft&apos;s range and performance; its fuselage was [ 3 ft 1 in on ] longer than the Comet 1&apos;s. Design changes had been made to make the aircraft more suitable for transatlantic operations. { Jackson 1980, p. 175. } Following the Comet 1 disasters, these models were rebuilt with heavier gauge skin and rounded windows, and the Avon engines featuring larger air intakes and outward-curving jet tailpipes. [ Avon-powered Comets were distinguished by larger air intakes and curved tailpipes that reduced the thermal effect on the rear fuselage.

All but four Comet 2s were allocated to the RAF with deliveries beginning in 1955. Modifications to the interiors allowed the Comet 2s to be used in a number of different roles. For VIP transport, the seating and accommodations were altered while provisions for carrying medical equipment including iron lungs were incorporated. Specialised ELINT and electronic surveillance capability was later added to some airframes. [ The 2R ELINT series was operational until 1974, when replaced by the Nimrod R1, the last Comet derivative in RAF service. Walker 2000, p. 159. N ] Comet 2X: Limited to a single Comet Mk 1 powered by four Rolls-Royce Avon 502 turbojet engines and used as a development aircraft for the Comet 2. Comet 2E: Two Comet 2 airliners were fitted with Avon 504s in the inner nacelles and Avon 524s in the outer ones. These aircraft were used by BOAC for proving flights during 1957–1958.

In service with No. 192 and No. 51 Squadron s, the 2R series was equipped to monitor Warsaw Pact signal traffic and operated in this role from 1958. [ Comet 3 ] Comet 3 G-ANLO in BOAC markings at Farnborough in September 1954 The Comet 3, which flew for the first time on 19 July 1954, was a Comet 2 lengthened by [ 15 ft 5 in on ] and powered by Avon M502 engines developing [ 10000 lbf kN on ]. The variant added wing pinion tanks, and offered greater capacity and range. { Jackson 1987, p. 457. } The Comet 3 was destined to remain a development series since it did not incorporate the fuselage-strengthening modifications of the later series aircraft, and was not able to be fully pressurised. { Birtles 1970, p. 129. } Only two Comet 3s began construction with G-ANLO, the only airworthy Comet 3, demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September 1954. The other Comet 3 airframe was not completed to production standard and was used primarily for ground-based structural and technology testing during development of the similarly sized Comet 4. Nine additional Comet 3 airframes were not completed and their construction was abandoned at Hatfield. { Walker 2000, pp. 51–52. } In BOAC colours, G-ANLO was flown by John Cunningham in a marathon round-the-world promotional tour in December 1955. As a flying testbed, it was later modified with Avon RA29 engines fitted, as well as replacing the original long-span wings with reduced span wings as the Comet 3B and demonstrated in British European Airways (BEA) livery at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1958. Assigned in 1961 to the Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) at RAE Bedford, the final testbed role played by G–ANLO was in automatic landing system experiments. When retired in 1973, the airframe was used for foam arrester trials before the fuselage was salvaged at BAE Woodford, to serve as the mock-up for the Nimrod. { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 36. } [ Comet 4 ] Comet 4B of British European Airways at Bremen in 1969 The Comet 4 was a further improvement on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed significantly from the original Comet 1, growing by 18  ft 6  in (5.64  m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1&apos;s 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). { Winchester 2004, p. 109. } The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice the thrust of the Comet 1&apos;s Ghosts. { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 62. } Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, [ The front 16 seats were De Luxe: £17/17/- or $50 extra fare afforded a &quot; sleeper seat &quot;, with more leg room and a footrest. Meals were the same as at the 32 First Class seats. N ] which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services. Comet 4B: Originally developed for Capital Airlines as the 4A, the 4B featured greater capacity and a shorter wingspan; 18 were produced. Comet 4C: This variant featured the Comet 4&apos;s wings and the 4B&apos;s added capacity; 23 were produced. The last two Comet 4C fuselages were used to build prototypes of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft. A Comet 4C (SA-R-7) was ordered by Saudi Arabian Airlines with eventual disposition to the Saudi Royal Flight for the exclusive use of King Saud bin Abdul Aziz. Extensively modified at the factory, the aircraft included a VIP front cabin, a bed, special toilets with gold fittings and was distinguished by a resplendent green, gold and white colour scheme with polished wings and lower fuselage that was commissioned from aviation artist John Stroud. Following its first flight, the special order Comet 4C was described as &quot; the world&apos;s first executive jet. &quot; { Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 50. } [ Comet 5 proposal ] The Comet 5 was proposed as an improvement over previous models, including a wider fuselage with five-abreast seating, a wing with greater sweep and podded Rolls-Royce Conway engines. Without support from the Ministry of Transport, the proposal languished as a hypothetical aircraft and was never realised.

[ Legacy ] Dan-Air DH-106 Comet 4C, G-BDIW exhibited at the &apos;&apos;Flugausstellung Hermeskeil&apos;&apos; in Germany The Comet is widely regarded jointly as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft&apos;s legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were perhaps some of the most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. { Bibel 2008, p. 68. } In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood at the time of the aircraft&apos;s development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could be only retroactively applied to the Comet. { Bibel 2008, pp. 115–116. } According to de Havilland&apos;s chief test pilot John Cunningham, who had flown the prototype&apos;s first flight, representatives from American manufacturers such as Boeing and Douglas privately disclosed that if de Havilland had not experienced the Comet&apos;s pressurisation problems first, it would have happened to them. { Faith 1996, p. 72. } Cunningham likened the Comet to the later Concorde, and added that he had assumed that the aircraft would change aviation, which it subsequently did. Aviation author Bill Withun concluded that the Comet had pushed &quot; &apos;the state-of-the-art&apos; beyond its limits. &quot; { Withun 1976, p. 88. } [ left 19% &quot; I don&apos;t think it is too much to say that the world changed from the moment the Comet&apos;s wheels left the ground. &quot; ] Aeronautical engineering firms were quick to respond to the Comet&apos;s commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland&apos;s Comet. { Trischler and Helmuth 2003, p. 90. } { Job 1996, p. 21. } While the Comet&apos;s buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, { Stroud 1968, p. 201. } later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. { Taylor 1996, p. 151. } Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. { Tegler 2000, p. 6. } In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often going so far as to explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet. { Dennies 2005, p. 27. } [ Specifications ] [ 93 ft on ] [ 96 ft 1 in on ] [ 111 ft 6 in on ] [ 111 ft 6 in on ] [ 115 ft on ] [ 29 ft 6 in on ] [ 2015 sqft on ] [ 2015 sqft on ] [ 2015 sqft on ] [ 2121 sqft on ] [ 110000 lb on ] [ 120000 lb on ] [ 150000 lb on ] [ 156000 lb on ] [ 1500 mi nmi km on on ] [ 2600 mi nmi km on on ] [ 2700 mi nmi km on on ] [ 3225 mi nmi km on on ] [ 740 kph kn mph on ] [ 790 kph kn mph on ] [ 840 kph kn mph on ] [ 840 kph kn mph on ] [ 42000 ft on ] [ 42000 ft on ] [ 45000 ft on ] [ 42000 ft on ] [ 5000 lbf on on ] [ 7000 lbf on on ] [ 10000 lbf on on ] [ 10500 lbf on on ] Comet 1 Comet 2 Comet 3 Comet 4 Cockpit crew 4 (2 pilots, flight engineer and radio operator/navigator) Passengers 36–44 36–44 58–76 56–81 Length Wingspan Tail height Wing area Airfoil NACA 63A116 mod root, NACA 63A112 mod tip Lednicer, David. &quot; The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage. &quot; UIUC Applied Aerodynamics Group, 15 September 2010.
