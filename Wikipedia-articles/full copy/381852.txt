[ yes 1851 4 12 ] { London } [ yes 1928 3 21 1851 4 12 ] { British } { Maunder Minimum } { Annie Scott Dill Maunder } Edward Walter Maunder (12 April 1851 – 21 March 1928) was an English astronomer best remembered for his study of sunspot s and the solar magnetic cycle that led to his identification of the period from 1645 to 1715 that is now known as the Maunder Minimum. [ Early and personal life ] Edward Maunder was born in 1851, in London, the youngest child of a minister of the Wesleyan Society. He attended King&apos;s College London but never graduated. He took a job in a London bank to finance his studies. Edward Maunder married twice. In 1873 Edward Maunder returned to the Royal Observatory, taking a position as a spectroscopic assistant. Shortly after, in 1875, he married Edith Hannah Bustin, who gave birth to six children. Following the death of Edith Hannah in 1888, he met Annie Scott Dill Russell (1868 –1947) in 1890, a mathematician with whom he collaborated for the remainder of his life. In 1895 Maunder and Russell married. In 1916 Annie Maunder became one of the first women accepted by the Royal Astronomical Society. Maunder was also an esteemed biblical scholar. [ Solar observations ] [[Image:Sunspot-bfly.gif|thumb|600px|center|F2|Figure 2: A modern version of the Mauders&apos; sunspot &quot; butterfly diagram &quot;. (This version from the solar group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.)]] Part of Maunder&apos;s job at the Observatory involved photographing and measuring sunspots, and in doing so he observed that the solar latitudes at which sunspots occur varies in a regular way over the course of the 11  year cycle. After 1891, he was assisted in his work by his second wife, Annie Scott Dill Maunder (née Russell), a mathematician educated at Girton College in Cambridge. She worked as a &quot; lady computer &quot; at the Observatory from 1890 to 1895. In 1904, he published their results in the form of the &quot; butterfly &quot; diagram. After studying the work of Gustav Spörer, who examined old records from the different observatories archives looking for changes of the heliographic latitude of sunspots, Maunder announced Spörer&apos;s conclusions in own paper edited in 1894. The period, recognized earlier by Spörer, now bears Maunder name. [ Other astronomical observations ] { The Observatory &apos;&apos;, June 1883 (pp. 192-193) and April 1916 (pp. 213-215), which he termed an &quot; auroral beam &quot; and &quot; a strange celestial visitor. &quot; Drawing by astronomer and } { aurora expert } { John Rand Capron, } { Guildown Observatory, } { Surrey, UK, who also observed it. From &apos;&apos; } { Philosophical Magazine &apos;&apos;, May 1883. } In 1882 Maunder (and some other European astronomers) observed what he called an &quot; auroral beam &quot;; as yet unexplained, it had some similarity in appearance to either a noctilucent cloud or an upper tangent arc. [ http://www.meteoros.de/arten/ee05e.htm Upper Tangent Arc Arbeitskreis Meteore e.V. ] However, Maunder wrote that the phenomenon moved rapidly from horizon to horizon, which would rule out a noctilucent cloud or upper tangent arc. Further, upper tangent arc cannot occur during nighttime when the observation was made. Since he made his observation during highly intense auroral activity, he assumed it was some extraordinary auroral phenomenon, though one he had never observed again before or after. He observed Mars and was a sceptic of the notion of Martian canals. He conducted visual experiments using marked circular disks which led him to conclude, correctly, that the viewing of canals arose as an optical illusion. Also he was convinced that there cannot be life &quot; as in our world &quot; on Mars, as there are no temperature-equating winds and too low mean temperatures. Craters on Mars and the Moon were named in his and his wife Annie &apos;s honours. [ Establishment of the British Astronomical Association ] In 1890, Maunder was a driving force in the foundation of the British Astronomical Association. Although he had been fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society since 1875, Maunder wanted an association of astronomers open to every person interested in astronomy, from every class of society, and especially open for women. Edward Maunder was the first editor of the Journal of the BAA, an office later taken by his wife Annie Maunder. His older brother, Thomas Frid Maunder (1841 –1935), was a co-founder, and secretary of the Association for 38 years. [ Publications ] [ Maunder, E.
