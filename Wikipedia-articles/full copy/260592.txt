The population was 3,451 at the 2010 census. The city is located within the Town of Seymour and the Town of Osborn. [ History ] The City of Seymour was founded in 1868 and named after Governor Horatio Seymour of the state of New York. Seymour is said to have once been called Squeedunk, which means &quot; little settlement &quot; or &quot; village &quot;. Seymour&apos;s centennial was in 1968. William and John Ausbourne were the first settlers in Seymour. They had traveled from western Outagamie County on the Wolf River during the summer of 1857 and made their way to the mouth of the Shioc River. They then moved to a spot where the Black Creek flows into the Shioc. After finding that there were no longer any roads to follow, the Ausbournes finally settled in the present location of Seymour, which was occupied by Native Americans at the time. There they built a log house, the only residence in Seymour for two years. Their closest neighbors lived in Osborn. Over the years more settlers came to Seymour. Willis and Dan Mungers arrived in Seymour in 1864. The Mungers built a house on what is now Main Street and their daughter Sally lived in a frame house on what is now South Main Street. Erastus C. Buttles came during the spring [ February 2011 ] and established a farm in the western part of the county. Leaonard and Avery Carter arrived in Seymour in 1876, along with Charles Eichler, the first German settler in the area. As the population of the area grew, more villages were established in the Seymour area. On March 1, 1877 Seymour became a recognized town, along with the towns of Osborn and Freedom. During the early 1880s, construction of the Green Bay and Lake Pepin Railroad was completed. In 1883 a station was built in Seymour, and soon Seymour was recognized as the smallest incorporated city in the nation. As soon as the settlers had built their houses, they turned to education, electing a school superintendent and an establishing a school tax. The schoolhouse was a simple one-room building with no floor and a shake roof. Sunday school soon began in the same building. Between 1887 and 1889 George E. Mendell published the first newspaper, called The Aurora, which lasted only three years. On July 8, 1886 the Seymour Press made its first appearance, and was published by the Van Vuren family for over 80 years. It was then sold to the Shellman Publishing Company of Oconto Falls, and is still published today. { http://www.seymour.k12.wi.us/shs/teachers/Grassel/regionals/history.htm } According to one claim, Charlie Nagreen served the world&apos;s first hamburger at the Seymour Fair of 1885. { http://www.seymourhistory.org/news/?id=35 } &quot; Hamburger &quot; Charlie decided to flatten a meatball and place it between slices of bread to increase portability.
