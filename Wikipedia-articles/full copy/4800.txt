Several dozen less powerful species from the League of Non-Aligned Worlds appear, including the Drazi, Brakiri, Vree, Markab, and pak&apos;ma&apos;ra.

Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season&apos;s plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race (the Battle of the Line ). [ Season 1 – Year 2258 ] [ List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 1: Signs and Portents ] During 2258, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station. Much of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth. Upon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that Valen, a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war, had been reincarnated as the Commander. Concluding that others of their species had been, and were continuing to be reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another, lest they harm the soul, they stopped the war just as Earth&apos;s final defenses were on the verge of collapse. It is gradually revealed that Ambassador Delenn is a member of the mysterious and powerful Grey Council, the ruling body of the Minbari. Towards the end of 2258, she begins the transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the assassination of Earth Alliance President Luis Santiago, and rising tension between the Narn and Centauri, after a Narn outpost is completely destroyed by an unknown third party. [ Season 2 – year 2259 ] [ List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 2: The Coming of Shadows ] At the beginning of 2259, Captain John Sheridan replaces Sinclair as the military governor of the station. He and the command staff learn that the death of President Santiago was actually an assassination masterminded by Vice President Clark (who assumed the Presidency upon Santiago&apos;s death). A conflict develops between the Babylon 5 command staff and the Psi Corps, an increasingly autocratic organization which oversees and controls the lives of human telepaths. Commander Ivanova, the second-in-command of the station, is secretly a latent telepath who has illicitly avoided registering with the Psi Corps. The Shadows, an ancient and extremely powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are revealed to be the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with the mysterious Mr. Morden in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, dies suddenly while visiting Babylon 5. A number of conspirators, including Londo Mollari and Refa, take control of the Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor&apos;s unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After a full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving mass driver s, outlawed weapons of mass destruction. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting freedom of speech. The Vorlon s are revealed to be the basis of legends about angel s on various worlds, including Earth, and are the ancient enemies of the Shadows. They enlist the aid of Sheridan and the Babylon 5 command staff in the struggle against the Shadows. [ Season 3 – year 2260 ] [ List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 3: Point of No Return ] The Psi Corps and President Clark, whose government has discovered Shadow vessels buried in Earth&apos;s solar system, begin to harness the vessels&apos; advanced technology. The Clark administration continues to become increasingly xenophobic and totalitarian, and uses a military incident as an excuse to declare martial law. This triggers a war of independence on Mars, which had long had a strained political relationship with Earth. Babylon 5 also declares independence from Earth, along with several other outlying Earth Alliance colonies. In response, the Earth Alliance attempts to retake Babylon 5 by force, but with the aid of the Minbari, who have allied with the station against the growing Shadow threat, the attack is repelled. Becoming concerned over the Shadows&apos; growing influence amongst his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them. Mr. Morden, the Shadows&apos; human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering the murder of Mollari&apos;s mistress while putting the blame on a rival Centauri House. Open warfare breaks out between the Shadows and the alliance led by Babylon 5 and the Minbari. It is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons is the source of human telepathy, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks. Displeased at the Vorlons&apos; lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador Kosh Naranek into launching an attack against their mutual enemy. Kosh&apos;s deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows. Former station commander Jeffrey Sinclair returns to Babylon 5 to enlist the aid of Captain Sheridan, Delenn, Ivanova and Marcus in stealing the Babylon 4 space station and sending it 1,000 years back in time to use it as a base of operations against the Shadows in the previous Minbari-Shadow war. Undergoing the same transformation as Delenn at the end of Season 1, Sinclair transforms into a Minbari and is subsequently revealed to be the actual Valen of Minbari legend, rather than a reincarnation. Spurred by the reappearance of his assumed-dead wife (who now works for the Shadows), Sheridan travels to Z&apos;ha&apos;dum, the Shadow homeworld, in an attempt by them to recruit him. However he instead destroys their largest city in a kamikaze nuclear attack, and is last seen jumping into a miles-deep pit to escape the explosion.Garibaldi, during a fight with Shadow vessels, goes missing. [ Season 4 – year 2261 ] [ List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat ] In 2261, the Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their tactics become a concern for the alliance when the Vorlons begin destroying entire planets which they deem to have been &quot; influenced &quot; by the Shadows. Disturbed by this turn of events, Babylon 5 recruits several other powerful and ancient races (the First Ones ) to their cause, against both the Shadows and the Vorlons. Captain John Sheridan returns to the station after escaping from Z&apos;ha&apos;dum, but at a price: barring illness or injury, he has only 20 years left to live. He is accompanied by a mysterious alien named Lorien who claims to be the oldest sentient being in the galaxy. Hours before Sheridan&apos;s return, Garibaldi is rescued and returned to the station, in rather dubious circumstances. He is markedly more paranoid and suspicious of other alien races and of Sheridan than he was before. Centauri Emperor Cartagia forges a relationship with the Shadows. Londo Mollari engineers the assassination of Cartagia and repudiates his agreement with the Shadows. Londo kills Mr. Morden and destroys the Shadow vessels based on the Centauri homeworld, in an attempt to save his planet from destruction by the Vorlons. Aided by the other ancient races, and several younger ones, Sheridan lures both the Vorlons and the Shadows into an immense battle, during which the Vorlon s and Shadows reveal that they have been left as guardians of the younger races, but due to philosophical differences, ended up using them as pawns in their endless wars throughout the ages. The younger races reject their continued interference, and the Vorlons and Shadows, along with the remaining First Ones, agree to depart the galaxy forever. After the Shadows are defeated Garibaldi leaves his post as security chief and works on his own as a &quot; provider of information &quot;. He begins working for one William Edgars, a Mars Tycoon, who is married to Garibaldi&apos;s former love. While he works ever closer with Edgars, he becomes increasingly aggressive towards Sheridan and eventually leaves Babylon 5. Minbar is gripped by a brief civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes. Delenn secretly meets with Neroon of the Warrior caste and convinces him that neither side can be allowed to win. She tells him that she will undergo a ritual wherein she will be willing to sacrifice herself, but will stop the ritual before she actually dies. When Neroon sees that she actually intends to go through the entire ritual, he rescues her and sacrifices himself instead, declaring that, although he was born Warrior, in his heart he is Religious. As part of the ongoing conflict between Earth and Babylon 5, Garibaldi eventually betrays Sheridan and arranges his capture in order to gain Edgars&apos; trust and learn his plans. Garibaldi later learns that Edgars created a virus that is dangerous only to telepaths. It is then revealed that Garibaldi was actually abducted by the Psi-Corps at the end of Season 3 and re-programmed by Bester to provide information to him at the right time. Bester releases Garibaldi of his programming, and allows him to remember everything he has done since being kidnapped. Edgars is killed and his wife disappears, but is reunited with Garibaldi after the end of the war. Garibaldi helps free Sheridan and return him to the campaign to free Earth. An alliance led by Babylon 5 frees Earth from totalitarian rule by President Clark in a short but bloody war. This culminates in Clark&apos;s suicide and the restoration of democratic government. Mars is granted full independence, and Sheridan agrees to resign his commission. The League of Non-Aligned Worlds is dissolved and reformed into the Interstellar Alliance, with Sheridan elected as its first President and continuing his command of the Rangers, who are to act as a galactic equivalent of United Nations peacekeepers. In the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000, and one million years into the future are shown, depicting Babylon 5&apos;s lasting influence throughout history. Amongst the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in the year AD 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a pre-industrial society, the loss and restoration of humanity&apos;s knowledge of space travel, and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth&apos;s sun goes nova. [ Season 5 – year 2262 ] [ List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 5: The Wheel of Fire ] In 2262, Earthforce Captain Elizabeth Lochley is appointed to command Babylon 5. The station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue telepaths running from the Psi Corps, resulting in conflict. G&apos;Kar, former Narn ambassador to Babylon 5, becomes unwillingly a spiritual icon after a book is published that he wrote while incarcerated during the Narn-Centauri War. The Drakh, former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy, take control of Regent Virini on Centauri Prime through a parasitic creature called a Keeper, then incite a war between the Centauri and the Interstellar Alliance, in order to isolate the Centauri from the Alliance and gain a malleable homeworld for themselves. Centauri Prime is devastated by Narn and Drazi warships and Londo Mollari becomes emperor, accepting a Drakh Keeper under threat of the complete nuclear destruction of the planet. (Portions of the end of his reign are seen in various prescient visions throughout the series; they show Mollari and former nemesis (and later friend) G&apos;Kar sixteen years in the future dying at each other&apos;s throats, seemingly out of their grudge. It is gradually revealed that there was a much more friendly subtext, with Mollari having become a slave to the drakh rule and being tired of life; his Drakh Keeper awakens and strangles G&apos;Kar in return. Vir Cotto, Mollari&apos;s loyal and more moral aide, succeeds him as emperor, free of Drakh influence. Sheridan and Delenn marry and move to Minbar, along with the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance. G&apos;Kar leaves Babylon 5 to escape his unwanted fame and explore the rim. Garibaldi also marries and settles down on Mars. Most of the other main characters leave B5. Nineteen years later on the verge of death, Sheridan takes a final trip to the obsolete Babylon 5 station before its decommissioning. Sheridan apparently dies but is claimed by the First Ones, who invite him to join them on a journey beyond the rim of the galaxy. Babylon 5 station is destroyed in a demolition shortly after Sheridan&apos;s departure, its existence no longer necessary as the Alliance has taken over its diplomatic purposes. This final episode features a cameo by Straczynski as the technician who switches off the lights before Babylon 5 is demolished. [ Themes ] Throughout its run, Babylon 5 found ways to portray themes relevant to modern and historical social issues. It marked several firsts in television science fiction, such as the exploration of the political and social landscapes of the first human colonies, their interactions with Earth, and the underlying tensions. Babylon 5 was also one of the first television science fiction shows to denotatively refer to a same-sex relationship.

The story begins in the aftermath of a war which brought the human race to the brink of extinction, caused by a misunderstanding during a first contact situation.

Wars between separate alien civilizations are featured. The conflict between the Narn and the Centauri is followed from its beginnings as a minor territorial dispute amplified by historical animosity, through to its end, in which weapons of mass destruction are employed to subjugate and enslave an entire planet. The war is an attempt to portray a more sobering kind of conflict than usually seen on science fiction television. Informed by the events of the first Gulf War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Soviet invasion of Prague, the intent was to recreate these moments when &quot; the world held its breath &quot; and the emotional core of the conflict was the disbelief that the situation could have occurred at all, and the desperation to find a way to bring it to an end.

Kosh sacrifices his life for a first victory against the Shadows. John Sheridan is ready to die at Z&apos;ha&apos;dum. Delenn is ready to die in the starfire wheel to restore Minbari society. Marcus Cole gives his life to save Susan Ivanova. Londo Mollari willingly accepts complete enslavement by a Drakh keeper to save the Centauri from annihilation. Many minor characters also willingly give their lives such as the crew of Drazi or Minbari ships in the final confrontation with the Shadows to save the Army of Light&apos;s leaders, some Centauri staying back at the island of Selini to allow the destruction of the Shadow warships, and so on. &quot; Some of us must be sacrificed if all are to be saved. &quot; is the spiritual epiphany experienced by G&apos;Kar. This reflects the Vorlon philosophy in contrast to the self-interest philosophy of the Shadows. [ Dreams and visions ] The subliminal and subconscious play a very significant role in the Babylon 5 universe. Every single major character experiences, on at least one occasion, some altered state of consciousness in which he or she receives some sort of important mental message. This could either be one that further fleshes out the character for the benefit of the viewer, or one of transcendental and transpersonal nature that anticipates important further developments in the storyline. Some of these signs and portents resemble lucid dream s, but many are quite bizarre and &quot; dreamlike, &quot; frequently in a spiritual context. [ Addiction ] Substance abuse and its impact on human personalities also plays a significant role in the Babylon 5 storyline. The station&apos;s security chief, Michael Garibaldi, is a textbook relapsing-remitting alcoholic of the binge drinking type; he practices complete abstinence from alcohol throughout most of the series (with one notable exception ) until the middle of season five. He only recovers physically and socially and breaks the cycle at the end of the season. Dr. Stephen Franklin develops an (initially unrecognized) addiction to injectable stimulant drugs while trying to cope with the chronic stress and work overload in Medlab (stemming from the Markab extinction), and wanders off to the homeless and deprived in Brown Sector, where he suffers through a severe withdrawal syndrome. Executive Officer Susan Ivanova mentions that her father became an alcoholic after her mother had committed suicide after having been drugged by the authorities over a number of years. Captain Elizabeth Lochley tells Garibaldi that her father was an alcoholic and that she is a recovering alcoholic herself. { Season 5, Episode 19: The Wheel of Fire } Among the aliens, Londo Mollari is at least a heavy abuser of alcohol, mostly in the form of the Centauri national drink, Brivari (though in Centauri culture, sobriety, as opposed to drunkenness, is considered a vice). Numerous other references to substance abuse and drug dealing are scattered throughout the storyline, including Dust, a white powder with a black-market presence comparable to cocaine. &quot; Dust &quot; turns out to be a &quot; designer drug &quot; developed by Psi Corps and placed into the black market as an experiment to see if psychic abilities could be brought out in &quot; mundanes &quot; (non-telepaths).

Michael Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralised location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of &quot; [going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week, &quot; a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the &apos;&apos;Foundation&apos;&apos; series, Childhood&apos;s End, The Lord of the Rings, Dune and the &apos;&apos;Lensman&apos;&apos; series, Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly-ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become Babylon 5. [ J. Michael Straczynski J.

[ Format ] Described as a &quot; window on the future &quot; by series production designer John Iacovelli, [ 085393343729 ] { 0-7907-9132-3 } the story is set in the 23rd century on a large O&apos;Neill Colony named &quot; Babylon 5 &quot; —a five-mile-long, 2.5 million-ton rotating colony designed as a gathering place for the sentient species of the galaxy, in order to foster peace through diplomacy, trade, and cooperation. Instead, acting as a center of political intrigue and conflict, the station becomes the linchpin of a massive interstellar war. This is reflected in the opening monologue of each episode, which includes the words &quot; last, best hope for peace &quot; in season one, changing to &quot; last, best hope for victory &quot; by season three. The series consists of a coherent five-year story arc taking place over five seasons of 22 episodes each.

Unable to get word one way or the other from parent company Warner Bros., and unwilling to short-change the story and the fans, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season in order to allow for both eventualities. Straczynski identified three primary plot-threads which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth&apos;s slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the TNT network commissioned two Babylon 5 television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the Earth–Minbari War, and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, Crusade. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into Crusade, or the fifth season, were it to be given the greenlight. The intended series finale, &quot; Sleeping in Light &quot;, was filmed during season four as a precaution against cancellation.

Michael Straczinski to get a sense of the historical perspective of the major alien races, “so I knew if they were a peaceful people or a warring people, cold climate etc. and then I would interpret what kind of sensibility that called for.” Collaborating with other departments to establish co-ordinated visual themes for each race, a broad palette of colours was developed with Iacovelli, which he referred to as “spicy brights”. These warm shades of grey and secondary colours, such as certain blues for the Minbari, would often be included when designing both the costumes and relevant sets. As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as “surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors”, so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador Londo Mollari&apos;s purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly coloured as Bruice felt &quot; Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker. &quot; Normally there was three changes of costume for the primary actors; one for on set, one for the stunt double and one on standby in case of &quot; coffee spills &quot;. For human civilians, garments were generally purchased off-the-rack and altered in various ways, such as removing lapels from jackets and shirts while rearranging closures, to suggest future fashions. For some of the main female characters a more couture approach was taken, as in the suits worn by Talia Winters which Bruice described as being designed and fitted to within “an inch of their life”. Costumes for the destitute residents of downbelow would be distressed through a combination of bleaching, sanding, dipping in dye baths and having stage blood added. Like many of the crew on the show, members of the costume department made an onscreen cameo. During the season 4 episode Atonement, the tailors and costume supervisor appeared as the Minbari women fitting Zack Allan for his new uniform as the recently promoted head of security. His complaints, and the subsequent stabbing of him with a needle by costume supervisor Kim Holly, was a light hearted reference to the previous security uniforms.

[ Prosthetic Makeup &amp; amp; Animatronics ] While the original pilot film featured some aliens which were puppets and animatronics, the decision was made early on in the show&apos;s production to portray most alien species as humanoid in appearance.

After the show&apos;s co-executive producer (Douglas Netter) and producer (John Copeland) approached Straczynski with the idea of producing the effects in-house, Straczynski agreed to replace Foundation, for season 4 and 5, once a new team had been established by Netter Digital, and an equal level of quality was assured, [ http://www.babylonpodcast.com/tag/jms/ Babylon Podcast #161: Interview with JMS, Part 1 J.

The show&apos;s success was seen as a great asset for Commodore Business Machines, the makers of the Amiga computer, and for NewTek, the company which made the Video Toaster card and its accompanying 3-D animation program, Lightwave 3D. On the strength of Babylon 5, Lightwave 3D would be employed on other shows, eventually becoming an industry standard.

Utilising Cubase software through an electronic keyboard, or for more complex pieces a light pen and graphics tablet, he would begin by developing the melodic content round which the ambient components and transitions were added. Using playbacks with digital samples of the appropriate instruments, such as a group of violins, he would decide which tracks to produce electronically or record acoustically. [ Babylon 5: Messages From Earth - The Interview Franke, Christopher 1995-04-23 http://christopherfranke.com/interview.html Rudy Koppl (interviewer) 2012-01-03 ] Utilizing the “acoustic dirt produced by live instruments and the ability to play so well between two semitones” and the “frequency range, dynamics and control” provided by synthesizers, he described his approach “as experimental friendly as possible without leaving the happy marriage between the orchestral and electronic sounds”. While highlighting Babylon 5 was produced on a “veritable shoestring”, and as such would have been unable to afford a full orchestral score every week, at least one reviewer felt that the soundtrack would have benefitted from a greater use of the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, which Franke established in 1991. [ More Babylon 5 CDs Than You Will Ever Need Bond, Jeff 1998-03-03 http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID%3D2383 Film Score Monthly 2011-12-28 ] Scores for the acoustic tracks were emailed to his Berlin scoring stage, and would require from four musicians to the full orchestra, with a maximum of 24 present at any one time. One of three conductors would also be required for any score that involved more than 6 musicians. Franke would direct recording sessions via six fibre optic digital telephone lines to transmit and receive video, music and the SMPTE timecode. The final edit and mixing of the tracks would take place in his Los Angeles studio. Initially concerned composing for an episodic television show could become “annoying because of the repetition”, Franke found the evolving characters and story of Babylon 5 afforded him the opportunity to continually “push the envelope”. [ Assembling music written for the series&apos; final episode, Sleeping in Light succinctly encapsulates just how far Franke&apos;s sensibilities evolved over the course of Babylon 5&apos;s five-year production run -- the synthesizer textures and martial percussion so long a fixture of the series&apos; musical palette are now enhanced by strings and guitars that emphasize the deeply human emotional dimensions of the interstellar drama. Indeed, for all the series&apos; obvious emphasis on fantasy and otherworldly sounds, Franke never lost track of its earthbound soul. Epic in scope and scale, Sleeping in Light boasts a power few TV soundtracks achieve. ] A total of 24 episode and three television film soundtracks were released under Franke&apos;s record label, Sonic Images Records, between 1995 and 2001. These contain the musical scores in the same chronological order as they played in the corresponding episodes, or television films. Three compilation albums were also produced, containing extensively re-orchestrated and remixed musical passages taken from throughout the series to create more elaborate suites.

[ Mastering problems ] While the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then standard 4:3 aspect ratio to the widescreen formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions. After visiting Warner Bros. who were stretching the horizontal interval for an episode of Lois &amp; Clark, producer John Copeland convinced them to allow Babylon 5 to be shot in super 35mm film. “The idea being that we would telecine to 4:3 for the original broadcast of the series. But what it also gave us was a negative that had been shot for the new 16x9 wide screen format televisions that we knew were on the horizon.” [ Interview with John Copeland: page 4 Copeland, John 2008-06-04 http://www.themadgoner.com/B5/B5Scrolls/B5Scrolls.htm#Screen1_07_4 B5Scrolls 2012-01-12 ] [ The widescreen conversion thing was executive short sightedness at it&apos;s finest!!! We offered to do ALL of Babylon 5 in widescreen mode if Warner Bros would buy us a reference monitor so we could check our output. (only $5000 at the time) Ken Parkes (the &quot; Business affairs &quot; guy) and Netter (penny wise, but pound foolish) said no! So we did everything so it could be CROPPED to be widescreen! Each blamed the other by the way. Doug Netter said, &quot; Ken Parkes said no &quot;. Ken Parkes said, &quot; Doug Netter said no &quot;. SHEESH!!! So for $75 an episode they could have had AWESOME near Hi-Def. right 44em right ] Though the CGI scenes, and those containing live action combined with digital elements, could have been created in a suitable widescreen format, a cost saving decision was taken to produce them in the 4:3 aspect ratio. The intention was to then crop the top and bottom of the images, and upscale the resolution for any future widescreen release or transmission. In 2000 when the show was transferred to widescreen for airing on the Sci-Fi channel prior to a DVD release the plan was not followed, as John Copeland recalls, “They did another video hack and simply used a digital post production device like a DVE (Digital Video Enhancer) to blow the material up. They essentially stretched it approximately 1/3 to fill the larger aspect ratio.” The scenes containing live action ready to be composited with matte paintings, CGI animation etc. were delivered on tape already telecined to 4:3, and contained a high level of grain, which resulted in further image noise being present when enlarged and stretched for widescreen.
