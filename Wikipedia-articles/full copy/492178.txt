Magnolia acuminata map.png ] Magnolia acuminata, commonly called the cucumber tree (often spelled as a single word &quot; cucumbertree &quot; ), cucumber magnolia or blue magnolia, is one of the largest magnolia s, and one of the cold-hardiest. It is a large forest tree of the Eastern United States and Southern Ontario Canada. It is a tree that tends to occur singly as scattered specimens, rather than in groves. { Sternberg, G., &amp; Wilson, J. (2004). Native Trees for North American Landscapes. Portland, Oregon:Timber Press } The cucumber tree is native primarily within the Appalachian belt, including the Allegheny Plateau and Cumberland Plateau, up to western Pennsylvania and New York. There are also numerous disconnected outlying populations through much of the southeastern U.S., and a few small populations in Southern Ontario. In Canada, the cucumber tree is listed as an endangered species and is protected under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. { White, D.J. (2000). Update COSEWIC Status Report on the Cucumber Tree Magnolia acuminata in Canada. Committee on the Satus of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Ottawa, Ontario } The leaves are deciduous simple and alternate, oval to oblong, 12-25  cm long and 6-12  cm wide, with smooth margins and downy on the underside. They come in two forms, acuminate at both ends, or moderately cordate at the base (these are usually only formed high in the tree). The fruit of &apos;&apos;Magnolia acuminata&apos;&apos; Unlike most magnolias, the flower s are not showy. They are typically small, yellow-green, and borne high in the tree in April through June. The name Cucumber tree comes from the unripe fruit, which is green and often shaped like a small cucumber; the fruit matures to a dark red color and is 6-8  cm long and 4  cm broad, with the individual carpels splitting open to release the bright red seed s, 10-60 per fruit. The ripe fruit is a striking reddish orange color. [ Uses and cultivation ] Cucumber trees are excellent shade trees for park s and garden s, though they are not recommended for use as street trees. In cultivation, they typically only grow 15-20 m (50-75 feet) tall, although they reach over 30 m (100 feet) in ideal forest situations. They can become quite massive: the United States national champion in Stark County, Ohio measures more than seven feet (2 m) in diameter (although only 79 ft or 24 m tall). They grow best in deep, moist, well-drained soil s that are slightly acidic although they are tolerant of alkali ne soils. They are tricky to transplant due to their coarse, fleshy root system and should be planted shallow and moved in early spring with a good soil ball. In the timber trade, this tree is interchangeable with that of the related tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera). Magnolia acuminata has been used in hybridizing new varieties that share its yellow flower color and cold hardiness [ References ] [ External links ] &apos;&apos;Magnolia acuminata&apos;&apos; images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu Flora of North America: &apos;&apos;Magnolia acuminata&apos;&apos; Flora of N.Amer-RangeMap: &apos;&apos;Magnolia acuminata&apos;&apos; NCRS: USDA Plants Profile: &apos;&apos;Magnolia acuminata&apos;&apos; acuminata Category:Trees of Appalachia U.S. Category:Trees of humid continental climate Category:Trees of Ontario Category:Trees of Indiana Category:Trees of New York Category:Trees of Ohio Category:Trees of Pennsylvania Category:Trees of West Virginia Category:Trees of Illinois Category:Trees of Missouri Category:Trees of Michigan Category:Trees of Oklahoma Category:Trees of Alabama Category:Trees of Arkansas Category:Trees of Florida Category:Trees of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Trees of Kentucky Category:Trees of Louisiana Category:Trees of Maryland Category:Trees of Mississippi Category:Trees of North Carolina Category:Trees of South Carolina Category:Trees of Tennessee Category:Trees of Virginia Category:Plants described in 1759 de:Gurken-Magnolie es:Magnolia acuminata la:Magnolia acuminata koi:Magnolia acuminata pl:Magnolia drzewiasta ru:Магнолия длиннозаострённая udm:Magnolia acuminata
