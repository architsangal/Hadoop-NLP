Industrial hemp products are made from Cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fiber. To satisfy the UN Narcotics Convention, some hemp varieties have been developed which contain minimal levels of THC (Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the psychoactive molecules that produces the &quot; high &quot; associated with marijuana. The psychoactive product consists of dried flowers of plants selectively bred to produce high levels of THC and other psychoactive chemicals. Various extracts including hashish and hash oil are also produced from the plant. { Erowid. 2006. &apos;&apos;Cannabis&apos;&apos; Basics.

The leaves are palmately compound or digitate, with serrate leaflet s. [ http://waynesword.palomar.edu/termlf1.htm Leaf Terminology (Part 1) Waynesword.palomar.edu 2011-02-17 ] The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite leaf arrangement and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant. Underside of &apos;&apos;Cannabis sativa&apos;&apos; leaf, showing diagnostic venation The leaves have a peculiar and diagnostic venation pattern that enables persons poorly familiar with the plant to distinguish a Cannabis leaf from unrelated species that have confusingly similar leaves (see illustration). As is common in serrated leaves, each serration has a central vein extending to its tip. However,the serration vein originates from lower down the central vein of the leaflet, typically opposite to the position of, not the first notch down, but the next notch. This means that on its way from the midrib of the leaflet to the point of the serration, the vein serving the tip of the serration passes close by the intervening notch. Sometimes the vein will actually pass tangent to the notch, but often it will pass by at a small distance, and when that happens a spur vein (occasionally a pair of such spur veins) branches off and joins the leaf margin at the deepest point of the notch. This venation pattern varies slightly among varieties, but in general it enables one to tell Cannabis leaves from superficially similar leaves without difficulty and without special equipment. Tiny samples of Cannabis plants also can be identified with precision by microscopic examination of leaf cells and similar features, but that requires special expertise and equipment. { Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub.

It is also known as hemp, although this term is often used to refer only to varieties of Cannabis cultivated for non-drug use. Cannabis plants produce a group of chemicals called cannabinoids, which produce mental and physical effects when consumed. Cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other compounds are secreted by glandular trichomes that occur most abundantly on the floral calyxes and bract s of female plants. { Mahlberg, Paul G. and Eun Soo Kim. 2001.

Cannabis plants produce a unique family of terpeno-phenolic compounds called cannabinoids, which produce the &quot; high &quot; one experiences from smoking marijuana. The two cannabinoids usually produced in greatest abundance are cannabidiol ( CBD ) and/or Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), but only THC is psychoactive [ March 2012 ]. Since the early 1970s, Cannabis plants have been categorized by their chemical phenotype or &quot; chemotype, &quot; based on the overall amount of THC produced, and on the ratio of THC to CBD. { Small, E. and H. D. Beckstead. 1973. Common cannabinoid phenotypes in 350 stocks of Cannabis. Lloydia 36: 144–165. } Although overall cannabinoid production is influenced by environmental factors, the THC/CBD ratio is genetically determined and remains fixed throughout the life of a plant. { Etienne P. M. de Meijer, M. Bagatta, A. Carboni, P. Crucitti, V. M. Cristiana Moliterni, P. Ranalli, and G. Mandolino. 2003. The Inheritance of Chemical Phenotype in &apos;&apos;Cannabis sativa&apos;&apos; L.

Retrieved on 23 February 2007 } Non-drug plants produce relatively low levels of THC and high levels of CBD, while drug plants produce high levels of THC and low levels of CBD. When plants of these two chemotypes cross-pollinate, the plants in the first filial (F 1 ) generation have an intermediate chemotype and produce similar amounts of CBD and THC. Female plants of this chemotype may produce enough THC to be utilized for drug production. { Hillig, Karl W. and Paul G. Mahlberg. 2004.

This is a contentious issue because there is no universally accepted definition of a species. { Small, E. 1979. Fundamental aspects of the species problem in biology. In: The Species Problem in Cannabis, vol. 1: Science. Corpus Information Services, Toronto, Canada, pp. 5–63. ISBN 0-919217-11-7 } One widely applied criterion for species recognition is that species are &quot; groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups. &quot; { Rieger, R., A. Michaelis, and M. M. Green. 1991. Glossary of Genetics, 5th ed. Springer-Verlag, pp. 458–459. ISBN 0-387-52054-6 } Populations that are physiologically capable of interbreeding, but morphologically or genetically divergent and isolated by geography or ecology, are sometimes considered to be separate species. Physiological barriers to reproduction are not known to occur within Cannabis, and plants from widely divergent sources are interfertile. However, physical barriers to gene exchange (such as the Himalayan mountain range) might have enabled Cannabis gene pools to diverge before the onset of human intervention, resulting in speciation. { Hillig, Karl W. 2005.

Marijuana with relatively high ratios of CBD:THC is less likely to induce anxiety than vice versa. This might partially be due to CBD&apos;s antagonist effects at the cannabinoid receptor, compared to THC&apos;s partial agonist effect. [ Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing The Science Base J.E. Joy, S. J. Watson, Jr., and J.A. Benson, Jr, Washington D.C National Academy of Sciences Press 1999 http://books.nap.edu/html/marimed/ 0-585-05800-8 ] The relatively large amount of CBD contained in Cannabis Sativa, means, compared to an Indica, the effects are modulated significantly. The effects of Sativa are well known for its cerebral high, hence used daytime as medical cannabis, while Indica are well known for its sedative effects and preferred night time as medical cannabis. [ Early classifications ] Relative size of varieties of &apos;&apos;Cannabis&apos;&apos; The Cannabis genus was first classified using the &quot; modern &quot; system of taxonomic nomenclature by Carolus Linnaeus in 1753, who devised the system still in use for the naming of species. { Linnaeus, C. 1753. Species Plantarum 2: 1027. Salvius, Stockholm. [Facsimile edition, 1957–1959. Ray Society, London, U.K.] } He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named Cannabis sativa L. (L. stands for Linnaeus, and indicates the authority who first named the species). Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. In 1785, noted evolutionary biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck published a description of a second species of Cannabis, which he named Cannabis indica Lam. { de Lamarck, J.B. 1785. Encyclopédie Méthodique de Botanique, vol. 1, pt. 2. Paris, France, pp. 694–695 } Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. He described C. indica as having poorer fiber quality than C. sativa, but greater utility as an inebriant. Additional Cannabis species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names Cannabis chinensis Delile, and Cannabis gigantea Delile ex Vilmorin. { Small, E. and A. Cronquist. 1976. A practical and natural taxonomy for Cannabis. Taxon 25(4): 405–435. } However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept was still widely accepted, except in the Soviet Union where Cannabis continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name Cannabis indica was listed in various Pharmacopoeia s, and was widely used to designate Cannabis suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations. { Winek, C. L. 1977. Some historical aspects of marijuana. Clinical Toxicology 10(2): 243-253. } [ 20th century ] &apos;&apos;Cannabis ruderalis&apos;&apos; In 1924, Russian botanist D.E. Janichevsky concluded that ruderal Cannabis in central Russia is either a variety of C. sativa or a separate species, and proposed C. sativa L. var. ruderalis Janisch. and Cannabis ruderalis Janisch. as alternative names. In 1929, renowned plant explorer Nikolai Vavilov assigned wild or feral populations of Cannabis in Afghanistan to C. indica Lam. var. kafiristanica Vav., and ruderal populations in Europe to C. sativa L. var. spontanea Vav. In 1940, Russian botanists Serebriakova and Sizov proposed a complex classification in which they also recognized C. sativa and C. indica as separate species. Within C. sativa they recognized two subspecies: C. sativa L. subsp. culta Serebr. (consisting of cultivated plants), and C. sativa L. subsp. spontanea (Vav.) Serebr. (consisting of wild or feral plants). Serebriakova and Sizov split the two C. sativa subspecies into 13 varieties, including four distinct groups within subspecies culta. However, they did not divide C. indica into subspecies or varieties. { Serebriakova T. Ya. and I. A. Sizov. 1940. Cannabinaceae Lindl. In: Vavilov N. I. (ed.), Kulturnaya Flora SSSR, vol. 5, Moscow-Leningrad, USSR, pp. 1–53. [in Russian] } This excessive splitting of C. sativa proved too unwieldy, and never gained many adherents. In the 1970s, the taxonomic classification of Cannabis took on added significance in North America. Laws prohibiting Cannabis in the United States and Canada specifically named products of C. sativa as prohibited materials. Enterprising attorneys for the defense in a few drug busts argued that the seized Cannabis material may not have been C. sativa, and was therefore not prohibited by law. Attorneys on both sides recruited botanists to provide expert testimony. Among those testifying for the prosecution was Dr. Ernest Small, while Dr. Richard E. Schultes and others testified for the defense. The botanists engaged in heated debate (outside of court), and both camps impugned the other&apos;s integrity. The defense attorneys were not often successful in winning their case, because the intent of the law was clear. { Watts, G. 2006. &apos;&apos;Cannabis&apos;&apos; confusions. BMJ 332: 175-176. Retrieved on 23 February 2007 } In 1976, Canadian botanist Ernest Small { Ernest Small (biography). National Research Council Canada. Retrieved on 23 February 2007 } and American taxonomist Arthur Cronquist published a taxonomic revision that recognizes a single species of Cannabis with two subspecies: C. sativa L. subsp. sativa, and C. sativa L. subsp. indica (Lam.) Small &amp; Cronq. The authors hypothesized that the two subspecies diverged primarily as a result of human selection; C. sativa subsp. sativa was presumably selected for traits that enhance fiber or seed production, whereas C. sativa subsp. indica was primarily selected for drug production. Within these two subspecies, Small and Cronquist described C. sativa L. subsp. sativa var. spontanea Vav. as a wild or escaped variety of low-intoxicant Cannabis, and C. sativa subsp. indica var. kafiristanica (Vav.) Small &amp; Cronq. as a wild or escaped variety of the high-intoxicant type. This classification was based on several factors including interfertility, chromosome uniformity, chemotype, and numerical analysis of phenotypic characters. { Small, E., P. Y. Jui, and L. P. Lefkovitch. 1976. A numerical taxonomic analysis of Cannabis with special reference to species delimitation. Systematic Botany 1(1): 67-84. } Professors William Emboden, Loran Anderson, and Harvard botanist Richard E. Schultes and coworkers also conducted taxonomic studies of Cannabis in the 1970s, and concluded that stable morphological differences exist that support recognition of at least three species, C. sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis. { Schultes, R. E., W. M. Klein, T. Plowman, and T. E. Lockwood. 1974. Cannabis: an example of taxonomic neglect. Harvard University Botanical Museum Leaflets 23: 337–367. } { Anderson, L. C. 1974.

Cannabis – a polytypic genus. Economic Botany 28: 304-310. } For Schultes, this was a reversal of his previous interpretation that Cannabis is monotypic, with only a single species. { Schultes, R. E. 1970. Random thoughts and queries on the botany of Cannabis. In: Joyce, C. R. B. and Curry, S. H. (eds), The Botany and Chemistry of Cannabis. J. &amp; A. Churchill, London, pp. 11–38. } According to Schultes&apos; and Anderson&apos;s descriptions, C. sativa is tall and laxly branched with relatively narrow leaflets, C. indica is shorter, conical in shape, and has relatively wide leaflets, and C. ruderalis is short, branchless, and grows wild in central Asia. This taxonomic interpretation was embraced by Cannabis aficionados who commonly distinguish narrow-leafed &quot; sativa &quot; drug strains from wide-leafed &quot; indica &quot; drug strains. { Interview with Robert Connell Clarke. 1 Jan 2005.

They also commented that these analyses confirm the continuity of the Cannabis gene pool throughout the studied accessions, and provide further confirmation that the genus comprises a single species, although theirs was not a systematic study per se. Karl W. Hillig, a graduate student in the laboratory of long-time Cannabis researcher Paul G. Mahlberg { Dr. Paul G. Mahlberg&apos;s &apos;&apos;Cannabis&apos;&apos; Research. North American Industrial Hemp Council. Retrieved on 23 February 2007 } at Indiana University, conducted a systematic investigation of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation among 157 Cannabis accessions of known geographic origin, including fiber, drug, and feral populations. In 2004, Hillig and Mahlberg published a chemotaxomic analysis of cannabinoid variation in their Cannabis germplasm collection. They used gas chromatography to determine cannabinoid content and to infer allele frequencies of the gene that controls CBD and THC production within the studied populations, and concluded that the patterns of cannabinoid variation support recognition of C. sativa and C. indica as separate species, but not C. ruderalis. The authors assigned fiber/seed landraces and feral populations from Europe, central Asia, and Asia Minor to C. sativa. Narrow-leaflet and wide-leaflet drug accessions, southern and eastern Asian hemp accessions, and feral Himalayan populations were assigned to C. indica. In 2005, Hillig published a genetic analysis of the same set of accessions (this paper was the first in the series, but was delayed in publication), and proposed a three-species classification, recognizing C. sativa, C. indica, and (tentatively) C. ruderalis. In his doctoral dissertation published the same year, Hillig stated that principal components analysis of phenotypic (morphological) traits failed to differentiate the putative species, but that canonical variates analysis resulted in a high degree of discrimination of the putative species and infraspecific taxa. { Hillig, Karl William. 2005.

He also concluded there is little support to treat C. ruderalis as a separate species from C. sativa at this time, but more research on wild and weedy populations is needed because they were underrepresented in their collection.

Cannabis aficionados recognize three distinct types based on such factors as morphology, native range, aroma, and subjective psychoactive characteristics. &quot; Sativa &quot; is the term used to describe the most widespread variety, which is usually tall, laxly branched, and found in warm lowland regions. &quot; Indica &quot; is used to designate shorter, bushier plants adapted to cooler climates and highland environments. &quot; Ruderalis &quot; is the term used to describe the short plants that grow wild in Europe and central Asia. Breeders, seed companies, and cultivators of drug type Cannabis often describe the ancestry or gross phenotypic characteristics of cultivar s by categorizing them as &quot; pure indica, &quot; &quot; mostly indica, &quot; &quot; indica/sativa, &quot; &quot; mostly sativa &quot;, or &quot; pure sativa. &quot; One of the most popular and potent sativas in Africa is Malawi Gold, locally known as chamba.

Dioecious varieties are also preferred for textile fiber production, whereas monoecious varieties are preferred for pulp and paper production. It has been suggested that the presence of monoecy can be used to differentiate licit crops of monoecious hemp from illicit drug crops. However, the so-called &quot; sativa &quot; drug strains often produce monoecious individuals, probably as a result of inbreeding. [ Mechanisms of sex determination ] Cannabis has been described as having one of the most complicated mechanisms of sex determination among the dioecious plants. Many models have been proposed to explain sex determination in Cannabis. Based on studies of sex reversal in hemp, it was first reported by K. Hirata in 1924 that an XY sex-determination system is present. At the time, the XY system was the only known system of sex determination. The X:A system was first described in Drosophila spp in 1925. { Bridges, C. B. 1925. Sex in relation to chromosomes and genes. American Naturalist 59: 127-137. } Soon thereafter, Schaffner disputed Hirata&apos;s interpretation, { Schaffner, J. H. 1929. Heredity and sex. Ohio Journal of Science 29 (1): 289-300. } and published results from his own studies of sex reversal in hemp, concluding that an X:A system was in use and that furthermore sex was strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Since then, many different types of sex determination systems have been discovered, particularly in plants. Dioecy is relatively uncommon in the plant kingdom, and a very low percentage of dioecious plant species have been determined to use the XY system. In most cases where the XY system is found it is believed to have evolved recently and independently. { Negrutiu, I., B. Vyskot, N. Barbacar, S. Georgiev, and F. Moneger. 2001. Dioecious plants; a key to the early events of sex chromosome evolution. Plant Physiology 127 (4): 418-424. } Since the 1920s, a number of sex determination models have been proposed for Cannabis. Ainsworth describes sex determination in the genus as using &quot; an X/autosome dosage type &quot;. A male hemp plant. Dense raceme of carpellate flowers typical of drug-type varieties of &apos;&apos;Cannabis&apos;&apos;. The question of whether heteromorphic sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a karyotype. Cannabis was one of the first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards (see History of Cytogenetics ). Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious &quot; Kentucky &quot; hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious &quot; Kentucky &quot; hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious &quot; Kentucky &quot; hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX. { Menzel, Margaret Y. 1964. Meiotic chromosomes of monoecious Kentucky hemp (Cannabis sativa). Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 91 (3): 193-205. } According to other researchers, no modern karyotype of Cannabis had been published as of 1996. { Shao Hong and Robert C. Clarke. 1996. Taxonomic studies of Cannabis in China. Journal of the International Hemp Association 3 (2): 55-60.

Euphytica 127: 209-218. } Ainsworth commented on these findings, stating, &quot; It is not surprising that male-associated markers are relatively abundant. In dioecious plants where sex chromosomes have not been identified, markers for maleness indicate either the presence of sex chromosomes which have not been distinguished by cytological methods or that the marker is tightly linked to a gene involved in sex determination. &quot; Environmental sex determination is known to occur in a variety of species. { Tanurdzic, M. and J. A. Banks. 2004. Sex-determining mechanisms in land plants. Plant Cell 16 (suppl.): S61-71. } Many researchers have suggested that sex in Cannabis is determined or strongly influenced by environmental factors. Ainsworth reviews that treatment with auxin and ethylene have feminizing effects, and that treatment with cytokinins and gibberellins have masculinizing effects. It has been reported that sex can be reversed in Cannabis using chemical treatment. { Mohan Ram, H. Y., and R. Sett. 1982.

Narrated by many historical and native accounts cannabis is pounded by the Sikhs, especially during religious festivals like Hola Mohalla.[43]Even today, Nihang Sikhs gather in their thousands at Anandpur, on the occasion of the festival of Hola Mohalla and display their martial skills and of course cannabis is pounded by the Nihang Sikhs. This tradition has been in place since the time of Guru Gobind Singh. Their fighting style is referred to as shastar vidiya, which is among the most intimidating and brutal martial art. The compositions from the Sri Dasam Granth are used in unison with the battle maneuvers. In modern times the Rastafari movement has embraced Cannabis as a sacrament.
