Laura Del Col, West Virginia University. } Child labour refers to the employment of children at regular and sustained labour. This practice is considered exploitative by many international organizations and is illegal in many countries. Child labour was employed to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the advent of universal schooling, with changes in working conditions during the industrial revolution, and with the emergence of the concepts of workers &apos; and children&apos;s rights. In many developed countries, it is considered inappropriate or exploitative if a child below a certain age works (excluding household chores, in a family shop, or school-related work).

This minimum age depends on the country and the type of work involved. States ratifying the Minimum Age Convention adopted by the International Labor Organization in 1973, have adopted minimum ages varying from 14 to 16. Child labor laws in the United States set the minimum age to work in an establishment without restrictions and without parents&apos; consent at age 16, [ http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/youthlabor/ Youth and Labor in America United States Department of 2010-03-21 ] except for the agricultural industry where children as young as 12 years of age can work in the fields for an unlimited number of non-school hours. See Children&apos;s Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act). The incidence of child labour in the world decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the World Bank. { Norberg, Johan (2007), Världens välfärd (Stockholm: Government Offices of Sweden), p. 58 } [ Historical ] { Macon, Georgia, 1909 } During the Industrial Revolution, children as young as four were employed in production factories with dangerous, and often fatal, working conditions. { E. P. Thompson The Making of the English Working Class, (Penguin, 1968), pp. 366–7 } Based on this understanding of the use of children as labourers, it is now considered by wealthy countries to be a human rights violation, and is outlawed, while some poorer countries may allow or tolerate child labour. Child labour can also be defined as the full-time employment of children who are under a minimum legal age. The Victorian era became notorious for employing young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps. { Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England } Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship, Charles Dickens for example worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in debtor&apos;s prison. The children of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay, { Barbara Daniels, Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era } earning 10-20% of an adult male&apos;s wage. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mill s were described as children. { &quot; Child Labor and the Division of Labor in the Early English Cotton Mills &quot;.

Some children undertook work as apprentice s to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servant s (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80 hour weeks. In the early 1900s, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133°F). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung aliments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00 P.M. to 3:00 A.M. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.

As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the &quot; Short Time Committees &quot; in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10 hour working days. An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900. { &quot; The Industrial Revolution &quot;. The Web Institute for Teachers. } In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States. { &quot; Photographs of Lewis Hine: Documentation of Child Labor &quot;.

Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants (where they may also work as waiters). Other children are forced to do tedious and repetitive jobs such as assembling boxes, polishing shoes, stocking a store&apos;s products, or cleaning.

That being so, they caution against the use of a legislative ban against child labour, and argue that should be used only when there is reason to believe that a ban on child labour will cause adult wages to rise and so compensate adequately the households of the poor children.

Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation. { Hugh Cunningham, &quot; The Employment and Unemployment of Children in England c.1680–1851. &quot; Past and Present.

Further, the usefulness of the experience of the industrial revolution in making predictions about current trends has been disputed. Social historian Hugh Cunningham, author of Children and Childhood in Western Society Since 1500, notes that: &quot; Fifty years ago it might have been assumed that, just as child labour had declined in the developed world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so it would also, in a trickle-down fashion, in the rest of the world. Its failure to do that, and its re-emergence in the developed world, raise questions about its role in any economy, whether national or global. &quot; Hugh Cunningham, &quot; The decline of child labor: labor markets and family economies in Europe and North America since 1830 &quot;, Economic History Review, 2000. { According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the } { University of Houston, in an article published by the } { Cato Institute, a } { libertarian think-tank operating in Washington D.C., &quot; it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools.
