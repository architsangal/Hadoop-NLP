[ article February 2012 ] [ February 2012 ] L-3 MPRI, is a global provider of private military contractor services. It offers a wide range of professional services to both public and private customers, most notably the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Law Enforcement organizations, foreign governments, government agencies and commercial businesses. The firm is based in Alexandria, Virginia. L-3 MPRI&apos;s President is retired US Army General Bantz J. Craddock. { http://www.mpri.com/esite/index.php/content/about/craddock/ } [ History ] Incorporated in 1987 — Founded as MPRI by eight former senior military leaders. Former Army Chief of Staff Carl E. Vuono joined MPRI in 1993. General William F. Kernan of the U.S. Army also joined the firm after his military service. Acquired in June 2000 — L-3 MPRI is a division of L-3 Communications Corporation. L-3 specializes in Command, Control and Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C3ISR), government services, training and simulation, and aircraft modernization and maintenance, and has a broad base of electronic systems. L-3 is also a major provider of homeland defense products and services. [ Training ] MPRI began by almost exclusively employing retired U.S. military personnel. It used retired military personnel and current U.S. National Guard or reservists, to run Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at more than 200 universities. Other employees have worked in U.S. Army recruitment centers and trained U.S. soldiers. With offices in other countries, employees also have trained foreign armies at ranges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kuwait, and South Africa. MPRI reassures their clients with services from teams of military leaders, law enforcement officers, strategic analysts, disaster management experts, and diplomatic and private sector leaders. In 1995-96 before Operation Storm, there is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that MPRI prepared and trained the Croatian Army for its offensive to retake the Krajina region. In April 1995, Democracy Transition Assistance Program (DTAP) training began at the &quot; Petar Zrinski &quot; military school in Zagreb. [ Singer P.W.

Adams Parameters Summer 1999 103–16 United States Army War College http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/99summer/adams.htm. ] { | } Its engagement was approved by the U.S. government. Local forces in Croatia were referred to MPRI by the United States Department of Defense and used their training. 120 African leaders and more than 5,500 African troops have been trained by MPRI on security issues.

The contract began with restructuring the Ministry of Defence and claimed to create a combined logistics system between the initial separate Muslim and Croat armies. While the contractors claimed they had combined the logistics system, assessments made in the 2000s disagreed: ‘the force integration of the Federation army has been superficial and limited to some cooperation at the HQ level.’ The contract also included development of training policy, assisting with unit training, establishment of a central combat training centre, including a school at Hadzici and a field combat simulation centre at Livno. While the facilities may have been constructed, whether the training and logistics systems changes lasted is uncertain, given Maxwell’s assessment. { Rohan Maxwell, &apos;Bosnia and Herzegovina 1.1,&apos; paper given at the &apos;New Armies from Old&apos; Conference, Carlisle Barracks, PA, 2010 } MPRI trained security forces used to defeat an attack on the presidential palace of Equatorial Guinea &apos;s long-serving dictator Teodoro Obiang Nguema. { More of the World&apos;s Worst Dictators. Number 14. } { Parade. } [ Defense contracts ] In the early 1990s, MPRI signeed a 5-year contract with the U.S. State Department involving the shipment of donated medical supplies and food to former Soviet states. In 1998, the government of Equatorial Guinea asked MPRI to evaluate its defense systems, particularly its need for a coast guard to protect its oil reserves. In order to take the job, MPRI needed a license from the U.S. State Department. The Clinton administration rejected the request, citing the West African nation&apos;s human rights record. In 2000, after lobbying by MPRI, the State Department issued the license. MPRI did not reveal the terms of its contract with Equatorial Guinea.

The contract expired in March 2001 and was not renewed allegedly because the Colombian Defense Ministry and its officers were upset by recommendations such as &quot; Hit the enemy with a closed fist; do not poke at him with fingers of an open hand. &quot; (Note: this is a maxim of World War II German General Heinz Guderian.)
