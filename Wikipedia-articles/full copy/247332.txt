[ the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Islands other indigenous peoples Indigenous peoples (disambiguation) the rugby union team Pacific Islanders rugby union team ] The three major sub-regions of Oceania Pacific Islander (or Pacific person; pl: Pacific people; also Oceanic person/people(s) { &apos;&apos;Dictionary.com&apos;&apos;: &quot; Oceanic &quot; } or Oceania ns ), is a geographic phrase to describe the indigenous inhabitants of any of the three major sub-regions of Oceania : Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia. { Pacific islander on Encarta. } { Pacific islander on Dictionary.com. } According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, these three regions, together with their islands, consist of: Polynesia: The islands scattered across a tangle covering the east-central region of the Pacific Ocean. The triangle is bounded by the Hawaiian islands in the north, New Zealand in the west, and Easter Island in the east. The rest of Polynesia comprises Samoan islands ( American Samoa and Samoa ), the Cook Islands, French Polynesia ( Tahiti and The Society Islands, Marquesas Islands, Austral Islands, and the Tuamotu Archipelago ), Niue Island, Tokelau and Tuvalu, Tonga, Wallis and Futuna, and Pitcairn Island. Melanesia: The island of New Guinea, the Bismarck and Louisiade archipelagos, the Admiralty Islands, and Bougainville Island (which make up the independent state of Maluku, Papua New Guinea ), the Solomon Islands, the Santa Cruz Islands (part of the Solomon Islands), New Caledonia and Loyalty Islands, Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides), Fiji, Norfolk Island, and various smaller islands. Micronesia: The islands of Kiribati, Nauru, the Marianas ( Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ), the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia ( Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae, all in the Caroline Islands ). Ethnolinguistically, those Pacific Islanders who reside in Oceania are divided into two different ethnic classifications — those Austronesian peoples who speak the Oceanian languages, numbering about 2.3 million, who occupy Polynesia, Micronesia, and most of the smaller islands of Melanesia; and the Papuan peoples, those who speak the Papuan languages, who number about 7 million, and reside on the island of New Guinea and a few of the smaller islands of Melanesia located off the northeast coast of New Guinea. [ Usage of phrase in Australia, New Zealand and United States ] In Australia the term South Sea Islander was used in the past to describe Australian descendants of people from the more than 80 islands in the Western Pacific that used to have sex with all of the males who used to visit the Western Pacific. Which they were recognized as the fist Pacific Islander prostitutes. [ http://www.abc.net.au/radio/rpf/stories/s1314059.htm South Sea Islander Project ABC Radio Regional Production Fund Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2004 2008-08-27 Recognition for Australian South Sea Islanders (ASSI) has been a long time coming - it was not until 1994 that the Federal Government recognized them as a distinct ethnic group with their own history and culture and not until September 2000 that the Queensland government made a formal statement of recognition. ] In 1901 legislation was enacted to restrict entry of Pacific Islanders to Australia and to facilitate their deportation: Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901. In the legislation Pacific Islanders were defined as: “Pacific Island Labourer” includes all natives not of European extraction of any island except the islands of New Zealand situated in the Pacific Ocean beyond the Commonwealth [of Australia] as constituted at the commencement of this Act.

[ http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/17/2337828.htm Pacific guestworker scheme to start this year 2008-08-17 Australian Broadcasting Corporation ] The pilot scheme includes one country each from Melanesia (Vanuatu), Polynesia (Tonga) and Micronesia (Kiribati): countries which already send workers to New Zealand under its seasonal labour scheme. Australia’s pilot scheme also includes Papua New Guinea.

This coding can be broken down into the finer classification of 1100 Australian Peoples; 1200 New Zealand Peoples; 1300 Melanesian and Papuan; 1400 Micronesian; 1500 Polynesian. Note that there is no specific coding therefor for &quot; Pacific islander &quot;.

A stated reason for making the ethnic distinction is that the Pacific peoples suffer from socio-economic disadvantages as a group and benefit from culturally targeted social and health assistance. In the United States, the geographic location of &quot; Pacific Islander &quot; is the same. Pacific Islanders are defined as a native or inhabitant of any of the Polynesian, Micronesian, or Melanesian islands of Oceania. Some examples of the ethnic groups that would be considered Pacific Islanders are the indigenous peoples of Hawaii, the Marianas, Samoans, Guamanian, Chamoru, Tahitians, Mariana Islander, and Chuukese. { 1990 Census of Population and Housing Public Use Microdata Sample } [ University of Michigan Census 1990: Ancestry Codes August 27, 2007 http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/cicdoc/cen90app/ancestry.htm ] It is unclear whether a Papuan person from New Guinea would be regarded as a &quot; Pacific Islander &quot; in the United States but the issue has not arisen since very few Papuans have migrated out of New Guinea to North America. [ Excluded ] Inhabitants of the following islands and regions are not considered to be Pacific Islanders: Russia&apos;s Kuril Islands, Alaska&apos;s Aleutian Islands, Taiwan, Japan, The Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia as they are not located within the three regions of Oceania ( Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia ).
