[ February 2008 March 2008 July 2010 November 2010 November 2010 ] Indian English is an umbrella term used to describe dialect s of the English language spoken primarily in the Republic of India. As a result of British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947, English is an official language of India and is widely used in both spoken and literary contexts. The rapid growth of India&apos;s economy towards the end of the 20th century led to large-scale population migration between regions of the Indian subcontinent and the establishment of English as a common lingua franca between those speaking diverse mother tongues. With the exception of the relatively small Anglo-Indian community and some families of full Indian ethnicity where English is the primary language spoken in the home, speakers of English in the Indian subcontinent learn it as a second language in school. In cities this is typically at English medium schools, but in smaller towns and villages instruction for most subjects is in the local language, with English language taught as a modular subject. Science and technical education is mostly undertaken in English and, as a result, most university graduates in these sectors are fairly proficient in English. { UGC, explaining its reasons for making it mandatory for all PhD theses to be submitted in English } Idiomatic forms derived from Indian literary and vernacular language have become assimilated into Indian English in differing ways according to the native language of speakers. Nevertheless, there remains general homogeneity in phonetics, vocabulary, and phraseology between variants of the Indian English dialect. [ Grammar ] The role of English within the complex multilingual society of India is far from straightforward: it is used across the country, by speakers with various degrees of proficiency; the grammar and phraseology may mimic that of the speaker&apos;s first language. While Indian speakers of English use idioms peculiar to their homeland, often literal translations of words and phrases from their native languages, this is far less common in proficient speakers, and the grammar itself tends to be quite close to that of Standard English, while exhibiting some features of American English. [ Phonology ] Indian accents vary greatly. Some Indians speak English with an accent very close to a Standard British ( Received Pronunciation ) accent (though not the same); others lean toward a more &apos;vernacular&apos;, native-tinted, accent for their English speech. [ Vowels ] In general, Indian English has fewer peculiarities in its vowel sounds than the consonants, especially as spoken by native speakers of languages like Hindi, the vowel phoneme system having some similarities with that of English. Among the distinctive features of the vowel-sounds employed by some Indian English speakers are: [ /æ/ ] [ /ɛ/ ] [ /æ/ ] [ /ɛ/ ] [ /æ/ ] [ January 2011 ] [ [fir] ] [ [fiə] ] [ [ˈkɒtedʒ] ] [ [ˈkɒtɨdʒ] ] [ [ʋɒz] ] [ [ʋas] ] [ [wəz] ] [ /d̪iː/ ] [ April 2008 ] [ /ʌ/ ] [ /ə/ ] [ /ɜː/ ] [ /ə/ ] [ a ] [ April 2008 ] [ /eɪ/ ] [ /oʊ/ ] [ [eː] ] [ [oː] ] [ /ɒ/ ] [ /ɔː/ ] [ /ɒ/ ] [ /ɔː/ ] [ /a/ ] [ /ɔː/ ] [ April 2008 ] Many Indian languages do not natively possess a separate phoneme (as in RP &lt; trap &gt; ). Thus, many speakers do not differentiate between the vowel sounds (as in &quot; dress &quot; ) and (as in &lt; trap &gt; ), except in cases where a minimal pair such as &lt; bed &gt; / &lt; bad &gt; exists in the vocabulary of the speaker. Such a speaker might pronounce &quot; tax &quot; like the first syllable of &quot; Texas &quot;. Wells, p. 627 Speakers of Southern languages and Sinhalese, which do differentiate and, do not have difficulty making this distinction. Eastern IE languages, notably Bengali does have the /æ/ sound for both the vowels ā আ (hāñcco—the sneezing sound—pronounced as hæñcco)and /e/ এ (henglā—greedy—pronounced as hængla). The vowel a অ has two sound values in Bengali:as au in aura (tatkāl) and as o ও (Kalikātā). It lacks the short vowel value for a অ (parāthā). Nowadays most Indian students learn English from childhood which enables them to produce almost all phonetics used in English. Chiefly in Punjab and Haryana states and western Uttar Pradesh, the short [ɛ] becomes lengthened and higher to long [eː], making &lt; pen &gt; sound like &lt; paenn &gt;. When a long vowel is followed by &quot; r &quot;, some speakers of Indian English usually use a monophthong, instead of the diphthong used for many such words in many other accents. Thus &quot; fear &quot; is pronounced instead of. Indian English often uses strong vowels where other accents would have unstressed syllables or words. Thus &quot; cottage &quot; may be pronounced rather than. A word such as &quot; was &quot; in the phrase &quot; I was going &quot; will be pronounced or in Indian English: in most other accents it would receive the unstressed realization. Another example is that many Indian English speakers often pronounce &lt; the &gt; as, irrespective of whether the definite article comes before a vowel or a consonant, or whether it is stressed or not. In native varieties of English, &lt; the &gt; is pronounced as [ðə] when it is unstressed and lies before a consonant, and as [ðiː] when it is before a vowel or when stressed even before a consonant. Continuing the above point, the indefinite article &lt; a &gt; is often pronounced by many Indian English speakers as [eː], irrespective of whether it is stressed or unstressed. In native varieties of English, &lt; a &gt; is pronounced as [ə] when unstressed and as [eɪ] when stressed. The RP vowels, and might be realized as in Indian English. Wells, p. 626 Bengalis often pronounce all these vowels as, including the &lt; r &gt; -colored versions of these vowels. Thus, &lt; firm &gt; may be pronounced the same as [farm].. &quot; Van &quot; as bhan etc. General Indian English realizes (as in &lt; face &gt; ) and (as in &lt; goat &gt; ) as long monophthong s,. Many Indian English speakers do not make a clear distinction between and. (See cot–caught merger.) Unlike British, but like American English, some Indian speakers don&apos;t pronounce the rounded or, and substitute instead. This makes &lt; not &gt; sound as [nat]. The phoneme, if used, is only semi-rounded at the lips.. Similarly in South India &quot; Coffee &quot; will be pronounced kaafi, &quot; Copy &quot; will be kaapi etc. Words such as &lt; class &gt;, &lt; staff &gt; and &lt; last &gt; would be pronounced with a back &lt; a &gt; as in British English but unlike American English, i.e., [klɑːs], [stɑːf] and [lɑːst] rather than American [klæːs], [stæːf] and [læːst] and in South of India &quot; Parent &quot; is pɑːrent. Most Indians have the Trap–bath split of Received Pronunciation. Those who aren´t usually influenced by American accents; not using the trap–bath split is often popularly construed as attempting to imitate an American accent. [ Consonants ] Among the most distinctive features of consonants in Indian English are: [ /v/ ] [ /w/ ] [ [ʋ] ] [ [v] ] [ [w] ] [ /p/, /t/, /k/ ] [ [pɪn] ] [ [pʰɪn] ] [ /tʃ/ ] [ /d/ ] [ /t/ ] [ [ɖ] ] [ [ʈ] ] [ /s/ ] [ /t/ ] [ [ ʃ ] ] [ /stɒp/ ] [ / ʃʈap/ ] [ /n/ ] [ /ʒ/ ] [ /z/ ] [ /dʒ/ ] [ /ˈtrɛz.əːr/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] [ /ˈtrɛʃ.ər/ ] [ /θ/ ] [ /ð/ ] [ [t̪ʰ] ] [ /θ/ ] [ [d̪] ] [ [d̪ʱ] ] [ /ð/ ] [ [t̪ʰɪn] ] [ /θɪn/ ] [ /l/ ] [ /n/ ] [ April 2008 ] [ April 2008 ] [ /isˈkuːl/ ] [ /s/ ] [ /z/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] [ [s] ] [ April 2008 ] [ /tʃ/ ] [ /dʒ/ ] [ /ŋ/ ] [ [ɡ] ] [ /ˈriŋ.iŋ/ ] [ /ˈriŋ.ɡiŋɡ/ ] [ April 2008 ] [ /l/ ] [ /m/ ] [ /n/ ] [ [əl] ] [ [əm] ] [ [ən] ] [ /ˈbuʈ.ʈən/ ] [ [il] ] [ /ˈliʈ.ʈil/ ] [ /ˈmiːtər/ ] [ /ˈmiːʈər/ ] [ April 2008 ] Most pronunciations of Indian English are rhotic, but many speakers with higher education are non-rhotic. Standard Hindi and most other vernaculars (except Punjabi &amp; Bengali) do not differentiate between ( voiced labiodental fricative ) and ( voiced labiovelar approximant ). Instead, many Indians use a frictionless labio-dental approximant for words with either sound, possibly in free variation with and/or. Thus, wet and vet are homophones. Because of the previous characteristic many Indians pronounce words such as &lt; flower &gt; as [flaː(r)] instead of [flaʊə(r)], and &lt; our &gt; as [aː(r)] instead of [aʊə(r)]. The voiceless plosives are always unaspirated in Indian English, whereas in RP, General American and most other English accents they are aspirated in word-initial or stressed syllables. Thus &quot; pin &quot; is pronounced in Indian English but in most other accents. In native Indian languages (except Tamil), the distinction between aspirated and unaspirated plosives is phonemic, and the English stops are equated with the unaspirated rather than the aspirated phonemes of the local languages. Wells, pp. 627-628 The same is true of the voiceless postalveolar afficate. The alveolar stops English, are often retroflex,, especially in the South of India. Wells, p. 62 In Indian languages there are two entirely distinct sets of coronal plosives: one dental and the other retroflex. To the Indian ears, the English alveolar plosives sound more retroflex than dental. In the Devanagari script of Hindi, all alveolar plosives of English are transcribed as their retroflex counterparts. One good reason for this is that unlike most other native Indian languages, Hindi does not have true retroflex plosives (Tiwari, [1955] 2001). The so-called retroflexes in Hindi are actually articulated as apical post-alveolar plosives, sometimes even with a tendency to come down to the alveolar region. So a Hindi speaker normally cannot distinguish the difference between their own apical post-alveolar plosives and English&apos;s alveolar plosives. However, languages such as Tamil have true retroflex plosives, wherein the articulation is done with the tongue curved upwards and backwards at the roof of the mouth. This also causes (in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh) the preceding alveolar to allophonically change to ( &lt; stop &gt; → ). Mostly in south India, some speakers allophonically further change the voiced retroflex plosive to voiced retroflex flap, and the nasal to a nasalized retroflex flap. Many Indians speaking English do not use the voiced postalveolar fricative ( ). Typically, or is substituted, e.g. treasure, and in the south Indian variants, with as in &lt; &quot; sh&apos; &quot; ore &gt;, e.g. treasure. All major native languages of India lack the dental fricatives ( and; spelled with th). Usually, the aspirated voiceless dental plosive is substituted for and the unaspirated voiced dental plosive, or possibly the aspirated version. is substituted for. For example, &quot; thin &quot; would be realized as instead of. South Indians tend to curl the tongue (retroflex accentuation) more for and. Most Indian languages (except Urdu variety) lack the voiced alveolar fricative /z/. While they do have its nearest equivalent: the unvoiced /s/, strangely, it is not used in substitution. Instead, /z/ is substituted with the voiced palatal affricate (or postalveolar) /dʒ/, just as with a Korean accent. This makes words such as &lt; zero &gt; and &lt; rosy &gt; sound as [ˈdʒiːro] and [ˈroːdʒiː]. This replacement is equally true for Persian and Arabic loanwords into Hindi. The probable reason is the confusion created by the use of the devanagari grapheme &lt; ज &gt; (for /dʒ/) with a dot beneath it to represent the loaned /z/ (as &lt; ज़ &gt; ). This is common among people without formal English education. Many Indians with lower exposure to English also may pronounce / f / as aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive [pʰ]. Again note that in Hindi (devanagari) the loaned / f / from Persian and Arabic is written by putting a dot beneath the grapheme for native [pʰ] &lt; फ &gt; : &lt; फ़ &gt;. This substitution is rarer than that for [z], and in fact in many Hindi-speaking areas /f/ is replacing /pʰ/ even in its native words. Inability to pronounce certain (especially word-initial) consonant cluster s by people of rural backgrounds. This is usually dealt with by epenthesis. e.g., school, similar to Spanish. Sometimes, Indian speakers interchange and, especially when plurals are being formed, as opposed to international varieties of English, where [s] is used for pluralization of a word ending in a voiceless consonant, [z] for that ending in a voiced consonant or vowel, and [ɨz] for that ending in a sibilant. Again, in dialects like Bhojpuri, all instances of are spoken like, a phenomenon which is also apparent in their English. Exactly the opposite is seen for many Bengalis. In case of the postalveolar affricates, native languages like Hindi have corresponding affricates articulated from the palatal region, rather than postalveolar, and they have more of a stop component than fricative; this is reflected in their English. While retaining in the final position, Indian speakers usually include the after it. Hence → (ringing). Syllabic, and are usually replaced by the VC clusters, and (as in button ), or if a high vowel precedes, by (as in little ). Syllable nuclei in words with the spelling er (a schwa in RP and an r-colored schwa in GA ) are also replaced VC clusters. e.g., meter, →. Indian English uses clear [l] in all instances like Irish English whereas other varieties use clear [l] in syllable-initial positions and dark [l] (velarized-L) in coda and syllabic positions. [ Spelling pronunciation ] A number of distinctive features of Indian English are due to &quot; the vagaries of English spelling &quot;. Most Indian languages, unlike English, have a nearly phonetic pronunciation with respect to their script, so the spelling of a word is a highly reliable guide to its modern pronunciation. Indians&apos; tendency to pronounce English phonetically as well can cause divergence from Western English. For example, &quot; jewellery &quot; is pronounced &quot; dʒʋeləriː &quot; and &quot; jewel &quot; as &quot; dʒʋel &quot; where Western Anglophones might omit the final e, pronouncing them as &quot; dʒʋelriː &quot; and &quot; dʒʋl &quot;. [ /ɡ/ ] [ [ɡʱ] ] [ [ɡʱoːst] ] [ [ʋʱ] ] [ [wʱ] ] [ [ʋʱɪtʃ] ] [ April 2008 ] [ April 2008 ] [ /f/ ] [ /v/ ] [ [d] ] [ [t] ] [ [ˈdɛʋləpd] ] [ /dɪˈvɛləpt/ ] [ [s] ] [ [z] ] [ [dɒɡs] ] [ [dɒɡz] ] [ April 2008 ] [ /r/ ] [ /r/ ] [ /ɻ/ ] [ September 2007 ] [ /ˈdril.liŋɡ/ ] [ April 2008 ] In words where the digraph &lt; gh &gt; represents a voiced velar plosive ( ) in other accents, some Indian English speakers supply a murmured version, for example &lt; ghost &gt;. No other accent of English admits this voiced aspiration. Similarly, the digraph &lt; wh &gt; may be aspirated as or, resulting in realizations such as &lt; which &gt;, found in no other English accent (except in certain parts of Scotland). Wells, p. 630 In unstressed syllables, native English varieties will mostly use the schwa while Indian English would use the spelling vowel, making &lt; sanity &gt; sound as [ˈsæn.i.ti] instead of [ˈsæn.ə.ti]. Similarly, &lt; above &gt; and &lt; ago &gt; can be heard as [eˈbʌv] and [eˈɡo] instead of [əˈbʌv] and [əˈɡo]. English words ending in grapheme &lt; a &gt; almost always have the &lt; a &gt; being pronounced as schwa /ə/ in native varieties (exceptions include words such as &lt; spa &gt; ). But in Indian English, the ending &lt; a &gt; is pronounced as the long open central unrounded vowel /aː/ (as in &lt; spa &gt; ) instead of schwa. So, &lt; India &gt; is pronounced as /ˈɪn.ɖɪ.aː/ instead of /ˈɪn.dɪ.ə/, and &lt; sofa &gt; as /ˈsoː.faː/ instead of /ˈsoʊ.fə/. The word &quot; of &quot; is usually pronounced with a instead of a as in most other accents. Wells, p. 629 Use of instead of for the &quot; -ed &quot; ending of the past tense after voiceless consonants, for example &quot; developed &quot; may be instead of RP. Wells, p. 628 Use of instead of for the &quot; -s &quot; ending of the plural after voiced consonants, for example &lt; dogs &gt; may be instead of. Pronunciation of &lt; house &gt; as [hauz] in both the noun and the verb, instead of [haus] as noun and [hauz] as verb. The digraph &lt; tz &gt; is pronounced as [tz] or [tdʒ] instead of [ts] (voicing may be assimilated in the stop too), making &lt; Switzerland &gt; sound like [ˈsʋɪt.zər.lænd] instead of [ˈswɪt.səɹ.lənd]. In RP, occurs only before a vowel. But many speakers of Indian English use in almost all positions in words as dictated by the spellings. The allophone used is a mild trill or a tap. Indian speakers do not typically use the retroflex approximant for &lt; r &gt;, which is common for American English speakers. All consonants are distinctly doubled (lengthened) in General Indian English wherever the spelling suggests so. e.g., &lt; drilling &gt;. English pronunciation of the grapheme &lt; i &gt; varies from [ɪ] to [aɪ] depending upon the dialect or accent. Indian English will invariably use the British dialect for it. Thus, &lt; tensile &gt; would be pronounced as [ˈtɛn.saɪl] like the British, rather than [ˈtɛn.sɪl] like the American; &lt; anti &gt; would be pronounced as [ˈæn.ti] like the British, rather than [ˈæn.taɪ] like American. [ Supra-segmental features ] Any of the native varieties of English produce unique stresses on the language. English is a stress-timed language, and both syllable stress and word stress, where only certain words in a sentence or phrase are stressed, are important features of Received Pronunciation. Indian native languages are actually syllable-timed language s, like Latin and French. Indian-English speakers usually speak with a syllabic rhythm. { Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language (Cambridge University Press, 1995), page 360 } Further, in some Indian languages, stress is associated with a low pitch, { http://www.linguistics.uiuc.edu/sala25/verma.htm &quot; Onset of Rising Pitch in Focused Words in Hindi: an Experimental Study &quot; } whereas in most English dialects, stressed syllables are generally pronounced with a higher pitch. Thus, when some Indian speakers speak, they appear to put the stress accents at the wrong syllables, or accentuate all the syllables of a long English word. Certain Indian accents are of a &quot; sing-song &quot; nature, a feature seen in a few English dialects in Britain, such as Scouse and Welsh English. { Varshney, R.L., &quot; An Introductory Textbook of Linguistics and Phonetics &quot;, 15th Ed. (2005), Student Store, Bareilly. } [ Vocabulary and colloquialisms ] Indians continue to use phrases from British English that other English speakers now consider antiquated. Official letters include phrases such as &quot; please do the needful &quot;, &quot;... will revert back... &quot; and &quot; you will be intimated shortly &quot;. In conversational speech it is common to ask, &quot; What is your good name? &quot; to a person of higher authority or social standing where a modern Western Anglophone would omit the word &quot; good &quot;. Recent influences from American English have created inconsistencies. For instance, both &quot; program &quot; and &quot; programme &quot; can be found in Indian newspapers.

This is also used in Scottish and South African English, and in the African American dialect of English in the United States. [ Numbering system ] The Indian numbering system is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken,numbers less than 100,000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English. Numbers including and beyond 100,000 are expressed in a subset of the Indian numbering system. Thus, the following scale is used: In digits (Standard English) In digits (Indian English) In words (Standard English) In words (Indian English) 10 ten 100 one hundred 1,000 one thousand 10,000 ten thousand 100,000 1,00,000 one hundred thousand one lakh 1,000,000 10,00,000 one million ten lakh 10,000,000 1,00,00,000 ten million one crore Larger numbers are generally expressed as multiples of the above. { &quot; Investors lose Rs 4.4 lakh crore in four days &quot;, Business Standard } { &quot; Back Corporate chiefs getting crores in salaries: 100 and counting! &quot;, SmartInvestor.in } [ Medical terms ] Often the cause of undesirable confusion. allopathy - Used by homeopaths to refer to conventional medicine. jaundice - Acute hepatitis. While standard medical terminology uses jaundice for a symptom (yellow discolouration of skin), in India the term is used to refer to the illness in which this symptom is most common. viral fever - Influenza [ Food ] Most Indians are more familiar with local names for food items and ingredients than their English translations. To accommodate this, Indian English frequently uses local (especially Hindi) names for food items. On an Indian cooking show, it would not be uncommon to see &quot; bhindi &quot; and &quot; apple &quot; in a single list of ingredients. brinjal : aubergines / eggplant capsicum : called chili pepper, red or green pepper, or sweet pepper in the UK, capsicum in Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India, bell pepper in the US, Canada, and the Bahamas; paprika in some other countries curds : Yogurt karahi, kadai : wok ladyfinger, bhindi : okra pulses, dal : pulses, e.g. lentils sabzi : greens, green vegetables sago : tapioca, Yuca in US sooji or Rava : Semolina [ Mathematics ] [ April 2012 ] by : divided by, as in &quot; 10 by 5 equals 2 &quot;, rather than &quot; 10 divided by 5 equals 2 &quot; into : times, as in &quot; 2 into 2 equals 4 &quot;, rather than &apos; &quot; 2 times 2 equals 4 &quot;, which is more common in other varieties of English. The use of into dates back to the 15th century, when it had been common in British English. multiply, v., Oxford English Dictionary, 2009, Accessed on July 1, 2009 When giving a fuzzy estimate of numbers, the words &apos;to&apos; or &apos;or&apos; are omitted. For e.g. &quot; Add four or five teaspoons of sugar &quot; would be &quot; Add four-five teaspoons of sugar &quot;. This usage is derived from the grammar of local languages. [ Addressing others ] [ July 2010 ] [ जी ] [ December 2007 ] [ मौसी ] strangers or anyone meriting respect as &quot; ji &quot; / &quot; jee &quot; ( used as a suffix) as in &quot; Please call a taxi for Goyal-ji &quot; (North, West and East India) Use of prefixes &quot; Shree &quot; / &quot; Shri &quot; (Devanagari: श्री meaning Mister) or &quot; Shreemati &quot; / &quot; Shrimati &quot; (Devanagari: श्रीमती meaning Ms/Mrs): Shri Ravindra Patel or Shreemati Das Gupta. &quot; Shreemati &quot; / &quot; Shrimati &quot; is used for married women. &quot; Kumari &quot; (Devnagari: कुमारी literally meaning a virgin) can be used for unmarried (as opposed to single) women or girls. &quot; Sushri &quot; (Devnagari: सुश्री a more recent addition and appropriate translation of Ms where marital status cannot be determined or is unimportant). The Tamil equivalent of such terms is &quot; thiru &quot; (திரு) and &quot; thirumathi &quot; (திருமதி). In Telugu, either &quot; Sree &quot; -as a prefix or &quot; Garu &quot; -as a suffix are used in formal contexts. Analogous titles &quot; Thiru &quot; and &quot; Thirumathi &quot; are used in Tamil. As with Shree/Shreemati, use of suffixes &quot; Saahib/Sāhab &quot; (Mr) and &quot; Begum &quot; (Mrs) (Urdu) as in &quot; Welcome to India, Smith-saahib &quot; or &quot; Begum Sahib would like some tea &quot;. The suffix &quot; sir &quot; is used for male teachers, professors, instructors and coaches and they are often addressed simply as &quot; sir &quot; (For e.g. Gupta-sir). The female equivalents are &quot; miss &quot;, &quot; madam &quot; or &quot; teacher &quot; (For e.g. Agarwal-miss, Godbole-madam and Ganguly-teacher). The term of address &quot; teacher &quot; is applied almost always to female teachers only, while male teachers are called &quot; sirs &quot; (except when stating or referring to their occupation), (for e.g. &quot; The sir is late to class today &quot;, &quot; There are some sirs sitting in the staff room &quot; ) Use of &quot; mister &quot; and &quot; missus &quot; as common nouns for wife/husband. For example, &quot; Jyoti&apos;s mister stopped by yesterday &quot; or &quot; My missus is not feeling well &quot;. &quot; Master &quot; is a common honorific for young boys (children, teenagers). e.g.: Master Kumar. Use of honorifics (Mr, Mrs, Ms) with the first name. For example, Swathi Ashok Kumar might be addressed as &quot; Ms Swathi &quot; instead of &quot; Ms Kumar &quot;. This is the only possible correct usage in South India, especially in Tamil Nadu, where most people do not use a surname. (The trailing caste names have gone out of vogue.) Use of the English words &apos;uncle&apos; and &apos;aunty&apos; as suffixes when addressing people such as distant relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, even total strangers (like shopkeepers) who are significantly older than oneself. E.g., &quot; Hello, Swathi aunty! &quot; In fact, in Indian culture, children or teenagers addressing their friends&apos; parents as Mr Patel or Mrs Patel (etc.) is rare and may even be considered unacceptable or offensive (in the sense of referring to an elder person by name). A substitution of Sir/Ma&apos;am, while common for addressing teachers/professors or any person in an official position, would be considered too formal to address parents of friends or any other unrelated (but known) elder persons. On the contrary, if the person is related, he/she will usually be addressed with the name of the relation in the vernacular Indian language, even while conversing in English. For example, if a woman is one&apos;s mother&apos;s sister, she would not be addressed (by a Hindi speaker) as &quot; auntie &quot; but as Mausi ( ) (by a Kannada speaker as Chikkamma Kannada: ಚಿಕ್ಕಮ್ಮ, by a Marathi speaker as &quot; mavashi &quot;, Marathi : मावशी). Calling one&apos;s friends&apos; parents aunty and uncle was also very common in Great Britain in the 1960s and 1970s but is much rarer today. The terms &apos;Uncle&apos; and &apos;Aunty&apos; with certain intonations can also connote a derogatory reference to the advanced age of an individual. Similar to the use of &apos;uncle&apos; and &apos;aunty as suffixes, &apos;didi&apos; (elder sister) or &apos;bhāi&apos; or &apos;bhaiyya&apos; (elder brother) may be used for people between 1–15 years older than oneself. The use of &apos;bhāi&apos; as a suffix is very common amongst North Indians and Urdu speakers. In other parts of India, terms from local languages may be used instead, for e.g. &apos;tāi&apos; (elder sister) and &apos;bhāu&apos; or &apos;dādā&apos; (elder brother) in the case of Marathi. In stereotypical depictions of gang culture, especially the Mumbai underworld, gangsters are frequently addressed to with the suffix &apos;bhai&apos;. People young enough to be one&apos;s children may be addressed as &apos;betā&apos; (both genders) or &apos;beti&apos; (female) in an endearing and informal sense. The use of &apos;betā&apos; as a suffix is also possible, though not as common as &apos;uncle&apos; and &apos;aunty&apos;. Use of Respected Sir while starting a formal letter instead of Dear Sir. Again, such letters are ended with non-standard greetings, such as &quot; Yours respectfully &quot;, or &quot; Yours obediently &quot;, rather than the standard &quot; Yours sincerely/faithfully/truly &quot;.

Fish, seafood, and eggs are not treated as categories separate from &quot; meat &quot;, especially when the question of vegetarianism is at issue (milk and its products are always considered vegetarian).
