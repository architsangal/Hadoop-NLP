[ John McCain ] [ August 2011 ] [ 1931 4 26 y ] { Melbourne, } { Victoria, } { Australia } { Victorian Legislative } { Bundoora } { 20 March 1976 } { 14 August 1992 } { Seat created } { Sherryl Garbutt } { Australian Labor Party } { Nancye Evelyn Williams } { Barrister } John Cain (born 26 April 1931), Australia n Labor Party politician, was the 41st Premier of Victoria, holding office from 1982 to 1990. During his time as Premier, changes were enforced to the practices of various institutions in Melbourne which discriminated against women, while other reforms were introduced such as libearlized shop trading hours and liquor laws, equal opportunity initiatives, and occupational health and safety legislation. { Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891-1991 } [ Biography ] Cain was born in Melbourne, the son of John Cain, leader of the Labor Party in Victoria from 1937 to 1957 and three times Premier. He was educated at Bell Primary School, Northcote High School, Scotch College, Melbourne and at the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in law. He practised law in suburban Melbourne, and was Chairman of the Victorian Law Institute in 1971â€“72. He was also a member of the Law Council of Australia and a member of the Australian Law Reform Commission. Cain was 24 at the time of the 1955 split in the Labor Party that brought down his father&apos;s last government. He lost a preselection battle with Frank Wilkes for his late father&apos;s seat of Northcote in 1957. During the 1960s he was a member of the group, known as The Participants, which also included John Button, Richard McGarvie Frank Costigan and Barry Jones, who opposed the left-wing group which controlled the Victorian Labor Party from 1955 onwards. In 1971 he supported the moves by supporters of Gough Whitlam, led by Bob Hawke and others, that in 1971 brought about federal intervention in the Victorian branch and ended left-wing control. He became Vice-Chairman of the Victorian Labor Party in 1973. That group of Participants later became known as the Independents faction which predominantly voted with the Socialist Left. [ Career ] In 1976 Cain was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as MP for Bundoora. He became shadow Attorney-General under the leadership of Frank Wilkes, but when Wilkes lost the 1979 election to the Liberal premier, Dick Hamer, Cain challenged him for the leadership, becoming leader in September 1981. In April 1982 Cain defeated the Liberals and formed the first Labor government in Victoria for 27 years since the one led by his father. [ Premiership ] During the first term of his government, Cain&apos;s government carried out many reforms to Victorian government, particularly in the areas of education, environment, law reform and public administration. The Government brought in nude beaches, legalized brothels, extended Saturday shop trading hours, extended nightclub hours, extended hotel hours and allowed Sunday VFL football and more gambling opportunities. { Cain enigma and me, Derryn Hinch, The Sun 11 August 1990. } Cain was a Keynesian, opposed to the doctrines of economic rationalism, and he increased government spending in the hope of stimulating growth and investment. Following the lead of NSW premier Neville Wran, Cain demanded Government owned enterprises pay dividends to the treasury, these dividends were increased every year forcing these enterprises to borrow to pay the dividend. Other schemes such as the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, and the Victorian Equity Trust promised good returns. These schemes worked so long as the national economy remained buoyant. The Government of Victoria refused to approve the plans for the upgrade VFL Park in 1982/1983, because the upgrade would have threatened the Melbourne Cricket Ground&apos;s right to host the VFL Grand Final. Cain said that such a major event must be played in the centre of Melbourne. Cain was also responsible for the appointment as Governor of Davis McCaughey, then aged 71, who served from 1986 to 1992. A highly respected theologian, McCaughey was a popular choice after the controversy surrounding after the resignation of Rear Admiral Sir Brian Murray, following disputed accusations that he had improperly accepted free air travel. [ Second Term ] Cain remained very popular with the Victorian electorate, and was easily elected to a second term in 1985, becoming the first Labor premier to be reelected. Due to a tied vote in the upper house province of Nunawading, and having the winning vote drawn from a hat, a Labor government for the first time in its history had control of the Legislative Council. Cain was able to push his Workcare Act. A fresh election ordered by the Court of Disputed Returns after it was found that the Chief Electoral Officer drew a name from the hat rather than caste the deciding vote. The Liberals won re-election and Labor lost its slim majority. Within a week the Chairman of the Victorian Nuclear Disarmament Party, lodged an official complaint about a deceptive NDP how to vote card handed out at the booths. It was claimed that members of the Australian Labor Party were recognised handing out this card and that the allocation of preferences to the ALP on the card damaged the NDP. { http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1992-10-14%2F0014;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1992-10-14%2F0080%22 } The government entered a cover-up to protect its state secretary Peter Batchelor and the Labor party. { Public debt and private pain, The Sun 8 August 1990 } During its second term Cain&apos;s government began to run into difficulties with the state budget. The stock market crash of 1987 created a crisis which forced the government to cut spending, alienating some trade union supporters. The State Bank of Victoria, in particular its merchant banking arm Tricontinental, ran up a huge portfolion of bad loans, without adequate fiduciary supervision. Progress had created a vast amount of vacant inner-city land, with the introduction of containerisation in the shipping industry, the docks became inadequate for the new container ship s. This made the docks within Victoria Harbour obsolete as the principal docking area shifted closer to the mouth of the Yarra, this was seen as a large urban blight by the Cain state government. The size of the Melbourne Docklands area meant that political influences were inescapable. The Docklands was high on the government&apos;s agenda, [ Kim Dovey 2005 Fluid City: Transforming Melbourne&apos;s Waterfront University of New South Wales Press Sydney ] however, the government at the time could not afford to initiate the investment for the project so the Docklands project stayed on the drawing board. There was a bid for the 1992 Olympic Games and another proposal was to turn the Docklands into a technology city known as the Multifunction Polis (MFP). [ Third Term ] The Cain government was narrowly re-elected to a third term in 1988, but immediately after the election a huge shortfall in the government&apos;s workers&apos; compensation scheme, WorkCare, was revealed. The collapse of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, a venture-capital fund that tried to pick winners but racked up huge losses. The VEDC and its sister, the Victorian Investment Corporation, were created to back new industries to replace outdated smokestack manufacturers. The VEDC collapsed under poor management and an absence of political accountability after it had provided $450 million of loan and equity assistance to business. [ Elias David VEDC: the ghost that still talks The Age 2005-09-08 http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/vedc-the-ghost-that-still-talks/2005/09/07/1125772584230.html 2011-03-28 ] This was followed by a budgetary crisis that the government was unable to deal with, partly because of the large spending programmes the government had previously instituted, partly because he was unable to obtain support from within his government for necessary spending reductions and also because the federal Government declined to &quot; bail out &quot; the Victorian government as they believed Cain&apos;s overspending was significantly to blame. The deputy premier Robert Fordham took some of the blame and resigned. This led to the elevation of Joan Kirner to deputy premier. His refusal to back down over banning tobacco advertising forced the Australian motorcycle Grand Prix to relocate from Phillip Island to Eastern Creek in Sydney. For 33 days from 1 January 1990, 250 trams were parked in Melbourne&apos;s CBD streets by tram drivers. The Cain government wanted to save $24 million a year, by the introduction of a new Met Ticket system - or scratchies as they were colloquially known. Scratch tickets were supposed to save money by cutting 550 ticket conductor jobs and 550 train station staff. The trams did not move because the government shut down the power grid. [ Lucas Clay Back to days when trams stood still The Age 2010-01-16 http://www.theage.com.au/national/back-to-days-when-trams-stood-still-20100115-mckl.html 2011-03-28 ] In February 1990 it was rumoured that Pyramid, a privately owned (but government regulated) building society, was in difficulties. Ministers in Cain&apos;s government accepted assurances from Pyramid directors that the society&apos;s position was sound, and passed these assurances on to the public. In fact the society was insolvent. When it failed, causing thousands of investors and depositors to lose their money, the government was blamed by investors and the media. This was followed shortly after by the collapse of Tricontinental Bank, which threatened to bankrupt the Victorian Government owned State Bank, Victoria&apos;s largest financial institution. The bank eventually had to be sold to the Commonwealth Bank, which was shortly thereafter privatised by the federal government. These disasters permanently ruined Cain&apos;s reputation for financial management. By this time Cain was becoming frustrated at the reluctance of his government&apos;s caucus members to approve his plans for tax rises and spending cuts to reduce the growing budget deficit. He issued an ultimatum at the Labor Party Conference to &quot; back me or sack me. &quot; When the undermining of his position continued, he resigned on 7 August 1990. During an interview after his resignation, he remarked, &quot; We appointed a few dills but we weren&apos;t crook. &quot; Joan Kirner was elected Labor leader in Cain&apos;s place and became the first female premier of Victoria. Cain retired from Parliament at the 1992 Victorian state election, which Labor lost. [ Life after Parliament ] Cain became a Professorial Fellow in politics at the University of Melbourne in 1991, and has since completed three books. In 2004 he surfaced in the media with a damning critique of the University of Melbourne&apos;s experimentation with what he says are risky financial ventures and what he argues is its departure from its public mission. Off Course: From Public Place to Marketplace at Melbourne University attracted a range of critical commentary. He is a regular political commentator on local radio. He has remained active in the affairs of the Victorian Labor Party, and has recently [ Austin Paul Cain attacks ALP for council abuses The Age 2009-05-16 http://www.theage.com.au/national/cain-attacks-alp-for-council-abuses-20090515-b652.html 2011-03-28 ] been critical of what he sees as the dominance of factions in the party, particularly the Labor Right. He is one of the ALP&apos;s Dispute Tribunal members, a panel of three people from which one is selected randomly to adjudicate internal party disputes. Some members have expressed concern that his public statements on factions means that he has prejudged disputes that could appear before him. John Cain sits on the board of the MCG Trust. [ MCG Trust http://www.mcg.org.au/About%20the%20G/MCG%20Trust.aspx 2011-03-28 ] He is also a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria.
