Roy W. Spencer is a climatologist and a Principal Research Scientist for the University of Alabama in Huntsville, as well as the U.S. Science Team Leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on NASA’s Aqua satellite. He has served as senior scientist for climate studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. He is known for his satellite-based temperature monitoring work, for which he was awarded the American Meteorological Society &apos;s Special Award. Spencer suggests that global warming is mostly natural. He argues that climate is inherently stable to changes in radiative forcing from variations in natural drivers as well as humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol pollution. He suggests that natural, chaotic variations in factors including low cloud cover may account for most observed warming. { Global Warming: Natural or Manmade? by Roy Spencer } { The 2007–2008 Global Cooling Event: Evidence for Clouds as the Cause by Roy Spencer } [ Education and work ] Spencer earned a B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Michigan in 1978 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Meteorology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1980 and 1982. [ http://aqua.nasa.gov/about/team_spencer.php Aqua Project Science NASA 2008 2008-10-10 ] Spencer designed an algorithm to detect tropical cyclones and estimate their maximum sustained wind speed using the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. { Spencer, R.W., and W.D. Braswell, &quot; Atlantic tropical cyclone monitoring with AMSU-A: Estimation of maximum sustained wind speeds. &quot; Monthly Weather Review, 129, 1518–1532, 2001 } The AMSU is a microwave radiometer that can be used to detect temperature at different levels of the atmosphere. Based on gradients in temperature measurements in a given area, it is possible to estimate maximal sustained radial wind speed. { Detecting Tropical Cyclones Using AMSU } As well as his position at UHA, he is currently the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer flying on NASA’s Aqua satellite. His research work is funded by NASA, NOAA, and DOE. He speaks publicly often on climate, including four appearances on Coast to Coast AM.

Christy, has maintained an atmospheric temperature record derived from satellite microwave sounding unit measurements, commonly called the &quot; UAH &quot; record record (see also satellite temperature record ). This was once controversial as until the late 1990s the satellite record erroneously showed a net global cooling trend, at odds with the radiosonde and surface record. A number of corrections (mostly minor) have been made since been made bringing the UAH &quot; lower troposphere temperature &quot; data closer to agreement with other temperature records. The most significant correction, demonstrated in a 1998 paper by Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS, was to correct for orbital decay of the MSU satellites. [ Wentz Frank J. Matthias Schabel Letters to Nature 13 August 1998 394 661–661 Effects of orbital decay on satellite-derived lower-tropospheric temperature trends 10.1038/29267 6694 ] { http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-execsum.pdf } [ 2007 cloud feedback article ] In August, 2007, Spencer and others published an article in Geophysical Research Letters regarding cloud feedback in the tropics.

Braswell, William D., Christy, John R., Hnilo, Justin Cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations Geophysical Research Letters 9 August 2007 34 15 10.1029/2007GL029698 ] Current understanding of the climate system predicts that an increase in high-level, heat trapping clouds will accelerate global warming. Spencer&apos;s observations in the tropics found a negative feedback and a lower climate sensitivity than the current consensus. Spencer and colleagues state that the negative feedback possibly supports Richard Lindzen &apos;s Infrared Iris hypothesis of compensating meteorological processes that tend to stabilize climate change. [ Richard S. Lindzen, Ming-Dah Chou, and Arthur Y. Hou Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 82 3 March 2001 417–432 http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen/adinfriris.pdf 10.1175/1520-0477(2001)082 &lt; 0417:DTEHAA &gt; 2.3.CO;2 Does the Earth Have an Adaptive Infrared Iris? ] In a press release that month, Spencer said, &quot; To give an idea of how strong this enhanced cooling mechanism is, if it was operating on global warming, it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent... The big question that no one can answer right now is whether this enhanced cooling mechanism applies to global warming. &quot; { Cirrus disappearance: Warming might thin heat-trapping clouds, UA Huntsville press release, 8/9/2007 } [ Spencer and Braswell 2008 ] In 2008, Spencer and William Braswell published a paper { &quot; Potential Biases in Feedback Diagnosis from Observational Data: A Simple Model Demonstration &quot;, by Roy W. Spencer &amp; William D. Braswell, } { Journal of Climate, 2008 } in the Journal of Climate which stated that conventional diagnoses of positive cloud feedback are artificially biased positive, because they ignore natural cloud variability. Climate model analyses treat decreasing cloud cover as an evidence of positive feedback of atmosphere to initial CO 2 induced warming, while it easily could be the other way around: the real cause of warming could be small naturally caused variations in cloud cover with rising temperatures as a result. Spencer postulates strong negative cloud feedback, contrary to what the current IPCC climate models use. He points out that the IPCC concedes that low clouds are the most uncertain element in climate models, and that a 1% change in low cloud cover could have radiative forcing equal to doubling of CO 2. [ September 2011 ] Spencer asserts that small cloud variations connected with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation can explain 75% of global warming in the twentieth century. { Global Warming as a Natural Response to Cloud Changes Associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) by Roy Spencer } [ Spencer and Braswell 2011 ] On 26 July 2011, Spencer and Braswell published a paper [ Spencer Roy William Braswell On the Misdiagnosis of Climate Feedbacks from Variations in Earth&apos;s Radiant Energy Balance Remote Sensing 2011 ], &quot; On the Misdiagnosis of Climate Feedbacks from Variations in Earth&apos;s Radiant Energy Balance &quot;, in Remote Sensing, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal. The paper questioned the ability of some computer climate models to reproduce the time lagged relationship between average sea surface temperature and net terrestrial radiative flux, and used a simple model to suggest the method used by Andrew Dessler and others to establish the value of cloud feedback was flawed. The conclusions of the paper were subsequently exaggerated by parts of the media and the authors themselves, with headlines such as &quot; New NASA Data Blow Gaping Hole In Global Warming Alarmism &quot; in Forbes magazine.

Retraction would be the normal course of action if a paper is technically wrong. His statement, in the form of an editorial in the journal, paradoxically said the reviewers had done their job correctly. Wagner further criticized Spencer, Braswell and parts of the media for misrepresenting the significance of their research.

In 2006 Spencer criticized Al Gore &apos;s documentary An Inconvenient Truth, saying, &quot; For instance, Mr. Gore claims that the Earth is now warmer than it has been in thousands of years. Yet the latest National Academies of Science (NAS) report on the subject has now admitted that all we really know is that we are warmer now than we were during the last 400 years, which is mostly made up of the &apos; Little Ice Age &apos; &quot;. { Star Search by Roy Spencer, } { TCS Daily, 30 Jun 2006 } In a New York Post opinion column on February 26, 2007, Spencer wrote: [ Spencer Roy W.

He also criticized climate models, saying &quot; The people that have built the climate models that predict global warming believe they have sufficient physics in those models to predict the future.

And finally, despite my previous acceptance of evolutionary theory as &apos;fact,&apos; I came to the realization that intelligent design, as a theory of origins, is no more religious, and no less scientific, than evolutionism.... In the scientific community, I am not alone. There are many fine books out there on the subject. Curiously, most of the books are written by scientists who lost faith in evolution as adults, after they learned how to apply the analytical tools they were taught in college. &quot; { Faith-Based Evolution, Roy Spencer, } { TCS Daily, 08 August 2005 } In The Evolution Crisis, a compilation of five scientists who reject evolution, Spencer states: &quot; I finally became convinced that the theory of creation actually had a much better scientific basis than the theory of evolution, for the creation model was actually better able to explain the physical and biological complexity in the world...
