[ Taylor County Wisconsin 225 1875 Medford 984 975 10 0.98% 2010 20689 8 www.co.taylor.wi.us ] Taylor County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of 2010, the population was 20,689. Its county seat is Medford. [ 6 ] [ History ] The earliest recorded event in Taylor county probably occurred in 1661, when Wisconsin was part of New France. A band of Huron Indians from eastern Ontario had fled the Iroquois and taken refuge near the headwaters of the Black River, probably around Lake Chelsea in the northeast part of the county. Father René Menard, a French Jesuit priest who had travelled up the Great Lakes as far as Keweenaw Bay in upper Michigan, heard that these Hurons were starving. He decided to try to reach them to baptize them, despite his own weak health and scant supplies. In mid-summer he and a French fur trader set out, following rivers and streams in birchbark canoes down into Wisconsin. Finally, a day&apos;s journey from the Huron camp, Father Menard separated from his travelling companion at a rapids to carry some supplies. He was never seen again. The place where he disappeared is believed to be the dells of the Big Rib River, below Goodrich in the southeast corner of Taylor county. { Schmirler, A. A. A., &quot; Wisconsin&apos;s Lost Missionary: The Mystery of Father Rene Menard &quot;, The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Volume 45, number 2, winter, 1961-1962. } On June 8, 1847, before any settlers or loggers, a team of surveyors entered the county [ Field Notes for T30N R1W http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/SurveyNotes/SurveyNotes-idx?type%3DPLSS%26amp%3Btwp%3DT030NR001W Original Field Notes and Plat Maps, 1833-1866 Board of Commissioners of Public Lands 31 May 2011 ] southwest of Medford, where County E now enters from Clark County. They were working for the U.S. government, marking a north-south line called the Fourth Principal Meridian, from which much of the land in the state would be measured. For six days they worked their way through woods and swamps, up what is now the southern part of E and across the valley that is now the Mondeaux Flowage, before continuing north into what is now Price County. The head of the team wrote of the trip: During four consecutive weeks there was not a dry garment in the party, day or night… we were constantly surrounded and as constantly excoriated by swarms or rather clouds of mosquitoes, and still more troublesome insects… [ Kassulke Natasha See Wisconsin through the Eyes of 19th Century Surveyors http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/2009/08/insert.pdf 2011-09-24 Wisconsin Natural Resources Magazine Aug, 2009 David Mladneoff Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ] On their way through the county, they and other surveyors recorded a forest then dominated by hemlock, yellow birch and sugar maple, with white pine the fourth or sixth most frequent. The mix of tree species then resembled today&apos;s Gerstberger Pines grove southeast of Rib Lake. { Finley, Robert W., &quot; Finley&apos;s Presettlement Vegetation &quot;, 1976, University of Wisconsin. } A crew hauling logs for the Fountain-Campbell Lumber Company in northwest Taylor County, 1909. Logging began in this area in the 1870s. Loggers came up the rivers and floated pine logs out in spring and early summer log drives, down the Big Rib River into the Wisconsin River, down the Black River to the south, and west down the Jump and the Yellow River into the Chippewa. In the early 1870s the Wisconsin Central Railway built its line up through Stetsonville, Medford, Whittlesey, Chelsea, and Westboro, with a spur to Rib Lake, and began to haul out the trees that didn&apos;t float well. { National Register of Historic Places. } { In } 1875 Taylor County with its current boundaries was carved out of the larger Chippewa, Lincoln and Clark counties and a bit of Marathon { http://www.genealogyinc.com/wisconsin/maps/ } with the county seat at Medford. The county was probably named for Wisconsin&apos;s governor at the time, William E. Taylor. { &quot; Dictionary of Wisconsin History &quot;, Wisconsin Historical Society. } From around 1902 to 1905 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway ran a line up the west end of the county through Polley, Gilman, Hannibal and Jump River. In 1902 the Eau Claire, Chippewa Falls, and Northeastern Railroad (better known as Omaha) pushed in from Holcombe through Hannibal to now-abandoned Hughey on the Yellow River. In 1905 the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line through Clark (now a ghost town ), Lublin, Polley, Gilman and Donald, heading for Superior. The SM &amp; P and Omaha were primarily logging railroads, which hauled out lumber and incidentally transported passengers and other cargo. With the lumber gone, the SM &amp; P shut down in 1933. { Nagel, Paul; (1979) S. M. &amp; P. RY. The Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway } After the good timber was gone, the lumber companies sold many of the cutover forties to farm families. Initially they tried making their living in various ways: selling milk, eggs, beef and wool, growing cucumbers and peas, and various other schemes. But before long dairy had become the predominant form of agriculture in the county. By 1923 Medford had the second largest co-op creamery in Wisconsin. The number of dairy farms peaked around 3,300 in the early 1940s and had dropped to 1,090 by 1995. [ Boelter Joseph M.

Much of the cut-over north-central part of the county was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest in 1933. { &quot; Nicolet National Forest &quot; } Mondeaux Dam Recreation Area and other parts of the forest were developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps starting in 1933. CCC camps were at Mondeaux, Perkinstown, and near the current Jump River fire tower. Today hikers can follow the Ice Age National Scenic Trail through the national forest and the northeast corner of the county. The major early industry was the production of sawlogs, lumber, and shingles. { &quot; 1876 Account of Taylor County &quot;, Wisconsin Land Commission. } Large sawmills were at Medford and Rib Lake. Medford, Perkinstown and Rib Lake had tanneries, which used local hemlock bark in the tanning process. Whittlesey had an early brickyard. Industry has diversified since, into creameries, window manufacturers, plastic s, and food processing - mostly at Medford. [ Geography ] Maximum extent of the Laurentide ice sheet, from John W. Attig. Taylor county&apos;s terrain was shaped chiefly by glaciers. Geologists believe that 15,000 to 25,000 years ago the Laurentide ice sheet pushed down from Canada across what are now the Great Lakes, and over much of the northern U.S. One of the ice sheet&apos;s lobes bulldozed down over two thirds of Taylor county, at its farthest extent covering a line from Westboro through Perkinstown to Lublin. The ice sheet pushed down that far, then melted back, leaving the band of choppy hills and little lakes that cuts diagonally across the county. This band of hills is called the Perkinstown terminal moraine. North and west of the moraine, in the corner of the county toward Jump River, that last glacier left behind a more gently rolling plain of glacial till. Glacial landforms of Taylor County. The striking glacial features in this area are glacial erratic boulders and eskers. Along with the Mondeaux and Lost Lake eskers, there are others in the towns of Westboro, Pershing, Aurora and Taft. The southeast corner of the county toward Stetsonville and Goodrich was not covered by the last glacier, but was covered by earlier ones. Here too they left glacial till, but the land is generally flatter and less rocky since erosion has had more time to level things. [ Attig John W. Pleistocene Geology of Taylor County, Wisconsin Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey 1993 Bulletin 90 http://www.uwex.edu/wgnhs/gis.htm 2011-04-15 ] Beneath the glacial till lies Cambrian and Precambrian bedrock. Outcrops have been exposed in places by the Jump and Yellow Rivers.

[ Berglund Mark Up around the Bend The Star News 2011-12-07 ] The county straddles a divide between three river systems. The Jump River and Yellow flow west into the Chippewa river valley. The Big Rib River flows southeast to the Wisconsin. And the Black River flows out to the south. All eventually feed the Mississippi. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of [ 984 sqmi km2 ], of which [ 975 sqmi km2 ] is land and [ 10 sqmi km2 ] (0.98%) is water.

STH 13 runs north-south through the eastern half of the county and STH 73 is the major north-south highway in the western half of the county. STH 64 is the major highway running east-west through Taylor county. Through a contractual agreement with the state, the Taylor County Highway Department is responsible for maintenance of state highways and right-of-ways. A network of [ 250 mi km ] of county highways serves Taylor County&apos;s rural areas. Major east-west highways include A, D, M, and O. Major north-south routes include C, E, and H. Towns in Taylor County are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of their individual town roads. There is one designated Rustic Road in Taylor County. Dedicated in 1975, Rustic Road No. 1, a five-mile (8 km) long gravel road between STH 102 and CTH D near Rib Lake was the first Rustic Road in Wisconsin. This road crosses through scenic hills and valleys created by glaciers nearly 12,000 years ago. A historical marker alongside the road commemorates the designation. [ Air transportation ] The primary airport in the county is the Taylor County Airport. There are six other private landing strips in the county. Located in the Town of Deer Creek, approximately three miles southeast of the City of Medford in T.30N-R.2E Section 7, the Taylor County Airport is the only public airport in the county. It has a [ 4100 ft m on ] paved and lighted runway with an NDB non-precision approach. Services provided include: Jet A fuel, 100 low-lead AV gas, 24-hour fuel service, car rental, taxi service, large ramp/tie down area, flight instruction, and computerized weather briefing/flight planning service. The addition of an east/west [ 5001 ft m on ] paved and lighted runway and an automated weather observation system (AWOS) was completed in 1996. All runways are paved and in excellent condition.
