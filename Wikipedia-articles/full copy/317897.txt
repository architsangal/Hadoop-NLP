[ http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/aberystwyth/pages/uwa_colinmcinnes.shtml Aber&apos;s Interpol 15 January 2009 BBC ] The department has 500 undergraduate students and 120 postgraduates studying at Masters Degree and PhD level. { http://www.aber.ac.uk/interpol/en/welcome/ } Of all Aberystwyth&apos;s submissions to the 2008 RAE, it had the highest proportion of research that was regarded as world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour.

H. Carr, Leopold Kohr, Andrew Linklater, Ken Booth, Steve Smith and Michael Cox. In 2006, a new building for the Department of International Politics was completed and opened on the main Penglais Campus. The department is also home to a number of journals. These include &quot; Intelligence &amp; National Security &quot;, &quot; International Relations &quot; and &quot; Critical Studies on Terrorism &quot;. [ Department of Law and Criminology ] The Department of Law and Criminology is housed in the Hugh Owen Building, which is located on the main campus. This department was founded in 1901. Ranked within the top twenty institutions for Law in the United Kingdom, [ January 2011 ] it is the oldest law school in Wales. [ January 2011 ] Furthermore, the Department is home to the specialist research centre, the Centre for Welsh Legal Affairs. All lecturers in the Department are engaged in research and the International Journal of Biosciences and the Law, and the Cambrian Law Review are edited in the Department. Over the years a large number of well-known legal academics, practitioners and politicians have taught in the Department. Recently the Department has worked closely with the Quality Assurance Agency in testing new processes for teaching quality assessment. The Department is one of only a few universities in the United Kingdom which offers the two-year LL.B scheme to graduates in a discipline other than law. Information published in 2006 indicates a progression rate from first year to second year of about 93.5% on the LLB courses. In 2006 the Department of Law &amp; Criminology started a Legal Practice Course. The LPC is a requirement for anyone who wishes to practice as a solicitor in England and Wales. The Times Good University Guide 2009 ranks its School of Law 34th overall out of 87 Law Schools across the UK. [ Department of Psychology ] In 2007, Aberystwyth added Psychology as a subject to its portfolio of module schemes by establishing a Centre for Applied Psychology within the Department of International Politics. This allowed the university to establish several new joint honours degrees schemes and lead to the establishment of a new independent Psychology Department in 2008; the first time Psychology has been offered as a study course at Aberystwyth for 50 years. The department is now aiming for full British Psychological accreditation by 2012. [ Department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies ] The Department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies is one of the largest departments in the university in terms of numbers of undergraduate students [ January 2010 ] and was established in the late 1970s. The department incorporates a BBC studio built in 2001. [ Institute of Rural Sciences ] The Institute of Rural Sciences on Llanbadarn Campus was formed by the merger of the Welsh Agricultural College, which had hitherto been independent, and the University&apos;s Department of Agriculture in 1995. [ School of Management and Business ] In 1998 the Department of Economics (founded 1912), the Department of Accounting and Finance (founded 1979) and the Centre for Business Studies merged to create the School of Management and Business. The MBA programme at Aberystwyth was established in 1985 and is accredited by the AMBA; it was the first business school in Wales to achieve this. [ January 2011 ] The school&apos;s postgraduate programmes in Management and International Business Management are both MBM (Masters in Business Management) accredited by the Association of MBAs. Only 28 business schools throughout the world, as at February 2011, have achieved this programme accreditation and Aberystwyth is one of only 9 in the UK.

Today, the School has a portfolio of undergraduate and postgraduate degree schemes, allowing either specialised or interdisciplinary studies of Fine Art, Art History, and Museum and Gallery Studies.Set in its own grounds, the School is self-contained within the listed Edward Davies building (originally a chemistry laboratory). The School houses studios for painting and photography, darkrooms, print workshops, a Mac suite, as well as lecture theatres and seminar rooms. The School also accommodates a museum, 2 modern galleries, and extensive art archives, which act as resources for students. [ http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/art/about-us/ http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/art/about-us/ ] The Guardian &apos;s University guide 2012 ranks Aberystwyth University as 8th out of 82 universities for Art and Design. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2011/may/17/university-guide-art-design http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2011/may/17/university-guide-art-design ] [ Department of Sport and Exercise Science ] [ January 2010 ] In 2001 the Department of Sport and Exercise Science was established under Prof. Jo Doust, the department was then taken over by Prof. David Lavallee in 2007. The department delivers undergraduate programmes in sport and exercise science, performs research in the sport and exercise sciences, and provides consultancy services to individuals and organisations in Wales and the rest of the UK. The Department has seen much success in its short history, including academic success for students and staff/researchers. For example recently students have won the 2007 and 2008 British Psychological Society (BPS) Division of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology H.T.A. Whiting Undergraduate Dissertation Prize and there is a history of success (undergraduate and postgraduate prizes) for communications at the annual student conference of the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES). [ Research ] The department is active in research, and members of staff are involved in various projects including collaborative work with other Universities and organisations. The department has made contributions to respiratory and endurance physiology, and the role of exercise in mental health and well-being. Members of academic staff have an established record of publications in scientific journals, as well as contributing to book chapters, popular magazine articles and television and radio broadcasts on issues related to their research work. In the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008, the Department of Sport and Exercise Science, which was returned for the first time since its formation in 2001, had 65% of research submitted rated as being recognised internationally and 15% being of international excellence. [ Geography of the university campuses ] Sunset as seen from Constitution Hill. The main campus of the university is situated on Penglais Hill, overlooking the town of Aberystwyth and Cardigan Bay. The Penglais Campus is the site of 12 of the University&apos;s 17 departments, as well as most of the student halls of residence. Just below the Penglais Campus is the National Library of Wales, one of Britain&apos;s five legal deposit libraries. A BBC article suggests the library is &quot; considered to be one of the world&apos;s greatest libraries, and its international reputation is certainly something that all Welsh men and women are intensely... proud of &quot;. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/national_library/pages/centenary.shtml BBC – Mid Wales National Library – Centenary celebrations BBC 23 November 2008 ] The original university building, next to the sea, known as &quot; Old College &quot;, is the site of most of the University&apos;s administration as well as the Departments of Welsh and Education. The Llanbadarn Campus is located approximately one mile to the east of the Penglais Campus, and hosts the Institute of Rural Sciences and the Department of Information Studies. Additionally, the Llanbadarn Campus is the site of the Aberystwyth branch of Coleg Ceredigion, a further education college, and not part of the University. The School of Art is located between the Penglais Campus and the centre of Aberystwyth, in what was originally the Edward Davies Chemical Laboratory, site of the now-defunct Department of Chemistry. [ Student residences ] The various student residences owned, leased or managed by the university offer over 3,500 bed-spaces in total.

Pentre Jane Morgan is due to be expanded over the next 5 years to accommodate for the closing of Llanbadarn (2007), Pantycelyn (2011) and some Sea Front (2011) halls. In total the site will expand to reach the boundary of Aberystwyth Golf Club and accommodate an estimated 900 students. However, due to the previously mentioned closing halls, the expansion will only see total of 300 additional rooms to the campus in total.
