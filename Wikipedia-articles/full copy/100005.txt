[ Grebes Podiceps nigricollis 001.jpg Black-necked Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis nigricollis), in non-breeding plumage Animal ia Chordata Aves Neognathae 1 Families, 6 Genera, 22 Species Grebe#Genera and species Mirandornithes Podicipediformes Fürbringer, 1888 Podicipedidae Bonaparte, 1831 Genera * Aechmophorus * Podiceps * Podilymbus * Poliocephalus * Rollandia * Tachybaptus ] A grebe ( [ icon ˈ ɡ r iː b ] ) is a member of the Podicipediformes order, a widely distributed order of freshwater diving bird s, some of which visit the sea when migrating and in winter. This order contains only a single family, the Podicipedidae, containing 22 species in 6 extant genera. [ Description ] { Diving grebe } { left } { thumb } Grebes are small to medium-large in size, have lobed toes, and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, although they can run for a short distance, they are prone to falling over, since they have their feet placed far back on the body. Grebes have narrow wings, and some species are reluctant to fly; indeed, two South America n species are completely flightless. They respond to danger by diving rather than flying, and are in any case much less wary than duck s. Extant species range in size from the Least Grebe, at 120  grams (4.3  oz) and 23.5  cm (9.3  inches), to the Great Grebe, at 1.7  kg (3.8  lbs) and 71  cm (28  inches). However, the North America n and Eurasia n species are all, of necessity, migratory over much or all of their ranges, and those species that winter at sea are also seen regularly in flight. Even the small freshwater Pied-billed Grebe of North America has occurred as a transatlantic vagrant to Europe on more than 30 occasions. Bills vary from short and thick to long and pointed, depending on the diet, which ranges from fish to freshwater insects and crustaceans. The feet are always large, with broad lobes on the toes and small webs connecting the front three toes. The hind toe also has a small lobe. Recent experimental work has shown that these lobes work like the hydrofoil blades of a propeller. [ Forshaw, Joseph Fjeldså, John 1991 Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds Merehurst Press London 59–60 1-85391-186-0 ] Curiously, the same mechanism apparently evolved independently in the extinct Cretaceous -age Hesperornithiformes, which are totally unrelated birds. Grebes have unusual plumage. It is dense and waterproof, and on the underside the feathers are at right-angles to the skin, sticking straight out to begin with and curling at the tip. By pressing their feathers against the body, grebes can adjust their buoyancy. Often, they swim low in the water with just the head and neck exposed. In the non-breeding season, grebes are plain-coloured in dark browns and whites. However, most have ornate and distinctive breeding plumages, often developing chestnut markings on the head area, and perform elaborate display rituals. The young, particularly those of the Podiceps genus, are often striped and retain some of their juvenile plumage even after reaching full size. When preening, grebes eat their own feathers, and feed them to their young. The function of this behaviour is uncertain but it is believed to assist with pellet formation, [ Simmons Feather-eating and Pellet-formation in the Great Crested Grebe Brit. Birds 49 432–435 1956 ] and to reduce their vulnerability to gastric parasite s. Grebes make floating nests of plant material concealed among reeds on the surface of the water. The young are precocial, and able to swim from birth. [ Systematics and evolution ] The grebes are a radically distinct group of birds as regards their anatomy. Accordingly, they were at first believed to be related to the loon s, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both families were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes. However, as recently as the 1930s, this was determined to be an example of convergent evolution by the strong selective forces encountered by unrelated birds sharing the same lifestyle at different times and in different habitat. [ Stolpe M. 1935 Colymbus, Hesperornis, Podiceps:, ein Vergleich ihrer hinteren Extremität J. Ornithol. 80 1 161–247 German 10.1007/BF01908745 ] Grebes and loons are now separately classified orders of Podicipediformes and Gaviiformes, respectively. The cladistics vs. phenetics debate of the mid-20th century revived scientific interest in generalizing comparisons. As a consequence, the discredited grebe-loon link was discussed again. This even went as far as proposing monophyly for grebes, loons, and the toothed Hesperornithiformes. [ Cracraft Joel 1982 Systematic Zoology 31 35–56 10.2307/2413412 Phylogenetic Relationships and Monophyly of Loons, Grebes, and Hesperornithiform Birds, with Comments on the Early History of Birds 1 ] In retrospect, the scientific value of the debate lies more in providing examples that a cladistic methodology is not incompatible with an overall phenetical scientific doctrine, and that thus, simply because some study &quot; uses cladistics &quot;, it does not guarantee superior results. Molecular studies such as DNA-DNA hybridization (Sibley &amp; Ahlquist, 1990) and sequence analyses fail to resolve the relationships of grebes properly due to insufficient resolution in the former and long-branch attraction in the latter. Still – actually because of this – they do confirm that these birds form a fairly ancient evolutionary lineage (or possibly one that was subject to selective pressures down to the molecular level even), and they support the non-relatedness of loons and grebes.

They hold at least eleven morphological traits in common, which are not found on other birds. Many of these characteristics have been previously identified on flamingos, but not on grebes. [ 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2003.00094.x Mayr Gerald Gerald Mayr Morphological evidence for sister group relationship between flamingos (Aves: Phoenicopteridae) and grebes (Podicipedidae) Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 140 2 157–169 2004 http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/flamingo.pdf 0024-4082 November 3, 2009 ] The fossil Palaelodids can be considered evolutionarily, and ecologically, intermediate between flamingos and grebes.

Alternatively, they could be placed in one order, with Phoenocopteriformes taking priority. [ Fossil grebes ] &apos;&apos;Juncitarsus merkeli&apos;&apos; fossil The fossil record of grebes is incomplete; there are no transitional forms between more conventional birds and the highly derived grebes known from fossils, or at least none that can be placed in the relationships of the group with any certainty. [ May 2008 ] The enigmatic waterbird genus Juncitarsus, however, may be close to a common ancestor of flamingos and grebes. The Early Cretaceous ( Berriasian, around 143 mya ) genus Eurolimnornis from NW Romania was initially believed to be a grebe. If it is indeed related to this lineage, it must represent a most basal form, as it almost certainly predates any grebe-flamingo split. On the other hand, the single bone fragment assigned to this taxon is not very diagnostic and may not be of a bird at all. [ Benton M. J.

The analysis did not result in a phylogenetic pattern but rather grouped some birds with similar wing shapes together while others stood separate. It is thus unknown whether this apparent similarity to grebes represents an evolutionary relationship, or whether Telmatornis simply had a wing similar to that of grebes and moved it like they do.

Only the Early Miocene Miobaptus from Czechoslovakia might be somewhat closer to the ancestral grebes, but more probably belongs to an extinct lineage. Indeed, Miobaptus is rivalled or even exceeded in age by a species of the modern genus Podiceps. A few more recent grebe fossils could not be assigned to modern or prehistoric genera as of now: [ Jehl Joseph R.
