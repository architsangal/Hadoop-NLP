In French it is la Principauté d&apos;Orange. The title is carried by members of the House of Orange-Nassau, as heirs to the crown of the Netherlands. Rival claims to the title are made by members of the House of Hohenzollern and the family of Mailly. The current holders of the title are Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern), and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Nesle (Mailly). [ History ] [ County of Orange ] Four generations Princes of Orange - William I, Maurice and Frederick Henry, William II, William III &apos;&apos;(Willem van Honthorst, 1662)&apos;&apos; The title originally referred to Orange, Vaucluse in the Rhone valley in southern France, which was a property of the House of Orange, then the House of Baux and the House of Châlon-Arlay before passing in 1544 to the House of Orange-Nassau. The area started as the County of Orange, a fief in the Holy Roman Empire, in its constituent Kingdom of Burgundy. It was awarded to William of Gellone, a grandson of Charles Martel and therefore a cousin of Charlemagne, around the year 800 for his services in the wars against the Moors and reconquering southern France and the Spanish March. His Occitan name is Guilhem. However, as a Frankish lord, he probably knew himself by the old Germanic version of Wilhelm. William was also count of Toulouse, duke of Aquitaine, and marquis of Septimania. The horn that came to symbolize Orange when heraldry came in vogue much later in the 12th century was a pun on his name in French, from the character his deeds inspired in the chanson de geste, the Chanson de Guillaume, &quot; Guillaume au Court Nez &quot; or &quot; Guillaume au Cornet &quot;. [ Grew Marion Ethel The House of Orange Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd 1947 36 Essex Street, Strand, London W.C.2 ] The chanson appears to be based on William of Gellone&apos;s battle at the Orbieu or Orbiel river near Carcassonne in 793 as well as his seizure of the town of Orange. [ Geneviève Hasenohr and Michel Zink Dictionnaire des lettres françaises: Le Moyen Age La Pochothèque Paris Fayard 1992 2-253-05662-6 ] [ Principality of Orange ] As the kingdom of Burgundy fragmented in the early Middle Ages, the title was raised by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa elevated to a principality in 1163 to shore up his supporters in Burgundy against the Pope and the King of France. As the Empire&apos;s boundaries retreated from those of the principality, the prince acceded to the sovereign rights that the Emperor used to exercise. [ October 2011 ] As William the Silent wrote in his marriage proposal to the uncle of his second wife, the Elector August of Saxony, he held Orange as &quot; my own free property &quot;, not as a fief of anyone else, neither the Pope, nor the King of Spain or France. [ The princes of Orange: the stadholders in the Dutch Republic Herbert H. Rowen Cambridge University Press 1988 11 0-8063-4811-9 ] [ Archives ou correspondance inedite de la Maison d&apos;Orange-Nassau F.Groen van Prinsterer, et. al. Leiden and Utrecht 1835-1915 1 1 232 ] However, in the days where one&apos;s position honor and reputation were determined by such things, it drove William the Silent forward as much as it also fueled his great grandson&apos;s William III&apos;s opposition to Louis XIV when that king continually invaded and occupied Orange. The last descendant of the original princes, René of Nassau, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent, who was not a descendant of the original Orange family but the legal heir to the principality of Orange. { principality of Orange in the 16th century. } In 1673, Louis XIV of France annexed all territory of the principality to the royal domain, as part of the war actions against the stadtholder William III of Orange — who later became King William III of England and King William II of Scotland. Orange ceased to exist as a separate sovereign principality, or in today&apos;s parlance, a separate sovereign nation. In 1673, Louis XIV bestowed the (now non-sovereign) principality on Louis of Mailly-Nesles, marquis of Nesles (1689–1764), a very remote descendant of the original princes of Orange, through the marriage of the marquis to a descendant of the Chalons &amp; des Baux.

In 1714 Louis XIV bestowed the usufruct of the principality on Prince Louis Armand of Bourbon-Conti. He died in 1727 and the principality was merged in the Crown in 1731.

Appleton And Company 1873 article on Principality of Orange An agnatic relative of William III, John William Friso of Nassau, who was also descended by female line from William the Silent, was designated the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. Several of his descendants became stadtholders. They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance, similar to that of William the Silent, inheriting from his cousin René, though not being descendants of the original princes of Orange. They also claim on basis of the testament of Philips William, Maurice and William III. Finally, they claim on the basis that Orange was an independent state, where the sovereign had the right to assign his succession according to his will. France never recognized any of this, nor allowed the Oranje-Nassaus or the Hohenzollerns to obtain anything of the principality itself. The Oranje-Nassaus nevertheless assumed the title and also erected several of their lordships as new principality of Orange.

[ House of Bourbon ] Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti, appointed by the French king, and his descendants [ The Princes of Orange of the House of Orange-Nassau ] [ Historical background ] William the Silent (Willem I) was the first stadtholder of the Dutch Republic and the most significant representative of the House of Orange in the Netherlands. He was count of a small German county, part of the Duchy of Nassau and heir to some of his father&apos;s fiefs in Holland. William obtained more extensive lands in the Netherlands (the lordship of Breda and several other dependencies) as an inheritance from his cousin René, Prince of Orange, when William was only 11 years old. After William&apos;s assassination in 1584, the title passed to his son Philip William (who had been held hostage in Spain until 1596), and after his death in 1618, to his second son Maurice, and finally to his youngest son, Frederick Henry. The title of Prince of Orange became synonymous with the stadtholder of the Netherlands. William III (Willem III) was also King of England, Scotland and Ireland, and his legacy is commemorated annually by the Protestant Orange Order. William and Mary had no legitimate children. After his death in 1702, the Dutch contender to his title was his heir in the Netherlands, John William Friso of Nassau-Diez, who assumed the title. William&apos;s testament designated Friso to inherit the title. The other contender was the King in Prussia, who based his claim to the title on the will of Frederick Henry, William III&apos;s grandfather. Eventually, a compromise was reached by which both families were entitled to bear the title of Prince of Orange. By then, it was no more than a title because the principality had been annexed by Louis XIV of France. Friso&apos;s line held it as their principal title during the 18th century. The French army drove them away from the Netherlands in 1795, but on their return, the Prince of Orange became the first sovereign of the Netherlands in 1813. After the establishment of the current Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, the title was partly reconstitutionalized in a bill and granted to the eldest son of King William I of the Netherlands, Prince William, who later became William II of the Netherlands. Since 1983, the heir to the Dutch throne, whether male or female [ January 2009 ], bears the title Prince or Princess of Orange. The first-born child of the heir to the Dutch throne bears the title Hereditary Prince(ss) of Orange [ January 2009 ]. Currently, Princess Catharina-Amalia is the Hereditary Princess of Orange. She will be the Princess of Orange once her father, Prince Willem-Alexander, is inaugurated King of the Netherlands. [ Style ] The Prince(ss) of Orange is styled His/Her Royal Highness the Prince(ss) of Orange (Dutch: Zijne/Hare Koninklijke Hoogheid de Prins(es) van Oranje). During the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries, The Prince(ss) of Orange was styled His/Her Highness the Prince(ss) of Orange (Dutch: Zijne/Hare Hoogheid de Prins(es) van Oranje), except for William III, who rated the &quot; Royal/Koninklijke &quot; as his mother was the Princess Royal of England. [ Arms ] The princes of Orange in the 16th and 17th century used the following sets of arms. On becoming prince of Orange, William placed the Châlon-Arlay arms in the center ( &quot; as an inescutcheon &quot; ) of his father&apos;s arms. He used these arms until 1582 when he purchased the marquisate of Veere and Vlissingen. He then used the arms attributed to Frederick Henry, etc. with the arms of the marquisate in the top center, and the arms of the county of Buren in the bottom center. Their growing complexity shows how arms are used to reflect the growing political position and royal aspirations of the house of Orange-Nassau.

Individual members of the House of Orange-Nasau also given their own arms by the reigning monarch, similar to the United Kingdom. This is usually the royal arms, quartered with the arms of the principality of Orange, and an inescutcheon of their paternal arms. For Willem Alexander, the current Prince of Orange &amp; crown prince of the Netherlands, it is: Personal arms of William Alexander &amp; his brothers. The inescutcheon is his father&apos;s arms of van Amsberg. [ The Counts of Orange of the First House of Orange ] The first house of Orange is somewhat of a conjecture given the fragmentary nature of documentation in the early medieval era. The French Wikipedia page for the first House of Orange has presented what is known with references. Their chart is reproduced here.
