The first element is ulfr which means &quot; wolf &quot; and the last element is steinn which means &quot; stone mountain &quot; (probably referring to a hill behind the farm). Before 1879, the name was written Ulfsten (or Ulfsteen), then between 1879-1888 it was spelled Ulvsten, and since 1889, it has been spelled Ulstein.
