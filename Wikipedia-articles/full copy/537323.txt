In 1983, Wilde received the Brit Award for Best British Female. { BRITs Profile: Kim Wilde Brits.co.uk. Retrieved 29 February 2012 } In 1987 she had a major hit in the US when her version of The Supremes &apos; classic &quot; You Keep Me Hangin&apos; On &quot; topped the charts. Starting in 1998, while still active in music, she has branched into an alternative career as a landscape gardener. [ Early life ] The eldest child of 1950s rock &apos;n&apos; roll er Marty Wilde (birth name Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker, who was earlier a member of the singing and dancing group The Vernons Girls, Kim Smith was born in the West London suburb of Chiswick and attended Oakfield Preparatory School, in the Southeast London area of Dulwich. When she was nine, the family moved to Hertfordshire, where she was educated at Tewin and later Presdales School in Ware. In 1980, at age 20, she completed a foundation course at St Albans College of Art &amp; Design and, as Kim Wilde, was signed to RAK Records by Mickie Most. { The Official Fan Club for Kim Wilde Introductory Booklet, 1981, page 4 } [ Music career ] [ The RAK years ] { Oakfield School in Dulwich } Wilde released her debut single &quot; Kids in America &quot; in January 1981. An instant success, it reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia. { David Kent (1993) Australian Chart Book 1970 - 1992, Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W. } Although it achieved only moderate success in the US, peaking at number 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde&apos;s signature song. Her debut album Kim Wilde repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in &quot; Chequered Love &quot; (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single &quot; Water on Glass &quot;.Her follow-up album was 1982&apos;s Select, led by the hit singles &quot; Cambodia &quot; and &quot; View From a Bridge &quot;. Both were Number 1 hits in France and reached Top 10 positions in Germany and Australia. At the time, there was some controversy about Wilde&apos;s hesitation to do live concerts. { Kim Wilde taking different route to top : Word-of-mouth, Personal Promotions, Not Live Shows build sales Billboard (US), 19 September 1981 } Her first concerts in September 1982 took place in Denmark, { 1200 Wild Wilde-friends Sjællands Tidende (Denmark), 11 September 1982 } before embarking on a UK-wide tour in October. { Finally: Kim on tour Veronica (Netherlands), 2 October 1982 } Wilde&apos;s third album, Catch as Catch Can (1983) was a relative failure. [ February 2011 ] The first single from the album, &quot; Love Blonde &quot;, was another success in France and Scandinavia, but failed to have major success in other countries. The failure of the album led to her leaving RAK and signing with MCA Records in the summer of 1984. [ September 2010 ] [ The MCA years ] Wilde&apos;s first MCA album Teases &amp; Dares was again overlooked in her home country, [ February 2011 ] but fared better in Germany, France and Scandinavia as well as scoring another German Top 10 single with &quot; The Second Time &quot; (which was Top 30 in the UK). The video for this song appeared in an episode of the 1980s TV hit Knight Rider in 1985. { Knight rider Wilde Life - Official Kim Wilde Fansite } The second single, &quot; The Touch &quot;, was not a commercial success, but the third single, the rockabilly &quot; Rage to Love &quot;, made the UK top 20 in 1985. All of Wilde&apos;s songs up to this point, including all her major hits, had been written by her father Marty and brother, Ricky. On &quot; Teases &amp; Dares &quot; she penning two songs. Meanwhile, Wilde had embarked on three European concert tours (1983, 85 and 86). [ February 2011 ] On her fifth album, 1986&apos;s Another Step, Wilde wrote or co-wrote most of the songs. The album&apos;s lead single &quot; Schoolgirl &quot; flopped in Europe and Australia, but Wilde&apos;s fortunes improved in spectacular fashion with the album&apos;s second single, a Hi-NRG remake of The Supremes classic &quot; You Keep Me Hangin&apos; On &quot;. [ http://www.allmusic.com/album/another-step-r58345/review Another Step-Kim Wilde Allmusic 2011-08-14 ] After topping the charts in Australia and Canada and peaking at number two in the UK, it became a US number one single in 1987. With that hit, she became the fifth UK female solo artist ever to top the US Hot 100, following Petula Clark, Lulu, Sheena Easton, and Bonnie Tyler. { Leona Lewis, First UK Woman In 21 Years To Top Billboard Hot 100 BBC America, 27 March 2008 } Wilde later admitted to &quot; not knowing the song terribly well &quot; beforehand: &quot; Basically we just went into the studio with a lot of energy and not a lot of reverence. We changed quite a lot of the song and I think that&apos;s why it was so successful. It was a very spontaneous idea. &quot; { kimwilde.com You keep me hangin&apos; on Wilde Life - Official Kim Wilde Fansite } Her popularity, especially in her native UK, was revitalised and she scored further Top 10 hits in 1987 with &quot; Another Step (Closer to You) &quot; (recorded with Junior ) and &quot; Rockin&apos; Around the Christmas Tree &quot; (a Comic Relief charity single, recorded with comedian Mel Smith ). In 1988, Wilde released her biggest selling album to date, [ February 2011 ] Close, which returned her to the UK top 10 and spent almost eight months on the UK album chart. It produced four major European hits: &quot; Hey Mr.Heartache &quot;, &quot; You Came &quot;, &quot; Never Trust a Stranger &quot; and &quot; Four Letter Word &quot;, (the last 3 were Top 10 hits in the UK). The release of the album coincided with a tour of Europe, where she was the opening act for Michael Jackson &apos;s Bad World Tour. [ http://www.laut.de/Kim-Wilde Kim Wilde German laut.de Laut AG 2011-04-21 ] Wilde released her next album, Love Moves, in 1990. The album barely made the UK Top 40, and, although it was a Top 10 success in Scandinavian countries, it failed to sell as well as its predecessor and only spawned two minor hits, &quot; It&apos;s Here &quot; a Top 20 success in Middle and Northern Europe as well as &quot; Can&apos;t Get Enough (Of Your Love) &quot;, her last Top 20 hit in France. She toured Europe again, this time opening for fellow Briton David Bowie. A collaboration with Rick Nowels, who had produced hits for Stevie Nicks and Belinda Carlisle, resulted in the guitar-driven pop of the single &quot; Love Is Holy &quot; and the album Love Is (1992). The album&apos;s success was again limited to a small number of countries, though the single became another Top 20 hit in the UK, [ http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1992/ Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive: 1992 Official charts 2011-04-20 ] and the second single ( &quot; Heart Over Mind &quot; ) also made the top 40. In 1993, she released her first official compilation album The Singles Collection 1981–1993, which was a success throughout Europe and Australia and the dancefloor-influenced single &quot; If I Can&apos;t Have You &quot; (a cover of the Yvonne Elliman song from the film Saturday Night Fever that was penned by The Bee Gees ), became her last UK Top 20 Hit as well as a number 3 hit in Australia.

[ September 2010 ] Her next album, Now &amp; Forever (1995), was a commercial failure worldwide. Her single &quot; Breakin&apos; Away &quot;, however, was a minor hit, and the follow-up, &quot; This I Swear &quot;, was also a minor hit in Europe.
