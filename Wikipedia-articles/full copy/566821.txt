Islamic terrorism ( [ إرهاب إسلامي ] [ ar DIN ʾirhāb ʾislāmī ] ) is a form of religious terrorism [ Falk Avner Islamic terror : conscious and unconscious motives 2008 Praeger Security International Westport, Conn. 978-0-313-35764-0 4 ] committed by Muslim s for the purpose of achieving varying political and/or religious ends. Islam ic terrorism has been identified as taking place in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, South Asia including India, Southeast Asia, and the United States since the 1970s. Islamic terrorist organizations have been known to engage in tactics including suicide attack s, hijacking s, kidnapping and recruiting new members through the Internet. [ History ] Some scholars, such as Mark Burgess of the Center for Defense Information, trace the roots of Islamic terrorism back to the 11th-century Assassins, an order of Isma&apos;ili Shi&apos;ism that targeted political and religious opponents who stood in the way of the Assassins&apos; sectarian ideology. In positing a continuity between Islamic terrorism&apos;s medieval and modern manifestations, Burgess identifies both a common underlying motive, namely loyalty to a divine imperative, and similar tactics, such as actively seeking out martyrdom. The emergence of modern Islamic terrorism has its roots in the 19th century. { Dreyfuss (2006), p. 2 Cooper (2008), p.272 } The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement that formed in the 18th century, began to establish a broad following during the 1800s and gradually inspired other fundamentalist movements during the 20th century. Waves of politically motivated terrorist movements in Europe during the 1800s (e.g. the Narodnaya Volya, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ) and early 1900s (e.g. the IRA, the Irgun ) served as inspirations and models which would inspire the Islamists over the course of the 20th century and beyond. { Cooper (2008), p.272 } During the Cold War, the United States and the United Kingdom supported the rise of fundamentalist groups in the Middle East and South Asia as a hedge against Soviet expansion and as a means to weaken anti-Western nationalist movements in some countries. { Dreyfuss (2006), p. 1-4 } According to Burgess, the escalation of terrorism during the later 20th century has its roots in three pivotal events circa 1979: the Iranian Revolution, the post-Cold War global religious revival, and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. These events, Burgess goes on to argue, were factors that fueled a recourse to religious terrorism.

Moreover, today’s terrorism has, in some respects come full circle, with many of its contemporary practitioners motivated by religious convictions – something which drove many of their earliest predecessors. ] American historian Walter Laqueur described the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan as the &quot; global trigger &quot; of Islamic terrorism.

Some academics argue that this form of terrorism should be seen as a strategic reaction to American power: that America is an empire, and empires provoked resistance in the form of terrorism. The Russian, Ottoman, and Habsburg Empires, for example, all suffered from terrorist attacks and had terrorist organizations – the Black Hand, Young Bosnia, Narodnaya Volya – spawned from their multiple ethnic groups, religions and national identities. [ Albert J. Bergesen and Omar Lizardo 22 1 Theories of Terrorism: A Symposium Sociological Theory March 2004 38–52 10.1111/j.1467-9558.2004.00203.x ] On the other hand, American intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq led to free elections in those nations. The United States therefore does not meet the definition of an empire as it lacks politico-military dominion over Muslim or other populations in those countries. Moreover, as discussed in the section below, the first instances of anti-American islamic terrorism occurred long before the United States was a global power. [ The view that Islamic terrorism predates U.S. action and is justified by Quranic teachings ] March 18, 1786 letter written by Thomas Jefferson and John Adams describing their diplomatic initiative with Tripoli. An alternative argument is that anti-American terrorism predated the rise of the United States as a global power and is justified by the Quran. This is exemplified by the events leading to the First Barbary War. Muslim pirates of Algiers, Morocco, Tunis, and Tripoli Barbary Coast had attacked, enslaved and held American merchant sailors for ransom, soon after the establishment of the United States of America in 1776 (see First Barbary War ). These terrorist-type attacks predated any U.S. involvement in the islamic world and occurred before the US had been involved in any overseas military action. In 1786, future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams met with Tripoli’s envoy to London, Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman in an attempt to negotiate an end to the piracy. Adams and Jefferson summarized their meeting in a letter dated March 28, 1786 to John Jay, the United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs: [ http://www.princeton.edu/~tjpapers/volumes/volume9.html The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 9:358 Princeton Univ. Press Thomas Jefferson ] &quot; We took the liberty to make some enquiries concerning the ground of their pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury, and observed that we considered all mankind as our friends who had done us no wrong, nor had given us any provocation. The Ambassador [of Tripoli] answered us that it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman (muslims) who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise. &quot; These diplomatic engagements suggest that a modern Jihad -like ideology existed prior to any U.S. involvement in the Islamic world, and that the Koran was used to justify this ideology. Thus, according to critics of Islam, islamic terrorism is linked to the practice of divinely sanctioned warfare against apostates. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/27/opinion/27iht-edpabst.html The New York Times Phillip Blond Adrian Pabst The roots of Islamic terrorism 28 July 2005 ] [ International Humanist and Ethical Union http://www.iheu.org/node/1540 The Fate of Infidels and Apostates under Islam &amp; #124; International Humanist and Ethical Union Iheu.org 2011-10-16 ] Many Muslim groups including the Council on American-Islamic Relations argue that references to violence in Muslim sources have been taken out of context. { Bible, Quran easily quoted out of context } { Islam - Verses of Qur&apos;an That Condone &quot; Killing the Infidel &quot; ? } [ 25057350 How Thomas Jefferson Read the Qur&apos;ān Kevin J. Hayes ] They argue that these Koranic ayahs are only for self-defense when non-believers endanger Muslim life. While a debate may exist on the proper interpretation of Koranic verses, the terrorist actions leading to the First Barbary War and the justification provided by Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman, provide an early example where the Koran was used to justify anti-American terrorism. These events occurred at a time where the U.S. had yet to intervene in the Muslim world and argue against U.S. policy as a fundamental cause of islamic terrorism. On the contrary, the historical timeline demonstrates that the very first U.S. engagement with the Muslim world was an American response to Islamic terrorism. [ Societal and economic motivations ] Scholar Scott Atran, research director and involved in NATO group studying suicide terrorism, points out that there is no single root cause of terrorism. Greatest predictors of suicide bombings, Atran concludes, is not religion but group dynamics: &quot; small-group dynamics involving friends and family that form the diaspora cell of brotherhood and camaraderie on which the rising tide of martyrdom actions is based &quot;. { The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism p.138, 144 } The Muslim world has been afflicted with economic stagnation for many centuries. In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama himself stated that apart from crude oil, the exports of the entire Greater Middle East with its 400 million population roughly equals that of Switzerland. [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-economics-of-obamas-arab-spring-speech/2011/05/19/AFIh0K7G_blog.html The Washington Post 19 May 2011 Michelle Singletary The economics of Obama&apos;s Arab Spring speech ] It has also been estimated that the exports of Finland, a European country of only five million, exceeded those of the entire 260 million-strong Arab world, excluding oil revenue. [ August 2011 ] This economic stagnation is argued [ August 2011 ] to have commenced with the demise of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, with trade networks being disrupted and societies torn apart with the creation of new nation states; prior to this, the Middle East had a diverse and growing economy and more general prosperity [ attribution needed for contrafactual statement, someone *believe* this, despite not true March 2012 ]. Obama gave a major public speech in the United States in response to the 2011 Arab Spring. In a message to Muslim leaders around the world, Obama urged reform and stated &quot; that in a global economy based on knowledge, based on innovation, no development strategy can be based solely upon what comes out of the ground (oil). He also stated that people can not reach their potential when they cannot start a business without paying a bribe. Throughout the region, many young people have a solid education, but closed economies leave them unable to find a job. Muslim entrepreneurs are brimming with excellent ideas, but corruption, lack of funding, lack of support or inadequate infastructure leaves them unable to develop and profit from those ideas. &quot; Strong population growth combined with economic stagnation has created urban conglomerations in Cairo, Istanbul, Tehran, Karachi, Dhaka, and Jakarta each with well over 12 million citizens, millions of them young and unemployed or underemployed. Such a demographic, alienated from the westernized ways of the urban elite, [ August 2011 ] but uprooted from the comforts and more passive traditions of the villages they came from, is understandably favourably disposed to an Islamic system promising a better world – an ideology providing an &quot; emotionally familiar basis for group identity, solidarity, and exclusion]; an acceptable basis for legitimacy and authority; an immediately intelligible formulation of principles for both a critique of the present and a program for the future. &quot; [ August 2011 ] [ Profiles ] Forensic psychiatrist and former foreign service officer Marc Sageman made an &quot; intensive study of biographical data on 172 participants in the jihad, &quot; in his book Understanding Terror Networks. { Sageman (2004) } He concluded social network s, the &quot; tight bonds of family and friendship &quot; rather than emotional and behavioral disorders of &quot; poverty, trauma, madness, [or] ignorance, &quot; inspired alienated young Muslims to join the jihad and kill.

Militants generally use jihad to mean defensive or retaliatory warfare against actors that have allegedly harmed Muslims. Transnational Islamist ideology, specifically of the militant Islamists, assert that Western polities and society are actively anti-Islamic, or as it is sometimes described, waging a &quot; war against Islam &quot;. Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between Christianity and Islam, dating back as far as the Crusades, among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. Osama bin Laden, for example, almost invariably describes his enemy as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. Defensive jihad differs from offensive jihad in being &quot; fard al-ayn, &quot; or a personal obligation of all Muslim, rather than &quot; fard al-kifaya &quot;, a communal obligation, which if some Muslims perform it is not required from others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage both of appearing to be a victim rather than aggressor, and of giving your struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims. Many of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and Israel. An example is bin Laden&apos;s al-Qaeda, which is also known as &quot; International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders &quot;. Most militant Islamists oppose Israel&apos;s policies, and often its existence. According to the U.S. Army Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, “ideology”, rather than any individual or group, is the &quot; center of gravity &quot; of al-Qaeda and related groups, and the ideology is a &quot; collection of violent Islamic thought called Qutbism. &quot; He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being: A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to “pure Islam” as originally practiced during the time of the Prophet. The path to “pure Islam” is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the Qur&apos;an and Hadith, along with implementation of the Prophet’s commands. Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars. That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the classical jurisprudential tradition is mere sophistry. Qutbism, An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism by Dale C. Eikmeier. Retrieved 17 June 2009. The historic rivalry between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a U.S. State Department report, India topped the list of countries worst affected by Islamic terrorism. In addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as immoral secularism. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of pornography, immorality, secularism, homosexuality, feminism, and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about them in his messages, in his &quot; Letter to America &quot; he answered the question, &quot; What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?, &quot; with We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling&apos;s, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women. { Full text: bin Laden&apos;s &apos;letter to America&apos; accessed 24 may 2007 } Given their perceived piety, The Times noted the irony when a major { Sexual perverts and the link to Islamic terrorists, The London Daily News,17 October 2008. } investigation by their reporters uncovered a link between Islamic Jihadis and child pornography; a discovery that, according to the London paper, &quot; is expected to improve understanding of the mindsets of both types of criminals and has been hailed as a potentially vital intelligence tool to undermine future terrorist plots. &quot;. { Dangerous and depraved: paedophiles unite with terrorists online, Richard Kerbaj, Dominic Kennedy, Richard Owen and Graham Keeley, } { The Times, 17 October 2008. Retrieved 30 November 2008. } Similarly, Reuters reported that pornography was found among the materials seized from Osama bin Laden&apos;s Abbottabad compound that was raided by U.S. Navy SEALs. { Exclusive: Pornography found in bin Laden hideout: officials, &quot; Reuters &quot;, 13 May 2011 } In 2006 Britain&apos;s then head of MI5 Eliza Manningham-Buller said of Al-Qaeda that it &quot; has developed an ideology which claims that Islam is under attack, and needs to be defended &quot;. &quot; This &quot; she said &quot; is a powerful narrative that weaves together conflicts from across the globe, presenting the West’s response to varied and complex issues, from long-standing disputes such as Israel/Palestine and Kashmir to more recent events as evidence of an across-the-board determination to undermine and humiliate Islam worldwide. &quot; { &lt; 2006 Speech of Eliza Manningham-Buller Director-General of MI5 on the terrorist threat facing the } { United Kingdom } She said that the video wills of British suicide bombers made it clear that they were motivated by perceived worldwide and long-standing injustices against Muslims; an extreme and minority interpretation of Islam promoted by some preachers and people of influence; their interpretation as anti-Muslim of UK foreign policy, in particular the UK’s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot; She also cautioned how difficult it was to gain a proper perspective, saying that although there are more important dangers we face daily without feeling so threatened by them such as climate change and road deaths and though terrorist deaths were few the intelligence services had prevented some potentially large threats and that vigilance was needed. [ Interpretations of the Qur&apos;an and Hadith ] [ July 2011 ] The role played by the Qur&apos;an, Islam&apos;s sacred text, in opposing or in encouraging attacks on civilians is disputed. The Princeton University Middle Eastern scholar Bernard Lewis, states that Islamic jurisprudence does not allow terrorism. { Lewis, Bernard, &apos;Islam: The Religion and the People&apos; (2009). Page 53, 145–150 } In 2001, Professor Lewis noted: [ Bernard Lewis http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id%3D95001224 Extra - WSJ.com Opinionjournal.com September 27, 2001 April 25, 2010 ] At no time did the (Muslim) jurist approve of terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism (in Islamic tradition). Muslims are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged, not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners, to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities, and to honor agreements. Similarly, the laws of Jihad categorically preclude wanton and indiscriminate slaughter. The warriors in the holy war are urged not to harm non-combatants, women and children, &quot; unless they attack you first. &quot; A point on which they insist is the need for a clear declaration of war before beginning hostilities, and for proper warning before resuming hostilities after a truce. What the classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered is the kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations that we saw in New York two weeks ago. For this there is no precedent and no authority in Islam. But Bernard Lewis says Jihad is an unlimited offensive to bring the whole world under Islamic law; Christian crusades a defensive, limited response to, and imitation of, jihad. { From pp.233-234 of The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2000 Years } { Even the Christian crusade, often compared with the Muslim jihad, was itself a delayed and limited response to the jihad and in part also an imitation. But unlike the jihad it was concerned primarily with the defense or reconquest of threatened or lost Christian territory...The Muslim jihad, in contrast, was perceived [by Muslims] as unlimited, as a religious obligation that would continue until all the world had either adopted the Muslim faith or submitted to Muslim rule.… The object of jihad is to bring the whole world under Islamic law. } Bernard Lewis says Islam imposes, without limit of time or space, the duty to subjugate non-Muslims. { p. 73 of The Political Language of Islam } &quot;...it is the duty of those who have accepted them [Allah&apos;s word and message] to strive unceasingly to convert or at least to subjugate those who have not. This obligation is without limit of time or space. It must continue until the whole world has either accepted the Islamic faith or submitted to the power of the Islamic state.” Michael Sells and Jane I. Smith (a Professor of Islamic Studies) write that barring some extremists like al-Qaeda, most Muslims do not interpret Qura’nic verses as promoting warfare; and that the phenomenon of radical interpretation of scripture by extremist groups is not unique to Islam. [ Michael Sells Understanding, Not Indoctrination http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename%3Darticle%26amp%3Bnode%3D%26amp%3BcontentId%3DA57379-2002Aug7%26amp%3BnotFound%3Dtrue August 8, 2002 The Washington Post ] [ Jane I.

Page 165-166: It is one of his most arresting statements. It is true that his Quran is quite brief, especially in comparison to the Old and even the New Testaments; whether its contents truly bear the &quot; widest meaning, &quot; is a matter for the contention of theologians. That he was made &quot; victorious with terror &quot; is undeniable, given the tumultuous history of his prophetic career, with its raids, wars, and assassinations. } &quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot; I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand. &quot; Abu Huraira added: Allah&apos;s Apostle has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them). Narrated in Abu Huraira, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 220 &quot; Furthermore Muhammad said in another Hadith: { Spencer, Robert, &apos;The Truth About Muhammad&apos; (2006). Page 115-116: After the Battle of Badr and the attack against the Qaynuqa Jews, the Prophet of Islam directed his anger ant the Jewish poet Ka´b bin Al-Ashraf, who according to Ibn Ishaq, &quot; composed amatory verses of an insulting nature about the Muslim women. &quot; } The Prophet said, &quot; Who is ready to kill Ka&apos;b bin Al-Ashraf who has really hurt Allah and His Apostle? &quot; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &quot; O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Do you like me to kill him? &quot; He replied in the affirmative. So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to him (i.e. Ka&apos;b) and said, &quot; This person (i.e. the Prophet) has put us to task and asked us for charity. &quot; Ka&apos;b replied, &quot; By Allah, you will get tired of him. &quot; Muhammad said to him, &quot; We have followed him, so we dislike to leave him till we see the end of his affair. &quot; Muhammad bin Maslama went on talking to him in this way till he got the chance to kill him. Narrated Jabir bin &apos;Abdullah Volume 4, Book 52, Number 270 And another Hadith: { Spencer, Robert, &apos;The Truth About Muhammad&apos; (2006).

And so their proclamations ignore 14 centuries of Muslim scholarship, and instead take the form of lists of anti-American grievances and of Koranic quotations referring to early Muslim wars against Arab idolaters. These are followed by the conclusion that all Americans, civilian and military, are to be wiped off the face of the Earth. All this amounts to an odd and extreme violation of the normal methods of Islamic scholarship. Had the authors of such fatwā s followed the norms of their religion, they would have had to acknowledge that no school of mainstream Islam allows the targeting of civilians.

Identity-based theoretical frameworks including theories of social identity, social categorization theory, and psychodynamics are used to explain the reasons terrorism occurs. { “Perspectives on Terrorism – Explaining Terrorism: A Psychosocial Approach.” Web. 16 Apr. 2010. } Social identity is explained by Karina Korostelina as a “feeling of belonging to a social group, as a strong connection with social category, and as an important part of our mind that affects our social perceptions and behavior” { Korostelina, K. (2007). Social Identity and Conflict: Structures, Dynamics and Implications. New York: Palgrave Macmillan } This definition can be applied to the case of Osama bin Laden, who, according to this theory, has a highly salient perception of his social identity as a Muslim, a strong connection to the social category of the Muslim Ummah or &apos;community,&apos; which affect his social perceptions and behaviors. { “Osama bin Laden&apos;s growing anxiety / The Christian Science Monitor – CSMonitor.com.” Web. 16 Apr. 2010 } Bin Laden&apos;s ideology and interpretation of Islam led to the creation of al-Qaeda in response to perceived threats against the Muslim community by the Soviet Union, the U.S. in particular due to its troop presence in Saudi Arabia, and American support for Israel. { “ Al-Qaeda Blames 9/11 on US Support for Israel – Defense/Middle East – Israel News – Israel National News. ” Web. 16 Apr. 2010. } The Islamist terrorist group al-Qaeda has a group identity, which includes “shared experiences, attitudes, beliefs, and interests of ingroup members,” and is “described through the achievement of a collective aim for which this group has been created,” { name=Korostelina } which in this case is to achieve &quot; a complete break from the foreign influences in Muslim countries, and the creation of a new Islamic caliphate. &quot; Social categorization theory has been discussed as a three-stage process of identification, where “individuals define themselves as members of a social group, learn the stereotypes and norms of the group, and group categories influence the perception and understanding of all situations in a particular context” This definition can be applied to the U.S.-led war on terror, in which conflict features such as the phenomenon of Anti-Americanism { “Understanding Arab anti-Americanism. - By Lee Smith - Slate Magazine.” Web. 30 Apr. 2010. } and the phenomenon of non-Arab countries like Iran and Afghanistan lending support to Islamist-based terrorism by funding or harboring terrorist groups such as Hezbollah { “Hizballah (Party of God).” Web. 30 Apr. 2010. } and al-Qaeda { “Analysis Of Al Qaeda In Afghanistan And Pakistan | Eurasia Review.” Web. 30 Apr. 2010. } against Western nations, particularly Israel { “Hezbollah and its Goals.” Web. 30 Apr. 2010. } and the United States { “Al-Qaida.” Web. 30 Apr. 2010. } are, according to social categorization theory, influenced by a three-stage process of identification. In this three-stage process of identification, the Arab and Muslim world(s) are the social group(s), in which their members learn stereotype s and norms which categorize their social group vis-à-vis the West. { “Global Connections.

According to Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (his booklet on Jihad is considered one of his most important contribution towards understanding the religion according to the principles of interpreting the Qur&apos;an introduced by Farahi and Islahi ) the Qur&apos;an does not allow waging war except for against oppression under a sovereign state. He holds that jihad without a state is nothing but creating nuisance in the land when hijacked by the individuals and groups independent of the state authority defeats the purpose. The principle behind this study of the issue in the basic sources is the principle that there are divine injunctions in the Qur&apos;an which are specific to the age of the Messenger. He says that nobody can be punished for apostasy or being non-Muslim after the Prophet who acted as the divine agent when he punished the disbelievers by sword who had rejected the message of God and his messenger even after the truth was made manifest to them. Ghamidi and his associates have written extensively on the topics related to these issues. In his book Meezan Ghamidi has concluded that: Jihad can only waged against persecution Islamic jihad has only two purposes: putting an end to persecution even that of the non-Muslims and making the religion of Islam reign supreme in the Arabian peninsula. The latter type was specific for the messenger of God and is no more operative. Under a sovereign state. There are strict ethical limits for jihad which do not again allow fighting for example non-combatants. Seen in this perspective acts of terrorism including suicide bombing becomes prohibited. [ Opinion surveys ] [ April 2010 ] Gallup conducted tens of thousands of hour-long, face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries between 2001 and 2007.

A Daily Telegraph survey showed that 88% of Muslims said the July 2005 bombings in the London Underground were unjustified, while 6% disagreed. In Pakistan, despite the recent rise in the Taliban&apos;s influence, a poll conducted by Terror Free Tomorrow in Pakistan in January 2008 tested support for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, other militant Islamist groups and Osama bin Laden himself, and found a recent drop by half. In August 2007, 33% of Pakistanis expressed support for al-Qaeda; 38% supported the Taliban. By January 2008, al-Qaeda&apos;s support had dropped to 18%, the Taliban&apos;s to 19%. When asked if they would vote for al-Qaeda, just 1% of Pakistanis polled answered in the affirmative. The Taliban had the support of 3% of those polled. Pew Research surveys in 2008 show that in a range of countries – Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh – there have been substantial declines in the percentages saying suicide-bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets can be justified to defend Islam against its enemies. Wide majorities say such attacks are, at most, rarely acceptable. The shift of attitudes against terror has been especially dramatic in Jordan, where 29% of Jordanians were recorded as viewing suicide-attacks as often or sometimes justified (down from 57% in May 2005). In the largest majority-Muslim nation, Indonesia, 74% of respondents agree that terrorist attacks are &quot; never justified &quot; (a substantial increase from the 41% level to which support had risen in March 2004); in Pakistan, that figure is 86%; in Bangladesh, 81%; and in Iran, 80%. A poll conducted in Osama bin Laden&apos;s home country of Saudi Arabia in December 2008 shows that his compatriots have dramatically turned against him, his organisation, Saudi volunteers in Iraq, and terrorism in general. Indeed, confidence in bin Laden has fallen in most Muslim countries in recent years. In Iraq, people of all persuasions unanimously reject the terror tactics against Iraqi civilians by the local al-Qaida. An ABC News / BBC / NHK poll revealed that all of those surveyed – Sunni and Shi&apos;a alike – found al-Qaida attacks on Iraqi civilians &quot; unacceptable &quot;; 98% rejected the militants&apos; attempts to gain control over areas in which they operated; and 97% opposed their attempts to recruit foreign fighters and bring them to Iraq.

In the September 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis more than 1,000 people were taken hostage after a school in the Russian republic of North Ossetia–Alania was seized by a pro-Chechen multiethnic group aligned to Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs; hundreds of people died during the storming by Russian forces. { Foreign Affairs, January/February 2008, p.74, &quot; The Myth of the Authoritarian Model &quot; } Since 2000, Russia has also experienced a string of suicide bombings that killed hundreds of people in the Caucasian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, as well as in Russia proper including Moscow.

The use of suicide bombers is seen by many Muslims [ July 2011 ] as contradictory to Islam&apos;s teachings; { Suicide Bombers in Islam } [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8544531.stm BBC News Dominic Casciani Muslim scholar condemns terrorism 2 March 2010 ] however, groups who support its use often refer to such attacks as &quot; martyrdom operations &quot; and the suicide-bombers who commit them as &quot; martyr s &quot; (Arabic: shuhada, plural of &quot; shahid &quot; ). The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ( shaheed ) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of paradise for their actions. [ Hijackings ] Islamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most famous were the &quot; 9/11 &quot; attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of aircraft hijacking. [ Kidnappings and executions ] Along with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted in the 1986 Iran–Contra affair. During the chaos of the Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.
