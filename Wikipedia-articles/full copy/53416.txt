[ Career ] { Metropolitan Opera House at } { Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, seen from Lincoln Center Plaza. } Harrison started his professional career with the firm of Corbett, Harrison &amp; MacMurray, participating in the construction of Rockefeller Center. He is best known for executing large public projects in New York City and upstate, many of them a result of his long and fruitful personal relationship with Nelson Rockefeller, for whom he served as an adviser. Architecturally, Harrison&apos;s major projects are marked by straightforward planning and sensible functionalism, although his residential side-projects show more experimental and humane flair. His architectural partner from 1941 to 1976 was Max Abramovitz. In 1931 Harrison established an 11 acre (45,000 m²) summer retreat in West Hills, New York, which was a very early example and workshop for the International Style in the United States, and a social and intellectual center of architecture, art, and politics. The home includes a 32 foot circular living room that is rumored to have been the prototype for the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center. Two other circular rooms complete the center of Harrison&apos;s design. Frequent visitors and guests included Nelson Rockefeller, Robert Moses, Marc Chagall, Le Corbusier, and Fernand Léger, who waited out part of World War II by painting a mural at the bottom of Harrison&apos;s swimming pool. Leger also created a large mural for the home&apos;s circular living room and sculpted an abstract form to serve as a skylight. Calder&apos;s first show is said to have taken place at the home. Between 1941 and 1943, Harrison designed and built the Clinton Hill Coops, a 12-building coop complex split between two “campuses” along Clinton Ave. in Brooklyn, New York, to house the Brooklyn Navy Yards workers. Harrison&apos;s architectural drawings and archives are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.
