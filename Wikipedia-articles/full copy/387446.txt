He was a two-time runner-up in the FIA Formula One World Drivers&apos; Championship. Peterson began his motor racing career in kart racing, traditionally the discipline where the majority of race drivers begin their careers in open-wheel racing. After winning a number of karting titles, including two Swedish titles in 1963 and 1964, he moved on to Formula Three, where he won the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race for the 1969 Grand Prix. Later that year he won the European Formula Three Championship and moved up into Formula One, racing for the March factory team. In his three-year spell with the team, he took six podiums, most of which were scored during the 1971 Formula One season in which he also finished as runner-up in the Drivers&apos; Championship. After seeing out his three-year contract at March, Peterson joined Colin Chapman &apos;s Team Lotus in 1973, partnering defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi. During his first two seasons with Lotus, Peterson took seven victories, scoring a career-best 52 points in 1973. After a poor 1975 season, Peterson moved back to March and scored his final victory for the team at the 1976 Italian Grand Prix. After spending 1977 with Tyrrell, he moved back to Lotus for the 1978 season as &quot; number two &quot; driver to Mario Andretti. Peterson scored two wins, at the South African and Austrian Grand Prix races, and would finish second in the Drivers&apos; Championship standings despite a fatal first-lap accident at Monza during the Italian Grand Prix. [ Early life ] Peterson was born in Almby in the vicinity of Örebro, Sweden. He developed his driving style at a young age while competing in karting, and rapidly worked his way up to the pinnacle of European karting before switching to cars. [ Formulas Three and Two ] After his karting years, Peterson entered Formula Three racing in the Svebe, a 1L, Brabham -derived Formula car he co-designed with his father Bengt (who was a baker) and Sven Andersson. Superb results from the outset quickly attracted the attention of the ambitious Tecno company from Italy, who signed him up in 1968. The pairing produced some fine results, and he won the 1969 Formula Three Championship. Even after his elevation to F1 status Peterson still drove in lower echelon racing series (which was common at the time), winning the 1971 European Formula Two Championship driving for March. [ Formula One ] [ Early years ] Peterson made his Grand Prix debut in a March 701 for Colin Crabbe &apos;s works-supported Antique Automobiles Racing Team at the 1970 Monaco Grand Prix. The limited budget of Crabbe&apos;s privateer team allowed only minimal testing, but Peterson qualified 12th out of 16 cars in the race. He was 10 places behind Jackie Stewart and Chris Amon, both on the front row of the grid in their newer specification 701s, but only just behind the more experienced Jo Siffert in the second works March. Peterson was the only March driver to finish the race, in seventh place. { Lawrence, Mike (1989) The Story of March; Four guys and a telephone Aston Publishing Ltd. p.36 ISBN 0-946627-24-X } In 1971 Peterson moved up to the full March works team, and made an instant impression. Five Formula One Grand Prix second places earned him the position of runner-up to Jackie Stewart in that year&apos;s World Championship. Peterson stayed at March until 1973, when he signed for John Player Team Lotus to partner Emerson Fittipaldi. [ 1973–1976 ] { Lotus 72 /R8 - Ronnie Peterson&apos;s main car during the } { 1974 Formula One season. } Ronnie Peterson at Silverstone in 1975. Peterson&apos;s first Grand Prix win was at the 1973 French Grand Prix, held at Paul Ricard, in a Lotus 72. There were three more wins that year, in Austria, Italy and the United States, but poor reliability restricted him to only third place in the World Championship at season&apos;s end. 1974 yielded three more victories: the French and Italian Grands Prix, as well as the Monaco Grand Prix, the premier event of Formula One. 1975 was a bad year for Lotus. The Lotus 76 proved a failure, and he reverted to driving the 72F. Peterson drove the first two races of 1976 in the Lotus 77 before rejoining March Engineering. Driving the March 761, he won the Italian Grand Prix. [ 1977–1978 ] [ section September 2007 ] In 1977, he raced for Tyrrell, driving the six-wheel Tyrrell P34 B. His only podium finish was a third place at the Belgian Grand Prix. Peterson surprised many by leaving Tyrrell to return to John Player Team Lotus for 1978.He won the 1978 South African Grand Prix, with a last-lap victory over Patrick Depailler, as well as the Austrian Grand Prix, in the innovative &apos;ground effect&apos; Lotus 79. His teammate Mario Andretti won the Drivers&apos; Championship with Peterson acting effectively as the Team &quot; No. 2 &quot; with the pair scoring four 1–2 wins, all with Mario at the lead. Both of Peterson&apos;s wins occurred when Andretti encountered trouble, with Mario winning once when Peterson failed to finish (not including the Italian Grand Prix ). Many times Peterson followed Andretti closely home, leading to speculation that &apos;Team Orders&apos; were in place. Throughout the 1970s Peterson had the reputation of being the fastest driver in F1 in terms of raw speed. [ September 2010 ] During the 1978 season Andretti would frequently post the faster qualifying time. Perhaps refusing to believe the American could beat Peterson in a head to head contest, many came to believe that team orders extended even to qualifying. Another view, held by some contemporary observers, was that while Peterson may have in fact been the outright quicker of the two, it was Andretti&apos;s considerable car development skills that brought the recalcitrant Lotus 78 and 79 to full potential, and Peterson&apos;s seeming deference to Andretti was a tacit acknowledgement of this. [ November 2011 ] To his credit, Peterson refused to contribute to any controversy, and on numerous occasions dismissed the speculation by stating that Andretti had simply turned the faster time. [ June 2008 ] [ Death ] The 1978 Italian Grand Prix at Monza started badly for Peterson. In practice he damaged his Lotus 79 race car beyond immediate repair and bruised his legs in the process. Team Lotus had a spare 79, but it had been built for Andretti, and the taller Peterson did not fit comfortably inside. The team&apos;s only other car was a type 78, the previous year&apos;s car, which had been dragged around the F1 circuit that season with minimal maintenance. At the start of the race, the race starter threw the green light before the field was ready. The cars from fourth row onwards (Peterson started from the third) were rolling when the green light came on and got a jump on those ahead, resulting in an accordion effect as the cars approached the chicane, bunching them tightly together. The front four, Andretti, Villeneuve, Jabouille and Lauda, were far enough ahead to avoid any drama, but Peterson had made a poor start from fifth and was immediately passed by Alan Jones, Jacques Laffite and John Watson. Jody Scheckter and Riccardo Patrese, starting 10th and 12th, had moved to the right across the line that separated the Grand Prix front straight from the approach to the old Monza banking. While Scheckter&apos;s Wolf was able to rejoin the track well ahead of the bunching pack, Patrese moved back in just ahead of James Hunt, who feinted left and collided with Peterson, with Vittorio Brambilla, Carlos Reutemann, Hans-Joachim Stuck, Patrick Depailler, Didier Pironi, Derek Daly, Clay Regazzoni and Brett Lunger all involved in the ensuing melee. Peterson&apos;s Lotus went into the barriers hard and caught fire before bouncing back into the middle of the track. He was trapped in the burning wreck, but Hunt, Regazzoni and Depailler managed to free him before he received more than minor burns. He was dragged free and laid in the middle of the track fully conscious, his severe leg injuries obvious to all. Hunt later said he stopped Peterson from looking at his legs to spare him further distress. At the time there was more concern for Brambilla, who was hit on the head by a flying wheel and was slumped comatose in his car (he later recovered and drove on in F1 until 1980). Peterson&apos;s life was not seen to be in any danger. The injured drivers were taken to hospital in Milan and the race was restarted when the track had been cleaned up. At the hospital, Peterson&apos;s X-rays showed he had seven fractures in one leg and three in the other. After discussion with him, the surgeons decided to operate to stabilize the bones. Unfortunately, during the night, bone marrow went into Peterson&apos;s bloodstream through the fractures, forming fat globules on his major organs including lungs, liver and brain. By morning he was in full renal failure and was declared dead a few hours later. The cause of death was given as fat embolism. { http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct &amp; n=313 } Teammate Mario Andretti clinched the championship at the race. [ Super Mario had speed to burn ESPN Larry Schwartz http://www.espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/andretti_mario.html 2007-07-12 ] &quot; It was so unfair to have a tragedy connected with probably what should have been the happiest day of my career &quot;, Andretti said, &quot; I couldn&apos;t celebrate, but also, I knew that trophy would be with me forever. And I knew also that Ronnie would have been happy for me &quot;. { Örebro, was unveiled in August 2003. } Peterson ran a total of 123 Grand Prix races during his career, winning ten of them. [ November 2011 ] Peterson&apos;s widow Barbro (née Edwardsson) never got over his death and committed suicide on 19 December 1987. She was buried alongside Ronnie in the Peterson family grave in Örebro. { The Official Ronnie Peterson Website } She and Ronnie had a daughter named Nina Louise (named after Jochen Rindt &apos;s wife) who was born in November 1975. { Formula 1 complete - all access F1 - Peterson, Ronnie } There is a statue of Ronnie Peterson in Örebro, by Richard Brixel. The official Ronnie Peterson museum was officially opened by Nina Peterson in Örebro on 31 May 2008, but it closed in October 2009 because it was unable to secure government funding. { http://www.ronniepetersonmuseum.com } [ Complete World Championship results ] ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) Year Entrant Chassis Engine 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 WDC Pts. 1970 Antique Automobiles Racing Team March 701 Cosworth V8 RSA ESP MON 7 BEL NC NC 0 Colin Crabbe Racing NED 9 FRA Ret GBR 9 GER Ret AUT ITA Ret CAN NC USA 11 MEX 1971 STP March Racing Team March 711 Cosworth V8 RSA 10 ESP Ret MON 2 NED 4 GBR 2 GER 5 AUT 8 ITA 2 CAN 2 USA 3 2nd 33 Alfa Romeo V8 FRA Ret 1972 STP March Racing Team March 721 Cosworth V8 ARG 6 RSA 5 9th 12 March 721X ESP Ret MON 11 BEL 9 March 721G FRA 5 GBR 7 GER 3 AUT 12 ITA 9 CAN DSQ USA 4 1973 John Player Team Lotus Lotus 72D Cosworth V8 ARG Ret BRA Ret RSA 11 3rd 52 Lotus 72E ESP Ret BEL Ret MON 3 SWE 2 FRA 1 GBR 2 NED 11 GER Ret AUT 1 ITA 1 CAN Ret USA 1 1974 John Player Team Lotus Lotus 72E Cosworth V8 ARG 13 BRA 6 MON 1 SWE Ret NED 8 FRA 1 GBR 10 AUT Ret ITA 1 CAN 3 USA Ret 5th 35 Lotus 76 RSA Ret ESP Ret BEL Ret GER 4 1975 John Player Team Lotus Lotus 72E Cosworth V8 ARG Ret BRA 15 RSA 10 ESP Ret MON 4 BEL Ret SWE 9 NED 15 FRA 10 GBR Ret GER Ret AUT 5 ITA Ret USA 5 13th 6 1976 John Player Team Lotus Lotus 77 Cosworth V8 BRA Ret 11th 10 March Engineering March 761 RSA Ret ESP Ret BEL Ret MON Ret SWE 7 FRA 19 GBR Ret GER Ret AUT 6 NED Ret ITA 1 CAN 9 USA Ret JPN Ret Theodore Racing USW 10 1977 Elf Team Tyrrell Tyrrell P34B Cosworth V8 ARG Ret BRA Ret RSA Ret USW Ret ESP 8 MON Ret BEL 3 SWE Ret FRA 12 GBR Ret GER 9 AUT 5 NED Ret ITA 6 USA 16 CAN Ret JPN Ret 14th 7 1978 John Player Team Lotus Lotus 78 Cosworth V8 ARG 5 BRA Ret RSA 1 USW 4 MON Ret BEL 2 ITA Ret 2nd 51 Lotus 79 ESP 2 SWE 3 FRA 2 GBR Ret GER Ret AUT 1 NED 2 USA CAN [ References ] [ Journals ] [ Henry Alan Alan Henry 2008 October My Mate Ronnie Motor Sport 48 10 58 –64 2008-09-29 ] [ Internet ] Nyberg, R. &amp; Diepraam, M. 2000.
