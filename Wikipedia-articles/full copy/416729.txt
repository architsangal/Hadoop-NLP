Reynolds attended Capitol Hill High School and the Oklahoma Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (A &amp; M), where he was a multi-sport athleted. Henry Iba, baseball coach of the Oklahoma A &amp; M baseball team, discovered Reynolds while he was practicing his javelin throw s. After excelling at baseball and American football at Oklahoma A &amp; M, Reynolds chose to turn professional in baseball. In his MLB career, Reynolds had a 182–107 win–loss record, 3.30 earned run average, and 1,423 strikeout s. Reynolds was a six-time MLB All-Star (1945, 1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954) and six-time World Series champion (1947, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953). He won the Hickok Belt in 1951 as the top American professional athlete of the year. He has also received consideration for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, though he has not been elected. [ Early life ] Reynolds was born on a reservation in Bethany, Oklahoma. His father was a preacher in the Church of the Nazarene. { Gittleman, p. 20 } His mother was a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. As a young child, he didn&apos;t play baseball, as his father did not approve of playing sports on Sundays. Reynolds threatened to run away from home if his father wouldn&apos;t let him play football; his father relented. Reynolds attended Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City, where he starred in American football as a quarterback and running back, and at track and field, where he excelled at the javelin throw and 100 yard dash. { Gittleman, p. 21 } He played fast-pitch softball for his father&apos;s church team, which did not play on Sundays. There, he also began dating Dale Earleane Jones, who was named Capitol Hill High School&apos;s most outstanding female athlete. she had previously dated Reynolds&apos; younger brother. The couple married on July 7, 1935. Oklahoma Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (A &amp; M) provided Reynolds a scholarship to attend and participate in track. Reynolds also played on the football team. He majored in education and graduated with a lifetime certification to teach public school in Oklahoma. Henry Iba, coach of the Oklahoma A &amp; M baseball team, first noticed Reynolds when he was practicing his javelin throws. { Gittleman, p. 19 } Iba asked Reynolds to throw batting practice while his pitchers recovered from sore arms.

He was assigned to the Springfield Indians of the Class-C Middle Atlantic League. In 1940, he pitched for the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Class-B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. Reynolds played right field for the Raiders when he wasn&apos;t pitching, as roster sizes were reduced to seventeen as a result of the Great Depression. { Gittleman, p. 25 } The Indians wanted to convert Reynolds to catcher due to his athleticism, but Reynolds refused to change positions. Reynolds started the 1941 season with the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Class-A Eastern League, but was demoted to Cedar Rapids after three appearances. { Gittleman, p. 26 } Becoming increasingly homesick and not wanting to spend his entire professional career in the minor leagues, Reynolds considered retiring after the 1942 season if he wasn&apos;t promoted to Major League Baseball (MLB). { Gittleman, p. 27 } In 1942, Reynolds went 18–7 with a 1.56 earned run average (ERA), eleven shutout s, twenty-one complete game s, and 193 strikeout s in 231 innings pitched, earning a promotion to MLB to finish the 1942 season.

He played many important roles for those teams. In his first six years with the Yankees he averaged over 232 innings, 17.5 wins, and 14 complete games.

His remarkable 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him at least half of the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery.

His first no-hitter, on July 12, 1951, was a 1–0 defeat of his former team, the Indians. Gene Woodling &apos;s solo home run was the only run scored during the game.
