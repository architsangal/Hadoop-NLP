It is often considered the application that turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool. VisiCalc sold over 700,000 copies in six years. { Secrets of Software Success: Management Insights from 100 Software Firms Around the World, ISBN 1-57851-105-4 (1999) } [ Origins ] Conceived by Dan Bricklin, refined by Bob Frankston, developed by their company Software Arts, [ Hormby Thomas VisiCalc and the rise of the Apple II Low End Mac 2006-09-22 http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/0922.html 2007-03-02 ] and distributed by Personal Software in 1979 (later named VisiCorp ) for the Apple II computer, it propelled the Apple from being a hobbyist&apos;s toy to a useful tool for business.

When the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite a number of sequential entries in the table. Bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an &quot; electronic spreadsheet &quot; to view results of underlying formulae. [ Coventry Joshua Interview with Dan Bricklin, Inventor of the Electronic Spreadsheet Low End Mac 2006-11-02 http://lowendmac.com/coventry/06/1107.html 2007-03-02 ] The development of Visicalc took two months of work by Frankston and Bricklin during the winter of 1978–79. Their original intention was for it to fit in 16k, but this proved impossible and 32k became necessary (some additional features they wanted like a split text/graphics screen still had to be omitted for space reasons). However, Apple eventually began shipping all Apple IIs with 48k following a drop in RAM prices and this was no longer an issue. The initial release supported cassette storage, but it was quickly dropped. Following Visicalc&apos;s release, Bricklin and Frankston developed ports for the Atari 800 and Commodore PET, both of which could be done easily due to sharing 6502 CPUs with the Apple II and being able to recycle large portions of code. The PET version was widely criticized for having a very small amount of worksheet space due to the developers&apos; insistence on including their own custom DOS (which ate a large amount of memory in the computer). Other versions followed for the HP 150 and TRS-80 Model I and II. Finally, Visicalc was ported to the IBM PC and became one of the initial pieces of software available for it on its 1981 launch. [ Successors ] Charles Babcock of InformationWeek wrote that, in retrospect, &quot; VisiCalc was flawed and clunky, and couldn&apos;t do many things users wanted it to do. &quot; { What&apos;s The Greatest Software Ever Written? - Technology News by TechWeb } A host of other spreadsheet programs appeared with more sophisticated features, including the CP/M-based Supercalc (1980), Lotus 123 (1983), Microsoft Multiplan (1983), Appleworks (1984), and Microsoft Excel (1985). The original Visicalc quickly became obsolete and was discontinued by 1983 while Lotus 123 became the dominant spreadsheet program on PC compatibles before the Windows era. [ Reception ] Antic reviewer Joseph Kattan wrote, &quot; VisiCalc isn&apos;t as easy to use as prepackaged home accounting programs, because you&apos;re required to design both the layout and the formulas used by the program. Because it is not pre-packaged, however, it&apos;s infinitely more powerful and flexible than such programs. You can use VisiCalc to balance your checkbook, keep track of credit card purchases, calculate your net worth, do your taxes—the possibilities are practically limitless. &quot; [ Joseph Kattan Product Reviews: VisiCalc http://www.atarimagazines.com/v3n2/productreviews.html Antic 3 2 80 1984 June April 15, 2011 ] [ See also ] Triumph of the Nerds, A documentary hosted by Robert X.
