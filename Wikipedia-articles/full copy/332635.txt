It is an interchange between National Rail trains between central London and Dartford (north Kent ), and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) between Lewisham to the south and the Docklands area and the City of London north of the River Thames. It is in Travelcard Zones 2 and 3. Tickets including either zone are valid. While Greenwich is the nearest National Rail station to the centre of Greenwich, Cutty Sark DLR station is more conveniently situated for the town centre and its tourist attractions. East of the station, the Dartford line goes through a tunnel underneath the grounds of the National Maritime Museum, towards Maze Hill. Northwards, the DLR goes into a tunnel through Cutty Sark station and under the River Thames to emerge on the Isle of Dogs; in the opposite direction, it rises on a concrete viaduct to follow the River Ravensbourne upstream to Deptford Bridge and Lewisham. Greenwich Station is 5½ miles from Charing Cross - the milepost is on platform 1. [ Services ] The typical off-peak service from the station is: 6tph (trains per hour) to London Cannon Street 2tph to Slade Green, returning to London Cannon Street via Sidcup 2tph to Slade Green 2tph to Dartford 12tph to Bank Station via Canary Wharf (DLR) 12tph to Lewisham Station (DLR) [ yes ] [ DLR ] [ DLR DLR Cutty Sark Deptford Bridge Three Lewisham ] [ Deptford Maze Hill Southeastern Greenwich line B0C4DE ] Peak hour morning services operate to London Charing Cross, while peak hour evening services operate from London Charing Cross. [ History ] Although the DLR is a recent addition, the National Rail line through Greenwich station is one of London&apos;s oldest - the London and Greenwich Railway is reputed to be the world&apos;s first suburban railway. It was designed by former army engineer George Landmann, and promoted by entrepreneur George Walter. Greenwich was linked by a massive brick-built railway viaduct with 878 arches, first to a station in Spa Road (Bermondsey), and later to London Bridge. The service opened on 8 February 1836 from Deptford, and on 29 December that year from Greenwich. Greenwich&apos;s handsome station building was designed by George Smith in 1840, making it one of the oldest station buildings in the world. Difficulties in extending the railway over the lands owned by the Greenwich Hospital (London) led to the station being bypassed for many years. Eventually the line was extended eastwards via a cut-and-cover tunnel towards Maze Hill. The link between Maze Hill and Greenwich opened on 1 February 1878. { http://rail.felgall.com/ser.htm SER Lines and Stations } { http://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/february.htm#1 Greenwich Guide } The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) was extended to Lewisham via Greewnwich in December 1999, the new platforms lying immediately to the south of the mainline station. At the eastern end, the DLR heads underground through the tunnel which serves nearby Cutty Sark station and then carries the route beneath the River Thames to the north.
