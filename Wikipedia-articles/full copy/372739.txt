[ Helen Hunt ] Helen Hunt Jackson, c. 1850s-1860s Helen Maria Hunt Jackson, born Helen Fiske (October 18, 1830 – August 12, 1885 ), was a United States writer who became an activist on behalf of improved treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government. She detailed the adverse effects of government actions in her history A Century of Dishonor (1881). Her novel Ramona dramatized the federal government&apos;s mistreatment of Native Americans in Southern California and attracted considerable attention to her cause, { H.H.Jackson (1884) Ramona (NY: Harper) } { DeLyser, Dydia (2005), Ramona Memories: Tourism and the Shaping of Southern California, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press) } although its popularity was based on its romantic and picturesque qualities rather than its political content. It was estimated to have been reprinted 300 times, and contributed to the growth of tourism in Southern California. The novel was adapted repeatedly for movies: in 1910 it was produced as a silent film Ramona, directed by D. W. Griffith and starring Mary Pickford. Other versions were made in 1928 and 1936. [ Early years ] She was born Helen Fiske in Amherst, Massachusetts, the daughter of Nathan Welby Fiske and Deborah Waterman Vinal. She had two brothers, both of whom died after birth, and a sister Anne. Her father was a minister, author, and professor of Latin, Greek, and philosophy at Amherst College. Her mother died in 1844 when Helen was fourteen, and her father three years later. Her father provided for her education and arranged for an aunt to care for her. Fiske attended Ipswich Female Seminary and the Abbott Institute, a boarding school run by Reverend J.S.C. Abbott in New York City. She was a classmate of the poet Emily Dickinson, also from Amherst. The two corresponded for the rest of their lives, but few of their letters have survived. [ Marriage and family ] In 1852 at age 22, Fiske married U.S. Army Captain Edward Bissell Hunt. They had two sons, one of whom, Murray Hunt, died as an infant in 1854 of a brain disease. In 1863, her husband died in a military accident. Her second son, Rennie Hunt, died of diphtheria in 1865. About 1873-1874, Hunt met William Sharpless Jackson, a wealthy banker and railroad executive, while visiting at Colorado Springs, Colorado, at the resort of Seven Falls. They married in 1875 and she took the name Jackson, under which she was best known for her writings. { Phillips, Kate (2003). Helen Hunt Jackson: A Literary Life, pp. 168-71, University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-21804-3 } She was a Unitarian. { New York Times: &quot; Add to Sunday&apos;s &apos;Hell List&apos;, &quot; May 7, 1917, accessed February 14, 2011 } [ Career ] Helen Hunt began writing after the deaths of her family members. She published her early work anonymously, usually under the name &quot; H.H. &quot; { New York Times: &quot; Books and Authors, &quot; October 18, 1931, accessed February 14, 2011 } Emerson admired her poetry and used several of her poems in his public readings. He included five of them in his anthology Parnassus. { New York Times: Renée Tursi, review of Kate Phillips, &apos;&apos;Helen Hunt Jackson: A Literary Life&apos;&apos;, September 21, 2003, accessed March 14, 2011 } She traveled widely. In the winter of 1873-1874 she was in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in search of a cure for tuberculosis. Here she met the man who would become her second husband. Over the next two years, she published three novels in the anonymous No Name Series, including Mercy Philbrick&apos;s Choice and Hetty&apos;s Strange History. { Carol E. Schmudde, &quot; Sincerity, Secrecy, and Lies: Helen Hunt Jackson&apos;s No Name Novels, &quot; in Studies in American Fiction, Spring 1993 } In 1879 her interests turned to Native Americans after hearing a lecture in Boston by the Ponca Chief Standing Bear. He described the forcible removal of the Ponca from their Nebraska reservation and transfer to the Quapaw Reservation in Indian Territory, where they suffered from disease, climate and poor supplies. Upset about the mistreatment of Native Americans by government agents, Jackson became an activist. She started investigating and publicizing government misconduct, circulating petitions, raising money, and writing letters to the New York Times on behalf of the Ponca. A fiery and prolific writer, Jackson engaged in heated exchanges with federal officials over the injustices committed against American Indians. Among her special targets was U.S. Secretary of Interior Carl Schurz, whom she once called &quot; the most adroit liar I ever knew. &quot; { J. Diane Pearson, The Nez Perces in the Indian Territory: Nimiipuu Survival (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008), 128 } She exposed the government&apos;s violation of treaties with the American Indian tribes. She documented the corruption of US Indian agent s, military officers, and settlers who encroached on and stole Indian lands. Jackson won the support of several newspaper editors who published her reports. Among her correspondents were editor William Hayes Ward of the New York Independent, Richard Watson Guilder of the Century Magazine, and publisher Whitelaw Reid of the New York Daily Tribune. { Mathes, xiv } Jackson also wrote a book, the first published under her own name, condemning state and federal Indian policy, and detailing the history of broken treaties. A Century of Dishonor (1881) called for significant reform in government policy toward Native Americans. { H.H. Jackson, Century of Dishonor,(NY: Harper, 1882). An edition edited by Andrew Rolle was published by Harper &amp; Row in 1965. } Jackson sent a copy to every member of Congress with a quote from Benjamin Franklin printed in red on the cover: &quot; Look upon your hands: they are stained with the blood of your relations. &quot; { Gudrun Grabher, Roland Hagenbüchle, Cristanne Miller, eds., The Emily Dickinson Handbook (University of Massachusetts Press, 1998), 328 } The New York Times later wrote that she &quot; soon made enemies at Washington by her often unmeasured attacks, and while on general lines she did some good, her case was weakened by her inability, in some cases, to substantiate the charges she had made; hence many who were at first sympathetic fell away. &quot; { New York Times: &quot; Obituary: Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson, &quot; August 13, 1885, accessed March 13, 2011 } Helen Hunt Jackson, before 1885 Jackson went to southern California for respite. Having been interested in the area&apos;s missions and the Mission Indians on an earlier visit, she began an in-depth study. While in Los Angeles, she met Don Antonio Coronel, former mayor of the city and a well-known authority on early Californio life in the area. He had served as inspector of missions for the Mexican government. Coronel told her about the plight of the Mission Indians after 1833. They were buffeted by the secularization policies of the Mexican government, as well as later U.S. policies, both of which led to their removal from mission lands. Under its original land grants, the Mexican government provided for resident Indians to continue to occupy such lands. After taking control of the territory in 1848, the U.S. generally disregarded such Mission Indian occupancy claims. In 1852, there were an estimated 15,000 Mission Indians in Southern California. By the time of Jackson&apos;s visit, they numbered fewer than 4,000. [ May 2010 ] Coronel&apos;s account inspired Jackson to action. The U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Hiram Price, recommended her appointment as an Interior Department agent. Jackson&apos;s assignment was to visit the Mission Indians, ascertain the location and condition of various bands, and determine what lands, if any, should be purchased for their use. With the help of the US Indian agent Abbot Kinney, Jackson traveled throughout Southern California and documented conditions. At one point, she hired a law firm to protect the rights of a family of Saboba Indians facing dispossession from their land at the foot of the San Jacinto Mountains. In 1883, Jackson completed her 56-page report. { Jackson (1883) &quot; Report on the Conditions and Needs of the Mission Indians, &quot; appears as an appendix to Century of Dishonor, 2nd ed. (Boston 1885) } It recommended extensive government relief for the Mission Indians, including the purchase of new lands for reservations and the establishment of more Indian schools. A bill embodying her recommendations passed the U.S. Senate but died in the House of Representatives. Jackson decided to write a novel to reach a wider audience. When she wrote Coronel asking for details about early California and any romantic incidents he could remember, she explained her purpose: &quot; I am going to write a novel, in which will be set forth some Indian experiences in a way to move people&apos;s hearts. People will read a novel when they will not read serious books. &quot; { Mathes, Indian Reform Letters, 298-9 } She was inspired by her friend Harriet Beecher Stowe &apos;s Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin (1852). &quot; If I could write a story that would do for the Indian one-hundredth part what Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin did for the Negro, I would be thankful the rest of my life, &quot; she wrote. { Mathes, Indian Reform Letters, 258 } Although Jackson started an outline in California, she began writing the novel in December 1883 in her New York hotel room, and completed it in about three months. Originally titled In The Name of the Law, she published it as Ramona (1884). It featured Ramona, an orphan girl who was half Indian and half Scots, raised in Spanish Californio society, and her Indian husband Alessandro, and their struggles for land of their own. The characters were based on people known by Jackson and incidents which she had encountered. The book achieved rapid success among a wide public and was popular for generations; it was estimated to have been reprinted 300 times. Its romantic story also contributed to the growth of tourism to Southern California. One year after her death the North American Review called Ramona &quot; unquestionably the best novel yet produced by an American woman &quot; and named it, along with Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin, one of two most ethical novels of the 19th century.

There have been over 300 reissues to date and the book has never been out of print.

Her last letter was written to President Grover Cleveland and said: &quot; From my death bed I send you message of heartfelt thanks for what you have already done for the Indians. I ask you to read my Century of Dishonor. I am dying happier for the belief I have that it is your hand that is destined to strike the first steady blow toward lifting this burden of infamy from our country and righting the wrongs of the Indian race. &quot; { New York Times: &quot; &apos;H.H.&apos; to the President, &quot; September 29, 1885, accessed February 14, 2011 } Jackson wrote, &quot; My Century of Dishonor and Ramona are the only things I have done of which I am glad....They will live, and...bear fruit. &quot; Jackson died of stomach cancer in 1885 in San Francisco, California. Her husband arranged for her burial on a one-acre plot on a high plateau overlooking Colorado Springs, Colorado. { New York Times: &quot; Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson&apos;s Grave, &quot; April 18, 1886, accessed February 14, 2011 } Her grave was later moved to Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs. { Find-a-grave } Her estate was valued at $12,642, { New York Times: &quot; Literary Notes, &quot; February 7, 1887, accessed February 14, 2011 } She used her married names, Helen Hunt and Helen Jackson, but scholars now refer to her as Helen Hunt Jackson. The New York Times referred to her as Helen Hunt Jackson in 1885, reporting on her final illness, and in 1886, reporting on visitors to her grave. Valery Sherer Mathes assessed the writer and her work: { Mathes, 159, 161 } Ramona may not have been another Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin, but it served, along with Jackson&apos;s writings on the Mission Indians of California, as a catalyst for other reformers....Helen Hunt Jackson cared deeply for the Indians of California. She cared enough to undermine her health while devoting the last few years of her life to bettering their lives. Her enduring writings, therefore, provided a legacy to other reformers, who cherished her work enough to carry on her struggle and at least try to improve the lives of America&apos;s first inhabitants. Her friend Emily Dickinson once described her limitations: &quot; she has the facts but not the phosphorescence. &quot; { Fannie Safier, Wanda Schindley, John Kuehn, Margaret Ferry, eds., Adventures in Appreciation (Harcourt, 1989), 257 } Her novel was adapted as a film by the same name, released in 1910. It was directed by D. W. Griffith and starred Mary Pickford. In a review of the film, a journalist wrote about the novel, calling it &quot; the long and lugubrious romance by Helen Hunt Jackson, over which America wept unnumbered gallons in the eighties and nineties, &quot; and complained of &quot; the long, uneventful stretches of the novel. &quot; { New York Times: &quot; &apos;Ramona&apos; Shown upon the Screen, &quot; April 6, 1916, accessed February 14, 2011 } In reviewing the history of her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, a 1970 reviewer noted that Jackson typified the house&apos;s success: &quot; Middle aged, middle class, middlebrow. &quot; { New York Times: David Dempsey, &quot; The Building of the House, &quot; March 1, 1970, accessed February 14, 2011 } The novel was adapted for films by the same name in 1928 and 1936 as well, and starred leading actresses. [ Legacy ] Jackson&apos;s A Century of Dishonor remains in print, as does a collection of her poetry. A New York Times reviewer said of Ramona that &quot; by one estimate, the book has been reprinted 300 times. &quot; { &apos;&apos;New York Times&apos;: Richard B. Woodward, review of &apos;&apos;Ramona Diaries&apos;&apos; by Didia DeLyser, July 24, 2005, accessed February 14, 2011 } The novel has been adapted for other media, including three films, stage, and television productions. A portion of Jackson&apos;s Colorado home has been reconstructed in the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum and furnished with her possessions. { City of Colorado Springs: &quot; About the Museum &quot;, accessed February 14, 2011 } [ Memorials ] The Helen Hunt Jackson Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library is a Mission/Spanish Revival style-building built in 1925. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
