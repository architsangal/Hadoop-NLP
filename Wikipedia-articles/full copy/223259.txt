It is the home of both Associazione Calcio Milan and Football Club Internazionale Milano. On 3 March 1980, { &apos;&apos;The history of the San Siro stadium.&apos;&apos; AC Milan.com. (accessed 2011-10-18) } the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner ( 1934, 1938 ) who played for Internazionale, and briefly for Milan, in the 1930s and 1940s. It held UEFA five-star stadium status which was superseded by a new system of classification. [ History ] Construction of the stadium commenced in 1925 in the district of Milan named San Siro, with the new stadium originally named &quot; Nuovo Stadio Calcistico San Siro &quot; (San Siro New Football Stadium). { &apos;&apos; &quot; Almanacco Illustrato del Milan &quot;, Panini, Modena (it.) } The idea to build a stadium in the same district as the horse racing track, belongs to the man who then was the president of AC Milan, Piero Pirelli. The architects designed a private stadium only for football, without the athletics tracks which characterized the Italian stadia built with public funds. { The architectural structure of San Siro was shared in Italy with } { Marassi that, as private home ground of } { Genoa CFC, hadn&apos;t athletics track. } The inauguration was on September 19, 1926, when 35,000 spectators saw Internazionale defeat Milan 6–3. Originally, the ground was home and property of AC Milan. In 1947 Internazionale became tenants and the two have shared the ground ever since. As well as being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team also plays occasional games there and it has also been used for the 1965, 1970, and 2001 UEFA Champions League finals. The stadium was also used for Internazionale&apos;s UEFA Cup finals when played over home and away legs but has never featured since the competition changed to a single final structure in 1997–98. The stadium underwent further renovations for the 1990 World Cup with $60 million being spent, bringing the stadium up to UEFA category four standard. As part of the renovations, the stadium became all seated, with an extra tier being added to three sides of the stadium. This entailed the building of 11 concrete towers around the outside of the stadium. Four of these concrete towers were being located at the corners to support a new roof which has distinctive protruding red girders. Inter is in the process of new stadium feasibility studies. The first Rugby Union international at the San Siro took place when Italy played New Zealand national rugby union team in the 2009 end of year rugby tests. [ Renovations ] [ http://www.sansiro.net/struttura.asp Struttura SanSiro.net 2010-02-25 ] [ April 2012 H3llBot ] Changes in capacity Year Total capacity 1926 26,000 1939 55,000 1955 100,000 1956 90,000 1988 72,000 1990 88,500 2002 85,700 2003 82,955 2008 81,277 1939 End stands enlarged and corners filled in. A crowd of 55,000 for Italy – England 2–2. 1940 65,000 for Italy vs. Germany. 1955 Completion of two tiers giving a claimed capacity of 100,000. 1956 April 25, in front of 100,000 spectators, Italy – Brazil 3–0 (Goals: Virgili 2, De Sordi). After the Heysel Stadium disaster, the capacity was reduced to 80,000 in the mid 1980s. 1987 As a preparation for the 1990 World Cup, the Italian government gave the Milanese council $30 million for its modernization, but in the end, the cost was more than double that. Project 1990 by Ragazzi e Hoffner e Salvi: 11 concrete towers of 50 meters in height. Of the 11 towers, 4 at each corner, protruded above the 3rd tier as support for the new roof. 1990 Third tier completed on three sides giving an all seated capacity of 85,700. 2002 Sky Box: 20 for 200 seats. 400 all-seats for journalists. Future renovation may involve the completion of the 3rd tier on the east side of the stadium, although this would involve purchasing land from the present hippodrome, behind the stadium.
