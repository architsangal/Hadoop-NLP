Mencken and George Jean Nathan; later Joseph Shaw 1920 United States ] Black Mask was a pulp magazine launched in 1920 by journalist H. L. Mencken and drama critic George Jean Nathan as one of a number of money-making publishing ventures to support the prestigious literary magazine The Smart Set, which Mencken edited, and which operated at a loss. Under their editorial hand, the magazine was not exclusively a publisher of crime fiction, offering, according to the magazine, &quot; the best stories available of adventure, the best mystery and detective stories, the best romances, the best love stories, and the best stories of the occult. &quot; The magazine&apos;s first editor was Florence Osborne(credited as F. M. Osborne) { Bleiler, Richard, &quot; Black Mask &quot;, in Rosemary Herbert,The Oxford companion to crime and mystery writing. Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1999.ISBN 0-19-507239-1 (pp. 38-9). } [ Editorial control ] After eight issues, Mencken and Nathan considered their initial $500 investment to have been sufficiently profitable, and they sold the magazine to its publishers, Eltinge Warner and Eugene Crow for $12,500. The magazine was then edited by George W. Sutton (1922–24), followed by Philip C. Cody. { Hagemann,Edward R. A Comprehensive Index to Black Mask, 1920-1951. Popular Press, 1982. ISBN 0-87972-202-9. } In 1926, Joseph Shaw took over the editorship. [ Contributing authors ] Early Black Mask contributors of note included J. S. Fletcher, Vincent Starrett, and Herman Petersen. { DeAndrea, William L. (editor).Encyclopedia Mysteriosa, MacMillan, 1994, ISBN 0-02-861678-2 (p.287-9). } Shaw, following up on a promising lead from one of the early issues, promptly turned the magazine into an outlet for the growing school of naturalistic crime writers led by Carroll John Daly. Daly&apos;s private detective Race Williams was a rough and ready character with a sharp tongue, and established the model for many later acerbic private eyes. Black Mask later published the profoundly influential Dashiell Hammett, creator of Sam Spade and The Continental Op, and other hardboiled writers who came in his wake, such as Raymond Chandler, Erle Stanley Gardner, Paul Cain, Frederick Nebel, Frederick C. Davis, Raoul F. Whitfield, Theodore Tinsley,W.T. Ballard, Dwight V. Babcock, and Roger Torrey. { Smith, Erin Ann. Hard-boiled:working-class readers and pulp magazines, Temple University Press, 2000. ISBN 1-56639-769-3 (p.95). } Author George Harmon Coxe created &quot; Casey, Crime Photographer &quot;, for the magazine, which became a media franchise with novels, films, radio, comic book tie-ins, television, and legitimate theatre.

Schlaikjer, { Robinson, Frank M., and Davidson, Lawrence.Pulp Culture - The Art of Fiction Magazines. Collectors Press, 2007. ISBN 1-933112-30-1 (p. 59) } while Shaw gave the artist Arthur Rodman Bowker a monopoly over all Black Mask interior illustrations. { Layman,Richard. Discovering the Maltese falcon and Sam Spade. Vince Emery Productions, 2005, ISBN 0-9725898-6-4,(p. 78) } Although primarily known for male contributors, Black Mask also published a number ofwomen crime writers, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Katherine Brocklebank, Sally Dixon Wright,Florence M. Pettee, Marion O&apos;Hearn, Kay Krausse, Frances Beck, Tiah Devitt and Dorothy Dunn. { Pronzini,Bill, &quot; Women in the Pulps &quot;, in Deadly Women: the woman mystery reader&apos;s indispensable companionedited by Jan Grape, Darryl Dean James, Ellen Nehr.

Cave, who appeared in its pages went onto greater commercial and critical success. Although crime fiction made up most of the magazine&apos;s content, Black Mask also published some Western and general adventure fiction. [ Decline and revival ] Black Mask reached a sales peak in the early 1930s, but then interest began to wane under increasing pressure from radio, the cinema,and rival pulp magazines. In 1936, refusing to cut writers&apos; already meager pay, Shaw resigned, and many of the high-profile authors abandoned the magazine with him. Shaw&apos;s successor Fanny Ellsworth, (1936–40) managed to attract new writersto Black Mask, including Cornell Woolrich, Frank Gruber, Max Brand and Steve Fisher. { Nolan, William F., The Black mask boys: masters in the hard-boiled school of detective fiction.William Morrow, 1985,(p.30). } However, from the 1940s on, Black Mask was in decline,despite the efforts of neweditor Kenneth S. White (1940–48). The magazine in this period carried the work of John D. MacDonald. Henry Steeger then editedBlack Mask anonymously until it eventually ceased publication in 1951. In 1985, the magazine was revived as The New Black Mask, and featured noted crime writers James Ellroy, Michael Collins, Sara Paretsky and Bill Pronzini, as well as Chandler and Hammett reprints. Edward D. Hoch praised the revived Black Mask, stating in the book Encyclopedia Mysteriosa that &quot; it came close to reviving the excitement and storytelling pleasure of the great old pulp magazines &quot;. Due to a legal dispute over the rights to Black Mask name, the magazine ceased publication in 1987. It was revived as a short-lived magazine titled A Matter of Crime. { Encyclopedia Mysteriosa, (p.256). } Original copies of the Black Mask are highly valued among pulp magazine collectors. Issues with Chandler and Hammett stories areespecially rare and command high prices. [ In popular culture ] Black Mask magazine was the specific pulp fiction magazine that inspired the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction. Originally, the title of the film was Black Mask, before being changed. An issue of Black Mask magazine features as a (planted) clue in the 1927 murder mystery novel Unnatural Death by Dorothy L. Sayers. An episode of the 1990&apos;s television series Millennium mentions a &apos;literary journal&apos; known as the &apos;Dark Mask&apos; which featured detective fiction, an obvious parody of the Black Mask.
