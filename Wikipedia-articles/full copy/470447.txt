The exact sign used varies in different languages. [ Usage ] [ English ] -st is used with numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 1st, pronounced first) -nd is used with numbers ending in 2 (e.g. 92nd, pronounced ninety second) -rd is used with numbers ending in 3 (e.g. 33rd, pronounced thirty third) As an exception to the above rules, all the &quot; teen &quot; numbers ending with 11, 12 or 13 use -th (e.g. 11th, pronounced eleventh, 112th, pronounced one hundred [and] twelfth) -th is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced ninth). In the 19th century, under French influence, these indicators were often written as superscript s (e.g. 2 nd, 34 th ), especially in British English. During most of the 20th century, formatting them on the baseline was favored. For example, the 16th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style states: &quot; The letters in ordinal numbers should not appear as superscripts (e.g., 122nd not 122 nd ). &quot; The usual explanation for this rule is that superscript suffixes in small type are hard to read and spoil the appearance of the page. [ September 2011 ] Since the 1990s, the superscript style become more prevalent [ May 2012 ] because some word processor s (e.g. Microsoft Word { http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/automatic-formatting-results-HP005262013.aspx } ) format ordinal indicators as superscripts by default. [ French ] The suffixes -er (e.g. [ fr 1 er – premier ] ), -re (e.g. [ fr 1 re – première ] ), and -e (e.g. [ fr 2 e – deuxième ] ). These indicators use superscript formatting whenever it is available. Alternatively, the suffix -ème is a common mistake in place of -e (e.g. [ fr 2 ème – deuxième ] ). The suffix º is used for terms like [ fr primo ], [ fr secundo ], and [ fr tertio ] as [ fr 1º ], [ fr 2º ], and [ fr 3º ]. [ Dutch ] Unlike other Germanic languages, Dutch is similar to English in this respect: the French layout with -e used to be popular, but the recent spelling changes now prescribe the suffix -e. Optionally -ste and -de may be used, but this is more complex and nowadays less used: [ January 2009 ] 1ste  (eerste), 2de  (tweede), 4de  (vierde), 20ste  (twintigste), etc. [ &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Croatian language &quot; &gt; Croatian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Croatian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Czech language &quot; &gt; Czech language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Czech &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Danish language &quot; &gt; Danish language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Danish &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Estonian language &quot; &gt; Estonian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Estonian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Faroese language &quot; &gt; Faroese language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Faroese &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; German language &quot; &gt; German language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; German &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Hungarian language &quot; &gt; Hungarian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Hungarian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Icelandic language &quot; &gt; Icelandic language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Icelandic &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Latvian language &quot; &gt; Latvian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Latvian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Norwegian language &quot; &gt; Norwegian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Norwegian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Polish language &quot; &gt; Polish language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Polish &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Slovak language &quot; &gt; Slovak language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Slovak &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Slovene language &quot; &gt; Slovene language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Slovene &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Serbian language &quot; &gt; Serbian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Serbian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Turkish language &quot; &gt; Turkish language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Turkish &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] A period or full stop is written after the numeral. The same usage, apparently borrowed from German, { Reindl, Donald F. 2009. &quot; Kranjska je naša spraha: Historical German-Slovenian Language Contact. &quot; In: Stolz, Christel (ed.), Unsere sprachlichen Nachbarn in Europa: Die Kontaktbeziehungen zwischen Deutsch und seinen Grenznachbarn, pp. 103–114. Bochum: Universitätsverlag Dr. N. Brockmeyer, p. 110. } is now a standard in Polish, where it replaced the superscript of the last phoneme (following complex declension and gender patterns, e.g., [ pl 1-szy ], [ pl 7-ma ], [ pl 24-te ], [ pl 100-ny ]; use of such contractions is considered an error; probably it&apos;s a calque from Russian, see below). [ &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Galician_language &quot; &gt; Galician_language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Galician &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Italian language &quot; &gt; Italian language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Italian &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Portuguese language &quot; &gt; Portuguese language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Portuguese &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, and &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Spanish language &quot; &gt; Spanish language &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Spanish &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] The suffixes -o and -a are appended to the numeral depending on whether the number&apos;s grammatical gender is masculine or feminine respectively. As with French, these signs are preferably superscripted, but in contrast, they are often underline d as well. Some character set s provide characters specifically for use as ordinal indicators in these languages: º and ª (in Unicode U+00BA and U+00AA { Unicode Latin-1 Punctuation code chart } ). The masculine ordinal indicator U+00BA (º) is often confused with the degree sign U+00B0 (°), which looks very similar in many fonts and is available on Italian and Spanish keyboard layout. The degree sign is a uniform circle and is never underlined, while the letter o may be oval or elliptical and have a varying stroke width. The letter o may also be underlined. In Spanish, using the two final letters of the word as it is spelled is not allowed, { &quot; Ordinales &quot; - Royal Spanish Academy } except in the cases of [ es primer ] (an apocope of [ es primero ] ) before singular masculine nouns, which is not abbreviated as [ es 1. o ] but as [ es 1. er ]. And the same happens with [ es tercer ] (an apocope of [ es tercero ] ) before singular masculine nouns, which is not abbreviated as [ es 3. o ] but as [ es 3. er ]. With compound ordinals ending in &quot; primer &quot; or &quot; tercer &quot;, the same applies. For instance, &quot; twenty-first &quot; is [ es vigésimo primer ] before a masculine noun, and its abbreviation is [ es 21. er ]. Since none of these words should be shortened before feminine nouns, their correct forms for those cases are [ es primera ] and [ es tercera ]. These can be represented as [ es 1. a ] and [ es 3. a ]. [ Irish ] Numerals from 3 up form their ordinals uniformly by adding the suffix -ú: 3ú, 4ú, 5ú, etc. When the ordinal is written out, the suffix adheres to the spelling restrictions imposed by the broad/slender difference in consonants and is written -iú after slender consonants; but when written as numbers, only the suffix itself (-ú) is written. In the case of 4 (ceathair), the final syllable is syncopated before the suffix, and in the case of 9 (naoi), 20 (fiche), and 1000 (míle), the final vowel is assimilated into the suffix. Most multiples of ten end in a vowel in their cardinal form and form their ordinal form by adding the suffix to their genitive singular form, which ends in -d; this is not reflected in writing. Exceptions are 20 (fiche) and 40 (daichead), both of whom form their ordinals by adding the suffix directly to the cardinal (fichiú and daicheadú). The numbers 1 (aon) and 2 (dó) both have two separate ordinals: one regularly formed by adding -ú (aonú, dóú), and one suppletive form (céad, dara). The regular forms are restricted in their usage to actual numeric contexts, when counting. The latter are also used in counting, especially céad, but are used in broader, more abstract senses of &apos;first&apos; and &apos;second&apos; (or &apos;other&apos;). In their broader senses, céad and dara are not written as 1ú and 2ú, though 1ú and 2ú may in a numeric context be read aloud as céad and dara (e.g., an 21ú lá may be read as an t-aonú lá is fiche or as an chéad lá is fiche). Cardinal Ordinal 1 a haon aonú (1ú) or céad 2 a dó dóú (2ú) or dara 3 a trí tríú (3ú) 4 a ceathair ceathrú (4ú) 5 a cúig cúigiú (5ú) 6 a sé séú (6ú) 7 a seacht seachtú (7ú) 8 a hocht ochtú (8ú) 9 a naoi naoú (9ú) 10 a deich deichiú (10ú) 20 fiche fichiú (20ú) 30 triocha triochadú (30ú) 40 daichead daicheadú (40ú) 50 caoga caogadú (50ú) 60 seasca seascadú (60ú) 70 seachtó seachtódú (70ú) 80 ochtó ochtódú (80ú) 90 nócha nóchadú (90ú) 100 céad céadú (100ú) 1000 míle míliú (1000ú) [ Catalan ] The rule is to follow the number with the last letter in the singular and the last two letters in the plural. { &apos;&apos;Gramàtica de la llengua catalana&apos;&apos; p. 391 } Most numbers follow the pattern exemplified by [ ca vint ] &quot; 20 &quot; ( [ ca 20è ] m sg, [ ca 20a ] f sg, [ ca 20ns ] m pl, [ ca 20es ] f pl), but the first few ordinals are irregular, affecting the abbreviations of the masculine forms. Superscripting is nonstandard. [ Russian ] Example of ordinal indicator in Russian, 1913 One or two letters of the spelled-out numeral are appended to it (either after a hyphen or, rarely, in superscript). The rule is to take the minimal number of letters that include at least one consonant phoneme. Examples: 2-му второму [ /ftɐromu/ ], 2-я вторая [ /ftɐraja/ ], 2-й второй [ /ftɐroj/ ] (note that in the second example the vowel letter я represents two phonemes, one of which ( [ /j/ ] ) is consonant). [ Finnish ] When the numeral is followed by its head noun (which indicates the grammatical case of the ordinal), it is sufficient to write a period or full stop after the numeral: Päädyin kilpailussa 2. sijalle &apos;In the competition, I finished in 2nd place &apos;. However, if the head noun is omitted, the ordinal indicator takes the form of a morphological suffix, which is attached to the numeral with a colon. In the nominative case, the suffix is ‑nen for 1 and 2, and ‑s for larger numerals: Minä olin 2:nen, ja veljeni oli 3:s &apos;I came 2nd, and my brother came 3rd &apos;. The system becomes rather complicated when the ordinal needs to be inflected, as the ordinal suffix is adjusted according to the case ending: 3:s (nominative case, which has no ending), 3:nnen ( genitive case with ending ‑n), 3:tta ( partitive case with ending ‑ta), 3:nnessa ( inessive case with ending ‑ssa), 3:nteen ( illative case with ending ‑en), etc. Even native speakers sometimes find it difficult to exactly identify the ordinal suffix, as its borders with the word stem and the case ending may appear blurred. In such cases it may be preferable to write the ordinal as a word (i.e., entirely with letters ) instead – and particularly 2:nen is rare even in the nominative case, as it is not significantly shorter than if written as a word (toinen). [ Swedish ] The general rule is that :a (for 1 and 2) or :e (for all other numbers, except 101:a, 42:a, et cetera) is appended to the numeral. When indicating dates, suffixes are never used. Examples: &quot; 1:a klass &quot; (first (i.e. business) class), &quot; 3:e utgåvan &quot; (third edition), but &quot; 6 november &quot;. Furthermore, suffixes can be left out if the number obviously is an ordinal number, example: &quot; 3 utg. &quot; (3rd ed). Using a full stop as an ordinal indicator is considered archaic, but still occurs in military contexts. Example: &quot; 5. komp &quot; (5th company). [ Similar conventions ] Some languages use superior letter s as a typographic convention for abbreviations that aren&apos;t related to ordinal numbers – the letters o and a may be among those used, but they don&apos;t indicate ordinals: [ es Vº Bº ] [ es visto bueno ] [ es Mª ] [ es Maria ] [ es José Mª ] [ pt Ex. mo ] [ pt Excelentíssimo ] [ pt L. da ] [ pt Limitada ] [ pt Sr. a ] [ pt Senhora ] Spanish uses the indicator letters in some abbreviations, such as for ( &quot; approved &quot; ); and for, a Spanish name frequently used in compounds like. In Portuguese, the underlined &quot; º &quot; and &quot; ª &quot; are used with many abbreviations, and should be preceded by a period. In fact, there is no limit for which words may be abbreviated this way. Sometimes, other letters are also written before the &quot; º &quot; or &quot; ª &quot;. For example: for (an honorific ), for ( Ltd. ), for ( Ms. ), etc. English has borrowed the &quot; No. &quot; abbreviation from the Romance languages word numero (according to the OED, the term is from the Latin numero, which is the ablative form of the word numerus ( &quot; number &quot; ). Similar forms exist as the word for &quot; number &quot; is derived in other Romance languages: numero in Italian, numéro in French, and número in Spanish and Portuguese), applying it as an abbreviation for the English word &quot; number &quot;. This is sometimes written as &quot; Nº &quot;, with the superscript o optionally underlined; see numero sign. Use of the ordinal-indicating Unicode characters for these kinds of abbreviations is a matter of preference, but can be misleading; the &quot; º &quot; in &quot; Nº &quot;, for example, is not intended to indicate ordinality at all.
