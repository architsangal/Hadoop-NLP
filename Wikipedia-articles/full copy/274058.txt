An academic discipline, or field of study, is a branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Discipline s are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic department s or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Pierce (1991, p.  22-23) writes: &quot; Although most studies fail to define the term [discipline] explicitly, they typically assume that boundaries of disciplines closely follows those of academic department s. The use of such boundaries may seem to fix overly concrete limits on a highly abstract phenomenon, excluding too large a number of people with interest in the subject. But its importance in creating and maintaining disciplinary communities makes the academic department the building block from which disciplines are created &quot;. { Pierce, S. J. (1991). Subject areas, disciplines and the concept of authority. LISR [Library and Information Science Research], 13, 21-35. } Fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. { Andrew Abbott, Chaos of Disciplines University Of Chicago Press 2001 ISBN 0-226-00101-6 } [ History of the concept ] &quot; The scientific discipline as the primary unit of internal differentiation of science is an invention of nineteenth century society. There exists a long semantic prehistory of disciplina as a term for the ordering of knowledge for the purposes of instruction in schoolsand universities. &quot;. { Stichweh, R. (2001).

Oxford: Elsevier Science (pp. 13727-13731). } Some researchers find that academic disciplines seem to be replaced by what is termed Mode 2 { Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott, &amp; Martin Trow (1994). The new production of knowledge: the dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies. London: Sage. } or &quot; post academic science &quot;. { Ziman, John (2000). Real Science. What it is, and what it means.. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. } [ Functions and criticism ] &quot; The disciplines characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate. &quot; (Foucault, 1975/1979, p 223. { Foucault, Michel (1977). Discipline and punish: The birth of the prison. Trans. Alan Sheridan. New York: Vintage.(Translation of: Surveiller et punir; naissance de la prison. [Paris] : Gallimard, 1975). } ) [ Bibliometric studies of disciplines ] Bibliometrics can be used to map several issues in relation to disciplines, for example the flow of ideas within and among disciplines (Lindholm-Romantschuk, 1998) { Lindholm-Romantschuk, Y. (1998). Scholarly book reviewing in the social sciences and humanities. The flow of ideas within and among disciplines. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. } or the existence of specific national traditions within disciplines. { Ohlsson, H. (1999). Is there a Scandinavian psychology?

A global map of science based on the ISI subject categories. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. The decomposition of scientific literature into disciplinary and subdisciplinary structures is one of the core goals of scientometrics. How can we achieve a good decomposition? The ISI subject categories classify journals included in the Science Citation Index (SCI). The aggregated journal-journal citation matrix contained in the Journal Citation Reports can be aggregated on the basis of these categories. This leads to an asymmetrical matrix (citing versus cited) that is much more densely populated than the underlying matrix at the journal level. Exploratory factor analysis of the matrix of subject categories suggests a 14-factor solution. This solution could be interpreted as the disciplinary structure of science. Lindholm-Romantschuk, Y.
