[ Friso (disambiguation) ] [ 1968 9 25 4a ] [ Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau His Royal Highness Your Royal Highness Sir ] House of Orange-Nassau Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau Countess Luana Countess Zaria Christian ( Dutch Reformed Church ) Claus von Amsberg Beatrix of the Netherlands Royal Sandard of the Princes of the Nethelands (Sons of Queen Beatrix).png Royal Standard of the Princes of the Netherlands Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau (born 25 September 1968) is the second son of Queen Beatrix and the late Prince Claus of the Netherlands. Prince Friso is a member of the Dutch Royal Family, but because of his marriage in 2004 he is no longer a member of the Dutch Royal House nor in line of succession to the Dutch throne. He is still in the line of succession to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms. On 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, while skiing off piste. He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck where he was in critical but stable condition.

It remains unclear whether he will ever regain consciousness and come out of his deeply comatose state, and even if he does, he could still be in a (perhaps permanent) vegetative state.

His godparents are King Harald V of Norway, Johan Christian Baron von Jenisch, J.H. van Roijen, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Christina von Amsberg. He has one elder brother, Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange and one younger brother, Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. In 1988, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. From 1988 to 1994 he studied at Delft University of Technology, where he obtained an engineer&apos;s degree in aeronautical engineering. Additionally, he has an MSc degree in economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam. To prepare himself for the possibility of succession to the throne, he took courses in Dutch law and parliamentary history. Prince Friso worked from 1995 until 1996 at the Amsterdam branch of the international management consultancy McKinsey. After completing an MBA -programme at INSEAD, Prince Friso worked as vice president from 1998 till 2003 for Goldman Sachs International in London. Since 2004 he is part-time co-president of TNO Space in Delft. As of October 2006, Prince Friso is Managing Director in the London office of the private investment and advisory firm Wolfensohn &amp; Co (founded by James Wolfensohn, former President of the World Bank ). Prince Friso is a co-founder of the MRI Centre in Amsterdam and is also a founding shareholder of Wizzair, the largest low-cost airline in Eastern Europe. Prince Friso is honorary chairman of the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development (a position he holds together with his younger brother Prince Constantijn). The Prince also serves as a director and supervisory director of various companies. Prior to his accident, Prince Friso was working as a Chief Financial Officer for URENCO, a uranium enrichment company that has its main offices in Stoke Poges, Berkshire, UK, and plants in the Netherlands, Germany, Capenhurst, UK, and New Mexico in the US. Prince Friso was taking care of all four plants. [ Marriage and children ] Prince Friso with his wife Mabel and daughters (2010) On 30 June 2003 it was announced that Prince Friso was to marry Mabel Wisse Smit. The Dutch cabinet, however, did not seek the permission of parliament for this marriage; constitutionally necessary if Prince Friso was to remain a member of the Dutch Royal House and in line of the hereditary succession for the throne (he had been second in this line of succession, after his older brother, Crown Prince Willem Alexander ). The Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende explained that this was due to discussions with Mabel Wisse Smit in October 2003 where she had admitted that her previous statements about an alleged relationship with Klaas Bruinsma (1953 –1991), known as a Godfather of the Dutch drug trade, had not been complete and accurate. [ http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/25/world/fg-briefs25.3 Prince Weds, Gives Up Any Claim to Throne Los Angeles Times April 25, 2004 February 17, 2012 ] She had previously stated that she had contact for a few months with Bruinsma, but in a casual context, not intimate or relating to business and that she had broken the contact on learning of Bruinsma&apos;s occupation. This &quot; breach of trust &quot; was the reason the government did not seek parliament&apos;s permission, respecting the wishes of the couple. { &quot; Revelations About Dutch Prince&apos;s Fiancée Rattle Royal Family &quot; } They nevertheless married in Delft on 24 April 2004, and Mabel Wisse Smit became a member of the Dutch Royal Family but not a member of the Dutch Royal House. Considering that his elder brother, Prince Willem-Alexander is heir apparent to the Dutch throne, and has three children, Prince Friso&apos;s exclusion from the succession is unlikely to have an effect on the monarchy in the Netherlands.

The prince&apos;s condition was described as &quot; stable, but critical &quot;. [ http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/ Het Koninklijk Huis Netherlands Government Information Service February 17, 2012 ] { In hospital MSNBC, February 17, 2012 } The Dutch royal family issued a statement on 19 February saying &quot; The Royal Family is very grateful and deeply touched by all expressions of support and sympathy after the ski accident of His Royal Highness Prince Friso. It is a great support for them during this difficult time. &quot; [ http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2012/februari/zijne-koninklijke-hoogheid-prins-friso-19-februari-2012-1913/ Zijne Koninklijke Hoogheid Prins Friso, 19 februari 2012 - 19:13 - Het Koninklijk Huis Koninklijkhuis.nl 2012-02-19 2012-02-24 ] A prognosis on his health situation was expected within a few days, but this was pushed back to Friday 24 February, a week after his accident. The RVD&apos;s comment remained the same: stable, but critical. On 24 February, an Innsbruck medical team announced that the prince had been buried for 25 minutes, followed by a 50-minute CPR to treat his cardiac arrest. Dr. Wolfgang Koller stated that an MRI was performed a day earlier revealing little change, however other neurological tests indicated significant damage due to oxygen shortage. It remains unclear whether the prince will ever regain consciousness. Koller said that the prince&apos;s family may now look for a rehabilitation institution. On the same day the Dutch royal family issued a statement requesting that the privacy of the prince&apos;s family be respected to enable them to come to terms with his condition.
