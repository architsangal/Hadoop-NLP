The park is located [ 9 mi km ] south of the town of Benson and west of the north-flowing San Pedro River. The park encompasses most of a down-dropped block of Palaeozoic rocks on the east flank of the Whetstone Mountains. The caverns are carved out of limestone and filled with spectacular speleothem s which have been growing for 50,000  years or longer, and are still growing. Careful and technical cave state park development and maintenance are designed to preserve the natural cave system. [ Arizona State Parks Kartchner Caverns State Park: Science http://www.pr.state.az.us/parks/KACA/science.html ] [ History ] The caverns were apparently unknown to humankind until 1974, when cavers Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts found a narrow crack in the bottom of a sinkhole, and followed the source of warm, moist air toward what ended up being more than [ 2.5 mi km ] of pristine cave passages. [ Randy Tufts Gary Tenen August 1999 Discovery and History of Kartchner Caverns, Arizona Journal of Cave and Karst Studies 1090-6924 61 2 44–8 http://www.caves.org/pub/journal/PDF/V61/v61n2-Tuffs.pdf ] Hoping to protect the cave from vandalism, they kept the location a secret for fourteen years, deciding that the best way to preserve the cavern — which was near a freeway — was to develop it as a tour cave. After gaining the cooperation of the Kartchner family and working with them for ten years, together they decided that the best way to achieve the goal of protection through development as a tour cave was to approach Arizona State Parks. In 1985, then-Governor Bruce Babbitt secretly left the state capitol with two bodyguards and spent three hours crawling through the cave&apos;s tight passages to reach the cave&apos;s showcase chambers, including the Big  Room, Echo  Passage and Cul-de-sac Passage. [ Roy Rivenburg Arizona&apos;s Deep Dark Secret Los Angeles Times L1 1999-11-14 http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/14/travel/tr-33279 ] The discovery of the cave was finally made public in 1988 when the landowners sold the area to the state for development as a park and show cavern. [ Barbara Yost Underground fantasy Arizona Republic T1, T8–9 2006-07-30 http://www.azcentral.com/travel/arizona/features/articles/0730kartchner0730main.html ] The state spent $28 million on a high-tech system of air-lock doors, misting machines and other gadgetry designed to preserve the cave. [ Features open to public viewing ] The two major features of the caverns currently available to the public are the Throne  Room and the Big  Room. The Throne  Room contains one of the world&apos;s longest ( [ 21 ft 2 in on on / ] ) soda straw stalactite s and a [ 58 ft m on ] high column called Kubla Khan, after the poem. The Big  Room contains the world&apos;s most extensive formation of brushite moonmilk; it is closed during the summer for several months (April  15 to October  15) each year because it is a nursery roost for over 1,000   cave bats. [ Arizona State Parks Cave Tour Information http://azstateparks.com/Parks/KACA/tour_info.html ] Other features publicly accessible within the caverns include Mud  Flats, Rotunda  Room, Strawberry  Room, and Cul-de-sac Passage. [ Animal life ] Although the cave is largely uninhabited, bats do nest in the Big Room during late spring. [ Debbie C. Buecher Ronnie M.
