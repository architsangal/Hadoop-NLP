It has a population of approximately 40,000. The Anglo-Saxon name for the settlement was Bexelei, from leah —a glade where the box tree grows. [ English Place-Names Explained Whynne-Hammond Charles 2007 Countryside Books 978-1-85306-911-6 228 ] [ History ] { The De La Warr Pavilion } Bexhill manor in 2002 The earliest evidence of occupation of the site came from the discovery of primitive boats at Egerton Park. The town came into official existence with the Charter of 772. In this charter, King Offa II, King of Mercia, granted land to Bishop Oswald to build a church. Three hundred years later, around 1066, William the Conqueror gave the Rape of Hastings, including the captured town of Bexhill (also referred to as the &quot; Badman Town &quot; ), to Robert, Count of Eu, as the spoils of victory. The manor of Gotham in Bexhill was held by the de Lyvet ( Levett ) family from an early date. (The Levetts held land at Firle, Catsfield, Ninfield, South Heighton and West Dean and elsewhere, some of which was lost due to an heir&apos;s bankruptcy.) Thomas de Lyvet, son of Richard, granted Gotham manor to James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele. Thomas&apos;s daughter Elizabeth, who married William Gildredge of Withyham, unsuccessfully disputed Gotham manor in 1445. [ Page William Louis Francis Salzman T. P. Hudson, A.

Constable ] The Gildredge family later lived at nearby Eastbourne, where by 1554 they owned much of the land. Today&apos;s Gildredge Park in Eastbourne is named for the family. Most of the Gildredge lands were carried by marriage into the Gilbert (now Davies-Gilbert ) family of Eastbourne, who made the Gildredge manor house their own. The church owned Bexhill Manor until Queen Elizabeth I acquired it in 1590 and granted it to Thomas Sackville, then Baron Buckhurst. Thomas became the first Earl of Dorset in 1603. In 1813, when the male line of the earldom had died out, Elizabeth Sackville married the fifth Earl De La Warr, and she and her husband inherited Bexhill. This early history can still be seen in street names, with Sackville Road, Buckhurst Road, De La Warr Parade, and King Offa Way being some of the most significant roads in the town. On 20 May 1729, a waterspout came ashore, became a tornado, and travelled [ 12 mi km ] inland to Battle and Linkhill; nine farms and properties received serious damage. { Gallery of Natural Phenomena } Smuggling was rife in the area in the early 19th century.

Reginald Sackville, seventh Earl De La Warr, decided to transform what was then a village on a hill around its church into an exclusive seaside resort, which he named Bexhill-on-Sea. He was instrumental in building a sea wall south of the village, and the road above it was then named De La Warr Parade. Large houses were built inland from there, and the new town began. In 1890, the luxurious Sackville Hotel was built. Bexhill was the location for the first motor race in the United Kingdom, in May 1902. { http://royalautomobileclub.co.uk/archive/archive_navmain5.asp?groupid=675 &amp; tabstyle=main } Signs at the town&apos;s outskirts have the text &apos;Birthplace of British Motor Racing&apos; appended below the town&apos;s name.

[ Transport ] { A259 Bypass for Bexhill town centre. } Bexhill is on the A259 road which forms the coast road between Folkestone and Brighton. Plans of an A259 Bexhill and Hastings bypass have repeatedly been postponed over the past 40 years but the plans were cancelled due to environmental concerns. Current plans include building a new [ 3.5 mi km on ] link road between the town and Hastings instead. In October 2009 this has been given initial approval for government funding.

The town is served by the coastal railway line between Ashford and Brighton and has three railway stations, including Cooden Beach, Collington, and Bexhill. Regular trains run to Brighton, Ashford and London.

A second line, this time built by the South Eastern Railway and approaching the town from the north, was a branch line from Crowhurst via an intermediate station at Sidley to a terminus at Bexhill West. The line opened on 1 June 1902 and closed on 15 June 1964. { H P White, Southern England (A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, Volume 2), David &amp; Charles, 1961-1982, page 36. } The branch was also closed temporarily between 1 January 1917 and 1 March 1919 as an economy measure during the First World War. { &quot; } { Railway Magazine &quot;, July 1958 } [ Sport and leisure ] Bexhill-on-sea has two Non-League football clubs Bexhill United F.C. who play at The Polegrove and Little Common F.C. who play at The recreation ground.
