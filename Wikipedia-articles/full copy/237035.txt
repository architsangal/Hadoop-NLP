[ Eiffel 65 Bloom06 Ostia.jpg As Bloom 06: Maurizio Lobina and Jeffrey Jey yes group_or_band Turin, Italy Eurodance, Italodance 1998–2005 2010–present BlissCorporation, Universal, Republic, Popular, Universal International Bloom 06, Bliss Team Jeffrey Jey Maurizio Lobina Gabry Ponte ] Eiffel 65 is an Italian three-piece eurodance group formed in 1998 and best known for pioneering in pitch correction and Auto-Tune, and for their international hit &quot; Blue (Da Ba Dee) &quot;. Their other hit singles include &quot; Move Your Body &quot; and &quot; Too Much of Heaven &quot;, all of which appeared on their album Europop, released in late 1999. The name &quot; Eiffel &quot; was chosen randomly by a computer program and the &quot; 65 &quot; was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. Eiffel 65 achieved considerable success in Italy, the rest of Europe, and Canada. Europop peaked in the top five on the Billboard 200, was at the top of the MuchMusic countdown, and sold over two million units. &quot; Blue (Da Ba Dee) &quot; peaked at #6 on the Billboard charts. { Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Eiffel 65 } [ Later work and reformation ] Eiffel 65 also made thirty remixes of tracks by other artists like &quot; The Bad Touch &quot; by Bloodhound Gang, Nek &apos;s hit single &quot; La vita è &quot; and S Club 7 &apos;s &quot; Reach &quot; between 1999 and 2002 and in early 2005 a remix of Yo Yo Mundi&apos;s &quot; L&apos;ultimo testimone &quot;. In early March 2005 the group&apos;s DJ, Gabry Ponte, broke up the group to be able to focus on his solo career. On 16 May 2005, the remaining two members, Maurizio Lobina and Jeffrey Jey, left Bliss Corporation to continue on their own with their own production company. Since the name &quot; Eiffel 65 &quot; was a property of Bliss Corporation, the duo decided to continue under a new name, as announced in June 2006, Bloom 06. Eiffel 65&apos;s long anticipated fourth album, under the working title Crash Test, had already finished production by the time of Maury&apos;s and Jeffrey&apos;s departure from Bliss Corporation. It was renamed, Crash Test 01, and was released by the new band, Bloom 06, on 13 October 2006. The album contains lyrics in both English and Italian. Bliss Corporation had confirmed that a new Eiffel 65 line-up would make their debut in summer of 2007 but then the debut was postponed. In 2009 Bliss Corporation began to promote work from older bands by subtitling music videos and releasing &quot; unseen &quot; video footage from Eiffel 65. In June 2010, it was announced on the Bloom 06 website that Eiffel 65 would reunite once more for production of new recordings as well as touring. [ http://www.bloom06.com/site/index.php bloom06.com bloom06.com 2012-05-10 ] In July 2010, it was announced from the official website that the group would release a new single in October 2010. The release has been postponed to sometime in 2012. In the meantime they are touring Europe with their New Planet Tour, a multimedial show with wide screens. For the summer 2012 it was announced on their official site a Mini Tour in Australia.

An alpha version of the video appeared as enhanced content for Eiffel&apos;s single &quot; Too Much of Heaven &quot;; the song is credited to Zorotl even though it was recorded by members of Eiffel 65, so Zorotl is considered a virtual group.
