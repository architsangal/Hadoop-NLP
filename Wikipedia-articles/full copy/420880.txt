[ December 2009 December 2009 December 2009 ] [ Council of Conservative Citizens Council of Conservative Citizens Logo.jpg 200px CofCC 1988 St. Louis, Missouri ] The Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) is an American political organization that supports a large variety of conservative and paleoconservative causes in addition to white nationalism, [ A Space for Hate: The White Power Movement&apos;s Adaptation Into Cyberspace Adam G. Klein June 2010 93 978-1-936117-07-9 ] and white separatism. { Council of Conservative Citizens - Statement of Principles } Several members of the CofCC Board of Directors are former leaders of the segregationist Citizens&apos; Councils of America, founded by Major Bob Patterson, which is commonly referred to as the White Citizens&apos; Council.

Other US states with active chapters include Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, California and New York. Sporadic CofCC activities occur in other parts of the country as well. [ History ] The CofCC was founded in 1988 in Atlanta, Georgia, and is now headquartered in St. Louis. The CofCC was formed by various Republicans, Conservative Democrat s, and some former members of the Citizens&apos; Councils of America, sometimes called the White Citizens Council, a segregationist organization formerly prominent in the 1960s and 1970s. Lester Maddox, the late former governor of Georgia, was a charter member.

Tom Dover, head of Dover Cylinder Repair is the president. Leonard Wilson, a former Alabama State Committeeman for both Republican and Democratic parties, sits on the CofCC Executive Board. Bill Lord Sr, Carroll County Coroner, former head of the Carroll Academy School Board, also sits of the Executive Board. The organization often holds meetings with various other paleo-conservative organizations in the United States, and sometimes meets with Nationalist organizations from Europe. In 1997, several members of the CofCC attended an event hosted by Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos;s National Front party. The delegation from the CofCC presented Le Pen with a Confederate flag, which had been flown over the South Carolina state capitol building.

One such politician was Bob Barr, who had spoken at CofCC functions, saying he found the groups&apos; racial views to be &quot; repugnant, &quot; and didn&apos;t realize the nature of the group when he agreed to speak at the group&apos;s meeting. [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C990317-2%2C00.html Bob Barr Barr Bob 1999-03-01 2007-03-12 Representative Barr Responds (Letter) Time Magazine ] In later years, additional media articles on the involvement of other Republican party leaders and conservative Democrats with the CofCC attempted to force a distinct denunciation of their association with the organization. For instance, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had also been a member of the CofCC. Subsequent to the report, the CofCC was denounced by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, for holding &quot; racist and nationalist views &quot; and demanded that Lott formally denounce the organization. Although Lott refused to denounce the organization he did state he had resigned his membership. Subsequently, Nicholson, demanded Lott denounce his former segregationist views following a speech he gave at Senator Strom Thurmond &apos;s birthday dinner when he promoted the Senator&apos;s former Dixiecrat Presidential campaign. [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37288-2002Dec10 The Washington Post Lott Remarks on Thurmond Echoed 1980 Words Thomas B. Edsall Brian Faler December 11, 2002 May 26, 2010 ] Following the ensuring controversy Nicholson&apos;s demands initiated, Lott once again apologized for his past support for segregation, his past associations, and his remarks at Thurmond&apos;s birthday. This caused his loss of support from a number of important conservatives, not least, Thurmond himself. Consequently, Lott resigned his post as Senate Minority Leader. Similarly, former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt also attended an event of the organization&apos;s St. Louis predecessor the &quot; Metro-South Citizens Council &quot; shortly before the name change in the mid-1980s. This was an event he has repeatedly referred to as a mistake.

[ September 2010 ] Similarly, in 1993, Mike Huckabee, then the Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, agreed to speak at the CofCC&apos;s national convention in Memphis, Tennessee in his pursuit for the Governorship of Arkansas. By the time of the CofCC convention, Huckabee was unable to leave Arkansas. Instead, he sent a videotaped speech, which &quot; was viewed and extremely well received by the audience, &quot; according to the CofCC newsletter. [ Blumenthal Max Mike Huckabee&apos;s White Supremacist Links The Nation 2008-01-18 http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters?pid%3D272545 2008-01-21 ] However, following his success in the election, in April 1994, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before the CofCC. He commented, &quot; I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones. I&apos;ve spent a lifetime fighting racism and anti-Semitism. &quot; [ Duhart Bill Huckabee won&apos;t appear with racist. Philadelphia Tribune 1994-04-12 ] Other prominent conservative national and state politicians who were members refused to denounce, distance, or resign their membership, and continued attending meetings and giving speeches remained prominent political leaders within the conservative movement including former Senator Jesse Helms. Senator Helms remained supportive of the CofCC and consistently won his elections, and support from the CofCC was considered decisive enough that the organization was influential in office throughout his terms in the Senate. Similarly, former governors H. Guy Hunt of Alabama and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, as well as Senator Strom Thurmond remained active members and/or gave speeches to the organization. Strom Thurmond remained in the Senate, retiring in 2002. The SPLC and the Miami Herald tallied a further 38 federal, state, and local politicians who appeared at CofCC events between 2000 and 2004. { SPLCenter.org: Communing with the Council } The ADL states the following politicians are members or have spoken at meetings: Senator Trent Lott, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, Mississippi state senators Gary Jackson, and Dean Kirby, several Mississippi state representatives. People who have also spoken at CofCC meetings include Ex-Governors Guy Hunt of Alabama, and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi. U.S. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi is said to have attended as well. { Council of Conservative Citizens - Extremism in America } In 2005, the Council of Conservative Citizens held its National Conference in Montgomery, Alabama. George Wallace Jr., an Alabama Public Service Commissioner and former State Treasurer who was then running for Lieutenant Governor, and Sonny Landham, an actor, spoke at the conference. [ Issues ] The CofCC considers itself a traditional conservative group opposing liberals and neo-conservatives, supports national self-determination, immigration restriction, federalism, home rule, and opposition to free trade and global capitalism. Its specific issues include states rights, race relations (especially interracial marriage, which it opposes), and conservative Christian values. They have criticized Martin Luther King, who is considered by the organization as a left-wing agitator of Black American communities with notable ties to communism, and holding personal sexual morals unworthy of a person deserving national recognition, [ http://www.cofcc.org/foundation/reparations.htm Reparations for Slavery: Strategies and Tactics 2003 2007-03-14 http://web.archive.org/web/20070206022935/http%3A//www.cofcc.org/foundation/reparations.htm 2007-02-06 ] and consider the Civil Rights Movement, and the Frankfurt School as elementally subversive to the Separation of powers under the United States Constitution. Consistent with paleo-conservatism, they regard American culture as an offshoot of the European cultural, specifically the British Protestant tradition. Consequently, the Council of Conservative Citizens is currently active in organizing the restriction, reduction, and/or moratorium of immigration, enforcing laws and regulation against illegal aliens, ending what they see as racial discrimination against whites through affirmative action and racial quotas, overturning Supreme Court rulings and Congressional Acts such as forced busing and gun control, ending free trade economic policy, and supports sexual morality, including promotion of the Defense of Marriage Act and persecution of homosexuality. In turn, the CofCC works with a number of European nationalist such as Front National, and Vlaams Belang and the United Kingdom Independence Party. Following its publishing of several dozen conservative organizations ranging from the Federation for American Immigration Reform to Vdare as hate group s in 2005, the CofCC staged a protest in front of the offices of the SPLC in Montgomery, Alabama. [ September 2010 ] About 72 members organized a demonstration of several hundred protesters receiving state-wide publicity and focusing attention on the SPLC&apos;s fundraising and raising suspicions of demagoguery by the center. The CofCC continues protesting speaking engagements by Morris Dees in Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Indiana, and South Carolina declaring him to be a threat to free speech and a fraud. [ Activities ] The CofCC publishes the Citizens Informer newspaper quarterly. Previously edited by the late Samuel T. Francis and web designer Joel T. LeFevre, William Rolen has recently [ March 2012 ] taken over. { http://web.archive.org/web/20101124122552/http://cofcc.org/extras/june10ci.pdf } Its editorial board includes Baum, Virginia Abernethy, Sam G. Dickson, Wayne Lutton, and Jared Taylor. [ March 2012 ] Recent contributors to the Citizen Informer have included Lawrence Auster, Louis Calabro and Robert Locke. It has also printed syndicated columns of Joseph Sobran, Patrick Buchanan, Rand Paul, and Congressional speeches of Ron Paul. [ March 2012 ] Numerous Mississippi businesses advertise in the Citizens Informer. [ March 2012 ] The CofCC has a non-profit foundation, the Conservative Citizens Foundation, which is currently [ March 2012 ] raising money for a Confederate monument project. [ March 2012 ] [ State chapters ] [ Tennessee ] In Tennessee there are several chapters. One in west Tennessee, one in Middle Tennessee, one for east Tennessee and another for southeast Tennessee. In Western Tennessee the chapter runs the The Political Cesspool radio show. [ September 2010 ] [ Mississippi ] In Mississippi there are several chapters that are working closely with private academies. These academies (many of which were originally called “council schools”) are private schools established for white parents to avoid the desegregation of public schools after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. Mississippi is the only state that has major politicians who are open CofCC members, including State Senators and State Representatives. The CofCC once claimed 34 members in the Mississippi legislature.

Demonstrations were held in the upstate, down to the tourist coast in Myrtle Coast and Hilton Head Island. The rallies started as a response to NAACP rallies calling for the flag to come down and their protests numbered several thousand. After a 1999 rally, when the CofCC drew 1,500 demonstrators to the capital, other groups asked to form a coalition. In 2000, a coalition march drew 8,000 people and was faced with an equal number of CofCC protesters. [ September 2010 ] Several coalition members endorsed a compromise that led to the flag coming down and being placed in front of the statehouse on the Confederate Soldier statue. The previous SC CofCC state director, Francis Bell died in 2005 after fighting a long battle with cancer. The South Carolina CofCC is now headed by a four member board of directors and has active chapters in Charleston and Greenville. [ Controversy and criticism ] Various critics describe the organization as a hate group. The New York Times and the Anti-Defamation League have described the Council of Conservative Citizens as a white supremacist organization. [ http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid%3D1048 Hate in the Mainstream: Ann Coulter Defends White Supremacist Group June 9, 2009 ] The CofCC is considered by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to be part of the &quot; neo-confederate movement &quot;. In general, organizations such as the NAACP, League of United Latin American Citizens, SPLC (which lists it as a &quot; hate group &quot; [ http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid%3D103 Center Report Exposes Links Between Hate Group, Lawmakers 2007-03-12 Southern Poverty Law Center September 2004 http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165149/http%3A//www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid%3D103 2007-09-30 ] ) and the Anti-Defamation League consider it a threat. Max Blumenthal calls it America&apos;s premier racist organization and elementally dangerous to America. { Beyond Macaca: The Photograph That Haunts George Allen } The CofCC&apos;s statement of principles condemns the Federal government&apos;s intervention into state and local affairs in forcing racial integration (item 2), free-trade and globalism, immigration by non-Europeans (item 2), homosexuality, and interracial marriage (item 6). According to its supporters, the Council of Conservative Citizens opposes globalism, multiculturalism, racism against whites, and an intrusive Federal government. The group says it has a key role in reporting the racial overtones of violence against whites, both in the United States and elsewhere. An April 2005 photo essay on the CofCC website claimed that images of decapitated, burnt and mangled bodies of whites are victims of black violence in South Africa. The website closes with the statement that someday American whites will be a minority and will be subject to the same form of violence. { Shelby County Tennessee Chapter } Columnist Ann Coulter has defended the group against charges of racism, stating on the basis of a viewing of their website that there is &quot; no evidence &quot; that the CofCC supports segregation.
