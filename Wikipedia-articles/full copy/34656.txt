[ March 2011 ] [ 1929 ] [ 1929 ] Year 1929 ( MCMXXIX ) was a common year starting on Tuesday in the Gregorian calendar. By January 1 of this year, every state in the entire world had adopted the Gregorian calendar, having abandoned the Julian calendar. { NOTOC } [ Summary ] This year marked the end of a period known in American history as the Roaring Twenties after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ushered in a worldwide Great Depression. In the Americas, an agreement was brokered to end the Cristero War, a counter-revolution in Mexico. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, a British high court, ruled that Canadian women are persons in the Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General) case. The 1st Academy Awards for film were held in Los Angeles, while the Museum of Modern Art opened in New York City. The Peruvian Air Force was created. In Asia, the Republic of China and the Soviet Union engaged in a minor conflict after the Chinese seized full control of the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway, which ended with a resumption of joint administration. In the Soviet Union, General Secretary Joseph Stalin expelled Leon Trotsky and adopted a policy of collectivization. The Grand Trunk Express began service in India. In the Middle East, rioting occurred between Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem over access to the Western Wall. Mohammed Nadir Shah became King of Afghanistan. Britain, Australia and New Zealand began a joint Antarctic Research Expedition. The centenary of Western Australia was celebrated. In international affairs, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, a treaty renouncing war as an instrument of national policy, went into effect. In Europe, the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy signed the Lateran Treaty. The Idionymon law was passed in Greece to outlaw political dissent. Spain hosted the Ibero-American Exposition which featured pavilions from Latin America n countries. The BBC broadcast a television transmission for the first time (see &quot; 1929 in television &quot; ). The German airship LZ 127 &apos;&apos;Graf Zeppelin&apos;&apos; flew around the world in 21 days. [ Middle East, Asia, and Pacific Isles ] On August 16 of this year the 1929 Palestine riots broke out between Palestinians and Jew s over control of the Western Wall. The rioting, initiated in part when British police tore down a screen the Jews had constructed in front of the Wall, [ Segev Tom Tom Segev One Palestine, Complete 1999 Metropolitan Books 0-8050-4848-0 295–313 ] continued until the end of the month. In total, 133 Jews and 116 Palestinians were killed. [ Matthew B. Stannard A Time of Change; Israelis, Palestinians and the Disengagement http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f%3D%2Fc%2Fa%2F2005%2F08%2F09%2FMNGF6E53GL1.DTL San Francisco Chronicle 2005-08-09 ] { NA 59/8/353/84/867n, 404 Wailing Wall/279 and 280, Archdale Diary and Palestinian Police records. } Two of the more famous incidents occurring during these riots were the August 23 and August 24 1929 Hebron massacre, in which 65–68 Jews were killed by Palestinians and the remaining Jews are forced to leave Hebron. The Palestinians had been told that Jews were killing Palestinians. Jews would not return to Hebron until after the Six Day War in 1967. { Segev, Tom (2000).

Translated by Haim Watzman of Metropolitan Books, Little, Brown and company. pp. 318–319 ISBN 0-8050-4848-0 and ISBN 0-316-64859-0. } The other major clash was the 1929 Safed massacre, in which 18–20 Jews were killed by Palestinians in Safed in similar fashion. [ Early Arab-Zionist Negotiation Attempts, 1913-1931 Kaplan Neil 1983 Routledge London 0-7146-3214-7 82 ] Elsewhere in the Middle East, Iraq took a big step toward gaining independence from the British. The Iraqi government had, since the end of World War I and the beginning of the British Mandate in the Middle East, constantly resisted British efforts to control or restrict them. In September, Britain announced that it would support Iraq&apos;s inclusion in the League of Nations, this signaled the beginning of the end of their direct control of the region. [ Britain&apos;s Informal Empire in the Middle East Daniel Silverfarb Majid Khadduri 13–20 0-19-503997-1 Oxford University Press 1986 New York ] Early in 1929, the Afghan leader King Amanullah lost power through revolution and civil war to Amir Habibullah II. Habibulah&apos;s rule, however, only lasted nine months. Nadir Shah replaced him in October, starting a line of monarchs which would last 40 years. { pp. 41–44 ISBN 0-8133-4019-5 } In neighboring India, a general strike in Bombay continued throughout the year despite efforts by the British. { Chandavarkar, Rajnarayan. Imperial Power and Popular Politics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. pp. 170–178 ISBN 0-521-59692-0 } On December 29, the All India Congress in Lahore declared Indian independence from Britain, something it had threatened to do if Britain did not grant India dominion status. { Vohra, Ranbir. The Making of India. Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 2001. pp. 147–148 ISBN 0-7656-0712-3 } China and Russia engaged in a minor conflict after China seized full control of the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway. Russia counterattacked and took the cities of Hailar and Manchouli before issuing an ultimatum demanding joint control of the railway to be reinstated. The Chinese agreed to the terms on November 26. The Japanese would later see this defeat as a sign of Chinese weakness, leading to their taking control of Manchuria. { Elleman, Bruce. Diplomacy and Deception. Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 1997. pp. 282–283 ISBN 0-7656-0143-5 } The Far East began to experience economic problems late in the year as the effects of the Great Depression began to spread. Southeast Asia was especially hard hit as its exports (spice, rubber, and other commodities) were more sensitive to economic problems. { Tarling, Nicholas. The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999. pp. 182–184 ISBN 0-521-66371-7 } In the Pacific, on December 28 – &quot; Black Saturday &quot; in Samoa – New Zealand colonial police killed 11 unarmed demonstrators, an event which led the Mau movement to demand independence for Samoa. [ Europe ] [ Western ] In 1929, the Fascist Party in Italy tightened its control. National education policy took a major step towards being completely taken over by the agenda of indoctrination. [ Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini: Totalitarianism in the Twentieth Century Pauley Bruce F. 2003 Harlan Davidson Wheeling 117 ] In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism, and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God. On February 11, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty, making Vatican City a sovereign state. [ Italy from Revolution to Republic Scala DI M., Spencer and Scala DI 2004 Westview Press Boulder 0-8133-4176-0 262–263 ] On July 25, Pope Pius XI emerged from the Vatican and entered St. Peter&apos;s square in a huge procession witnessed by about 250,000 persons, thus ending nearly 60 years of papal self-imprisonment within the Vatican. [ Prisoner of the Vatican Kertzer David 2004 Houghton Mifflin Boston 0-618-22442-4 292–293 ] Italy used the diplomatic prestige associated with this successful agreement to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy. [ The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32 Pollard John 2005 Cambridge University Press Cambridge 0-521-02366-1 74–76 ] Germany experienced a major turning point in this year due to the economic crash. The country had experienced prosperity under the government of the Weimar Republic until foreign investors withdrew their German interests. This began the crumbling of the Republican government in favor of Nazism. [ Weimar and Nazi Germany Lee Stephen 1996 Heinemann London 0-435-30920-X 38–39 ] In 1929, the number of unemployed reached three million. { Gilbert, Martin. A History of the Twentieth Century. New York: Avon books, 1998. ISBN 0-380-71393-4 } On July 27, the Geneva Convention, held in Switzerland, addressed the treatment of prisoners of war in response to problems encountered during World War I. { Geneva Convention (1929):Introduction } On May 31, the British general election returned a hung parliament yet again, with the Liberals in position to determine who would have power. These elections were known as the &quot; Flapper &quot; elections due to the fact that it was the first British election in which women under 30 could vote. [ Gender, Modernity, and the Popular Press in Inter-War Britain Bingham Adrian 2004 Clarendon Oxford 0-19-927247-6 125 ] A week after the vote, on June 7 the Conservatives conceded power rather than ally with the Liberals. Ramsay MacDonald founded a new Labour government the next day. [ Twentieth-Century Britain William 2003 Palgrave Macmillan Basingstoke 0-333-77224-5 165–169 ] 1929 is regarded as a turning point by French historians, who point out that it was last year in which prosperity was felt before the effects of the Great Depression. The Third Republic had been in power since before World War I. On July 24 French prime minister Raymond Poincaré resigned for medical reasons; he was succeeded by Aristide Briand. Briand adopted a foreign policy of both peace and defensive fortification. The Kellogg-Briand Pact, renouncing war as an instrument of foreign policy, went into effect in this year (it was first signed in Paris in 1928 by most leading world powers). [ Triumph and Downfall Louria Margot 2001 Greenwood Press Westport 0-313-31272-9 137–138 ] The French began work on the Maginot line in this year, as a defense against a possible German attack, and on September 5 Briand presented a plan for the United States of Europe. [ The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914-1938 Bernard Philippe et al. 1985 Cambridge University Press Cambridge 0-521-35854-X 173 ] On October 22 Briand was replaced as Prime Minister by Andre Tardieu. [ The Lights That Failed Steiner Zara 2005 Oxford University Press Oxford 0-19-822114-2 828 ] Primo de Rivera &apos;s dictatorship in Spain experienced growing dissatisfaction among students and academics, as well as businessmen who blamed the government for recent economic woes. Many called for a fascist regime, like that in Italy. [ Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977 Payne Stanley 1999 University of Wisconsin Press Madison 0-299-16564-7 36–37 ] [ Eastern ] In May, Joseph Stalin consolidated his power in the Soviet Union by sending Leon Trotsky into exile. The only country that would grant Trotsky asylum was Turkey, in return for his help in their civil war. He and his family left the USSR aboard ship on February 12. { Brackman, Roman. The Secret File of Joseph Stalin. London: Frank Cass, 2001. pp. 202–203 ISBN 0-7146-5050-1 } Stalin then turned on his former political ally, Nikolai Bukharin, who was the last real threat to his power. By the end of the year Bukharin had been defeated. Once Stalin was in power, he turned his former support for Lenin&apos;s New Economic Policy into opposition. { Alexander, Robert. International Trotskyism, 1929-1985. Durham: Duke University Press, 1991. p. 3 ISBN 0-8223-1066-X } In November, Stalin declared that it &quot; The Year of the Great Breakthrough &quot; and stated that the country would focus on industrial programs as well as on collectivizing the grain supply. He hoped to surpass the West not only in agriculture, but in industry. { Rappaport, Helen. Joseph Stalin: a Biographical Companion. City: ABC-Clio Inc, 1999. p. 119 ISBN 1-57607-084-0 } Millions of Soviet farmers were removed from their private farms, their property was collected, and they were moved to state-owned farms. Stalin also emphasized in 1929 a campaign demonizing Kulaks as a plague on society. Kulak property was taken and they were deported by cattle train to areas of frozen tundra. { Gilbert, 761–2 } The timber market in Finland began to decline in 1929 due to the Great Depression, as well as the Soviet Union&apos;s entrance into the market. Financial and political problems culminated in the birth of the fascist Lapua Movement on November 23 in a demonstration in Lapua. The movement&apos;s stated aim was Finnish democracy and anti-communism. { Singleton, Frederick and Anthony Upton. A Short History of Finland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 117 ISBN 0-521-64701-0 } The Finnish legislature received heavy pressure to remove basic rights from Communist groups. { Capoccia, Giovanni. Defending Democracy. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005. p. 153–154 ISBN 0-8018-8038-6 } Politics in Lithuania was also very heated, as President Voldemaras was unpopular in some quarters, and survived an assassination attempt in Kaunas. { Kristina Vaičikonis. &apos;&apos;Augustinas Voldemaras&apos;&apos;. Lituanus, Vol. 30, No.3 -Fall 1984, ed. Antanas Klimas, ISSN 0027-5089 } Later, while attending a meeting of the League of Nations, he was ousted in a coup by President Smetona, who made himself dictator. Upon Voldemaras&apos; removal from office, Geležinis Vilkas went underground and received aid and encouragement in its activities from Germany. Yugoslavia was renamed the &quot; Kingdom of Yugoslavia &quot; as King Alexander sought to unite the Balkans under his rule. { Lukic, Reneo and Allen Lynch. Europe from the Balkans to the Urals. Solna: SIPRI, 1996. p. 68 ISBN 0-19-829200-7 } The state&apos;s new Monarchy replaced the old parliament, which had been dominated by Serbs. { Payne, Stanley. A History of Fascism, 1914-1945. New York: Routledge, 1996. pp. 143–144 ISBN 1-85728-595-6 } [ North America ] [ 1929 in the United States ] In October 1929, the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada that women could not be members of the legislature. This case, which came to be known as the Persons Case, had important ramifications not just for women&apos;s rights but also because in overturning the case, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council engendered a radical change in the Canadian judicial approach to the Canadian constitution, an approach that has come to be known as the &quot; living tree doctrine &quot;. The five women who initiated the case are known in Canada as the Famous Five. [ Brian Brennan Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference 2001 Fifth House 14 1-894004-76-0 ] In November, the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake occurred off the south coast of Newfoundland in the Atlantic Ocean. It registered as a Richter magnitude 7.2 submarine earthquake centered on Grand Banks, broke 12 submarine transatlantic telegraph cable s and triggered a tsunami that destroyed many south coast communities in the Burin Peninsula area, killing 28 (as of 1997, Canada&apos;s most lethal earthquake). The Mexican Cristero War continued in 1929 as clerical forces attempted an assassination of the provisional president in a train bombing in February. The attempt failed. Plutarco Calles, at the center of power for the anti-clerics, continued to gather power in Mexico City. His government was considered an enemy to more conservative Mexicans who held to traditional forms of government and more religious control. Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party early in the year to increase his power; a party which was, ironically, seen by foreigners as fascist and which was in opposition to the Mexican Right. A special election was held in this year, which Jose Vasconselos lost to Ortiz Rubio. By this time, the war had ended. { Sherman, John. The Mexican Right. New York: Praeger, 1997. ISBN 0-275-95736-5 pp. 18–23 } The last group of rebels was defeated on June 4, and in the same month US Ambassador Dwight Morrow initiated talks between parties. On June 21 an agreement was brokered ending the Cristero War. On June 27, church bells rang and mass was held publicly for the first time in three years. However, the agreement favored the government heavily, as Priests were required to register with the government and religion was banned from schools. { Scheina, Robert. Latin America&apos;s Wars Volume II: the Age of the Professional Soldier, 1900-2001. City: Potomac Books Inc, 2003. ISBN 1-57488-452-2 p. 32–33 } The major event of the year for the United states was the stock market crash on Wall Street, which was to have international effects. On September 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) peaked at 381.17, a height it would not reach again until November 1954. Then, from October 24 – October 29, stock prices suffered three multi-digit percentage drops, wiping out more than $30 billion from the New York Stock Exchange (10 times greater than the annual budget of the federal government). { Gilbert, 767–9 } On December 3 U.S. President Herbert Hoover announced to the U.S. Congress that the worst effects of the recent stock market crash were behind the nation, and that the American people had regained faith in the economy. { http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=22021 } [ Literature, arts, and entertainment ] [ 1929 in the arts (disambiguation) ] Literature of the time reflected the memories many harbored of the horrors of World War I. A major seller was All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque. Remarque was a German who had fought in the war at age eighteen and been wounded in the Third Battle of Ypres. He stated that he intended the book to tell the story &quot; of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war. &quot; Another 1929 book reflecting on World War I was Ernest Hemingway &apos;s A Farewell to Arms, as well as Goodbye to All That by Robert Graves. { Gilbert, 769–70 } In lighter media, a few stars of the comic industry made their debut, including Tintin, a comic book character created by Hergé, who would appear in over 200 million comic books in 60 languages. Popeye, another comic strip character created by Elzie Crisler Segar, also appeared in this year. Within the film industry on May 16 the 1st Academy Awards were presented at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California, with Wings winning Best Picture. Also in this year Hallelujah! became the first Hollywood film to contain an entirely black cast, and Atlantic, a German film about the Titanic, was the first sound-on-film movie, signaling the beginning of the end for silent films. The arts were in the midst of the Modernist movement, as Pablo Picasso painted two cubist works, Woman in a Garden and Nude in an Armchair, during this year. The surrealist painters Salvador Dalí and René Magritte completed several works, including The First Days of Spring and The Treachery of Images. On November 7 in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art opened to the public. The latest in modern architecture was also represented by the likes of the Barcelona Pavilion in Spain and the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, at its completion the tallest building in the British Empire. [ Science and technology ] [ 1929 in science ] The year saw several advances in technology and exploration. On June 27 the first public demonstration of color TV was held by H. E. Ives and his colleagues at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. The first images were a bouquet of roses and an American flag. A mechanical system was used to transmit 50-line color television images between New York and Washington. By November, Vladimir Zworykin had taken out the first patent for color television. On November 29, Bernt Balchen, U.S. Admiral Richard Byrd, Captain Ashley McKinley, and Harold June, became the first to fly over the South Pole. Within the year, Britain, Australia and New Zealand began a joint Antarctic Research Expedition, and the German airship Graf Zeppelin began a round-the-world flight (ended August 29 ). This year Ernst Schwarz describes Bonobo (Pan paniscus) as a different species from chimpanzee (Pan troglodites), both very closely phylogenetically related to human beings.
