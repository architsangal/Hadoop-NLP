{ Barry Bonds holds } { all-time home run records in } { Major League Baseball. } { Sadaharu Oh, pictured here in 2006, holds the officially verified all-time world home-run record. } In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, [ http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_9.shtml Home Run History Keating, Peter American Heritage 2006 October 57 5 http://web.archive.org/web/20070303083608/http%3A//www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_9.shtml March 3, 2007 July 13, 2011 ] resulting in an automatic home run. There is also the &quot; inside-the-park &quot; home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field. When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself. Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, a run for each runner that scores including the batter, and an earned run each for the batter and for all baserunners who did not initially reach base on error, except that the runs scored by any runners who reached base while facing an earlier pitcher are charged to that pitcher. Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and, as a result, prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams — hence the old saying, variously attributed to slugger Ralph Kiner, or to a teammate talking about Kiner, &quot; Home run hitters drive Cadillac s, and singles hitters drive Ford s. &quot; [ http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a%3Dv%26amp%3Bv%3Da%26amp%3Bbid%3D1066%26amp%3Bpid%3D7516 Ralph Kiner Society for American Baseball Research The Baseball Biography Project July 16, 2011 Corbett, Warren http://web.archive.org/web/20070202061154/http%3A//bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a%3Dv%26amp%3Bv%3Da%26amp%3Bbid%3D1066%26amp%3Bpid%3D7516 February 2, 2007 ] [ Types of home runs ] [ Out of the park ] The most common type of home run involves hitting the ball over the outfield fence, or above a line on the outfield fence specifically designed to indicate a home run, in flight, in fair territory, without it being caught or deflected back by an outfielder into the playing field. This is sometimes called a home run &quot; out of the ballpark &quot;, although that term is frequently used to indicate a blow that completely clears any outfield seating, as a home run is usually automatically assumed to have left the field of play unless otherwise indicated. A batted ball that hits the ground (in fair territory) and bounces out of play is not a home run, but a ground rule double. A batted ball is also considered a home run if the ball touches any of the following while in flight, regardless of whether the ball subsequently rebounds back onto the playing field: [ http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf Major League Baseball Rulebook Major League Baseball PDF http://web.archive.org/web/20100319044131/http%3A//mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf March 19, 2011 July 16, 2011 ] Foul pole or attached screen Glove, hat, or any equipment or apparel deliberately thrown by a fielder, in an attempt to stop or deflect a fair ball that, in the umpires&apos; judgment, would have otherwise been a home run. Any fixed object where a particular ballpark&apos;s ground rules specifically state that a batted ball striking that object is a home run. This usually applies to objects such as ladders, scoreboard supports, etc. which are beyond the outfield fence in fair territory, but are located such that it is difficult for an umpire to quickly judge their position in relation to the field from several hundred feet away. If the ball hits the foul pole, the ball is fair and a home run is awarded to the batter. A famous example of the above happened on May 26, 1993, in a game between the Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers, when Cleveland&apos;s Carlos Martínez hit a fly ball that Texas outfielder José Canseco lost sight of as he was crossing the warning track. The ball hit Canseco in the head and bounced over the wall for a home run. { The Ballplayers – Jose Canseco } A home run accomplished in any of the above manners is an automatic home run. The ball is considered dead, and the batter and any preceding runners cannot be put out at any time while running the bases. However, if one or more runners fail to touch a base or one runner passes another before reaching home plate, that runner or runners can be called out on appeal, though in the case of not touching a base a runner can go back and touch it if doing so won&apos;t cause them to be passed by another preceding runner and they have not yet touched the next base (or home plate in the case of missing third base). This stipulation is in Approved Ruling (2) of Rule 7.10(b). [ Inside-the-park home run ] [ Inside-the-park home run ] An inside-the-park home run occurs when a batter hits the ball into play and is able to circle the bases before the fielders can put him out. Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases. This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield In the early days of baseball, outfields were relatively much more spacious, reducing the likelihood of an over-the-fence home run, while increasing the likelihood of an inside-the-park home run, as a ball getting past an outfielder had more distance that it could roll before a fielder could track it down. With outfields much less spacious and more uniformly designed than in the game&apos;s early days, inside-the-park home runs are now a rarity. They are usually the result of a ball being hit by a very fast runner, coupled with an outfielder either misjudging the flight of the ball (e.g., diving and missing) or the ball taking an unexpected bounce. Either way, this sends the ball into open space in the outfield and thereby allows the batter-runner to circle the bases before the defensive team can put him out. The speed of the runner is crucial as even triples are relatively rare in most modern ballparks. If any defensive play on an inside-the-park home run is labeled an error by the official scorer, a home run is not scored; instead, it is scored as a single, double, etc., and the batter-runner and any applicable preceding runners are said to have taken all additional bases on error. All runs scored on such a play, however, still count. An example of an unexpected bounce occurred during the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at AT &amp; T Park in San Francisco on July 10, 2007. Ichiro Suzuki of the American League team hit a fly ball off the right-center field wall, which caromed in the opposite direction from where National League right fielder Ken Griffey, Jr. was expecting it to go. By the time the ball was relayed, Ichiro had already crossed the plate standing up. This was the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history, and led to Suzuki being named the game&apos;s most valuable player. [ Specific situation home runs ] These types of home runs are characterized by the specific game situation in which they occur, and can theoretically occur on either an outside-the-park or inside-the-park home run. [ Grand slam ] [ Grand slam (baseball) ] Home runs are often characterized by the number of runners on base at the time, if any. A home run hit with the bases empty is seldom called a &quot; one-run homer &quot;, but rather a &quot; solo &quot; homer. With one or two runners on base, the home runs are usually called &quot; two-run homers &quot; or &quot; three-run homers &quot;. The term &quot; four-run homer &quot; is seldom used. Instead, it is nearly always called a &quot; grand slam &quot;. A grand slam occurs when the bases are &quot; loaded &quot; (that is, there are base runners standing at first, second, and third base) and the batter hits a home run. According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, the term originated in the card game of contract bridge. An inside-the-park grand slam is a grand slam without the ball leaving the field, and it is very rare, due to the relative rarity of loading the bases along with the significant rarity (nowadays) of inside-the-park home runs. On July 25, 1956 Roberto Clemente became the only MLB player to have ever scored a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in a 9–8 Pittsburgh Pirates win over the Chicago Cubs, at Forbes Field. On April 23, 1999, Fernando Tatís made history by hitting two grand slams in a single inning, both against Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers. With this feat, Tatís also set a Major-League record with eight RBI in a single inning. On July 29, 2003 against the Texas Rangers, Bill Mueller became the only player in major league history to hit two grand slams in a single game from opposite sides of the plate. In fact, he hit three home runs in that game, and his two grand slams were in consecutive at-bats. On August 25, 2011 the New York Yankees became the first team to hit three grand slams in a single game vs the Oakland A&apos;s. The Yankees eventually went on to win the game 22-9, after trailing 1-7. [ Walk-off home run ] [ Walk-off home run ] A walk-off home run is a home run hit by the home team in the bottom of the ninth inning, any extra inning, or other scheduled final inning, which gives the home team the lead and thereby ends the game. The term is attributed to Hall of Fame relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, [ Lowell Cohn What the Eck? San Francisco Chronicle April 21, 1988 D1 July 13, 2011 ] so named because after the run is scored, the players can &quot; walk off &quot; the field. Two World Series have ended via the &quot; walk-off &quot; home run. The first was the 1960 World Series when Bill Mazeroski of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a 9th inning solo home run in the 7th game of the series off New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry to give the Pirates the World Championship. The second time was the 1993 World Series when Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays hit a 9th inning 3-run home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams in Game 6 of the series, to help the Toronto Blue Jays capture their second World Series Championship in a row. Such a home run can also be called a &quot; sudden death &quot; or &quot; sudden victory &quot; home run. That usage has lessened as &quot; walk-off home run &quot; has gained favor. Along with Mazeroski&apos;s 1960 shot, the most famous walk-off or sudden-death homer would probably be the &quot; Shot Heard &apos;Round the World &quot; hit by Bobby Thomson to win the 1951 National League pennant for the New York Giants. A walk-off home run over the fence is an exception to baseball&apos;s one run rule. Normally if the home team is tied or behind in the ninth or extra innings the game ends as soon as the home team scores enough runs to achieve a lead. If the home team has two outs in the inning, the game will officially end either the moment the batter successfully reaches 1st base or the moment the runner touches home plate - whichever happens last. However, this is superseded by the &quot; ground rule &quot;, which provides automatic doubles (when a ball-in-play hits the ground first then leaves the playing field) and homeruns (when a ball-in-play leaves the playing field without ever touching the ground). In the latter case, all base runners including the batter are allowed to cross the plate. [ Lead-off home run ] A lead-off home run is a home run hit by the first batter of a team, the leadoff hitter of the first inning of the game. In MLB, Rickey Henderson holds the record with 81 leadoff home runs. Craig Biggio holds the National League record with 53. Although third all-time in the National League, Alfonso Soriano is second all-time in the Major Leagues, and first among active players. [ Back-to-back ] When two consecutive batters each hit a home run, this is described as back-to-back home runs. It is still considered back-to-back even if both batters hit their home runs off different pitchers. A third batter hitting a home run is commonly referred to as back-to-back-to-back, the most recent occurrence was on May 26th, 2012, when Nelson Cruz, Yorvit Torrealba and Mitch Moreland of the Texas Rangers hit back-to-back-to-back home runs off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Henderson Alvarez in the bottom of the sixth inning. On May 10, 2012, Ryan Flaherty, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis of the Baltimore Orioles hit three in a row against Colby Lewis of the Texas Rangers in the bottom of the first inning. On April 15, 2006, in the bottom of the sixth inning, the Oakland Athletics were trailing the Texas Rangers 4-2 when Eric Chavez, Milton Bradley, and Frank Thomas hit back-to-back-to-back home runs off of Texas Rangers&apos; pitcher Vicente Padilla on three consecutive pitches. Oakland went on to win the game 5-4. Four home runs in a row by consecutive batters has only occurred seven times in the history of Major League Baseball. Following convention, this is called back-to-back-to-back-to-back. The most recent occurrence was on August 11, 2010, when the Arizona Diamondbacks hit four in a row against the Milwaukee Brewers in Miller Park as Adam LaRoche, Miguel Montero, Mark Reynolds and Stephen Drew homered off pitcher Dave Bush. Bush became the third pitcher to surrender back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs, following Paul Foytack on July 31, 1963 and Chase Wright on April 22, 2007. On April 22, 2007 the Boston Red Sox were trailing the New York Yankees 3–0 when Manny Ramirez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell and Jason Varitek hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to put them up 4–3. They eventually went on to win the game 7–6 after a three-run home run by Mike Lowell in the bottom of the 7th inning. On September 18, 2006 trailing 9–5 to the San Diego Padres in the 9th inning, Jeff Kent, J. D. Drew, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to tie the game. After giving up a run in the top of the 10th, the Dodgers won the game in the bottom of the 10th, on a walk-off two run home run by Nomar Garciaparra. J. D. Drew has been part of two different sets of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs. In both occurrences, his homer was the second of the four. On September 30, 1997, in the sixth inning of Game One of the American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians, Tim Raines, Derek Jeter and Paul O&apos;Neill hit back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Yankees. Raines&apos; home run tied the game. New York went on to win 8–6. This was the first occurrence of three home runs in a row ever in postseason play. The Boston Red Sox repeated the feat in Game Four of the 2007 American League Championship Series, also against the Indians. Simple back-to-back home runs are a relatively frequent occurrence. If a pitcher gives up a homer, he might have his concentration broken and might alter his normal approach in an attempt to &quot; make up for it &quot; by striking out the next batter with some fastballs. Sometimes the next batter will be expecting that and will capitalize on it. A notable back-to-back home run of that type in World Series play involved &quot; Babe Ruth&apos;s called shot &quot; in 1932, which was accompanied by various Ruthian theatrics, yet the pitcher, Charlie Root, was allowed to stay in the game. He delivered just one more pitch, which Lou Gehrig drilled out of the park for a back-to-back shot, after which Root was removed from the game. In Game 3 of the 1976 NLCS, George Foster and Johnny Bench hit back-to-back homers in the last of the ninth off Ron Reed to tie the game. The Series-winning run was scored later in the inning. Another notable pair of back-to-back home runs occurred on September 14, 1990, when Ken Griffey, Sr. and Ken Griffey, Jr. hit back-to-back home runs, off Kirk McCaskill, the only father-and-son duo to do so in Major League history. On May 2, 2002, Bret Boone and Mike Cameron of the Seattle Mariners hit back-to-back home runs off of starter Jon Rauch in the first inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox. The Mariners batted around in the inning, and Boone and Cameron came up to bat against reliever Jim Parque with two outs, again hitting back-to-back home runs and becoming the only pair of teammates to hit back-to-back home runs twice in the same inning. [ http://espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId%3D220502104 Seattle Mariners vs. Chicago White Sox – Box Score – May 02, 2002 ESPN May 2, 2001 July 16, 2011 ] Likewise, individuals hitting home runs in consecutive at-bats is not unusual, but three or more is rare. The record for consecutive home runs by a batter under any circumstances is 4. Of the sixteen players (through 2012) who have hit 4 in one game, six have hit them consecutively. Twenty-eight other batters have hit four consecutive across two games. Bases on balls do not count as at-bats, and Ted Williams holds the record for consecutive home runs across the most games, 4 in four games played, during September 17–22, 1957, for the Red Sox. [ http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y%3D1957%26amp%3Bt%3DBOS 1957 Boston Red Sox Schedule Baseball Almanac July 16, 2011 http://web.archive.org/web/20090309041457/http%3A//www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y%3D1957%26amp%3Bt%3DBOS March 9, 2011 ] Williams hit a pinch-hit homer on the 17th; walked as a pinch-hitter on the 18th; there was no game on the 19th; hit another pinch-homer on the 20th; homered and then was lifted for a pinch-runner after at least one walk, on the 21st; and homered after at least one walk on the 22nd. All in all, he had 4 walks interspersed among his 4 homers. In World Series play, Reggie Jackson hit a record three in one Series game, the final game (Game 6) in 1977. But those three were a part of a much more impressive feat. He walked on four pitches in the second inning of game 6. Then he hit his three home runs on the first pitch of his next three at bats. He had also hit one in his last at bat of the previous game, giving him four home runs on four consecutive swings. (His home run in game 5 was also hit on the first pitch, although this did not add to any significant streak.) The four in a row set the record for consecutive homers across two Series games. In Game 3 of the World Series in 2011, Albert Pujols hit three home runs to tie the record with Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson. The St. Louis Cardinals went on to win the World Series in Game 7 at Busch Stadium. Nomar Garciaparra holds the record for consecutive home runs in the shortest time in terms of innings: 3 homers in 2 innings, on July 23, 2002, for the Boston Red Sox. [ Home run cycle ] [ Hitting for the cycle ] An offshoot of hitting for the cycle, a &quot; home run cycle &quot; is where a player hits a solo, 2-run, 3-run, and grand slam home run all in one game. This is an extremely rare feat, as it requires the batter to not only hit four home runs in a game (which itself has only occurred 16 times in the Major Leagues { The Official Site of Major League Baseball: History: Rare Feats } ), but also to hit those home runs with the specific number of runners already on base. Although it is a rare accomplishment, it is largely dependent on circumstances outside the player&apos;s control, such as his preceding teammates&apos; ability to get on base, as well as the order in which he comes to bat in any particular inning. Another variant of the home run cycle would be the &quot; natural home run cycle &quot;, which would require a batter to hit a solo, 2-run, 3-run, and grand slam home run in that order. Though multiple home run cycles have been recorded in collegiate baseball, [ http://www.stolaf.edu/offices/communications/magazine/2004spring/BigLeagueOles.pdf#search%3D%22%22home%20run%20cycle%22%20college%22 St. Olaf Magazine (St. Olaf College) Big-League Oles May 2004 July 16, 2011 http://web.archive.org/web/20090303235640/http%3A//www.stolaf.edu/offices/communications/magazine/2004spring/BigLeagueOles.pdf March 3, 2009 ] [ http://www.baseballnews.com/allamericans/archives/1999/allamericans1999.htm Collegiate Baseball Newspaper, Inc. &quot; Louisville Slugger&apos;s &quot; All-American Baseball Teams May 28, 1999 ] the only home run cycle in a professional baseball game belongs to Tyrone Horne, who stroked four long balls for the minor league, Double-A Arkansas Travelers in a game against the San Antonio Missions on July 27, 1998.

In the fifth inning of a game against the Pawtucket Red Sox, Indianapolis players hit for a &quot; Homer Cycle &quot;. Pete Rose, Jr. opened the inning with a solo home run, Jason Williams connected for a 3–run shot, Glenn Murray slugged a grand slam, and Guillermo Garcia finished the scoring with a 2–run blast. The Indians won the game 11–4. [ 1998_Major_League_Baseball_season#April-June 1998 Major League Baseball season Wikipedia July 16, 2011 http://web.archive.org/web/20101104033041/http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Major_League_Baseball_season November 4, 2010 ] A major league player has come close to hitting for the home run cycle many times. On April 2, 1997, Tino Martinez, first baseman of the New York Yankees, was a grand slam away from accomplishing this feat in a 16–2 victory over his former team, the Seattle Mariners. He hit a 3-run home run in the 1st inning, a 2-run home run in the 3rd and a solo shot in the 5th; all off starting pitcher Scott Sanders. He would get four more plate appearances that night, three of which came with the bases loaded. He grounded out with the bases loaded in the 6th and singled with a man on in the 8th. In the 9th inning, he would come to bat twice with the bases loaded where he first walked and later struck out to end the inning. { April 2, 1997 New York Yankees at Seattle Mariners Box Score and Play by Play – Baseball-Reference.com Baseball-Reference.com } On April 26, 2005 Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit 3 home runs off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Bartolo Colón. { Los Angeles Angels/New York Yankees Box Score Tuesday April 26, 2005 Yahoo Sports, April 26, 2005 } Rodriguez hit a 3-run home run, 2-run home run, and a grand slam in the first, third, and fourth innings, respectively. He later, in the bottom of the eighth inning, just missed a solo home run, lining out to Jeff DaVanon in deep center field. { Los Angeles Angels/New York Yankees Play by Play Tuesday April 26, 2005 Yahoo Sports, April 26, 2005 } On May 16, 2008 Jayson Werth of the Philadelphia Phillies hit 3 home runs off Toronto Blue Jays pitchers David Purcey and Jesse Litsch. Werth hit a 3-run home run, a grand slam, and a solo home run in the second, third, and fifth innings, respectively. { Toronto Blue Jays vs. Philadelphia Phillies – Play By Play – May 16, 2008 – ESPN ESPN.com, May 16, 2008 } On June 26, 2009, Andre Ethier of Los Angeles Dodgers also came close to hitting for the home run cycle when he hit a three-run home run off Jason Vargas in the second, a two-run home run off Roy Corcoran in the sixth, and a solo home run off Miguel Batista in the eighth inning in a Dodger home game against Seattle Mariners. { Seattle Mariners vs. Los Angeles Dodgers – Play By Play – June 26, 2009 – ESPN ESPN.com, June 26, 2009 } On July 7, 2009, Chicago White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko came within a three-run home run of hitting the home run cycle. He hit a solo home run in the second inning off Cleveland Indians pitcher Jeremy Sowers, a grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever Chris Perez, and a two-run home run in the seventh inning off reliever Winston Abreu. { Cleveland Indians vs. Chicago White Sox – Play By Play – July 7, 2009 – ESPN ESPN.com, July 7, 2009 } On August 1, 2009, Andrew McCutchen, center fielder of the Pittsburgh Pirates, hit a solo home run in the first inning, a two run home run in the fourth inning, and a three run home run in the sixth inning of a game against the Washington Nationals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He had one final at bat in the game. Had he hit a grand slam in his final at bat, McCutchen would have been the only major league player in history to hit for the natural home run cycle  — a solo home run first, a two run home run second, a three run home run third and a grand slam fourth. On September 17, 2010, Shin-Soo Choo, right fielder for the Cleveland Indians, hit three home runs in an away game against the Kansas City Royals. Choo hit a 2-run homer 420  ft to right in the top of the 4th inning. In Choo&apos;s next at bat, in the top of the 6th, he hit a towering grand slam to deep center. In the top of the 8th Choo hit a 405  ft solo homer over the right field wall. In the top of the 9th, the Indians had two men on at 1st and 2nd with Choo waiting on deck, when Asdrubal Cabrera grounded out to first to end the inning. With the Indians leading 11–4, the Royals went out 1–2–3 to end the game. { http://boards.espn.go.com/boards/mb/mb?sport=mlb &amp; id=cle } Graph depicting the yearly number of home runs per MLB game (blue line) [ History of the home run ] In the early days of the game, when the ball was less lively and the ballparks generally had very large outfields, most home runs were of the inside-the-park variety. The first home run ever hit in the National League was by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the Chicago Cubs ), in 1876. The home &quot; run &quot; was literally descriptive. Home runs over the fence were rare, and only in ballparks where a fence was fairly close. Hitters were discouraged from trying to hit home runs, with the conventional wisdom being that if they tried to do so they would simply fly out. This was a serious concern in the 19th century, because in baseball&apos;s early days a ball caught after one bounce was still an out. The emphasis was on place-hitting and what is now called &quot; manufacturing runs &quot; or &quot; small ball &quot;. The home run&apos;s place in baseball changed dramatically when the live-ball era began after World War I. First, the materials and manufacturing processes improved significantly, making the ball somewhat more lively. Batters such as Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby took full advantage of rules changes that were instituted during the 1920s, particularly prohibition of the spitball, and the requirement that balls be replaced when worn or dirty. Along with the baseball being easier to see and capable of being hit farther, as the game&apos;s popularity boomed more outfield seating was built, shrinking the size of the outfield and increasing the chances of a long fly ball resulting in a home run. The teams with the sluggers, typified by the New York Yankees, became the championship teams, and other teams had to change their focus from the &quot; inside game &quot; to the &quot; power game &quot; in order to keep up. Prior to 1931, a ball that bounced over an outfield fence during a major league game was considered a home run. The rule was changed to require the ball to clear the fence on the fly, and balls that reached the seats on a bounce became ground rule double s in most parks. A carryover of the old rule is that if a player deflects a ball over the outfield fence without it touching the ground, it is a home run. Polo Grounds left field foul line with guide rope, as seen from upper deck Also, until approximately that time, the ball had to not only go over the fence in fair territory, but to land in the bleacher s in fair territory or to still be visibly fair when disappearing behind a wall. The rule stipulated &quot; fair when last seen &quot; by the umpires. Photos from that era in ballparks, such as the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium, show ropes strung from the foul poles to the back of the bleachers, or a second &quot; foul pole &quot; at the back of the bleachers, in a straight line with the foul line, as a visual aid for the umpire. Ballparks still use a visual aid much like the ropes; a net or screen attached to the foul poles on the fair side has replaced ropes. As with American football, where a touchdown once required a literal &quot; touch down &quot; of the ball in the end zone but now only requires the &quot; breaking of the [vertical] plane &quot; of the goal line, in baseball the ball need only &quot; break the plane &quot; of the fence in fair territory (unless the ball is caught by a player who is in play, in which case the batter is called out). Babe Ruth &apos;s 60th home run in 1927 was somewhat controversial, because it landed barely in fair territory in the stands down the right field line. Ruth lost a number of home runs in his career due to the when-last-seen rule. Bill Jenkinson, in The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs, estimates that Ruth lost at least 50 and as many as 78 in his career due to this rule. Further, the rules once stipulated that an over-the-fence home run in a sudden-victory situation would only count for as many bases as was necessary to &quot; force &quot; the winning run home. For example, if a team trailed by two runs with the bases loaded, and the batter hit a fair ball over the fence, it only counted as a triple, because the runner immediately ahead of him had technically already scored the game-winning run. That rule was changed in the 1920s as home runs became increasingly frequent and popular. Babe Ruth&apos;s career total of 714 would have been one higher had that rule not been in effect in the early part of his career. Major League Baseball keeps running totals of all-time home runs by team, including teams no longer active (prior to 1900) as well as by individual players. Gary Sheffield hit the 250,000th home run in MLB history with a grand slam on September 8, 2008. [ http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-09-09-tigers-athletics_N.htm USA Today Sheffield hits MLB&apos;s 250,000th HR as Tigers beat A&apos;s September 9, 2008 ] Sheffield had hit MLB&apos;s 249,999th home run against Gonzalez in his previous at-bat. The all-time, verified professional baseball record for home runs for one player, excluding the U. S. Negro Leagues during the era of segregation, is held by Sadaharu Oh. Oh spent his entire career playing for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan&apos;s Nippon Professional Baseball, later managing the Giants, the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks and the 2006 World Baseball Classic Japanese team. Oh holds the all-time home run world record, having hit 868 home runs in his career. In Major League Baseball, the record is 762, held by Barry Bonds, who broke Hank Aaron&apos;s record on August 7, 2007, when he hit his 756th home run at AT &amp; T Park off pitcher Mike Bacsik. Only seven other major league players have hit as many as 600: Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714), Willie Mays (660), Ken Griffey, Jr. (630), Sammy Sosa (609), as well as active players Jim Thome (604) and Alex Rodriguez (631). The single season record is 73, set by Barry Bonds in 2001. Negro League slugger Josh Gibson &apos;s Baseball Hall of Fame plaque says he hit &quot; almost 800 &quot; home runs in his career. The Guinness Book of World Records lists Gibson&apos;s lifetime home run total at 800. Gibson&apos;s true total is not known, in part due to inconsistent record keeping in the Negro Leagues. The 1993 edition of the MacMillan Baseball Encyclopedia attempted to compile a set of Negro League records, and subsequent work has expanded on that effort. Those records demonstrate that Gibson and Ruth were of comparable power. The 1993 book had Gibson hitting 146 home runs in the 501 &quot; official &quot; Negro League games they were able to account for in his 17-year career, about 1 homer every 3.4 games. Babe Ruth, in 22 seasons (several of them in the dead-ball era ), hit 714 in 2503 games, or 1 homer every 3.5 games. The large gap in the numbers for Gibson reflect the fact that Negro League clubs played relatively far fewer league games and many more &quot; barnstorming &quot; or exhibition games during the course of a season, than did the major league clubs of that era. Other legendary home run hitters include Jimmie Foxx, Mel Ott, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle (who on September 10, 1960, mythically hit &quot; the longest home run ever &quot; at an estimated distance of [ 643 ft m 0 ], although this was measured after the ball stopped rolling { http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/art_hr.shtml } ), Reggie Jackson, Harmon Killebrew, Ernie Banks, Mike Schmidt, Dave Kingman, Sammy Sosa (who hit 60 or more home runs in a season 3 times), Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey, Jr. and Eddie Mathews. The longest verifiable home run distance is about [ 575 ft m 0 ], by Babe Ruth, to straightaway center field at Tiger Stadium (then called Navin Field and prior to the double-deck), which landed nearly across the intersection of Trumbull and Cherry. The location of where Hank Aaron&apos;s record 755th home run landed has been monumented in Milwaukee. { http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070607 &amp; content_id=2011893 &amp; vkey=news_mil &amp; fext=.jsp &amp; c_id=mil } The hallowed spot sits outside Miller Park, where the Milwaukee Brewers currently play. Similarly, the point where Aaron&apos;s 715th homer landed, upon breaking Ruth&apos;s career record in 1974, is marked in the Turner Field parking lot. [ Home run slang ] Slang terms for home runs include: blast, bomb, circuit clout, &quot; dialing 9 for long distance &quot;, dinger, ding-dong, dong, donger, four-bagger, four-base knock, goner, gonzo, gopher ball, homer, jack, long ball, moonshot, quadruple, round-tripper, shot, slam, swat, tape-measure shot, tater, wallop, and yahtzee. The act of hitting a home run can be called going deep or going yard or going home; additionally, with men on base, it can be called clearing the table. Home runs hit to the highest-level stands are upper-deckers. A comparatively long home run can be described as Ruthian, named after Babe Ruth &apos;s legendary drives. Babe Ruth himself was often referred to as &quot; The Sultan of Swat &quot;, a nickname earned due to the number of home runs which he hit. The act of attempting to hit a home run, whether successful or not, can also be termed swinging for the fences or going downtown. A game with many home runs in it can be referred to as a slugfest or home run derby. A grand slam is often referred to as a grand salami. If more than one grand slam occurs, a game may be referred to as a salamifest. With the increase of Latin American players a home run is also being called the whole enchilada, or as Kenny Mayne described it, jonrón, the Spanish pronunciation of the word home run. [ Instant replay ] [ Instant replay Instant replay in baseball ] Replays &quot; to get the call right &quot; have been used extremely sporadically in the past, but the use of instant replay to determine &quot; boundary calls &quot;  – home runs and foul balls  – was not officially allowed until 2008. In a game on May 31, 1999, involving the St. Louis Cardinals and Florida Marlins, a hit by Cliff Floyd of the Marlins was initially ruled a double, then a home run, then was changed back to a double when umpire Frank Pulli decided to review video of the play. The Marlins protested that video replay was not allowed, but while the National League office agreed that replay was not to be used in future games, it declined the protest on the grounds it was a judgment call, and the play stood. [ http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1999/05/31/cardinals_marlins/ Rule reversal June 1, 1999 Associated Press CNNSI.com ] [ http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/04/sports/sp-44230 Marlins&apos; &apos;Replay&apos; Protest Denied June 4, 1999 Associated Press Los Angeles Times ] In November 2007, the general managers of Major League Baseball voted in favor of implementing instant replay reviews on boundary home run calls. { ESPN – GMs vote 25–5 to use replay to aid home run decisions – MLB } The proposal limited the use of instant replay to determining whether a boundary/home run call is: A fair (home run) or foul ball A live ball (ball hit fence and rebounded onto the field), ground rule double (ball hit fence before leaving the field), or home run (ball hit some object beyond the fence while in flight ) Spectator interference or home run (spectator touched ball after it broke the plane of the fence). On August 28, 2008, instant replay review became available in MLB for reviewing calls in accordance with the above proposal. It was first utilized on September 3, 2008 in a game between the New York Yankees and the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. [ http://mlb.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd%3D20080903%26amp%3Bcontent_id%3D3412731%26amp%3Bvkey%3Drecap%26amp%3Bfext%3D.jsp%26amp%3Bc_id%3Dnyy Instant message: Yanks not done Replay used on A-Rod&apos;s homer in Bombers&apos; must-win vs. Rays Hoch Bryan September 4, 2008 MLB.com May 22, 2011 ] Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees hit what appeared to be a home run, but the ball hit a catwalk behind the foul pole. It was at first called a home run, until Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon argued the call, and the umpires decided to review the play. After 2 minutes and 15 seconds, the umpires came back and ruled it a home run. About two weeks later, on September 19, also at Tropicana Field, a boundary call was overturned for the first time. In this case, Carlos Peña of the Rays was given a ground rule double in a game against the Minnesota Twins after an umpire believed a fan reached into the field of play to catch a fly ball in right field. The umpires reviewed the play, determined the fan did not reach over the fence, and reversed the call, awarding Peña a home run. Aside from the two aforementioned reviews at Tampa Bay, replay was used four more times in the 2008 MLB regular season: twice at Houston, once at Seattle, and once at San Francisco. The San Francisco incident is perhaps the most unusual. Bengie Molina, the Giants&apos; catcher, hit what was first called a single. Molina then was replaced in the game by Emmanuel Burriss, a pinch-runner, before the umpires re-evaluated the call and ruled it a home run. In this instance though, Molina was not allowed to return to the game to complete the run, as he had already been replaced. Molina was credited with the home run, and two RBIs, but not for the run scored which went to Burriss instead. On October 31, 2009, in the fourth inning of Game 3 of the World Series, Alex Rodriguez hit a long fly ball that appeared to hit a camera protruding over the wall and into the field of play in deep left field. The ball ricocheted off the camera and re-entered the field, initially ruled a double. However, after the umpires consulted with each other after watching the instant replay, the hit was ruled a home run, marking the first time an instant replay home run was hit in a playoff game.
