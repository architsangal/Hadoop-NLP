The name is derived from the Latin for wheel (rota) and axle (axis). The two components of a rotaxane are kinetically trapped since the ends of the dumbbell (often called stoppers) are larger than the internal diameter of the ring and prevent disassociation (unthreading) of the components since this would require significant distortion of the covalent bonds. Much of the research concerning rotaxanes and other mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures, such as catenane s, has been focused on their efficient synthesis. However, examples of rotaxane have been found in biological systems including: cystine knot peptides, cyclotide s or lasso-peptides such as microcin J25 are protein, and a variety of peptides with rotaxane substructure. [ Synthesis ] The earliest reported synthesis of a rotaxane in 1967 relied on the statistical probability that if two halves of a dumbbell-shaped molecule were reacted in the presence of a macrocycle that some small percentage would connect through the ring. [ I. T. Harrison and S. Harrison Synthesis of a stable complex of a macrocycle and a threaded chain 1967 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89 22 5723–5724 10.1021/ja00998a052 ] To obtain a reasonable quantity of rotaxane, the macrocycle was attached to a solid-phase support and treated with both halves of the dumbbell 70 times and then severed from the support to give a 6% yield. However, the synthesis of rotaxanes has advanced significantly and efficient yields can be obtained by preorganizing the components utilizing hydrogen bond ing, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, covalent bond s, or coulombic interaction s. The three most common strategies to synthesize rotaxane are &quot; capping &quot;, &quot; clipping &quot;, and &quot; slipping &quot;, [ F. Aricó, J. D. Badjic, S. J. Cantrill, A. H. Flood, K. C.-F. Leung, Y. Liu, and J. F. Stoddart Templated Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules 2005 Topics in Current Chemistry 249 203–259 10.1007/b104330 ] though others do exist. [ I. Yoon, M. Narita, T.

Am. Chem. Soc. 129 11950–11963 10.1021/ja073513f 17845039 39 ] [ Capping ] Rotaxane synthesis can be carried out via a &quot; capping, &quot; &quot; clipping, &quot; slipping &quot; or &quot; active template &quot; mechanism Synthesis via the capping method relies strongly upon a thermodynamically driven template effect; that is, the &quot; thread &quot; is held within the &quot; macrocycle &quot; by non-covalent interactions. This dynamic complex or pseudorotaxane is then converted to the rotaxane by reacting the ends of the threaded guest with large groups, preventing disassociation. [ Clipping ] The clipping method is similar to the capping reaction except that in this case the dumbbell shaped molecule is complete and is bound to a partial macrocyle. The partial macrocycle then undergoes a ring closing reaction around the dumbbell-shaped molecule, forming the rotaxane. [ Slipping ] The method of slipping is one which exploits the kinetic stability of the rotaxane. If the end groups of the dumbbell are an appropriate size it will be able to reversibly thread through the macrocycle at higher temperatures. By cooling the dynamic complex, it becomes kinetically trapped as a rotaxane at the lower temperature. [ &quot; Active template &quot; methodology ] Leigh et al. recently began to explore a strategy in which template ions could also play an active role in promoting the crucial final covalent bond forming reaction that captures the interlocked structure (i.e., the metal has a dual function, acting as a template for entwining the precursors and catalyzing covalent bond formation between thereactants).

Res. 31 10 611–619 10.1021/ar960263r ] These molecular machines are usually based on the movement of macrocycle on the dumbbell. The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as molecular switch with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical [ F. Coutrot, E. Busseron A New Glycorotaxane Molecular Machine Based on an Anilinium and a Triazolium Station 2008 Chem. Eur.

In this case, the 4 C 1 or 1 C 4 chair-like conformation of the manno pyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. [ F. Coutrot, E.

These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controlable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines. [ C. Romuald, A. Arda, C. Clavel, J.

More reactive squaraine dye s have also been shown to have enhanced stability by preventing nucleophilic attack of the inner squaraine moiety. [ E. Arunkumar, C. C. Forbes, B. C. Noll, and B. D. Smith Squaraine-Derived Rotaxanes: Sterically Protected Fluorescent Near-IR Dyes 2005 J. Am. Chem.

[ Nanorecording ] In a nanorecording application, [ M. Feng, X. Guo, X. Lin, X. He, W. Ji, S. Du, D. Zhang, D. Zhu, and H. Gao Stable, Reproducible Nanorecording on Rotaxane Thin Films 2005 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 127 44 15338–15339 10.1021/ja054836j 16262375 ] a certain rotaxane is deposited as a Langmuir-Blodgett film on ITO -coated glass. When a positive voltage is applied with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to a different part of the dumbbell and the resulting new conformation makes the molecules stick out 0.3 nanometer from the surface. This height difference is sufficient for a memory dot. It is not yet known how to erase such a nanorecording film. [ Nomenclature ] Accepted nomenclature is to designate the number of components of the rotaxane in brackets as a prefix. { E. S. Wilks Macromolecular Nomenclature Note No. 24 } Therefore the graphical representation of rotaxane displayed above would be a [2]rotaxane as it consists of a single dumbbell and a single macrocycle.
