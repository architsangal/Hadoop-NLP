The road forms part of the unsigned Euroroutes E24 and E30. Prior to the completion of the M6 motorway in 1971 and the opening of the A1-M1 Link road in 1994 traffic would have used the A45 road. Until 1994 the A14 designation was used for a section of the Ermine Street between the A10 at Royston on the A10 and the A1 at Alconbury, most of which is now the A1198 road. [ Route ] From the Port of Felixstowe the road heads west, bypassing Ipswich to the south using the Orwell Bridge and on to Stowmarket, Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and Cambridge where it meets the M11. From Cambridge there is a very busy section past St Ives, Huntingdon and the junction with the A1. From there through Kettering ending at the M1. The entire road is a dual carriageway with two lanes each way, except for a dual three-lane section on the Newmarket bypass (between Junctions 36 and 38) where this road runs concurrent with the A11 and a short stretch between the Girton Interchange and Bar Hill is also dual three-lane. The road is heavily used by truck s carrying freight from the Port of Felixstowe (Britain&apos;s busiest container port) and the Midlands, North West and Ireland. There are three at-grade junctions along the road: with the B663 at Bythorn in Cambridgeshire (junction 15); at the Leighton Bromswold turn a few miles to the east (junction 17); and at the Dockspur Roundabout at the edge of Felixstowe (junction 60). [ History ] { Needham Market. } Prior to the construction of the current A14 road the main route from the Birmingham to the Haven ports followed the old A45 road route via Coventry, Rugby, Northampton, St Neots, Cambridge and then through all the towns on the current route A14 from there to Felixstowe. Prior to its use for the current route the A14 designation had been used for a section of road between the A10 at Royston and the A1 at Alconbury following part of the route of Ermine Street which is now most designated as the A1198 road. The M45 motorway was constructed in 1959 parallel to part of the old A45 route in the Midlands and opened on the same day as the M1 motorway and was soon one of the busiest sections of motorway. The M6 opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s after which more traffic to the ports used a route from junction 1 of the M6 via the A427 road to Market Harborough followed by a short section of the A6 road to Kettering and then the A604 to Cambridge before joining the old A45 to the ports as above. { The Hamlin Road Atlas of Great Britain - 1976 } The M45 now carries little traffic. The sections from Huntingdon east to the ports were upgraded first, starting with the Huntingdon bypass in 1973, followed by the Girton to Bar Hill section in 1975/76 and the Cambridge northern bypass and Cambridge/Newmarket section in 1976/77.

The section between Cambridge and Kettering used to be the A604 apart from a short section near Kettering that used to be part of the A6. The road which was known as the A14 until the late 1980s is now the A1198 between Royston, Hertfordshire and Godmanchester but, confusingly, retains its A14 designation north of Godmanchester until it meets the A1 road near Alconbury; thus forming a &apos;spur&apos; off the main A14.
