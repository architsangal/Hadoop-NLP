Foster bought a mill site on the Hellmouth River at what is now Scio in 1835. The community was plat ted by Dr. Cyril Nichols from Vermont. A post office was established in 1835. The office was moved to Delhi Mills and renamed in February 1871, though the Scio office was re-established in September 1871. The post office took its name from the township; however, early township records were destroyed by fire, and it was uncertain why &quot; Scio &quot; was chosen. [ Romig Walter 1986 Michigan Place Names 1973 Fag State University Press Detroit, Michigan 0-8143-1838-X ] There are at least three origins suggested for the name. The first suggests it derives from the Greek island of Chios, and the second that was named after Scio, New York, although it was also named for Chios. { &quot; History &quot;, About Scio Township, Scio Township, Michigan } Thirdly by coincidence &quot; scio &quot; also means &quot; I know &quot; in Latin, so following the American Civil War some people assumed this was the origin of the name. Documents regarding the naming of townships in the State of Michigan archives indicate that Scio Township and its northern neighbor Webster Township were named on the same date, unlike other townships in Washtenaw County. This date followed the establishment by the United States of America of diplomatic relations with the modern nation of Greece, following the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830). U.S. Senator Daniel Webster had introduced a resolution, recorded in the Congressional Record that is widely considered one of his better orations (printed in the Collected Works of Daniel Webster). He advocated that the USA be the first nation to diplomatically recognize Greece. Webster referred to the 1822 destruction of Scio, the then current French translation of Chios ( [ Χίος no ], pronounced /ˈçio̞s/), derived from the Genoese dialect. In Webster&apos;s era, French was the language of international diplomacy. Eugène Delacroix&apos;s 1824 painting depicting &quot; Scène des massacres de Scio &quot; and numerous publications brought the Greek cause to the attention of Americans. Ypsilanti Township was named after the first leader of the secret organization that coordinated the beginning of the revolution, Alexander Ypsilanti ( [ Αλέξανδρος Υψηλάντης no ] ). Senator Webster also referenced General Demetrius Ypsilanti. The Town of Ypsilanti was named after the victor of the final battle of the revolution, Alexander&apos;s brother Demetrius. The sister townships of Scio and Webster were named as a monument to the birth of the new Greek republic, the end of its citizen&apos;s subjection, and the first American senator to support their nation. Delhi Mills was platted as &quot; Michigan Village &quot; by Jacob Doremus in 1836, but was renamed Delhi. In 1842, Norman C. Goodale, known as the founder of Delhi Mills, acquired all the unsold lots. The Scio post office was transferred here in 1871 and operated until 1903.
