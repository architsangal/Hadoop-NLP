[ United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD Geneva, Switzerland Supachai Panitchpakdi Active 1964 United Nations ] The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was established in 1964 as a permanent intergovernmental body. It is the principal organ of the United Nations General Assembly dealing with trade, investment, and development issues. The organization&apos;s goals are to &quot; maximize the trade, investment and development opportunities of developing countries and assist them in their efforts to integrate into the world economy on an equitable basis. &quot; (from official website). The creation of the conference was based on concerns of developing countries over the international market, multi-national corporations, and great disparity between developed nations and developing nations. In the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD was closely associated with the idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO). The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established in 1964 in order to provide a forum where the developing countries could discuss the problems relating to their economic development. UNCTAD grew from the view that existing institutions like GATT (now replaced by the World Trade Organization, WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of developing countries. The primary objective of the UNCTAD is to formulate policies relating to all aspects of development including trade, aid, transport, finance and technology. The Conference ordinarily meets once in four years. The first conference took place in Geneva in 1964, second in New Delhi in 1968, the third in Santiago in 1972, fourth in Nairobi in 1976, the fifth in Manila in 1979, the sixth in Belgrade in 1983, the seventh in Geneva in 1987, the eighth in Cartagena in 1992 and the ninth at Johannesburg (South Africa)in 1996. The Conference has its permanent secretariat in Geneva. One of the principal achievements of UNCTAD has been to conceive and implement the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). It was argued in UNCTAD, that in order to promote exports of manufactured goods from developing countries, it would be necessary to offer special tariff concessions to such exports. Accepting this argument, the developed countries formulated the GSP Scheme under which manufacturers&apos; exports and some agricultural goods from the developing countries enter duty-free or at reduced rates in the developed countries. Since imports of such items from other developed countries are subject to the normal rates of duties, imports of the same items from developing countries would enjoy a competitive advantage. Currently, UNCTAD has 194 member States and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. UNCTAD has 400 staff members and an bi-annual (2010-2011) regular budget of $138 million in core budget expenditures and $72 million in extra-budgetary technical assistance funds. It is also a member of the United Nations Development Group. { http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 } [ Meetings ] The inter-governmental work is done at 5 levels of meetings: { UNCTAD } UNCTAD VIII in Cartagena, Colombia on 8–25 February 1992 UNCTAD IX in Midrand, South Africa on 27 April – 11 May 1996 UNCTAD X in Bangkok, Thailand on 12–19 February 2000 http://www.unctad-10.org/ UNCTAD XI in São Paulo, Brazil on 13–18 June 2004 http://www.unctadxi.org/ UNCTAD XII in Accra, Ghana on 21–25 April 2008 http://www.unctadxii.org/ UNCTAD XIII in Doha, Qatar on 21–26 April 2012 http://www.unctadxiii.org/ The UNCTAD Trade and Development Board – the Board manages the work of UNCTAD in between two Conferences and meets up to three times every year; Four UNCTAD Commissions and one Working Party – these meet more often than the Board in order to take up policy, programme and budgetary issues; Expert Meetings – the Commissions will convene expert meetings on selected topics in order to provide substantive and expert input for Commission policy discussions. [ Geneva, 1964 ] In response to developing country ( Least Developed Country, LDC) anxiety at their worsening position in world trade, the United Nations General Assembly voted for a &apos;one off&apos; conference. These early discussions paved the way for new IMF facilities to provide finance for shortfalls in commodity earnings, and for the Generalised Preference Schemes which increased access to Northern markets for manufactured imports from the South. At Geneva, the Idcs were successful in their proposal for the conference with its Secretariat to become a permanent organ of the UN, with meetings every four years.

While the first conference was held in Geneva in 1964, the second conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for schemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus inpersuading the North to follow up UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing generalised preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was raised to 1% of the North&apos;s GNP, but the developed countries failed to commit themselves to achieving the target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at UNCTAD conferences. The conference also led to the International Sugar Agreement, which seeks to stabilise world sugar prices.

Discussion centred on the international monetary system, and specifically on the South&apos;s proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the socalled &apos;link&apos;). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement both over the SDR proposal and between those within G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South&apos;s favour at the IMF, and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the Group&apos;s negotiating position, and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the &apos;link&apos; or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.

An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper of April 1979 highlights one reason for success as being down to the 1973 Oil Crisis and the encouragement of LDCs to make gains through producers of other commodities. The principal result of the conference was the adoption of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. The programme covered the principal commodity exports and its objectives aside from the stabilisation of commodity prices were: &apos;Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world inflation&apos;, the expansion of processing, distribution and control of technology by LDCs and improved access to markets.

An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper written in 1979 focuses its attention on the key issues regarding the LDCs` role as the Group of 77 in the international community.

The key issues of the time were finance and adjustment, commodity price stabilisation and trade.
