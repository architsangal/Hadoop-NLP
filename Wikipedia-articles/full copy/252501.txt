Pinchback, however, refused to support Packard and endorsed Nicholls.

Foster 100px May 10, 1892 May 8, 1900 Democratic Foster&apos;s 1896 reelection was characterized by widespread voting fraud which benefited his candidacy. A temporarilly rejuvenated Republican Party united with the Populists behind the candidacy of John N. Pharr and likely won more than the 43 percent attributed to Pharr in the official returns. Foster quickly maneuvered to adopt the state constitution of 1898, which effectively disenfranchised Blacks and induced several decades of one-party Democratic control via White primaries, the winning of which was tantamount to election.
