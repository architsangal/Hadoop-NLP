Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, a mantle, and arms. Squid, like cuttlefish, have eight arms arranged in pairs and two, usually longer, tentacle s. Squid are strong swimmers and certain species can &apos;fly&apos; for short distances out of the water. { Jabr, F. 2010. Fact or Fiction: Can a Squid Fly Out of the Water? Scientific American, August 2, 2010. } [ Modification from ancestral forms ] Squid have differentiated from their ancestral mollusc s such that the body plan has been condensed antero-posteriorly and extended dorso-ventrally. What before may have been the foot of the ancestor is modified into a complex set of tentacles and highly developed sense organs, including advanced eyes similar to those of vertebrate s. The ancestral shell has been lost, with only an internal gladius, or pen, remaining. The pen is a feather-shaped internal structure that supports the squid&apos;s mantle and serves as a site for muscle attachment. It is made of a chitin -like material. [ Anatomy ] Composite diagram illustrating basic squid features (ventral aspect) The main body mass is enclosed in the mantle, which has a swimming fin along each side. These fins, unlike in other marine organisms, are not the main source of locomotion in most species. The skin is covered in chromatophore s, which enable the squid to change color to suit its surroundings, making it practically invisible. The underside is also almost always lighter than the topside, to provide camouflage from both prey and predator. Under the body are openings to the mantle cavity, which contains the gills (ctenidia) and openings to the excretory and reproductive system s. At the front of the mantle cavity lies the siphon, which the squid uses for locomotion via precise jet propulsion. In this form of locomotion, water is sucked into the mantle cavity and expelled out of the siphon in a fast, strong jet. The direction of the siphon can be changed, to suit the direction of travel. Inside the mantle cavity, beyond the siphon, lies the visceral mass, which is covered by a thin, membranous epidermis. Under this are all the major internal organs. [ Nervous system ] The giant axon, which may be up to 1  mm (0.04  inches) in diameter in some larger species, innervates the mantle and controls part of the jet propulsion system. As cephalopods, squid exhibit relatively high intelligence among invertebrates. For example, groups of Humboldt squid hunt cooperatively, using active communication. (See Cephalopod intelligence.) [ Reproductive system ] [ vertical 220 Onykia ingens with non-erect penis.jpg A dissected male specimen of Onykia ingens, showing a non-erect penis (the white tubular structure located below most of the other organs) Onykia ingens with erect penis.jpg A specimen of the same species exhibiting elongation of the penis to 67  cm in length ] In females the ink sac is hidden from view by a pair of white nidamental gland s, which lie anterior to the gills. There are also red-spotted accessory nidamental glands. Both organs are associated with food manufacture and shells for the eggs. Females also have a large translucent ovary, situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass. Males do not possess these organs, but instead have a large testis in place of the ovary, and a spermatophoric gland and sac. In mature males, this sac may contain spermatophore s, which are placed inside the female&apos;s mantle during mating. Shallow water species of the continental shelf and epipelagic / mesopelagic zones are characterised by the presence of hectocotyli, specially modified arms used to fertilise the female&apos;s eggs. { Arkhipkin, A.I. &amp; V.V. Laptikhovsky 2010. Observation of penis elongation in Onykia ingens: implications for spermatophore transfer in deep-water squid. Journal Molluscan Studies, published online on June 30, 2010. } [ 10.1093/mollus/eyq019 ] Most deep sea squid lack hectocotyli and have longer penis es; Ancistrocheiridae and Cranchiinae are exceptions. Giant squid of the genus Architeuthis are unusual in that they possess both a large penis and modified arm tips, although it is uncertain whether the latter are used for spermatophore transfer. Penis elongation has been observed in the deep water species Onykia ingens; when erect, the penis may be as long as the mantle, head and arms combined. { Walker, M. 2010. Super squid sex organ discovered. BBC Earth News, July 7, 2010. } As such, deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacle s. [ Digestive system ] Like all cephalopods, squid have complex digestive systems. The muscular stomach is found roughly in the midpoint of the visceral mass. From there, the bolus moves into the caecum for digestion. The caecum, a long, white organ, is found next to the ovary or testis. In mature squid, more priority is given to reproduction such that the stomach and caecum often shrivel up during the later life stages. Finally, food goes to the liver (or digestive gland), found at the siphon end, for absorption. Solid waste is passed out of the rectum. Beside the rectum is the ink sac, which allows a squid to rapidly discharge black ink into the mantle cavity. { Chtenopteryx sicula &apos;&apos; } { alt=Diagram labeling siphon, intestine, nidamental gland, accessory nidamental gland, renal pore, and branchial heart. } [ Cardiovascular system ] Squid have three heart s. Two branchial heart s feed the gills, each surrounding the larger systemic heart that pumps blood around the body. Squid blood contains the copper -rich protein hemocyanin for transporting oxygen. The faintly greenish hearts are surrounded by the renal sacs - the main excretory system. The kidney s are difficult to identify and stretch from the hearts (located at the posterior side of the ink sac) to the liver. The systemic heart is made of three chambers, a lower ventricle and two upper auricles. [ Head ] The head end bears 8 arms and 2 tentacles, each a form of muscular hydrostat containing many suckers along the edge. These tentacles do not grow back if severed. In the mature male, one basal half of the left ventral tentacle is hectocotylised — and ends in a copulatory pad rather than suckers. It is used for sexual intercourse. The mouth is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of chitin [ Clarke M.R. A Handbook for the Identification of Cephalopod Beaks 1986 Clarendon Press Oxford 0-19-857603-X ] and cross-linked proteins, and is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. [ Miserez A Li, Y; Waite, H; Zok, F 2007 Jumbo squid beaks: Inspiration for design of robust organic composites Acta Biomaterialia 3 1 139–149 10.1016/j.actbio.2006.09.004 17113369 ] Captured whale s often have indigestible squid beaks in their stomachs. The mouth contains the radula (the rough tongue common to all mollusc s except bivalvia ). The eyes, on either side of the head, each contain a hard lens. The image is focused by changing the position of the lens, as in a camera or telescope, rather than changing the shape of the lens, as in the human eye. Squid appear to have limited hearing.

Teuthida is the largest cephalopod order with around 300 species classified into 29 families. The order Teuthida is a member of the superorder Decapodiformes (from the Greek for &quot; ten legs &quot; ). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are taxonomically distinct from Teuthida and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the bobtail squid of order Sepiolida and the ram&apos;s horn squid of the monotypic order Spirulida. The vampire squid, however, is more closely related to the octopuses than to any squid.
