The platinum group metals (abbreviated as the PGMs; alternatively, the platinoids, platidises, platinum group, platinum metals or platinum group elements (PGEs)) is a term used sometimes to collectively refer to six metal lic elements clustered together in the periodic table.These elements are all transition metal s, lying in the d-block (groups 8, 9, and 10, periods 5 and 6 ). The six platinum group metals are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. They have similar physical and chemical properties, and tend to occur together in the same mineral deposits. [ The Canadian Mineralogist 1991 29 2 231 –237 Nomenclature of platinum-group-element alloys; review and revision D. C. Harris Cabri L. J. ] However they can be further subdivided into the iridium-group platinum group elements (IPGEs: Os, Ir, Ru) and the palladium-group platinum group elements (PPGEs: Rh, Pt, Pd) based on their behaviour in geological systems.

[ Discovery of the Elements 385 –407 Weeks, M. E. 1968 7 Journal of Chemical Education 0-8486-8579-2 23991202 ] Though the metal was used by pre-Columbian peoples, the first European reference to platinum appears in 1557 in the writings of the Italian humanist Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484–1558) as a description of a mysterious metal found in Central American mines between Darién (Panama) and Mexico ( &quot; up until now impossible to melt by any of the Spanish arts &quot; ). The Spaniards named the metal platina ( &quot; little silver &quot; ) when they first encountered it in Colombia. They regarded platinum as an unwanted impurity in the silver they were mining.

They are highly resistant to wear and tarnish, making platinum, in particular, well suited for fine jewelry. Other distinctive properties include resistance to chemical attack, excellent high-temperature characteristics, and stable electrical properties. All these properties have been exploited for industrial applications. [ L. B. Hunt Lever, F. M.

A naturally occurring platinum-iridium alloy, platiniridium, is found in the mineral cooperite (platinum sulfide, PtS). Platinum in a native state, often accompanied by small amounts of other platinum metals, is found in alluvial and placer deposits in Colombia, Ontario, the Ural Mountains, and in certain western American states. Platinum is also produced commercially as a by-product of nickel ore processing. The huge quantities of nickel ore processed makes up for the fact that platinum makes up only two parts per million of the ore. South Africa, with vast platinum ore deposits in the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld complex, is the world&apos;s largest producer of platinum, followed by Russia.

[ Osmium ] Iridiosmium is a naturally occurring alloy of iridium and osmium found in platinum-bearing river sands in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Trace amounts of osmium also exist in nickel-bearing ores found in the Sudbury, Ontario region along with other platinum group metals. Even though the quantity of platinum metals found in these ores is small, the large volume of nickel ores processed makes commercial recovery possible.

Naturally occurring iridium alloys include osmiridium and iridiosmium, both of which are mixtures of iridium and osmium. It is recovered commercially as a by-product from nickel mining and processing. [ Ruthenium ] Ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa. [ Rhodium ] The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex as the metal occurs in ores mixed with other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold. It is found in platinum ores and obtained free as a white inert metal which is very difficult to fuse. Principal sources of this element are located in river sands of the Ural Mountains, in North and South America and also in the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury Basin region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of nickel ore processed makes rhodium recovery cost effective. However, the annual world production in 2003 of this element is only 7 or 8   ton s and there are very few rhodium minerals.

However it is commercially produced from nickel- copper deposits found in South Africa and Ontario, Canada. The huge volume of nickel-copper ore processed makes this extraction profitable in spite of its low concentration in these ores. [ September 2009 ] [ Production ] The production of pure platinum group metals normally starts from residues of the production of other metals with a mixture of several of those metals. One typical starting product is the anode residue of gold (other fast refining methods used today), copper or nickel production. The differences in chemical reactivity and solubility of several compounds of the metals under extraction are used to separate them. A first step is to dissolve all the metals in aqua regia forming their respective Cl-complexes. If silver is present, this is then separated by forming insoluble silver chloride. Rhodium sulfate is separated after the salts have been melted together with sodium bisulfate and leached with water. The residue is then melted together with sodium peroxide, which dissolves all the metals and leaves the iridium. The two remaining metals, ruthenium and osmium, form ruthenium and osmium tetroxides after chlorine has been added to solution. The osmium tetroxide is then dissolved in alcoholic sodium hydroxide and separated from the ruthenium tetroxide s. All of these metals&apos; final chemical compounds can ultimately be reduced to the elemental metal using hydrogen.

Palladium has been of special interest due to its less complex behavior when compared to rhodium and ruthenium. The special interest in palladium may be also due to its widespread application in chemical catalysis and the electronics industry. Several research groups are exploring the possibility of recovering palladium by various methods like direct electrolysis of high-level liquid waste, [ 10.1016/j.electacta.2008.08.034 Studies on the feasibility of electrochemical recovery of palladium from high-level liquid waste 2009 Jayakumar, M Electrochimica Acta 54 1083 Venkatesan K Srinivasan T Rao P 3 ] [ 10.1007/s11137-005-0040-7 Palladium in Irradiated Fuel.
