Fluent in Spanish as well as in English, she has also recorded songs in at least six other languages. She is regarded as a folk singer, although her music has diversified since the 1960s, encompassing everything from folk rock and pop to country and gospel music. Although a songwriter herself, Baez is generally regarded as an interpreter of other people&apos;s work, having recorded songs by The Allman Brothers Band, The Beatles, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Violeta Parra, Woody Guthrie, The Rolling Stones, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Leonard Cohen, and many others.

She learned four chords, which enabled her to play rhythm and blues, the music she was listening to at the time. Her parents, however, were fearful that the music would lead her into a life of drug addiction. { Democracy Now, May 4, 2009 (transcript). Interview with Joan Baez, by } { Amy Goodman at Pete Seeger&apos;s 90th birthday celebration. } When she was 8, at her aunt&apos;s behest, Baez attended a concert by folk music ian Pete Seeger, and found herself strongly moved by his music. She soon began practicing the songs of his repertoire and performing them publicly. One of her very earliest public performances was at a retreat in Saratoga, California, for a youth group from Temple Beth Jacob, a Redwood City, California, congregation. In 1957, Baez bought her first Gibson acoustic guitar. [ College music scene in Massachusetts ] In 1958, her father accepted a faculty position at MIT, and moved his family to Massachusetts. At that time, it was within the center of the up-and-coming folk-music scene, and Baez began walking near home in Boston and nearby Cambridge. She also performed in clubs, and attended Boston University for about six weeks. In 1958, at the Club 47 in Cambridge, she gave her first concert. When designing the poster for the performance, Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl, the surname of her long-time mentor, Ira Sandperl or Maria from the song &quot; They Call the Wind Maria &quot;. She later opted against it, fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish. The audience consisted of her parents, her sister Mimi, and a small group of friends to a total of eight patrons. She was paid ten dollars. Baez was later asked back and began performing twice a week for $25 per show.

The three sang solos and duets, a family friend designed the album cover, and it was released on Veritas Records that same year as Folksingers &apos;Round Harvard Square. Baez later met Bob Gibson and Odetta, who was at the time one of the most prominent vocalists singing folk and gospel music. Baez cites Odetta as a primary influence along with Marian Anderson and Seeger. { Baez, Joan. And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009, p. 43 } Gibson invited Baez to perform with him at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival, where the two sang two duets, &quot; Virgin Mary Had One Son &quot; and &quot; We Are Crossing Jordan River &quot;.

The collection of traditional folk ballads, blues and lament s sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well. It featured many popular Child Ballads of the day, such as &quot; Mary Hamilton &quot; and was recorded in only four days in the ballroom of New York City&apos;s Manhattan Towers Hotel. The album also included &quot; El Preso Numero Nueve &quot;, a song sung entirely in Spanish. That same song later appeared on her Spanish-language album, Gracias a la Vida (1974). Her second release, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 (1961) went &quot; gold &quot;, as did Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1 (1962) and Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2 (1963). Like its immediate predecessor, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 contained strictly traditional material. Her two albums of live material, Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1 and its second counterpart, were unique in that, unlike most live albums, they contained only new songs, rather than established favorites. It was Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2 that featured Baez&apos;s first-ever Dylan cover. From the early-to-mid-1960s, Baez emerged at the forefront of the American roots revival, where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown Bob Dylan (the two became romantically involved in late 1962, remaining together through early 1965), and was emulated by artists such as Judy Collins, Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell and Bonnie Raitt. Though primarily an albums artist, several of Baez&apos; singles have charted and the first being her 1965 cover of Phil Ochs &apos; &quot; There but for Fortune &quot;, which became a mid-level chart hit in the U.S. and a top-ten single in the United Kingdom. Baez added other instruments to her recordings on Farewell, Angelina (1965), which features several Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare. Deciding to experiment after having exhausted the folksinger-with-guitar format, Baez turned to Peter Schickele, a classical music composer, who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums: Noël (1966), Joan (1967) and Baptism: A Journey Through Our Time (1968). Noël was a Christmas album of traditional material, while Baptism was akin to a concept album, featuring Baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as James Joyce, Federico García Lorca and Walt Whitman. In 1968, Baez traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, where a marathon recording session resulted in two albums. The first, Any Day Now (1968), consists exclusively of Dylan covers. The other, the country-music-infused David&apos;s Album (1969) was recorded for husband David Harris, a prominent anti- Vietnam War protester eventually imprisoned for draft resistance. Harris, a country-music fan, turned Baez toward more complex country-rock influences beginning with David&apos;s Album. Later in 1968, she published her first memoir, Daybreak (by Dial Press ). In 1969, her appearance at Woodstock in upstate New York afforded her an international musical and political podium, particularly upon the successful release of the documentary film Woodstock (1970). Beginning in the late 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, beginning with &quot; Sweet Sir Galahad &quot; and &quot; A Song For David &quot;, both songs appearing on her 1970 (I Live) One Day at a Time album; the former song was written about her sister Mimi&apos;s second marriage, while the later was a tribute to Harris. Baez&apos;s distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on popular music. She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest, singing and marching for human rights and peace. Baez came to be considered the &quot; most accomplished interpretive folksinger/songwriter of the 1960s. &quot; { Joan Baez. United States History. History.com. } Her appeal extended far beyond the folk-music audience. Of her fourteen Vanguard albums, thirteen made the top 100 of Billboard&apos;s mainstream pop chart, eleven made the top forty, eight made the top twenty, and four made the top ten. { Joan Baez: Charts and Awards, All Music, accessed 2011-12-01. } [ 1970s and the end of Vanguard years ] Baez playing in Hamburg, 1973 After eleven years with Vanguard, Baez decided in 1971 to cut ties with the label that had released her albums since 1960. She delivered them one last success with the gold-selling album Blessed Are... (1971) which spawned a top-ten hit in Robbie Robertson &apos;s &quot; The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down &quot;, her cover of The Band&apos;s signature song. With Come from the Shadows (1972), Baez switched to A &amp; M Records, where she remained for four years and six albums. Joan Baez wrote and performed &quot; The Story of Bangladesh &quot; at the Concert for Bangladesh, Madison Square Garden in 1971. This song was based on the Pakistan Army crackdown on unarmed sleeping Bengali students at Dhaka University on March 25, 1971, which ignited the prolonged nine-month Bangladesh Liberation War. { Avijit Roy, Joan Baez and our Liberation War, mukto-mona.com. } The song was later entitled &quot; The Song of Bangladesh &quot; and released in a 1972 album from Chandos Music. { Words and Music by Joan Baez, Song of Bangladesh, lyrics joanbaez.com. } During this period, in late 1971, she reunited with Schickele to record two tracks, &quot; Rejoice in the Sun &quot; and &quot; Silent Running &quot; for the science-fiction film, Silent Running. The two songs were issued as a single on Decca (32890). In addition, another LP was released on Decca (DL 7-9188), and was later reissued by Varese Sarabande on black (STV-81072) and green (VC-81072) vinyl. In 1998 a limited release on CD by the &quot; Valley Forge Record Groupe &quot; was released. Where Are You Now, My Son? (1973) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the B-side of the album. Half spoken word poem and half tape-recorded sounds, the song documented Baez&apos;s visit to Hanoi, North Vietnam, in December 1972, during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day long Christmas Bombings campaign over Hanoi and Haiphong. { Democracy Now, December 26, 2002 (audio).

Gracias a la Vida (1974) (the title song written and first performed by Chile an folk singer Violeta Parra ) followed and was a success in both the U.S. and Latin America. It included the song &quot; Cucurrucucú paloma &quot;. Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for Diamonds &amp; Rust (1975), the album became the highest selling of Baez&apos;s career and spawned a second top-ten single in the form of the title track. After Gulf Winds (1976), an album of entirely self-composed songs, and From Every Stage (1976), a live album that had Baez performing songs &quot; from every stage &quot; of her career, Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to CBS Records for Blowin&apos; Away (1977) and Honest Lullaby (1979). [ 1980s and 1990s ] In 1980, Baez was given honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees by Antioch University and Rutgers University for her political activism and the &quot; universality of her music &quot;. In 1983, she appeared on the Grammy Awards, performing Dylan&apos;s anthemic &quot; Blowin&apos; in the Wind &quot;, a song she first performed twenty years earlier. { Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, } { Carlos Santana, performing in May 1984, } { Hamburg. } Baez also played a significant role in the 1985 Live Aid concert for African famine relief, opening the U.S. segment of the show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She has toured on behalf of many other causes, including Amnesty International &apos;s 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope tour and a guest spot on their subsequent Human Rights Now! tour. Baez found herself without an American label for the release of Live Europe 83 (1984), which was released in Europe and Canada, but not released commercially in the U.S. She did not have an American release until the album Recently (1987) on Gold Castle Records. In 1987, Baez&apos;s second autobiography called And a Voice to Sing With was published and became a New York Times bestseller. That same year, she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for Israel and the Palestinians. In May 1989, Baez performed at a music festival in communist Czechoslovakia, called Bratislavská lýra. While there, she met future Czechoslovakian president Václav Havel, whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of Charter 77, a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing a cappella for the nearly four thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country&apos;s Velvet Revolution, the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated communist government there was overthrown. Baez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle, Speaking of Dreams, (1989) and Brothers in Arms (1991). She then landed a contract with a major label, Virgin Records, recording Play Me Backwards (1992) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by EMI. She then switched to Guardian, with whom she produced a live album, Ring Them Bells (1995), and a studio album, Gone from Danger (1997). In 1993, at the invitation of Refugees International and sponsored by the Soros Foundation, she traveled to the war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina region of then- Yugoslavia in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there. She was the first major artist to perform in Sarajevo since the outbreak of the Yugoslav civil war. In October of that year, Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on Alcatraz Island (a former U.S. federal prison ) in San Francisco, California, in a benefit for her sister Mimi&apos;s Bread and Roses organization. She later returned for another concert in 1996.

On October 1, 2005, she performed at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, at San Francisco&apos;s Golden Gate Park. Then, on January 13, 2006, Baez performed at the funeral of Lou Rawls, where she led Jesse Jackson, Sr., Wonder, and others in the singing of &quot; Amazing Grace &quot;. On June 6, 2006, Baez joined Bruce Springsteen on stage at his San Francisco concert, where the two performed the rolling anthem &quot; Pay Me My Money Down &quot;. In September 2006, Baez contributed a live, retooled version of her classic song &quot; Sweet Sir Galahad &quot; to a Starbucks &apos;s exclusive XM Artist Confidential album. In the new version, she changed the lyric &quot; here&apos;s to the dawn of their days &quot; to &quot; here&apos;s to the dawn of her days &quot;, as a tribute to her late sister Mimi, about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969. Later on, October 8, 2006, she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the Forum 2000 international conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Her performance was kept secret from former Czech Republic President Havel until the moment she appeared on stage. Havel was a great admirer of both Baez and her work. During Baez&apos;s next visit to Prague, in April 2007, the two met again when she performed in front of a sold-out house at Prague&apos;s Lucerna Hall, a building erected by Havel&apos;s grandfather. On December 2, 2006, she made a guest appearance at the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir &apos;s Christmas Concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California.

A DVD and CD of the sound track were released at the same time. [ Social and political involvement ] [ 1950s ] In 1956, Baez first heard Martin Luther King, Jr. speak about nonviolence, civil rights and social change which brought tears to her eyes. Several years later, the two became friends, with Baez participating in many of the demonstrations that King had planned and organized. In 1957, at age 16, Joan committed her first act of civil disobedience by refusing to leave her Palo Alto High School classroom in Palo Alto, California for an air-raid drill. After the bells rang, students were to leave the school, make their way to their home air-raid shelter s, and pretend they were surviving an atomic blast. Protesting what she believed to be misleading government propaganda, Baez refused to leave her seat when instructed and continued reading a book. For this act she was punished by school officials, and was ostracized by the local population for being a supposed &quot; Communist infiltrator. &quot; [ Civil Rights ] The early years of Joan Baez&apos;s career saw the civil-rights movement in the U.S. become a prominent issue. Her performance of &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot;, the civil-rights anthem, at King&apos;s 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom permanently linked her to the song. Baez again sang &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; in Sproul Plaza during the mid-1960s Free Speech Movement demonstrations at the University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California, and at many other rallies and protests. Her recording of the song &quot; Birmingham Sunday &quot; (1964),written by her brother-in-law, Richard Fariña, was used in the opening of 4 Little Girls (1997), Spike Lee &apos;s documentary film about the four young victims killed in the 1963 bombing. Baez joined King on his 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, singing for the marchers in the town of St. Jude, Alabama, as they camped the night before arriving in Montgomery. She linked arms with King to protect African-American schoolchildren in Grenada, Mississippi who were trying to attend &quot; white &quot; schools. [ August 2009 ] In 1966, she stood in the fields alongside César Chávez and California&apos;s migrant farm workers as they fought for fair wages and safe working conditions and performed at a benefit on behalf of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union in December of that year. In 1972, she was at Chávez&apos;s side during his 24-day fast to draw attention to the farmworkers struggle and can be seen singing &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; during that fast in the film about the UFW, &quot; Si Se Puede &quot; ( &quot; It can be done &quot; ). [ August 2009 ] [ &quot; I went to jail for 11 days for disturbing the peace; I was trying to disturb the war. &quot; ] [ Vietnam War ] Highly visible in civil-rights marches, Baez became more vocal about her disagreement with the Vietnam War. In 1964, she publicly endorsed resisting taxes by withholding sixty percent of her 1963 income taxes. In 1964, she founded the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence (along with her mentor Sandperl) and encouraged draft resistance at her concerts. Baez was arrested twice in 1967 [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_2535000/2535301.stm BBC News 1967: Joan Baez arrested in Vietnam protest October 16, 1967 2010-05-06 ] for blocking the entrance of the Armed Forces Induction Center in Oakland, California and spent over a month in jail.

There were many others, culminating in Ochs&apos;s The War Is Over celebration in New York City in May 1975. [ End-of-War Rally Brings Out 50,000; PEACE RALLY HERE BRINGS OUT 50,000 Paul L. Montgomery The New York Times May 12, 1975 2008-02-03 ] During the Christmas season 1972, Baez joined a peace delegation traveling to North Vietnam, both to address human rights in the region, and to deliver Christmas mail to American prisoners of war. During her time there, she was caught in the U.S. military&apos;s &quot; Christmas bombing &quot; of Hanoi, North Vietnam, during which the city was bombed for eleven straight days. Her disquiet at the human-rights violations of communist Vietnam made her increasingly critical of its government and she organized the May 30, 1979, publication, of a full-page advertisement (published in four major U.S. newspapers) [ Joan Baez starts protest on repression by Hanoi The New York Times May 30, 1979 A14 2008-02-03 ] in which the communists were described as having created a nightmare. [ Human rights ] Baez was instrumental in founding the USA section of Amnesty International in the 1970s, and has remained an active supporter of the organization. Baez&apos; experiences regarding Vietnam&apos;s human-rights violations ultimately led her to found her own human-rights group, Humanitas International, whose focus was to target oppression wherever it occurred, criticizing right and left-wing régimes equally. In 1976, she was awarded the Thomas Merton Award for her ongoing activism. [ http://www.nndb.com/people/560/000022494/ Joan Baez Nndb.com 2012-04-09 ] She toured Chile, Brazil and Argentina in 1981, but was prevented from performing in any of the three countries, for fear her criticism of their human-rights practices would reach mass audiences if she were given a podium. While there, she was kept under surveillance and subjected to death threats. A film of the ill-fated tour, There but for Fortune, was shown on PBS in 1982. In 1989, after the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing Baez wrote and released the song &quot; China &quot; to condemn the Chinese Communist Party for its bloody slaughter of thousands of student protesters who called for establishment of democratic republicanism. In a second trip to Southeast Asia, Baez assisted in an effort to take food and medicine into the western regions of Cambodia, and participated in a United Nations Humanitarian Conference on Kampuchea. On July 17, 2006, Baez received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the Legal Community Against Violence. At the annual dinner event they honored her for her lifetime of work against violence of all kinds. [ Opposing death penalty ] In December 2005, Baez appeared and sang &quot; Swing Low, Sweet Chariot &quot; at the California protest at the San Quentin State Prison against the execution of Tookie Williams. { Jenifer Warren, Jenifer and Dolan, Maura (December 13, 2005).

In 1978, she performed at several benefit concerts to defeat the Briggs Initiative, which proposed banning all gay people from teaching in the public schools of California. Later that same year, she participated in memorial marches for the assassinated San Francisco city supervisor, Harvey Milk, who was openly gay. In the 1990s, she appeared with her friend Janis Ian at a benefit for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a gay lobbying organization, and performed at the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March. Her song &quot; Altar Boy and the Thief &quot; from Blowin&apos; Away (1977) was written as a dedication to her gay fanbase. [ September 2011 ] [ Iran&apos;s people ] On June 25, 2009, Baez created a special version of &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; with a few lines of Persian lyrics in support of peaceful protests by Iranian people. She recorded it in her home and posted the video on YouTube { Baez, Joan (June 25, 2009). Joan Baez &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; (2009) youtube.com; Google Inc. Retrieved 2010-06-17. } and on her personal website. She dedicated the song &quot; Joe Hill &quot;, to the people of Iran during her concert at Merrill Auditorium, Portland, Maine on July 31, 2009. [ Environmental causes ] On Earth Day 1999, Baez and Bonnie Raitt honored environmental activist Julia Butterfly Hill with Raitt&apos;s Arthur M. Sohcot Award in person on her [ 180 ft m on ] -high redwood treetop platform, where Hill had camped to protect ancient redwoods in the Headwaters Forest from logging. { Rising Ground, Michael. (1999). Bonnie Raitt and Joan Baez Tree-sit in protest. EcoMall; Ecology America. Retrieved 2010-06-18. } [ War in Iraq ] In early 2003, Baez performed at two rallies of hundreds of thousands of people in San Francisco protesting the U.S. invasion of Iraq (as she had earlier done before smaller crowds in 1991 to protest the Gulf War ). In August 2003, she was invited by Emmylou Harris and Steve Earle to join them in London, U.K., at the Concert For a Landmine-Free World. In the summer of 2004, Joan joined Michael Moore &apos;s &quot; Slacker Uprising Tour &quot; on American college campuses, encouraging young people to get out and vote for peace candidates in the upcoming national election. In August 2005, Baez appeared at the Texas anti-war protest that had been started by Cindy Sheehan. [ Poverty ] On May 23, 2006, Baez once again joined Julia &quot; Butterfly &quot; Hill, this time in a &quot; tree sit &quot; in a giant tree on the site of the South Central Farm in a poor neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles, California. Baez and Hill were hoisted into the tree, where they remained overnight. The women, in addition to many other activists and celebrities, were protesting the imminent eviction of the community farmers and demolition of the site, which is the largest urban farm in the state. Because many of the South Central Farmers are immigrants from Central America, Baez sang several songs from her 1974 Spanish-language album, Gracias a la Vida, including the title track and &quot; No Nos Moverán &quot; ( &quot; We Shall Not Be Moved &quot; ). [ 2008 Presidential election ] [ &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; Joan Baez performs We Shall Overcome at the White House, February 09, 2010.ogg Audio Only &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; Joan Baez performs We Shall Overcome Feb 09 2010.ogv Joan Baez performs &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; at the White House in front of President Barack Obama, at a celebration of music from the civil rights era (February 9, 2010). left ] Throughout most of her career, Baez remained apprehensive about involving herself in party politics. However, on February 3, 2008, Baez wrote a letter to the editor at the San Francisco Chronicle endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. She noted: &quot; Through all those years, I chose not to engage in party politics.... At this time, however, changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do. If anyone can navigate the contaminated waters of Washington, lift up the poor, and appeal to the rich to share their wealth, it is Sen.

[ Personal life ] [ Early relationships ] Baez&apos;s first real boyfriend was Michael New, a young man whom she met at college. Years later in 1979, he inspired her song &quot; Michael &quot;. New was a fellow student from Trinidad, West Indies, who, like Baez, attended classes only occasionally. The two spent a considerable amount of time together, but Baez was unable to balance her blossoming career and her relationship. The two bickered and made up repeatedly, but it was apparent to Baez that New was beginning to resent her success and new-found local celebrity. One night she saw him kissing another woman on a street corner. Despite this, the relationship remained intact for several years, long after the two moved to California together in 1960. [ Bob Dylan ] { Bob Dylan at the civil rights } { March on Washington, August 28, 1963. } Baez first met Dylan in 1961 at Gerde&apos;s Folk City in New York City&apos;s Greenwich Village. At the time, Baez had already released her debut album and her popularity as the emerging &quot; Queen of Folk &quot; was on the rise. Baez was initially unimpressed with the &quot; urban hillbilly &quot;, but was impressed with one of Dylan&apos;s first compositions, &quot; Song to Woody &quot;, and remarked that she would like to record it. At the start, Dylan was more interested in Baez&apos;s younger sister, Mimi, but under the glare of media scrutiny that began to surround Baez and Dylan, their relationship began to develop into something more. By 1963, Baez had already released three albums, two of which had been certified gold, and she invited Dylan on stage to perform alongside her at the Newport Folk Festival. The two performed the Dylan composition &quot; With God on Our Side &quot;, a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come. Typically while on tour, Baez would invite Dylan to sing on stage partly by himself and partly with her, much to the chagrin of her fans. Before meeting Dylan, Baez&apos;s topical songs were very few: &quot; Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream &quot;, &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot;, and an assortment of negro spirituals. Baez would later say that Dylan&apos;s songs seemed to update the topics of protest and justice. By the time of Dylan&apos;s 1965 tour of the U.K., their relationship had slowly begun to fizzle out after they had been romantically involved off and on for nearly two years. The tour and simultaneous disintegration of their relationship was documented in D.A. Pennebaker &apos;s documentary film Dont Look Back (1967). Baez toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76. She sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue, released in 2002. Baez appeared with Dylan in the one hour TV special, Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as &apos;The Woman In White&apos; in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Bob Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 along with Carlos Santana. Baez discussed her relationship with Dylan in Martin Scorsese &apos;s documentary film No Direction Home (2005), and in the PBS American Masters biography of Baez, How Sweet the Sound (2009). Baez penned at least three songs about Dylan. In &quot; To Bobby &quot;, written in 1972, she urged Dylan to return to political activism, while in &quot; Diamonds &amp; Rust &quot;, the title track from her 1975 album, she revisited her feelings for him in warm, yet direct terms. [ Gray Michael Michael Gray (author) The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia The Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd London 2006 30–31 0-8264-6933-7 ] &quot; Winds of the Old Days &quot;, also on the Diamonds &amp; Rust album, is a bittersweet reminiscence about her time with &quot; Bobby &quot;. References to Baez in Dylan&apos;s songs are far less clear. Baez herself has suggested that she was the subject of both &quot; Visions of Johanna &quot; and &quot; Mama, You Been on My Mind &quot;, although the latter was more likely about his relationship with Suze Rotolo. { Gray p 30 } [ Heylin Clinton Behind the Shades Revisited HarperEntertainment London 2003 158–159 0-06-052569-X ] As for &quot; Visions of Johanna &quot;, &quot; She Belongs to Me &quot; and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez, neither Dylan nor biographers such as Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray have had anything definitive to say one way or the other regarding the subject of these songs. [ David Harris ] { Diamonds &amp; Rust &apos;&apos;. } In October 1967, Baez, her mother, and nearly 70 other women were arrested at the Oakland, California, Armed Forces Induction Center for blocking the doorways of the building to prevent entrance by young inductees, and in support of young men who refused military induction. They were incarcerated in the Santa Rita Jail, and it was here that Baez met David Harris, who was kept on the men&apos;s side but who still managed to visit with Baez regularly. The two formed a close bond upon their release and Baez moved into his draft-resistance commune in the hills above Stanford, California. The pair had known each other for three months when they decided to wed. After confirming the news to The Associated Press, media outlets began dedicating ample press to the impending nuptials (at one point, Time magazine referred to it as the &quot; Wedding of the Century &quot; ). After finding a pacifist preacher, a church outfitted with peace signs and writing a blend of Episcopalian and Quaker wedding vows, Baez and Harris married each other in New York City on March 26, 1968. Her friend Judy Collins sang at the ceremony. After the wedding, Baez and Harris moved into a home in the Los Altos Hills on [ 10 acre m2 ] of land called Struggle Mountain, part of a commune, where they tended gardens and were strict vegetarians. A short time later, Harris refused induction to the armed forces and was indicted. On July 16, 1969, Harris was taken by federal marshals to prison. { People: July 25, 1969, para. 2. } { Time Magazine, July 25, 1969.

A character based on Baez appears in I&apos;m Not There and is portrayed by Julianne Moore. &quot; Here&apos;s to You &quot; (music by Ennio Morricone, lyrics by Baez), a song Baez originally performed for the Italian film Sacco e Vanzetti (1971), became a hymn for the 1960s and 1970s civil-rights movement. It also appears on the soundtrack for the film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004). The song is also played over the credits of the quasi-documentary film Deutschland im Herbst (1977) and was recently used in the video game Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.
