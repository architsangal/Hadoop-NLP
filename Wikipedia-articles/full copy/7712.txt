Additional British participation in the Continuation War was limited to supply aid, aerial support for its Arctic operations and a British airwing ( No. 151 Wing RAF ) under Soviet command, which supported Soviet air raids in the Murmansk area and trained Soviet crews for roughly a month in the autumn of 1941 - couple of months before the declaration of war against Finland by the United Kingdom. &quot; Notes &quot; ] { declared war on Finland but conducted only minor operations. } The Continuation War ( [ jatkosota ], [ fortsättningskriget ], 25 June 1941 – 19 September 1944) was the second of two wars fought between Finland and the Soviet Union during World War II. At the time of the war, the Finnish side used the name to make clear its perceived relationship to the preceding Winter War. [ The history of Finland 126 Jason Edward Lavery Greenwood Press ] The Soviet Union saw the war as a part of its struggle against Germany and its allies, the Eastern Front of World War II or, as it was known in the Soviet Union, the Great Patriotic War. { Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Finland, Moscow, 1974. ISBN 0-02-880010-9 } Germany regarded its operations in the region as a part of its overall war efforts of World War II. It provided critical material support and military cooperation to Finland. Acts of war between the two countries started on 22 June 1941, the day Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union. Open warfare started with a Soviet air offensive on 25 June. Subsequent Finnish operations undid its post- Winter War cessations on the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia, and captured East Karelia by September 1941. On the Karelian Isthmus, the Finns froze their offensive 30  km from Leningrad, where the pre-WWII border of the Soviet Union and Finland ran. The Finns did not attack the city. Yet, they passively participated in the siege by holding their pre-WWII land for two and a half years on the Karelian Isthmus.

Eventually the Soviet strategic offensive in the summer of 1944 drove the Finns from most of the territories they had gained during the war but the Finnish Army later fought it to a standstill in July 1944. Cease-fire ended the hostilities on 5 September and Moscow Armistice officially ending the hostilities was signed in 19 September. The Paris peace treaty concluded the war formally in 1947. Finland ceded Petsamo and rented Porkkala to the Soviet Union, and paid reparations of $300,000,000 equaling half of its annual gross domestic product in 1939, while Finland retained its independence. [ Background ] [ Winter War ] [ Background of the Winter War Winter War ] Finnish ski troops in Northern Finland on 12 January 1940 On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact where parties divided the independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania into spheres of interest, with Finland falling to the Soviet sphere of interest. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 30 } Shortly afterward, Germany invaded Poland so the United Kingdom and France declared war against Germany. The Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland on 17 September. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 31 } Next, Moscow demanded that the Baltic states allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The Baltic governments accepted ultimatums, signing the corresponding agreements in September and in October. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 33 } In October 1939, the Soviet Union attempted to negotiate for Finnish territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital Helsinki. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 39 } The Finnish government refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 44 } Condemnation by the League of Nations and by countries all over the world had no effect on Soviet policy. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 49 } International help to Finland was planned, but very little actual help materialized, except from Sweden. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 65 } The Moscow Peace Treaty, which was signed on 12 March 1940, ended the Winter War. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 69 } According to the Treaty contract Finland lost one eleventh of its national territory and about 13 percent of its economic capacity. { Kirby 2006, p. 215 } However, Finland had avoided having the Soviet Union annex the whole country. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 70 } [ Interim peace ] { half-mast after the publication of the peace terms. } [ Interim Peace ] The country&apos;s foreign policy had been based on multilateral guarantees for support from the League of Nations and Nordic countries and was considered a failure. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 74 } Public opinion favored the re-conquest of Finnish Karelia. The defence of the country was declared first priority and military expenditures rose to nearly half of government spending. Finland received war material purchased and donated during and immediately after the Winter War. On the southern frontier, the Soviet Union had acquired a military base in Hanko near the Finnish capital of Helsinki, employing over 30,000 military personnel. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 75 } Finland also had to resettle some 420,000 evacuees from the lost territories. To ensure the supply of food, it was necessary to clear new land for them to cultivate. This issue was facilitated with the Rapid Settlement Act. The Finnish leadership wanted to preserve the spirit of unanimity that was commonly felt throughout the country during the Winter War. The divisive White Guard tradition of the Civil War 16 May victory day celebration was therefore discontinued. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 76 } Relations between Finland and the Soviet Union remained strained despite the signing of the one-sided peace treaty and there were disputes regarding the implementation of the conditions of the treaty. Finland sought security against further territorial depredations by the Soviet Union and proposed mutual defence agreements with Norway and Sweden, but these initiatives were quashed by Moscow. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 77 } { Kirby 2006, p. 216 } [ German and Soviet expansion in Europe ] After the Winter War, Germany was not popular in Finland as it was considered an ally of the Soviet Union. However, the Finnish government began to restore diplomatic relations with Germany. Finland continued its Western orientation policy and negotiated a war trade agreement with the United Kingdom but the agreement was renounced after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway on 9 April, when Britain cut all trade and traffic communications with Scandinavia. With the fall of France, a policy of Western orientation was no longer considered an option in Finnish foreign policy. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 78 } On 15–16 June, the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic states without resistance. Puppet regimes were installed and within two months Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were incorporated as Soviet Republics within the Soviet Union. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 79 } By mid-1940, both the northern democracies of Finland and Sweden were encircled by the totalitarian states of Germany and the Soviet Union. On 23 June, a short time after the Soviet occupation in the Baltic states, the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov contacted the Finns and demanded a mining licence in the nickel mines in Petsamo for the Soviet Union or to a joint Soviet-Finnish company. The licence to mine the deposit had earlier been granted to a British-Canadian company and the proposition was rejected. Next month, the Soviets demanded Finland destroy the fortifications built in the Åland islands and give the right to use Finnish railways for transporting troops to the newly acquired Soviet base at Hanko. The Finns very reluctantly agreed to these demands. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 80 } On 24 July, Molotov accused the Finnish government of persecuting the so-called Society for Peace and Friendship between Finland and USSR, a pro-communist group, and soon after he publicly supported it. The society organized demonstrations, some of which turned into riots. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 81 } { Kirby 2006, p. 218 } [ Finnish relations with Germany and the USSR ] { Joachim von Ribbentrop bidding farewell to Soviet } { Vyacheslav Molotov in Berlin on 14 November 1940. } On 31 July 1940, the German leader Adolf Hitler gave the order to start planning an assault on the Soviet Union. This meant that Germany had to re-assess the positions of both Finland and Romania. Until then, Germany had rejected Finnish appeals to purchase arms but in August the Germans allowed the secret sale of weapons. Military authorities made an agreement on 12 September and an official exchange of diplomatic notes were sent on 22 September. At the same time, German troops were allowed to transit their troops through Sweden and Finland. { Kirby 2006, p. 220 } In practice, this meant redrawing of the border between German and Soviet spheres of influence. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 83 } Due to the changed situation, Molotov made a visit to Berlin on 12–13 November. { Kirby 2006, p. 219 } He wanted Germany to withdraw its troops from Finland and stop enabling Finnish anti-Soviet sentiments. He also reminded the Germans of the 1939 Soviet–German non-aggression pact. Hitler asked how the Soviet Union planned to settle the &quot; Finnish question &quot;. Molotov answered that it would happen in the same manner as in Bessarabia and the Baltic states. Hitler rejected this. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 84 } Next December, the Soviet Union, Germany and the United Kingdom all voiced opinions concerning suitable Finnish presidential candidates. Risto Ryti was the only one of the candidates to whom none of three superpowers objected. He was elected on 19 December. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 85 } In January 1941, the Soviet Union demanded to take control of the Petsamo mining area. Finland rejected this, as it had by then a re-built defense force and was encouraged by Germany to reject the Soviet demand. On 18 December 1940, Hitler had officially approved Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. { Kirby 2006, p. 221 } Both Finland and Romania were expected to join in the campaign. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 86 } Two days earlier, Finnish Major General Paavo Talvela had met German Colonel General Franz Halder and, a couple days later, Hermann Göring, in Berlin. This was the first time the Germans advised them, in carefully couched diplomatic terms, that they were preparing for a war with the Soviet Union. Outlines of the actual plan were revealed in January 1941 and regular contacts between Finnish and German military leaders started from February. In late Spring 1941, the Soviet Union made a number of goodwill gestures in order to prevent Finland from completely falling under German influence. Soviet ambassador Ivan Zotov was replaced with the more flexible Pavel Orlov. Furthermore, the Soviet government announced that it no longer opposed an approchement between Finland and Sweden. However, these conciliatory measures did not have effect on Finnish policy. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 87 } [ Path to war ] [ Finnish-German agreement ] On 20 May, Germany invited Finnish officers to Germany to discuss the coordination of Operation Barbarossa. The participants met on 25–28 May in Salzburg and Berlin, and continued in Helsinki on 3–6 June. They agreed upon the arrival of German troops, Finnish mobilization and general division of operations. It was also agreed that the Finnish Army would start mobilization on 15 June, but the Germans did not reveal the final date for the assault. The Finnish decisions were made by a small group of political and military leaders and the rest of the government was largely kept in the dark. They were not told until the 9th of June that the country would start mobilization of reservist s due to tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union. [ Deployments and pre-assaults ] { Petsamo area and the Finns assaulted on 1 July from } { Suomussalmi and } { Kuusamo area. } The Germans took responsibility for a [ 500 km mi on ] stretch of the front in the northern Finland, the Finnish Lapland. The Finnish army was now much stronger than it had been during the Winter War. Its total strength was 475,000 men and the artillery was relatively strong. However, there was only one tank battalion and a lack of motorized transportation. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 90 } At the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union had only eighteen divisions in the region, against fifteen Finnish and four German divisions. The Finns also enjoyed air supremacy. Furthermore, the Soviet Union needed its best units and most up-to-date materiel on its western front. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 91 } The German troops assaulted the Soviet Union on 22 June elsewhere but not in Finland. However, German minelayers hiding in the Archipelago Sea laid two large minefields across the Gulf of Finland in the late hours of 21 June. { Nordberg, Erkki, Arvio ja ennuste Venäjän sotilaspolitiikasta Suomen suunnalla, 2003, ISBN 951-884-362-7 } { Encyclopædia Britannica Premium, 2006, &apos;&apos;Finland&apos;&apos; } Later the same night, German bombers flew along the Gulf of Finland to Leningrad and mined the harbour and the river Neva. On the return trip, these bombers landed for refueling on an airfield in Utti. In the early hours of 22 June Finnish forces launched Operation Kilpapurjehdus that occupied the demilitarized Åland Islands. An international treaty on the status of the islands called for Finland to occupy them in case of a threat of an attack.

Finland mobilised 16 infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and two jäger brigades, which were standard infantry brigades, except for an armoured battalion in the 1st Jäger Brigade. There were separate battalions mostly formed from border guard units and used mainly for reconnaissance. Soviet military plans estimated that Finland would be able to mobilise only 10 infantry divisions, as it had done in the Winter War, but they failed to take into account the materiel Finland had purchased between the wars and its training of all available men. Two German mountain divisions were stationed at Petsamo and two infantry divisions at Salla. On the morning of 22 June, the German Mountain Corps Norway began its advance from northern Norway to Petsamo. Finland did not allow direct German attacks from its soil into the Soviet Union. On the same day, another German infantry division was moved in from Oslo to face Ladoga Karelia. The Karelian Isthmus was covered by the 23rd Army. Ladoga Karelia was defended by the 7th Army. In the Murmansk – Salla region, there was the 14th Army with the 42nd Corps. The Red Army also had around 40 battalions of separate regiments and fortification units present. Leningrad was garrisoned by three infantry divisions and one mechanized corps. As the initial devastating German strike against the Soviet Air Force had not affected air units located near Finland, the Soviets deployed 700 planes as well as some aircraft from the Navy against 300 Finnish planes. { Jokipii 1999, p. 301 } [ Campaign of 1941 ] The front in December 1941. In the morning of 25 June, the Soviet Union launched an air offensive of 460 fighter and bombers targeted against 19 airfields in Finland; however, inaccurate intelligence and bad bombing accuracy caused several raids to actually hit Finnish cities or municipalities.

This offered the Finnish government a ground for claiming that the country had become the target of a new assault and the parliament approved the &quot; defend war &quot; as a fait accompli. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 88 } The message was more for public opinion in Finland than abroad, where it was seen that the country was in the German camp. { Kirby 2006, p. 222 } In 1941, most Finns thought it was only to regain back what had been wrongly taken in the Winter War. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 89 } The Soviet Union claimed the air attack was directed against German targets, especially airfields, in Finland. [ Platonov S.P. 1964 Битва за Ленинград The Battle for Leningrad Voenizdat Ministerstva oborony SSSR ] At the same time, Soviet artillery stationed at the Hanko base began to shell Finnish targets and a minor Soviet infantry attack was launched over the Finnish side of the border in Parikkala. The Soviet Union was struggling to contain the German invasion and soon the Soviet High Command had to call all available units to the rapidly deteriorating front line. [ Lunde Henrik, O. Finland&apos;s War of Choice March 19, 2011 Casemate Pub 159 978-1-935149-48-4 ] Because of this, the initial air offensive against Finland could not be followed by a supporting land offensive in the scale originally planned. { Manninen (2008), Miten Suomi valloitetaan: Puna-armeijan operaatiosuunnitelmat 1939–1944, Helsinki: Edita, 2008. ISBN 978-951-37-5278-1 } Moreover, the 10th Mechanized Corps and the 237th Infantry Division were withdrawn from Ladoga Karelia, thus stripping reserves from the remaining defending units.

Finnish HQ halted the offensive in Ladoga Karelia on 25 July after reconquering the area of Ladoga Karelia lost to Soviet Union in 1940 and advancing as far as Vitele, and then moved onto the offensive at other sections of the front.

On 22 August Finnish IV AK started its offensive from the 1940 border between the Gulf of Finland and II AK and advanced towards Viipuri. By 23 August, the Finnish II Corps had reached the Vuoksi waterway from the east and continued to surround the Soviet forces defending Viipuri. The Soviet withdrawal order came too late, and divisions lost much of their equipment, although a sizable portion of their manpower was later evacuated via the Koivisto islands. The badly mauled defending Soviet army was unable to halt the Finnish offensive, and by 2 September they had reached the 1939 border along its whole length. On 31 August, Finnish HQ ordered the offensive to halt at a straightened line just past the former border. However, according to Soviet sources the Finns advanced and took the settlement of Novyi Beloostrov on 4 September, but a Soviet counter-attack threw them out the next day, { Werth 1999, p. 294 } { Luknitsky 1988, p. 58 } although the war diary of the Finnish 12th Division facing the settlement does not mention the fighting and notes that it was quiet at the time [ http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid%3D3494909 Os.2/12.DE, sotapäiväkirja, 4.9.41 – 18.1.42 Finnish War diary of 12th Divisions headquarters, section 2 War diary collection National Archives Services of Finland 3–4 22 August 2011 ] while the neighboring 18th Division gave clear orders on the morning of 4 September 1941 not to advance to N.

On 6 November, the Finnish HQ ordered their forces to capture Karhumäki and then move to defense. The Finnish forces captured the area of Karhumäki and Povenets and halted the offensive in early December. Related to Finnish advance to Svir the German Army Group North advanced from the south towards Svir river and managed to capture Tikhvin before Soviet counterattacks forced the Germans to withdraw to Volkhov River. Soviet forces also made several attempts to force Finns out from their bridgehead south of Svir during October and December 1941 however the Soviet efforts to reduce the bridgehead were blocked by the Finns. Soviet forces also attacked against the German 163rd Division – which was operating under Finnish command – across the Svir in October 1941 but the Soviet forces which had crossed the river were pushed back soon after.

The German soldiers were from central Europe and they had difficulties moving over a roadless terrain of swamp and forest. Troops managed to advance some distance with heavy casualties, but the terrain offered good defensive positions for the Soviet resistance. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 95 } The order for German–Finnish troops to move to defensive operations was given on 17 November and attempts to reach the Murman Railway had failed.

Evacuations from Tallinn and Hanko proved to be very costly operations. As the Soviet Navy withdrew to the eastern end of the Gulf of Finland it left the nearly the whole of the Baltic Sea as well as many of the islands to the Germans and the Finns. Though submarines caused some threat to German traffic on the Baltic, the withdrawal of the Soviet Navy made the Baltic Sea a &apos;German lake&apos; until the second half of 1944. Though the Soviet navy left in a hurry, the naval mines it had managed to lay before and during the evacuations caused casualties both to the Germans and to the Finns, including the loss of one of the two Finnish coastal defence ships, the [ Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen 2 ]. [ Political development ] The main forces of Germany advanced rapidly deep into the Soviet territory during the first weeks of campaign. The Finns believed the Germans would defeat the Soviet Union soon. President Ryti envisioned Greater Finland, where the country and other Finnic people would live inside &quot; natural defence borderline &quot; by incorporating the Kola Peninsula, East Karelia and perhaps even northern Ingria. In public the proposed frontier was introduced by the slogan &quot; A short border – a long peace &quot;. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 92 } Some members of parliament opposed the idea, such social democrats and Swedish-speaking party people, and argument that 1939 frontier would be enough. The Commander-in-Chief C.G.E. Mannerheim gave an order of the day on 10 July, the Sword scabbard declaration, in which he pledged to liberate Karelia. The Finnish government assured to Americans that it was unaware of the order. { Kirby 2006, p. 224 } Finland had prepared for a short war, but in late autumn it was clear that there was no decisive outcome in the short term. The Finnish troops suffered losses during its advance, and overall German victory became unsure as their troops were halted near Moscow. The Finnish economy suffered from a lack of labour, food shortages and increased prices. The Finnish government had to demobilize part of the army so that industrial and agricultural production would not collapse. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 96 } In October, the Finns informed Germany that it would need [ 175000 ST t on on ] of grain s to manage till next year&apos;s harvest. German authorities would have rejected the request, but Hitler himself agreed. The annual grain deliveries [ 200000 ST t on ] amounted to almost ½ of the Finnish domestic crop. In November Finland decided to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 101 } The advance in East Karelia was halted on 6 December. The Finns had suffered 75,000 casualties of whom 25,000 died during the advance. [ Finland and Western Allies ] Finland worked to maintain good relations with the Western powers. The government stressed that Finland was fighting as a co-belligerent of Germany only against the Soviet Union to protect itself. Furthermore, Finland stressed that it was still the same democratic country as it had been in the Winter War. However, the United Kingdom had signed with the Soviet Union an agreement of joint action on 12 July. Furthermore, Finland had to close, under German pressure, the British legation in Helsinki. As a result, diplomatic relations between Finland and the United Kingdom were broken on 1 August. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 97 } On 28 November, Britain presented Finland an ultimatum, in which it demanded that Finland cease military operations by 3 December. Unofficially Finland informed the Western powers that troops would halt their advance in the next few days. The reply did not satisfy the United Kingdom. It declared war on Finland on 6 December, following the Commonwealth member states of Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 100 } [ See also the Statute of Westminster 1931. &quot; Notes &quot; ] Relations between Finland and the United States were more complex. The American public was sympathetic to the &apos;brave little democracy&apos; and there were still anti-communist feelings. At first, the U.S. empathised with the Finnish cause; however, the situation became problematic after Finnish troops crossed the 1939 border. Finnish and German troops were a threat to the Murmansk Railway and northern communication supply line between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 98 } On 25 October, the U.S. demanded that Finland cease all hostilities against the Soviet Union and withdraw behind the 1939 border. In public President Ryti rejected the demands, but in private he wrote Mannerheim on 5 November asking him to halt the offensive. Mannerheim agreed and secretly instructed General Hjalmar Siilasvuo to break off the assault against the Murmansk Railway. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 99 } [ 1942–1943: Trench warfare ] Trench warfare of the Continuation War in 1942. Soviets made four major assaults which all were repelled. [ Military operations ] [ Baltic Sea Campaigns (1939–1945) Siege of Leningrad ] Though military operations during 1942–1943 were limited, the front did see some action. In early 1942, Soviet Karelian Front forces attempted to retake the Medvezhyegorsk which had been lost to the Finns in late 1941. As the spring came, the Soviet forces also went onto the offensive in the Svir front as well as in Kiestinki region. All Soviet offensives started promisingly but either due to overextending their lines or by stubborn resistance, the Soviet offensives were stopped and repulsed. After Finnish and German (in Kiestinki) counterattacks, the eventual front lines had moved very little. On September 1942, the Soviets tried again at Kriv near Medvezhyegorsk, but despite of five days of fighting, the Soviets managed to push back the Finnish lines only [ 500 m yd on ] on a roughly [ 1 km mi on ] -long stretch of the front. [ Jatkosodan torjuntataisteluja 1942–44 Defensive battles of Continuation War 1942–44 Finnish Raunio Ari Kilin Juri 2008 Otavan Kirjapaino Oy Keuruu 978-951-593-070-5 76–81 ] Unconventional warfare was fought in both the Finnish and Soviet wilderness. Finnish LRRP s organized both by Finnish HQ—4th Separate Battalion (Er.P 4)—and by local units patrolled beyond Soviet lines. In the summer of 1942, the Soviet Union had formed the 1st Partisan Brigade. The unit was only &apos;partisan&apos; in the name as it was essentially more than 600 men and women on long range patrol. The 1st Partisan Brigade was able to infiltrate beyond Finnish patrol lines but was found out and largely destroyed. [ Tikkanen Pentti, H. Sissiprikaatin tuho Destruction of Partisan Brigade Finnish 1973 Arvi A. Karisto Osakeyhtiö 951-23-0754-5 ] On the naval front, the Soviet Baltic Fleet still operated from the besieged city of Leningrad. In early 1942, Soviet forces recaptured the island of Gogland but lost both Gogland and Bolshoy Tyuters to the Finns later in the spring of 1942. During the winter of 1941/1942, the Soviet Baltic Fleet made the decision to use the large Soviet submarine fleet to carry the fight to the enemy. Though initial submarine operations in the summer of 1942 were successful, the German Kriegsmarine and Finnish Navy soon stepped up their anti-submarine efforts, making the Soviet submarine operations later in 1942 very costly. The underwater offensive carried out by the Soviets convinced the Germans to lay anti-submarine net s as well as supporting minefields between Porkkala and Naissaar which proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the Soviet submarines. [ Kijanen Kalervo Suomen Laivasto 1918–1968 II Finnish Navy 1918–1967, part II Finnish 1968 Meriupseeriyhdistys/Otava Helsinki 123 ] [ Diplomatic manoeuvers ] { Ryti meet, } { Imatra — June 1942 } Operation Barbarossa was planned as a blitzkrieg intended to last a few weeks. British and U.S. observers believed that the invasion would be concluded before August. [ January 2009 ] In the autumn of 1941, this turned out to be wrong, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany&apos;s capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in Northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly Murmansk. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times. { Jutikkala 1988, p.248 } Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by drawing down shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps in the hope that the Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland&apos;s independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany. Finland&apos;s participation in the war brought major benefits to Germany. The Soviet fleet was blockaded in the Gulf of Finland, so that the Baltic was freed for the training of German submarine crews as well as for German shipping, especially for the transport of vital iron ore from northern Sweden and nickel and rare metals (needed in steel processing) from the Petsamo area. The Finnish front secured the northern flank of the German Army Group North in the Baltic states. The sixteen Finnish divisions tied down numerous Soviet troops, put pressure on Leningrad (although Mannerheim refused to attack it directly), and threatened the Murmansk railway. Additionally, Sweden was further isolated and was increasingly pressured to comply with German and Finnish wishes, though with limited success. [ January 2009 ] Despite Finland&apos;s contributions to the German cause, the Western Allies had ambivalent feelings, torn between residual goodwill for Finland and the need to accommodate their vital ally, the Soviet Union. As a result, Britain declared war against Finland, but the U.S. did not. With few exceptions, there was no combat between these countries and Finland, but Finnish sailors were interned overseas. In the U.S., Finland was denounced for naval attacks made on American Lend-Lease shipments, but received approval for continuing to make payments on its World War I debt throughout the inter-war period. Because Finland joined the Anti-Comintern Pact and signed other agreements with Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Allies characterized Finland as one of the Axis Powers, although the term used in Finland is &quot; co-belligerence with Germany &quot;, emphasizing the lack of a formal military alliance treaty. [ International volunteers and support ] Estonian volunteers in Finland during the Continuation War. Like in the Winter War, Swedish volunteers were recruited. Until December they were tasked with guarding the Soviet naval base at Hanko. When it was evacuated by sea in December 1941, the Swedish unit was officially disbanded. During the Continuation War, the volunteers signed for three to six months of service. In all, over 1,600 fought for Finland, though only about 60 remained by the summer of 1944. About ⅓ of the volunteers had previously participated in the Winter War. Another significant group—about ¼ of the men—were Swedish officers on leave. From 1942 to 1944 there was also a Schutzstaffel (SS) battalion of volunteers on the northern Finnish front that was recruited from Norway, then under German occupation, and similarly, some Danes. About 3,400 Estonian volunteers took part. On other occasions, the Finns received around 2,100 Soviet prisoners of war in return for those POWs they turned over to the Germans. These POWs were mainly Estonians and Karelians who were willing to join the Finnish army. These, as well as some volunteers from occupied Eastern Karelia, formed the Kinship Battalion (Finnish: &quot; Heimopataljoona &quot; ). At the end of the war the USSR requested members of the Kinship Battalion to be handed over. Some managed to escape before or during transport, but most of them were either sent to the labor camps or executed. [ Finnish occupation policy ] [ Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia East Karelian concentration camps ] On 19 July 1941, the Finns set up the military administration in occupied East Karelia. The goal of the administration was to prepare the region for eventual incorporation into Finland. [ In the early stage, the Finns aimed at ethnic cleansing where the Russian population would be moved out of the area once the war was over. May 2012 ] They would be replaced with Finnic peoples such as Karelians, Finns, Estonians, Ingrians, and Vepsians. The Russian population was deemed &quot; non-national &quot;. Most of the East Karelian population had been evacuated before the Finnish forces arrived. About 85,000 people — mostly the elderly, women and children — were left behind, and less than ½ of them were Karelians. A significant number of civilians —almost 30% of the remaining Russians — were interned in concentration camps. { Kirby 2006, p. 225 } The winter of 1941–1942 was hard for the Finnish urban population due to poor harvests and a shortage of agricultural laborers. However, for the interned it was disastrous and over 3,500 of them died, mostly from famine. The figure was equivalent to 13.8% of the inmates, where the corresponding figure for the free population of the occupied territories was 2.6% and for Finland proper 1.4%. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 107 } Conditions were gradually improved, and the following year ethnic discrimination in wage levels and food rations was terminated, and schools were established also for the Russian section of the population. { Kirby 2006, p. 226 } By the end of the occupation the death rate dropped to the same level as in Finland proper. [ Soviet partisans ] [ Soviet partisans#Finland and Karelia ] { Seitajärvi, July 1942. } Soviet partisans conducted a number of operations in Finland and in Eastern Karelia from 1941 to 1944. The major one failed when the 1st Partisan Brigade was destroyed in the beginning of August 1942 at Lake Seesjärvi. Partisans distributed propaganda newspapers, &quot; Pravda &quot; in Finnish and &quot; Lenin&apos;s Banner &quot; in Russian. One of the leaders of the partisan movement in Finland and Karelia was Yuri Andropov. { Andropov Yuri Vladimirovich. Biography. } Finnish sources state that partisan activity in East Karelia focused mainly on Finnish military supply and communication targets, but almost two thirds of the attacks on the Finnish side of the border targeted civilians, { Eino Viheriävaara, Partisaanien jäljet 1941–1944.

They had full civil rights and fought with other Finns in the ranks of the Finnish Army. The Germans had mentioned the Finnish Jews at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, wishing to transport them to Majdanek in General Gouvernment. SS leader Heinrich Himmler mentioned the Finnish Jews during his visit in Finland in the summer of 1942. Finnish Prime Minister Jukka Rangell replied that Finland had no Jewish question. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 102 } However, there were differences for Jewish refugees in Finland. In November 1942, the Finns handed eight Jewish refugees over to the Gestapo. This raised protests among the Finnish Social Democrat ministers, and after this no more refugees were handed over. { Vehviläinen 2002, p. 103 } Over 500 Jewish refugees were granted asylum. [ Finland Yad Vashem http://yad-vashem.org.il/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205852.pdf 2010-10-29 ] The field synagogue in Eastern Karelia was one of the very few functioning synagogues on the Axis side during the war. There were even several cases of Jewish officers of Finland&apos;s army awarded the German Iron Cross, which they declined. German soldiers were treated by Jewish medical officers who succeeded in saving their lives. { Rautkallio, Hannu, Suomen juutalaisten aseveljeys (Finnish Jews as German Brothers in Arms), Tammi, 1989 } { Tuulikki Vuonokari (2003), Jews in Finland During the Second World War, Finnish Institutions Student Paper: FAST Area Studies Program Department of Translation Studies, University of Tampere, Autumn 2003.

Retrieved 2009-02-06. } [ Finland and the Western Allies ] The Continuation War represents the only case of a genuinely democratic state participating in World War II on the side of the Axis powers, albeit without being a signatory of the Tripartite Pact. The United Kingdom declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 (Finnish Independence Day), with Canada and New Zealand declaring war on Finland on 7 December and Australia and South Africa declaring war the next day. The U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull congratulated the Finnish envoy on 3 October 1941 for the liberation of Karelia but warned Finland not to enter Soviet territory; furthermore, the U.S. did not declare war on Finland when they went to war with the Axis countries and, together with UK, approached Stalin in the Tehran Conference about acknowledging Finnish independence. However, the U.S. government seized Finnish merchant ships in American ports, and in the summer of 1944 shut down Finnish diplomatic and commercial offices in the U.S. as a result of President Ryti&apos;s treaty with Germany. The U.S. government later warned Finland about the consequences of continued adherence to the Axis. { World War II: Finland } The best-known British action on Finnish soil was an aircraft carrier strike on German and Finnish ships in the Finnish harbour of Petsamo on 31 July 1941. { FAA archive: Raid on Petsamo } This attack achieved little except the loss of three British aircraft, but it was intended as a demonstration of British support for its Soviet ally. Later in 1941, Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF, based at Murmansk, provided local air cover for Soviet troops and fighter escorts for Soviet bombers. { The } { Royal Air Force in Russia : Hurricanes at Murmansk } The British contribution to the war was occasional but significant. Finnish radio intelligence is said to have participated effectively in German actions against British convoys to Murmansk. { Ahtokari, Reijo and Pale, Erkki: Suomen Radiotiedustelu 1927–1944 (Finnish radio intelligence 1927–1944), Helsinki, Hakapaino Oy, pp. 191–198, ISBN 952-90-9437-X } Throughout the war, German aircraft operating from airfields in northern Finland attacked British air and naval units based in Murmansk and Archangelsk.

[ Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive ] [ Overtures for peace ] [ Bombing of Helsinki in World War II Battle of Narva (1944) ] Finland began to actively seek a way out of the war after the disastrous German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943. Edwin Linkomies formed a new cabinet with peace as the top priority. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943–44 between Finland and its representative— Juho Kusti Paasikivi —on one side and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached. Stalin decided to force Finland to surrender; a bombing campaign on Helsinki followed. The air campaign in February 1944 included three major air attacks involving a total of over 6,000 sortie s. Finnish anti-aircraft defences managed to repel the raids as only 5% of the dropped bomb s hit their planned targets. Major air attacks also hit Oulu and Kotka but, because of radio intelligence and effective anti-aircraft defence s, the number of casualties was small. [ Mäkelä Jukka Helsinki liekeissä Werner Söderström osakeyhtiö 1967 Helsinki 20 ] Meanwhile, the lengthy and ferocious German defence in Narva aided by Estonians denied a Soviet-occupied Estonia as a favorable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. The tactical success of the army detachment &quot; Narwa &quot; from mid-February to April diminished the hopes of the Stavka to assault Finland and force it into capitulation from Estonia.

On the [ 21.7 km mi on ] -wide breakthrough segment the Red Army had concentrated 3,000 guns and mortars. In some places, the concentration of artillery pieces exceeded 200 guns for every kilometer of the front (one every [ 5 m yd on ] ). On that day, Soviet artillery fired over 80,000 rounds along the front on the Karelian Isthmus. On the second day of the offensive, the Soviet forces broke through the Finnish front lines. The Soviets penetrated the second line of defence by the sixth day. The Soviet pressure on the Karelian Isthmus forced the Finns to reinforce the area. This allowed the second Soviet offensive in Eastern Karelia to meet less resistance and to capture Petrozavodsk by 28 June 1944. The main objective of the offensives was to force Finland from the war. { Gebhardt 1989, p. 2 } Finland especially lacked modern antitank weaponry which could stop Soviet heavy tanks, and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop offered these in exchange for a guarantee that Finland would not seek a separate peace again. On 26 June, President Risto Ryti gave this guarantee as a personal undertaking, which he intended to last for the remainder of his presidency. In addition to delivering thousands of hand-held Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck antitank weapons (German equivalents of American bazooka s ), Hitler sent the 122nd Infantry Division, ½-strength 303rd Assault Gun Brigade, and a Luftwaffe Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey to provide temporary support in the most threatened defense sectors. With new supplies from Germany, the Finnish army halted the Soviet advance in early July 1944. At this point, the Finnish forces had retreated about one hundred kilometres, which brought them to approximately the same line of defence they had held at the end of the Winter War. This line was known as the VKT-line (short for &quot; Viipuri–Kuparsaari–Taipale &quot;, running from Viipuri to River Vuoksi to Lake Ladoga at Taipale ), where the Finnish Army stopped the Soviet offensive in the Battle of Tali-Ihantala in spite of the Soviet numerical and material superiority. { 500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe... – Google Books } { Finland at War 1939–45 – Google Books } { Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O – Google Books } The front stabilized once again. A few battles were fought in the latter stages of the war. The last of them was the Battle of Ilomantsi, a Finnish victory, from 26 July to 13 August 1944. { Lunde 2011, p. 299 } { Ilomantsin mottitaistelut 26.7.-13.8.1944 (The motti-battle in Ilomantsi).

The German support under the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement had prevented a disaster, but the country would not be able to hold another major attack. { Grier 2007, p. 31 } The Soviet advances against German Army Groups Center and North further complicated matters for Finland. With the front being stable so far, it was a good time for Finland to seek a way out of the war. { Erickson 1993, p. 329-30 } { Glantz 1998, p. 229 } By the beginning of August President Ryti resigned to allow Finland to sue for peace again, which the new government did in late August. { Glantz 1998, p. 201-3 } The Soviet peace terms were harsh but the $600,000,000 reparations demanded in the Spring were reduced to $300,000,000, most likely due to pressure from the US and Britain. { Ziemke (2002), p. 390 } However, after the ceasefire the Soviets insisted that the payments should be based on 1938 prices, which doubled the amount. [ Prisoners of war ] [ Soviet prisoners of war in Finland ] [ Soviet prisoners of war in Finland ] The number of Soviet prisoners of war was estimated to be around 64,000 persons. Of these, 56,000 were captured in 1941. { Juutilainen &amp; Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1036 } About 2,600–2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 Finnic prisoners of war. { Helsingin Sanomat : &quot; Wartime refugees made pawns in cruel diplomatic game. &quot; 8 November 2003 } Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest, and this was the primary reason for the number of deaths. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, 18,318 died in Finnish prisoner of war camp s. { Ylikangas, Heikki, Heikki Ylikankaan selvitys Valtioneuvoston kanslialle } [ October 2010 ] {, Government of Finland } [ Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union ] [ Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union ] There are two views of the number of Finnish prisoners of war. The Soviet and Russian view is that of 2,377 Finnish prisoners of war who reached the prison camps 1,954 were returned after Moscow Armistice. The Finnish view is that of original ~3,500 prisoners of war only ~2,000 were returned (more than 40% perished). The difference can be at least partially explained by Soviet practice of counting only the prisoners who survived to reach a prison camp.

May 2000 } [ Moscow Armistice Lapland War ] Mannerheim had repeatedly reminded the Germans that in case their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland would be forced to make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms. { Howard D. Grier. Hitler, Dönitz, and the Baltic Sea, Naval Institute Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59114-345-4. p. 121 } The territory of Estonia would have provided the Soviet army with a favourable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Finland&apos;s capital, Helsinki, and other strategic targets in Finland, and would have strangled Finnish access to the sea. The initial German reaction to Finland&apos;s announcement of ambitions for a separate peace was limited to only verbal opposition. However, the Germans arrested hundreds of sailors on Finnish merchant ships in Germany, Denmark and Norway. Previously, in return for critically needed food and defense materiel from the Germans, President Ryti had personally committed, in writing, that no separate peace with the Soviets would be attempted. Accordingly, it became clear that he must resign, paving the way for a separate peace. Finland&apos;s military leader and national hero, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, was extraordinarily appointed president by the parliament, accepting responsibility for ending the war. On 4 September, the cease-fire ended military actions on the Finnish side. The Soviet Union ended hostilities exactly 24 hours after the Finns. An armistice between the Soviet Union and Finland was signed in Moscow on 19 September. Finland had to make many concessions: the Soviet Union regained the borders of 1940, with the addition of the Petsamo area (now Pechengsky District, Russia); the Porkkala peninsula (adjacent to Helsinki) was leased to the USSR as a naval base for fifty years and transit rights were granted; Finland&apos;s army was to be demobilized with haste, and Finland was required to expel all German troops from its territory within 14 days. As the Germans did not leave Finland in time for the given deadline, the Finns fought their former co-belligerents in the Lapland War. Finland was also to clear the minefields in Karelia (including East Karelia) and in the Gulf of Finland. Retreating German forces had also mined northern Finland heavily. The demining was a long operation, especially in the sea areas, lasting until 1952. 100 Finnish army personnel were killed and over 200 wounded during this process, most of them in Lapland. Nevertheless, in contrast to the rest of the Eastern front countries, where the war was fought to the end, a Soviet occupation of Finland did not occur and the country retained sovereignty. Neither did Communists rise to power as they had in the Eastern Bloc countries. A policy called the Paasikivi–Kekkonen line formed the basis of Finnish foreign policy towards the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. [ Analysis ] [ December 2011 ] { Mannerheim Cross is the most distinguished Finnish military decoration and awarded to soldiers for extraordinary bravery; the achievement of extraordinarily important objectives by combat, or for especially well conducted operations. } Finland re-entered the World War II mainly because of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the Winter War, which had taken place despite of the Finnish intentions of relying on the League of Nations and Nordic neutrality to avoid conflicts. { Lunde 2011, p. 9 } During the Continuation War, Finland primarily aimed at reversing its territorial losses under the March 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty and, depending on the success of the German invasion, possible expansion, especially into East Karelia ( Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic ). { Jokipii 1999, p. 145-6 } Some right-wing groups also supported a Greater Finland ideology. Finland was able to come out of World War II without losing its independence, { Lunde 2011, p. 379 } although the price for war was high in war casualties, reparation payments, territorial loss, a bruised international reputation, and subsequent careful consideration of Soviet international perspectives during the Cold War. The Finnish–German alliance was different from most of the other Axis relationships, an example of which is represented by the participation of Finnish Jews in the fight against the Soviet Union. [ http://www.uta.fi/~tuulikki.vuonokari/fin-1.html Jews in Finland During the Second World War 2010-10-29 Tuulikki Vuonokari 2003-11-21 University of Tampere http://web.archive.org/web/20080110115019/http%3A//www.uta.fi/~tuulikki.vuonokari/fin-1.html 2008-01-10 ] The Finns did not take any anti-Jewish measures in Finland, despite repeated requests from Nazi Germany. { Letter to the New York Times by Mark Cohen, Executive Director of Holocaust Publications in New York, 28 April, 1987 } One remarkable aspect of the Finnish-German relationship was that Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact, which was signed by all de jure Axis countries. The Finns, and Mannerheim in particular, clearly stated they would fight against the Soviets only to the extent necessary to redress the balance of the 1940 treaty (which would ultimately have dire consequences for Germany, when Finland refused to advance beyond its 1939 borders to complete the German encirclement of Leningrad.) However, for Hitler the matter was irrelevant and he saw Finland as an ally. Finland&apos;s supreme commander Field Marshal Mannerheim at his headquarters. Finland adopted the concept of a &quot; parallel war &quot; whereby it sought to pursue its own objectives in concert with, but separate from, Nazi Germany, as &apos;co-belligerents.&apos; Major events of World War II, and the tides of war in general, had a significant impact on the course of the Continuation War: Germany&apos;s invasion of the Soviet Union ( Operation Barbarossa ) is closely connected to the Continuation War&apos;s beginning. The Allied invasion of France ( Battle of Normandy ) was coordinated with the Soviet major offensive against Finland (9 June-15 July 1944). The subsequent Soviet and Allied advances towards Germany drew away the interest in military operations from Northern Europe hastening the end of the Continuation War. Soviet sources maintain that Soviet policies up to the Continuation War were best explained as defensive measures by offensive means: the division of occupied Poland with Germany, the occupation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and the invasion of Finland in the Winter War are described as elements in the construction of a security zone or buffer region between the perceived threat from the capitalist powers of Western Europe and the Communist Soviet Union—as some see the post-war establishment of Soviet satellite state s in the Warsaw Pact countries and the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance concluded with post-war Finland. { The problem of ensuring the security of Leningrad from the north in light of Soviet war planning of 1932–1941 by V. N. Baryshnikov: The actual war with Finland began first of all due to unresolved issues in Leningrad&apos;s security from the north and Moscow&apos;s concerns for the perspective of Finland&apos;s politics. At the same time, a desire to claim better strategic positions in case of a war with Germany had surfaced within the Soviet leadership. } { Финская война. Взгляд &quot; с той стороны &quot; ( &quot; The Finnish war. A look from the &quot; other side &quot; &quot; ) by A. I. Kozlov: After the rise of National Socialism to power in Germany, the geopolitical importance of the former &quot; buffer states &quot; had drastically changed. Both the Soviet Union and Germany vied for the inclusion of these states into their spheres of influence. Soviet politicians and military considered it likely, that in case of an aggression against the USSR, German armed forces will use the territory of the Baltic states and Finland as staging areas for invasion — by either conquering or coercing these countries. None of the states of the Baltic region, excluding Poland, had sufficient military power to resist a German invasion. } { Stalin&apos;s Missed Chance, by } { Mikhail Meltyukhov :The English–French influence in the Baltics, characteristic for the &apos;20s – early &apos;30s was increasingly limited by the growth of German influence. Due to the strategic importance of the region, the Soviet leadership also aimed to increase its influence there, using both diplomatic means as well as active social propaganda. By the end of the &apos;30s, the main contenders for influence in the Baltics were Germany and the Soviet Union. Being a buffer zone between Germany and the USSR, the Baltic states were bound to them by a system of economic and non-aggression treaties of 1926, 1932 and 1939 } Western historians such as Norman Davies and John Lukacs dispute this view and describe the prewar Soviet policy as attempting to stay out of the war and regaining land lost after the fall of the Russian Empire. { Norman Davies, No simple victory, 2007, ISBN 978-0-670-01832-1 } [ See also ] List of Finnish corps in the Continuation War List of Finnish divisions in the Continuation War Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union Co-belligerence Einsatzkommando Finnland Finlandization Finnish &apos;&apos;Waffen-SS&apos;&apos; volunteers Paasikivi–Kekkonen line Salpalinja No. 151 Wing RAF Karelian question in Finnish politics Russo-Finnish wars [ Notes ] [ &quot; Notes &quot; ] [ References ] [ Citations ] [ 2 ] [ Bibliography ] [ Erickson John The Road to Berlin: Stalin&apos;s War with Germany 1993 Yale University Press New Haven 0-300-07813-7 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D6UaU6ZLqK4UC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Erickson ] [ Leavenworth Papers 17 The Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation: Soviet Breakthrough and Pursuit in the Arctic, October 1944 Gebhardt James 1990 Combat Studies Institute Fort Leavenworth 0195-3451 http://carl.army.mil/download/csipubs/gebhardt/geb_chapt1.pdf 10 May 2010 Gebhardt ] [ Glantz David House Jonathan When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler 1998 University Press of Kansas Lawrence 978-0-7006-0899-7 Glantz2 ] [ Grier Howard Hitler, Dönitz, and the Baltic Sea: the Third Reich&apos;s last hope, 1944–1945 2007 US Naval Institute Press Annapolis 978-1-59114-345-1 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Du4IbqxEQeBMC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Grier ] { * } [ Финляндия на пути к войне The Launching of the Continuation War Jokipii Mauno Mauno Jokipii 1999 Karelia Petrozavodsk 5-7545-0735-6 Russian Jokipii ] [ Jutikkala Eino Pirinen Kauko 1988 A History of Finland Dorset Press 0-88029-260-1 EinoJutikkala1988 ] [ Ilomantsi – lopultakin voitto Juutilainen Antti 1994 Kirjapaino Oy West Point Rauma 951-95218-5-2 Juutilainen Finnish ] [ Kirby David A concise history of Finland Cambridge University Press Cambridge 2006 343 978-0-521-53989-0 DavidKirby2006 ] [ Krosby H.
