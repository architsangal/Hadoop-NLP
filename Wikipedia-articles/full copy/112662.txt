The population was 255 at the 2000 census. [ History ] The town was founded at the location of a trading post called Pine Village, which may have been named for a lone pine tree that stood on the bluff of Pine Creek, or it may have been named for the creek itself. [ Baker Ronald L. Carmony Marvin Indiana University Press 1975 Bloomington, Indiana Indiana Place Names 130 ] The town was laid out in 1851 by Isaac and John R. Metsker, and the plat map was made by county surveyor Perrin Kent. The Methodist Church was already there; it was built several years earlier. [ A History of Warren County, Indiana Warren County Historical Society 1966 6 ] [ Rail service ] Rail service reached the town in the 1870s. The year 1883 witnessed the completion of a north/south Chicago and Great Southern Railway (later the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway ) line between Attica and Fair Oaks, which subsequently came under the ownership of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad. The line came to be known as the &quot; Coal Road &quot; for the large quantities of coal transported along it. When the C &amp; EI floundered in the early 1920s, Charles F. Propst purchased the Coal Road and in October 1922 incorporated it as the Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad. The CA &amp; S was placed in receivership on August 5, 1931, and incremental abandonment occurred over subsequent years. [ Sulzer Elmer G.
