[ January 2009 ] [ Judge Anderson Arthur Ranson.jpeg y Judge Anderson in The Jesus Syndrome(art by Arthur Ranson IPC Media / Rebellion 2000 AD #150 (February 1980) John Wagner Brian Bolland Cassandra Anderson Judge Dredd Anderson, Judge ] Judge Cassandra Anderson is a fictional character that started as a supporting player in the comic story Judge Dredd of 2000 AD and eventually rose in prominence and became the star of her own series, which is entitled Anderson: Psi-Division. She was created by writer John Wagner and artist Brian Bolland in 1980. Since 1988, Anderson has been written almost exclusively by Alan Grant, often working with artist Arthur Ranson. [ Publication history ] [ January 2009 ] John Wagner created both Judge Death and Judge Anderson for the Judge Dredd story &quot; Judge Death, &quot; { 2000 AD progs 149-151 } the latter helping introduce the Psi-Judges, which were seen as a natural progression. { Bishop 2007, page 70 } Brian Bolland based the character on Debbie Harry, &quot; having recently drawn the singer into an advertisement for Forbidden Planet. &quot; [ Fictional character biography ] Like her namesake Cassandra, Judge Anderson has psychic powers. In addition to being able to sense approaching danger and foresee events of the near future, as did her namesake, she also has telepathy. This allows her to read other people&apos;s minds and use mental attacks. These abilities allowed her to be a member of Mega-City One &apos;s corps of Judges as member of the Psi Division, which includes all Judges possessing psychic abilities. Originally appearing while the city was facing the first attack by Judge Death of the Dark Judges (a group of undead Judges from another dimension who seek to destroy all crime by destroying all life) she was instrumental in stopping the attack. { 2000 AD #151 } She has since been involved in many other attacks by the Dark Judges, who even managed to use her as an instrument of their plans for a while. Despite her efforts to end their threat, which even included exiling them to empty pocket-dimensions, the Dark Judges always manage to return eventually, ever determined to fulfil their mission. Though both sides claim it as their mission to prevail, in time Anderson and Death have become personal enemies to each other. Meanwhile she has become a prominent member of her Division and has gained the respect of Dredd, despite their differing attitudes. { Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 3 #7 } For instance, in the first encounter with Judge Death, Anderson eventually resorts to volunteering to become entombed in &apos;Boing&apos;, the tough but porous material, hoping to keep the fiend contained within her own body. As a result, Anderson was held in state in a place of honor with the designation, &apos;The Supreme Sacrifice&apos;. This lasted until the Dark Judges have her freed to release their brother and she returned to active duty. In contrast to Dredd, she has always been critical of the weaknesses evident in the judicial system of Mega-City One, though she has been deemed too valuable to her Division to face consequences for it. Also in contrast to Dredd, she has a sense of humour and she is able to form personal friendships with fellow Judges. She is able to feel doubt and remorse, two feelings that Dredd doesn&apos;t allow himself. But her determination to a mission she accepts as her own is similar to Dredd&apos;s, and the two have been able to co-operate effectively during a number of missions. Judge Anderson has had a crisis of conscience following the resurfacing of childhood memories of an abusive father (as told in the story Engram { 2000 AD #712-717 and 758-763 } ). She was shocked to find that her Division was aware of it but had set mental blocks in her mind to make her forget. Though she understood the Division&apos;s belief that she was more effective without those scars threatening her mental health, she still did not agree with it. This, together with the events chronicled in Leviathan&apos;s Farewell (a standalone non-Anderson story concerning Anderson&apos;s friend Judge Corey&apos;s suicide), Shamballa, The Jesus Syndrome and Childhood&apos;s End left her unable to continue serving as a Judge and she resigned. { Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 2 #34 } She had a series of space travels while soul-searching, and eventually returned to Mega-City One. Dredd has had a similar experience and they can somewhat relate to each other. Dredd and Anderson are both considered veterans currently, and are regarded with awe by younger and less experienced judges. After a deadly run-in with Judge Death, she was placed in a coma { 2000 AD #1294 } and infected with the psychic Half-Life virus that would be released if she ever awoke. Judge Anderson was able to contain the virus within a web of psychic constructions and illusions, but she was slowly dying. A team of Psi-Judges was sent in to rescue her and destroy the virus; they succeeded in rescuing Anderson, at the cost of nearly the whole team, but Half Life passed on to Judge Gistane, who was then experimented on by the mad Judge Fauster so he could use the virus to achieve immortality. When Half Life was unleashed on the city causing a wave of mass murder, Anderson was the one who stopped it. { Judge Dredd Megazine #214-236 } Since exiting her coma, Anderson is still dealing with her increasing age; she is now almost fifty, and since being a Psi stops her from using the drugs and treatments that keep aging Street Judges like Dredd active, she knows she will eventually be unable to do her job.
