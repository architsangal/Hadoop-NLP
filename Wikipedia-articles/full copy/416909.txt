It was reported that the arrest took place without the knowledge of the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith. Green was held for nine hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

In a statement to Parliament on 3 December, Michael Martin Speaker of the House of Commons, responsible for the security of the Palace of Westminster, stated that, although the police undertaking the search had neither presented a search warrant nor given (what Martin said was) the requisite advice that such a warrant was necessary, the search of the Parliamentary office had been undertaken with express written consent from the Serjeant at Arms, who had signed a consent form without consulting the Clerk of the House. { http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/3546532/Damian-Green-raid-Pressure-on-Speaker-Michael-Martin-to-go.html Daily Telegraph December 3rd 2008 } The arrest of a senior opposition politician (and former journalist) on matters connected with that politician&apos;s obtaining of confidential information for release to journalists generated much comment, largely from politicians and journalists. The Conservative Party leader David Cameron was said to be &apos;angry&apos; over the action of the police. The Conservative Party issued a statement, stating that, while no one should be above the law, Green had &quot; a right &quot; to publish information in the public interest. [ June 2009 ] The constitutional expert Professor Vernon Bogdanor of Oxford University told the BBC that the row was a &quot; storm in a teacup &quot;, adding that the “important principle is that MPs - apart from when they&apos;re speaking in the chamber and dealing with constituents&apos; correspondence - are as subject to the same laws as the rest of us”.

Robertson also pointed out that much of the debate over the police action had missed the point, observing that police have operational independence, and it would have been wrong for them to have told their plans to the Prime Minister or the Home Secretary.

[ June 2009 ] The investigation and arrest of Green were conducted by the Metropolitan Police Counter-Terrorism Branch headed by Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick, who had been appointed in August 2008 as the most senior anti-terrorism officer. The arrest was criticised by political figures including Conservative Leader David Cameron, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and veteran left-wing Labour politician Tony Benn. The Prime Minister Gordon Brown made no comment over the arrest other than to say it was a police matter. The Director of the UK human rights organisation Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, wrote in The Sunday Times an article highly critical of the arrest and search of Green&apos;s offices.

I think it is a very spiteful act, possibly to intimidate me away from investigating Mr Green, and I feel it has put my family at risk.” The Conservative Party stated that it had &quot; played no part whatsoever in the publication of this story &quot;, { http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/dec/21/police-uksecurity The Guardian December 21, 2008 } and that “as the officer leading the inquiry into the allegations involving Damian Green, Assistant Commissioner Quick should display objective professionalism and not make baseless, political attacks.

I wish to make clear that it was not my intention to make any allegations and retract my comments. I apologise unreservedly for any offence or embarrassment that I have caused.” On 9 April 2009, Quick resigned his position after inadvertently revealing details of a counter-terrorist raid that was unrelated to the Green affair.

This followed the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee criticizing Home Office civil servants for prompting the investigation by using &quot; exaggerated &quot; claims about the implications for national security that the leaks held. On 18 April 2009, Damian Green claimed that arresting officers had searched his computer documents and emails for key words &quot; Shami Chakrabarti &quot;, fuelling claims that his arrest had been politically motivated. { Daily Telegraph article on Galley } Following a disciplinary hearing, Galley was sacked from the civil service on 24 April 2009 for “gross professional misconduct”. Galley claimed that Green told him: “If you are fired, we will look after you”, but that his attempts to find work have been rebuffed; Conservative MPs, Galley averred, “don&apos;t want to touch me now that I have done their dirty work”.
