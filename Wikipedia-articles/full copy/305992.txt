{ Škoda Astra tram. } A regenerative brake is an energy recovery mechanism which slows a vehicle or object down by converting its kinetic energy into another form, which can be either used immediately or stored until needed. This contrasts with conventional braking systems, where the excess kinetic energy is converted to heat by friction in the brake linings and therefore wasted. The most common form of regenerative brake involves using an electric motor as an electric generator. In electric railway s the generated electricity is fed back into the supply system, whereas in battery electric and hybrid electric vehicles, the energy is stored in a battery or bank of capacitor s for later use. Energy may also be stored mechanically via pneumatics, hydraulics or the kinetic energy of a rotating flywheel. [ The motor as a generator ] Vehicles driven by electric motor s use the motor as a generator when using regenerative braking: it is operated as a generator during braking and its output is supplied to an electrical load; the transfer of energy to the load provides the braking effect. Regenerative braking is used on hybrid gas/electric automobile s to recoup some of the energy lost during stopping. This energy is saved in a storage battery and used later to power the motor whenever the car is in electric mode. Early examples of this system were the front-wheel drive conversions of horse-drawn cabs by Louis Antoine Krieger (1868–1951). The Krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with a second set of parallel windings ( bifilar coil ) for regenerative braking.

Slowing down the speed of the cars or keeping it in hand on descending gradients, the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers.

Twenty years later, the regenerative braking system was reintroduced. Regenerative braking has been in extensive use on railways for many decades. The Baku-Tbilisi-Batumi railway (Transcaucasian railway or Georgian railway) started utilizing regenerative braking in the early 1930s. This was especially effective on the steep and dangerous Surami Pass.

The rail cars are full of thousands of tons of iron ore on the way down to Narvik, and these trains generate large amounts of electricity by their regenerative braking. From Riksgränsen on the national border to the Port of Narvik, the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate. The regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border. [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iore Iore 30 January 2011 31 January 2011 ] Any excess energy from the railway is pumped into the power grid to supply homes and businesses in the region, and the railway is a net generator of electricity. An Energy Regeneration Brake was developed in 1967 for the AMC Amitron.

Time 22 December 1967 14 August 2010 ] Many modern hybrid and electric vehicles use this technique to extend the range of the battery pack. Examples include the Toyota Prius, Honda Insight, the Vectrix electric maxi-scooter, the Tesla Roadster, the Nissan Leaf, and the Chevrolet Volt. [ Limitations ] Traditional friction -based braking is used in conjunction with mechanical regenerative braking for the following reasons: The regenerative braking effect drops off at lower speeds; therefore the friction brake is still required in order to bring the vehicle to a complete halt. Physical locking of the rotor is also required to prevent vehicles from rolling down hills. The friction brake is a necessary back-up in the event of failure of the regenerative brake. Most road vehicles with regenerative braking only have power on some wheels (as in a two-wheel drive car) and regenerative braking power only applies to such wheels because they are the only wheels linked to the drive motor, so in order to provide controlled braking under difficult conditions (such as in wet roads) friction based braking is necessary on the other wheels. The amount of electrical energy capable of dissipation is limited by either the capacity of the supply system to absorb this energy or on the state of charge of the battery or capacitors. Regenerative braking can only occur if no other electrical component on the same supply system is drawing power and only if the battery or capacitors are not fully charged. For this reason, it is normal to also incorporate dynamic braking to absorb the excess energy. Under emergency braking it is desirable that the braking force exerted be the maximum allowed by the friction between the wheels and the surface without slipping, over the entire speed range from the vehicle&apos;s maximum speed down to zero. The maximum force available for acceleration is typically much less than this except in the case of extreme high-performance vehicles. Therefore, the power required to be dissipated by the braking system under emergency braking conditions may be many times the maximum power which is delivered under acceleration. Traction motors sized to handle the drive power may not be able to cope with the extra load and the battery may not be able to accept charge at a sufficiently high rate. Friction braking is required to dissipate the surplus energy in order to allow an acceptable emergency braking performance. For these reasons there is typically the need to control the regenerative braking and match the friction and regenerative braking to produce the desired total braking output. The GM EV-1 was the first commercial car to do this. Engineers Abraham Farag and Loren Majersik were issued two patents for this brake-by-wire technology. { GM patent 5775467 – Floating electromagnetic brake system. } { GM patent 5603217 – Compliant master cylinder. } [ Electric railway vehicle operation ] During braking, the traction motor connections are altered to turn them into electrical generators. The motor fields are connected across the main traction generator (MG) and the motor armatures are connected across the load. The MG now excites the motor fields. The rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures, and the motors act as generators, either sending the generated current through onboard resistors ( dynamic braking ) or back into the supply (regenerative braking). For a given direction of travel, current flow through the motor armatures during braking will be opposite to that during motoring. Therefore, the motor exerts torque in a direction that is opposite from the rolling direction. Braking effort is proportional to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings, times that of the armature windings. Savings of 17% are claimed for Virgin Trains Pendolinos.

The Delhi Metro saved around 90,000 tons of carbon dioxide ( [ CO 2 ] ) from being released into the atmosphere by regenerating 112,500 megawatt hours of electricity through the use of regenerative braking systems between 2004 and 2007. It is expected that the Delhi Metro will save over 100,000 tons of [ CO 2 ] from being emitted per year once its phase II is complete through the use of regenerative braking. [ Delhi Metro prevents 90,000 tons of CO 2 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Earth/Delhi-Metro-Cuts-90000-tons-of-CO2/articleshow/4176147.cms India Times 23 February 2009 14 August 2010 yes ] [ September 2011 RjwilmsiBot ] Another form of simple, yet effective regenerative braking is used on the London Underground which is achieved by having small slopes leading up and down from stations. The train is slowed by the climb, and then leaves down a slope, so kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy in the station. Electricity generated by regenerative braking may be fed back into the traction power supply; either offset against other electrical demand on the network at that instant, or stored in lineside storage systems for later use. [ http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/flywheel-firm-launches.html 2011-02-13 Railway Gazette: Flywheel firm launches ] [ Comparison of dynamic and regenerative brakes ] Dynamic brakes ( &quot; rheostatic brakes &quot; in the UK), unlike regenerative brakes, dissipate the electric energy as heat by passing the current through large banks of variable resistor s. Vehicles that use dynamic brakes include forklift s, diesel-electric locomotive s, and streetcar s. This heat can be used to warm the vehicle interior, or dissipated externally by large radiator -like cowls to house the resistor banks. The main disadvantage of regenerative brakes when compared with dynamic brakes is the need to closely match the generated current with the supply characteristics and increased maintenance cost of the lines. With DC supplies, this requires that the voltage be closely controlled. Only with the development of power electronics has this been possible with AC supplies, where the supply frequency must also be matched (this mainly applies to locomotives where an AC supply is rectified for DC motors). A small number of mountain railway s have used 3-phase power supplies and 3-phase induction motors. This results in a near constant speed for all trains as the motors rotate with the supply frequency both when motoring and braking. [ Kinetic energy recovery systems ] [ Kinetic energy recovery system ] Kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) were used for the motor sport Formula One &apos;s 2009 season, and are under development for road vehicles. KERS was abandoned for the 2010 Formula One season, but re-introduced for the 2011 season. As of the 2011 season, 9 teams are using KERS, with 3 teams having not used it so far in a race.

The concept of transferring the vehicle’s kinetic energy using flywheel energy storage was postulated by physicist Richard Feynman in the 1950s [ May 2009 ] and is exemplified in such systems as the Zytek, Flybrid, [ Flybrid Systems LLP http://www.flybridsystems.com/Technology.html Flybrid Systems Flybrid Systems 2010-09-10 2010-09-17 ] Torotrak { Torotrak } [ September 2010 ] [ http://www.xtrac.com/pdfs/Torotrak_Xtrac_CVT.pdf Torotrak, Xtrac &amp; CVT pdf PDF 2010-09-17 ] and Xtrac used in F1.

[ BHR Technology. http://www.bhr-technology.com/CPC-KERS.pps Cpc-Kers Bhr-technology.com 2010-09-17 ] Xtrac and Flybrid are both licensees of Torotrak&apos;s technologies, which employ a small and sophisticated ancillary gearbox incorporating a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The CPC-KERS is similar as it also forms part of the driveline assembly. However, the whole mechanism including the flywheel sits entirely in the vehicle’s hub (looking like a drum brake). In the CPC-KERS, a differential replaces the CVT and transfers torque between the flywheel, drive wheel and road wheel.
