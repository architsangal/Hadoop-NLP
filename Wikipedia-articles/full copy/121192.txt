[ History ] Archeological research has shown that the area around Spijkenisse has been inhabited for many thousands of years. The people then depended on fishing on the Meuse and hunting in the swamps. The oldest reference to the name Spickenisse is from a source from 1231. This name comes from the words spieke ( Spit (landform) ) and nesse (nose) meaning &quot; pointy nose &quot; in reference to a spit of land protruding along the river. { Gemeente Spijkenisse } Spijkenisse formed as a farmers and fishing village at a creek along the Oude Maas. Initially it belonged to the Lord of Putten (whose coat of arms is now used by the city) but in 1459 the fiefdom Putten, including Spijkenisse, was transferred to Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. In 1581 the area came under the control of the Count of Holland. { Spijkenisse Online - geschiedenis } In the 16th century the village suffered several floods. In the 17th and 18th centuries it endured destructive fires which hampered its economic growth.
