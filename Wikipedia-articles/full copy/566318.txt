[ April 2009 April 2010 April 2010 ] A Spanish document of 1820 which certifies that the King swore the Constitution. The Trienio Liberal ( [ ˈtɾjenjo liβeˈɾal ], &quot; Liberal Triennium &quot; ) was a period of three years of liberal government in Spain. After the revolution of 1820 the movement spread quickly to the rest of Spain and the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was reinstated. The Triennium was a conflictive period, and a number of conservative intrigues and political tensions between liberals and conservatives weakened progressively the government&apos;s authority. Finally in 1823, with the approval of the crown heads of Europe, a French army invaded Spain and reinstated the King&apos;s absolute power. This invasion is known in France as the &quot; Spanish Expedition &quot; (expédition d’Espagne), and in Spain as &quot; The Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis &quot;.

The King sought to reclaim the Spanish colonies in the Americas that had recently revolted successfully, consequently depriving Spain of an important source of revenue. In January 1820, soldiers assembled at Cadiz for an expedition to South America, angry over infrequent pay, bad food, and poor quarters, mutinied under the leadership of Colonel Rafael del Riego y Nuñez. Pledging fealty to the 1812 Constitution, they seized their commander. Subsequently the rebel forces moved to nearby San Fernando where they began preparations to march on the capital of Madrid.

However, in this liberal atmosphere, political conspiracies of both right and left proliferated in Spain, as was the case across much of Europe. Liberal revolutionaries stormed the King&apos;s palace and seized Ferdinand VII who was a prisoner of the Cortes in all but name for the next three years. During this time Ferdinand retired to Aranjuez. The elections to the Cortes Generales in 1822 were won by Rafael del Riego. Ferdinand&apos;s supporters set themselves up at Urgell, took up arms and put in place an absolutist regency. Ferdinand&apos;s supporters, accompanied by the Royal Guard, staged an uprising in Madrid which was subdued by forces supporting the new government and its constitution.Despite the defeat of Ferdinand&apos;s supporters at Madrid, civil war erupted in the regions of Castile, Toledo, and Andalusia. { Luis María de Borbón y Vallabriga, 14th Count of Chinchón (1777-1823), } { Archbishop of Toledo and } { Primate of Spain, Liberal churchman who abolished the } { Spanish Inquisition in 1820.

In France, the ultra-royalists pressured Louis XVIII to intervene. To temper their counter-revolutionary ardor, the Duc de Richelieu deployed troops along the Pyrenees Mountains along the France-Spain border, charging them with halting the spread of Spanish liberalism and the &quot; yellow fever &quot; from encroaching into France. In September 1822 this &quot; cordon sanitaire &quot; became an observation corps and then very quickly transformed itself into a military expedition. The Holy Alliance ( Russia, Austria and Prussia ) refused Ferdinand&apos;s request for help, but the Quadruple Alliance ( Britain, France, the Netherlands and Austria ) at the Congress of Verona in October 1822 gave France a mandate to intervene and restore the Spanish monarchy. On 22 January 1823, a secret treaty was signed at the congress of Verona, allowing France to invade Spain to restore Ferdinand VII as an absolute monarch. With this agreement from the Holy Alliance, on 28 January 1823 Louis XVIII announced that &quot; a hundred thousand Frenchmen are ready to march, invoking the name of Saint Louis, to safeguard the throne of Spain for a grandson of Henry IV of France &quot;.
