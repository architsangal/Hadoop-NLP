The name comes from Jabłonna, the nearby village, where in 1774-1779 Bishop Michał Poniatowski (brother of Poland &apos;s last king, Stanisław Poniatowski ) built his palace (currently the House of Congresses and Conferences of the Polish Academy of Sciences). In 1892 the Russian army barracks (koszary carskie) were built near the railroad station ( ) and a local garrison of the Russian army was stationed there, as a part of Warsaw Stronghold Region ( ), until the beginning of World War I, when this region was occupied by the German troops. In 1912, Legionowo is given a city rights ( ). In 1919, Jabłonna Nowa was renamed as Legionowo to honour Polish Legions (Legiony Polskie). Ca. 1920 Institute of Aerology (currently Aerology Centre within Institute of Meteorology and Water Administration, ) was opened. During the Battle for Warsaw ( ) in August 1920, from barracks in Legionowo, General Żeligowski led the 10th Infantry Division ( ) to Radzymin, which helped to save Warsaw from the Red Army. In 1922 the Aviotex balloon and parachute factory, which also produced tents and other camping equipment (e.g. sleeping bags), opened in Legionowo After 1925, Legionowo became a summer resort for inhabitants of Warsaw, as by that time, it was a wooded and unpolluted area. Between World War I and World War II, narrow-gauge railroad line connected Legionowo with Warsaw, going through Jabłonna. In 1930 Legionowo became a commune ( ). During World War II a ward of Stalag 368 (, prison camp for lower officers and soldiers) in Beniaminowo and a ghetto were located in Legionowo. During World War II, in 1944, Legionowo took part in Warsaw uprising, as so called District 7: Collar ( ). During the first week of August 1944, Legionowo was a place of regular fights between German troops and Polish rebels. After a week or so, Germans put down the uprising and several Poles where executed in one of the military shelters near the railroad line. After World War II there was a brick factory ( ), now nonexistent. In 1950s the standard-gauge railroad line was electrified. In late 1960s, narrow-gauge railroad line was closed and in early 1970s the tracks were removed. The terminus and depot buildings remain, currently in private use. In 1960s first 4-storeys blocks of flats were built. In 1970s and 1980s, three large groups of blocks of flats (4-storeys and 11-storeys) were built. In 1977 a tin ware factory &quot; Bistyp &quot; was opened. In early 1980s, house factory was built near Legionowo, which made prefabricated elements for blocks of flats built in the region. The factory is now closed. In August 1990 the Police Training Centre ( ), one of two such institutions in Poland, was opened. After the big flood in southern parts of Poland in 1997, the Aerology Institute was equipped with Doppler meteorological radar, able to scan about 1/5 of Poland&apos;s area for storm and rain clouds.
