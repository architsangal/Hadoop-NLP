[ History ] The award was established on 3 June 1918, shortly after the formation of the RAF. It was originally awarded to air force commissioned officers and to Warrant Officer s. During the Second World War it was also awarded to Royal Artillery officers from the British Army serving on attachment to the RAF as pilots-cum-artillery directors. Since the Second World War, the award has been open to army and naval aviation officers, and since 1993 to other ranks as well; the Distinguished Flying Medal, previously awarded to other ranks, has been discontinued. Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot; DFC &quot;. A bar is added to the ribbon for holders of the DFC who received a second award. During the Great War, a total of approximately 1,100 DFCs were awarded, with 70 first bars and 3 second bars. During the Second World War, 20,354 DFCs were awarded (the most of any award), with approximately 1,550 first bars and 45 second bars. { Carter, Nick and Carter, Carol, The Distinguished Flying Cross and How It Was Won 1918-1995, (London): Savannah, 1998, ISBN 1-902366-00-X. } Honorary awards were made on 964 occasions to aircrew from other non-commonwealth countries.
