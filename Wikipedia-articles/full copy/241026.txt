It, along with the down quark, forms the neutron s (one up quark, two down quarks) and proton s (two up quarks, one down quark) of atomic nuclei. It is part of the first generation of matter, has an electric charge of + [ 2 3 ]   e and a bare mass of 1.5– [ 3.3 MeV/c2 ]. Like all quark s, the up quark is an elementary fermion with spin - 1 2, and experiences all four fundamental interaction s : gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interaction s, and strong interaction s. The antiparticle of the up quark is the up antiquark (sometimes called antiup quark or simply antiup), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. Its existence (along with that of the down and strange quark s ) was postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the Eightfold Way classification scheme of hadron s. The up quark was first observed by experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. [ History ] In the beginnings of particle physics (first half of the 20th century), hadrons such as proton s, neutron s and pion s were thought to be elementary particle s. However, as new hadrons were discovered, the &apos; particle zoo &apos; grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s. The relationships between each of them was unclear until 1961, when Murray Gell-Mann [ M. Gell-Mann 2000 1964 The Eightfold Way: A theory of strong interaction symmetry M. Gell-Manm, Y.

This classification scheme organized the hadrons into isospin multiplet s, but the physical basis behind it was still unclear. In 1964, Gell-Mann [ M.

Zweig An SU(3) Model for Strong Interaction Symmetry and its Breaking: II CERN Report No.8419/Th 8412 1964 ] (independently of each other) proposed the quark model, then consisting only of up, down, and strange quark s.

Schroeder 1995 An introduction to quantum field theory 556 Addison–Wesley 0-201-50397-2 ] [ Mass ] Despite being extremely common, the bare mass of the up quark is not well determined, but probably lies between 1.7 and [ 3.1 MeV/c2 ].. Lattice QCD calculations give more precise value: [ 2.01 0.14 MeV/c2 ]. [ Cho Adrian Mass of the Common Quark Finally Nailed Down http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/mass-of-the-common-quark-finally.html Science Magazine April 2010 ] When found in meson s (particles made of one quark and one antiquark ) or baryon s (particles made of three quarks), the &apos;effective mass&apos; (or &apos;dressed&apos; mass) of quarks become greater because of the binding energy caused by the gluon field between each quarks (see mass–energy equivalence ). For example, the effective mass of up quarks in a proton is around [ 330 MeV/c2 ]. Because the bare mass of up quarks is so light, it cannot be straightforwardly calculated because relativistic effects have to be taken into account.
