[ Ganzfeld.jpg An experiment in Sensory deprivation aiming to stimulate clairvoyance Terminology Clairvoyance the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known human sense s Telepathy Anomalous cognition ESP Remote viewing Psychometry ] The term clairvoyance (from French clair meaning &quot; clear &quot; and voyance meaning &quot; vision &quot; ) is used to refer to the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known human sense s, [ http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clairvoyance Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, Retrieved 2007-10-05 &quot; 1: the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses 2: ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception: penetration &quot; Mw1.merriam-webster.com 2011-11-17 ] { Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Retrieved 2007-10-07. The ESP entry includes clairvoyance } a form of extra-sensory perception. A person said to have the ability of clairvoyance is referred to as a clairvoyant ( &quot; one who sees clearly &quot; ). Claims for the existence of paranormal and psychic abilities such as clairvoyance are highly controversial. Parapsychology explores this possibility, but the existence of the paranormal is generally not accepted by the scientific community. Clairvoyance is often listed as an example of pseudoscience. { Dictionary.com &quot; Pseudoscience &quot; } { Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy &quot; Science and Pseudo-Science &quot; } { &quot; Science Needs to Combat Pseudoscience: A Statement by 32 Russian Scientists and Philosophers &quot; } { International Cultic Studies Association &quot; Science Fiction in Pseudoscience &quot; } [ Usage ] Within parapsychology, clairvoyance is used exclusively to refer to the transfer of information that is both contemporary to, and hidden from, the clairvoyant. It is very different from telepathy in that the information is said to be gained directly from an external physical source, rather than being transferred from the mind of one individual to another. { Glossary of Parapsychological terms - Clairvoyance — } { Parapsychological Association (2007-04-27) } Outside of parapsychology, clairvoyance is often used to refer to other forms of anomalous cognition, most commonly the perception of events that have occurred in the past, or which will occur in the future (known as retrocognition and precognition respectively), { Carrol, Robert (2003), &quot; Clairvoyance &quot; – Skeptics Dictionary, Wiley, ISBN 0-471-27242-6 } [ August 2010 ] or to refer to communications with the dead (see Mediumship ). Clairvoyance is related to remote viewing, although the term &quot; remote viewing &quot; itself is not as widely applicable to clairvoyance because it refers to a specific controlled process. Bruce Main-Smith writes, &quot; It is unfortunate, indeed careless, that clairvoyance has come to be indicative of all/most forms of purported mediumship. &quot; There are four primary channels, clairsensing, trance, healing and physical, plus a whole raft of others that do not fit neatly into any one primary channel. Clairvoyance (seeing) and clairaudience (hearing) for example are both kinds of clairsensing and belong in that main group. Many mediums who are good clairvoyants may well have little or no clairaudient capability even though both &quot; gifts &quot; belong in the primary channel of clairsensing. Remote viewing is a facet of clairvoyance and usually appears in practitioners suffering from arrested development. Trance is the ability to communicate with, and mainly to receive from, other entities, incarnate and discarnate, and may sometimes be independent of time; it is usually divided into deep trance (obliterative and so dangerous, where the operative abdicates the throne, quite common) and light trance (a high or even total degree of awareness and thus safer for the practitioner, and extremely rare when well-done). Healing is the ability to induct health benefits from some usually unspecified higher source where the healer can direct the effects to the beneficiary. Contact healing involves the healer being in the closest proximity but not necessarily touching. Absent healing is explained by its alternative name of distant healing and is independent of spatial distance. Physical mediumship includes events such as table turning, production of quasi-physical objects (even personages) and sometimes involving so-called ectoplasm. It is often said to require either total darkness or at the most a weak red light. There are many further mediumistic events, still unfortunately too often dubbed clairvoyance, which do not fit neatly into any of the four main channels. These include psychometry (establishing the history of an object), slate writing (common in Victorian times), extras appearing in photographs (seemingly no more; possibly since the advent of compound camera lenses using plastic as well as quartz-glass) and a long list of other curiosities. It is most unusual for a medium to have more than one primary channel &quot; open &quot; and under control. [ Status of clairvoyance ] The concept of clairvoyance gained some support from the US and Soviet governments both during and after the Cold War, and both governments made several attempts to harness it as an intelligence gathering tool. [ Douglas Waller Douglas C. Waller 1995-12-11 The Vision Thing http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C983829%2C00.html Time 2009-05-30 mdy ] According to skeptics, clairvoyance is the result of fraud, self- delusion, Barnum effects, confirmatory biases, or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences. For example, in a scientific experiment of clairvoyance, a purported clairvoyant participant will inevitably make correct guesses some of the time (i.e., during some of the trials within the same experiment), simply because of chance. Furthermore, because of the nature of the statistical tests used by experimenters, a very small proportion of all experiments conducted will yield an overall statistically significant result (suggesting that clairvoyance took place at above-chance levels), again simply because of chance. A proper summary of the experimental evidence on clairvoyance should include a summary of all experiments that were conducted, taking into account their probabilities of turning out false positive and false negative results, and making sure that studies are not included in the review selectively. Some researchers on clairvoyance have tended to purposefully exclude negative findings from their reviews, [ Tart, C. T. 1983 Information acquisition rates in forced-choice ESP experiments: precognition does not work as well as present-time ESP Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research 0003-1070 77 4 293–310 ] thus biasing their own conclusions. [ Clairvoyance and related phenomena throughout history ] There have been anecdotal reports of clairvoyance and &apos;clear&apos; abilities throughout history in most cultures. Often clairvoyance has been associated with religious or shaman ic figures, offices and practices. For example, ancient Hindu religious texts list clairvoyance amongst other forms of &apos;clear&apos; experiencing, as siddhi s, or &apos;perfections&apos;, skills that are yielded through appropriate meditation and personal discipline. But a large number of anecdotal accounts of clairvoyance are of the spontaneous variety among the general populace. For example, many people report seeing a loved one who has recently died before they have learned by other means that their loved one is deceased. While anecdotal accounts do not provide scientific proof of clairvoyance, such common experiences continue to motivate research into such phenomena. The earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the Marquis de Puységur, a follower of Mesmer, who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others. When he came out of the trance state he would be unaware of anything he had said or done. This behavior is somewhat reminiscent of the reported behaviors of the 20th century medical clairvoyant and psychic Edgar Cayce. It is reported that although Puységur used the term &apos;clairvoyance&apos;, he did not think of these phenomena as &quot; paranormal &quot;, since he accepted mesmerism as one of the natural sciences. Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the spiritualist period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day. Early researchers of clairvoyance included William Gregory (chemist), Gustav Pagenstecher, and Rudolf Tischner. These were largely qualitative experiments in which selected participants sought to identify a concealed target image, or to provide accurate information about the history of a target object. Charles Richet, the noted physiologist and, later, Ina Jephson, a member of the Society for Psychical Research, introduced more quantitative methods. A significant development in clairvoyance research came when J. B. Rhine, a psychologist at Duke University, introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analysing the data, as part of his research into extrasensory perception. Perhaps the best-known study of clairvoyance in recent times has been the US government-funded remote viewing project at SRI / SAIC during the 1970s through the mid-1990s; at least those studies amongst these that did not involve &quot; agents &quot; visiting or being otherwise aware of the target sites. Some parapsychologists [ May 2012 ] have proposed that our different functional labels (clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, etc.) all refer to one basic underlying mechanism, although there is not yet any satisfactory theory for what that mechanism may be. [ July 2009 ] [ Parapsychological research ] Parapsychological research studies of remote viewing and clairvoyance have produced favorable results significantly above chance, and meta-analysis of these studies increases the significance. [ September 2011 ] For instance, at the Stanford Research Institute, in 1972, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the viewers or percipients) could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or targets. In the early studies, a human sender was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term remote viewing was coined to describe this overall process. [ September 2011 ] Targ and Puthoff both believed that Uri Geller, retired police commissioner Pat Price and artist Ingo Swann all had genuine psychic abilities. { Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities, by Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, Dell Pub Co., 1978 } They published their findings in Nature { R. Targ, and H,E, Puthoff, H.E &quot; Information transfer under conditions of sensory shielding, &quot; Nature, 251, 602-607. (1974). } and the Proceedings of the IEEE. { Puthoff, H.E. and Targ, R. &quot; A Perceptual Channel for Information Transfer over kilometer distances: Historical perspective and recent research. &quot; Proc. IEEE, Vol. 64, no. 3, 329-254. (1976) } Their work however met criticism from a number of writers, such as psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann in their 1980 book The Psychology of the Psychic. { Marks, D. and Kammann, R., (1980) The Psychology of the Psychic, p26. Prometheus Books. ISBN 1-57392-798-8 } In order to explore the nature of remote viewing channel, the viewer in some experiments was secured in a double-walled copper-screened Faraday cage. Although this provided attenuation of radio signals over a broad range of frequencies, the researchers found that it did not alter the subject&apos;s remote viewing capability. They postulated that extremely low frequency (ELF) propagation might be involved, since Faraday cage screening is less effective in the ELF range. Such a hypothesis had previously been put forward by telepathy researchers in the Soviet Union. [ Kogan I Information theory analysis of telepathic communication experiments Telecommunications and Radio Engineering 23 2 March 1968 122–125 0040-2508 ] The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on psychic research to appear in a mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journal was published in Nature in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success. [ 10.1038/251602a0 Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding 1974 Russel Targ Harold Puthoff Nature 251 602–607 4423858 5476 ] One of the individuals involved in these initial studies at SRI was Uri Geller, a well-known celebrity psychic at the time. The research team reported witnessing some of Geller&apos;s trademark metal spoon-bending performances, but admitted that they were unable to conduct adequately controlled experiments to confirm any paranormal hypothesis about them. Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques were also used by team to examine ESP phenomena. In these investigations, a sender, who was isolated in a visually opaque, electrically and acoustically shielded chamber, was stimulated at random by bursts of strobe-light flickers The experimenters reported that, for one receiver, differential alpha block on control and stimulus trials were observed, which showed that some information transfer had occurred. In contrast, this person&apos;s expressed statements of when the stimulus occurred were no different than that which would be expected by chance. The researches were unable to identify the physical parameters by which the EEG effect was mediated. [ 4468758 1974 April Rebert, CS; Turner, A EEG spectrum analysis techniques applied to the problem of psi phenomena 6 1–12 18–24 0005-7932 Behavioral neuropsychiatry ] After the publication of these findings, various attempts to replicate the remote viewing findings were quickly carried out. Several of these follow-up studies, which involved viewing in group settings, reported some limited success. They included the use of face-to-face groups, [ 10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting 1976 October Hastings, A.C. Proceedings of the IEEE 64 1544–1545 Hurt D.B. 10 ] [ 10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 Preliminary experiments in group &apos;Remote viewing&apos; 1976 October Whitson, T.W.

Askevold G. 10 ] The various debates in the mainstream scientific literature prompted the editors of &apos;Proceedings of the IEEE&apos; to invite Robert Jahn, then Dean of the School of Engineering at Princeton University, to write a comprehensive review of psychic phenomena from an engineering perspective. His paper, [ 10.1109/PROC.1982.12260 The persistent paradox of psychic phenomena: An engineering perspective 1982 February Jahn, R.G. Proceedings of the IEEE 70 136–170 2 ] published in February 1982, includes numerous references to remote viewing replication studies at the time. Clairvoyance experiments involving Zener cards currently exist on the Internet. One such online system, the Anima Project, [ http://www.animaproject.org The Anima Project 2008-04-08 ] gathers user results into a master database which is then analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques. [ Skepticism ] Parapsychological research is regarded by its critics as a pseudoscience. { Marks, D.F. (2000). The Psychology of the Psychic (2nd Ed.) New York: Prometheus Books. ISBN 1-57392-798-8 } [ August 2010 ] In 1988, the US National Research Council concluded that it &quot;...finds no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years, for the existence of parapsychological phenomena. &quot; { &apos;&apos;An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural&apos;&apos; James Randi } Skeptics say that if clairvoyance were a reality it would have become abundantly clear. They also contend that those who believe in paranormal phenomena do so for merely psychological reasons. According to David G. Myers (Psychology, 8th ed.): The search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited &apos;senders&apos; to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to &apos;receivers&apos; deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem &amp; Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem &amp; others, 2001; Milton &amp; Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003). One skeptic, magician James Randi, has a longstanding offer—now U.S. $1 million—“to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions” (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi’s offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing. &quot; People&apos;s desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist. &quot; Susan Blackmore, &quot; Blackmore&apos;s first law &quot;, 2004. [ Psychiatric interpretation ] In mainstream psychiatry clairvoyance is considered as hallucination.

Clairvoyanceis French for seeing clearly. The term is used in the parapsychological literature to denote a * visual or * compound hallucination attributable to a metaphysical source. It is therefore interpreted as * telepathic, * veridical or at least * coincidental hallucination. ReferenceGuily, R.E. (1991) Harper&apos;s encyclopedia of mystical and paranormal experience.New York, NY: Castle Books. ] [ Other related terms ] The words &quot; clairvoyance &quot; and &quot; psychic &quot; are often used to refer to many different kinds of paranormal sensory experiences, but there are more specific names: [ Clairsentience (feeling/touching) ] In the field of parapsychology, clairsentience is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person acquires psychic knowledge primarily by feeling. { Parapsychological Association historical terms glossary, retrieved 2006-12-17 } The word “clear” is from the French clair, and “sentience” is derived from the Latin sentire, “to feel”. In addition to parapsychology, the term also plays a role in some religions. For example: clairsentience is one of the six human special functions mentioned or recorded in Buddhism. [ March 2012 ] It is an ability that can be obtained at advanced meditation level. Generally the term refers to a person who can feel the vibration of other people. There are many different degrees of clairsentience ranging from the perception of diseases of other people to the thoughts or emotions of other people. The ability differs from third eye in that this kind of ability cannot have a vivid picture in the mind. Instead, a very vivid feeling can form. Psychometry is related to clairsentience. The word stems from psyche and metric, which means &quot; soul-measuring &quot;. { Joseph Rodes Buchanan, Manual of Psychometry : the Dawn of a New Civilization Boston, Frank H. Hodges (4th edition), 1893 p.3 } [ Clairaudience (hearing/listening) ] In the field of parapsychology, clairaudience [from late 17th century French clair (clear) and audience (hearing)] is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person acquires information by paranormal auditory means. It is often considered to be a form of clairvoyance. { Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology, Retrieved 2006-01-24 } Clairaudience is essentially the ability to hear in a paranormal manner, as opposed to paranormal seeing (clairvoyance) and feeling ( clairsentience ). Clairaudient people have psi -mediated hearing. Clairaudience may refer not to actual perception of sound, but may instead indicate impressions of the &quot; inner mental ear &quot; similar to the way many people think words without having auditory impressions. But it may also refer to actual perception of sounds such as voices, tones, or noises which are not apparent to other humans or to recording equipment. For instance, a clairaudient person might claim to hear the voices or thoughts of the spirits of persons who are deceased. In Buddhism, it is believed that those who have extensively practiced Buddhist meditation and have reached a higher level of consciousness can activate their &quot; third ear &quot; and hear the music of the spheres; i.e. the music of the celestial gandharva s. Clairaudience may be positively distinguished from the voices heard by the mentally ill when it reveals information unavailable to the clairaudient person by normal means (including cold reading or other magic tricks), and thus may be termed &quot; psychic &quot; or paranormal. [ November 2007 ] [ Clairalience (smelling) ] Also known as clairescence. In the field of parapsychology, clairalience [presumably from late 17th century French clair (clear) and alience (smelling)] is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person accesses psychic knowledge through the physical sense of smell. [ http://www.ghostvillage.com/resources/2003/resources_10132003.shtml Supernatural Glossary Ghostvillage.com 2011-11-17 ] [ Claircognizance (knowing) ] In the field of parapsychology, claircognizance [presumably from late 17th century French clair (clear) and cognizance ( &lt; ME cognisaunce &lt; OFr conoissance, knowledge)] is a form of extra-sensory perception wherein a person acquires psychic knowledge primarily by means of intrinsic knowledge. It is the ability to know something without a physical explanation why you know it, like the concept of mediums. [ Clairgustance (tasting) ] In the field of parapsychology, clairgustance is defined as a form of extra-sensory perception that allegedly allows one to taste a substance without putting anything in one&apos;s mouth. It is claimed that those who possess this ability are able to perceive the essence of a substance from the spiritual or ethereal realms through taste.
