It is informed by the UK&apos;s history as a developed island country, major power, and its composition of four countries — England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales —each of which have preserved distinct customs, culture s and symbolism. The Industrial Revolution, with its origins in the UK, brought about major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation, and had a profound effect on the socio-economic and cultural conditions of the world. The social structure of Britain during this period has also played a central cultural role. More recently, popular culture of the UK included notable movements in music such as the British invasion and Britpop, while British literature, British cinema, British television and British poetry is respected across the world.

Irish and Ulster Scots enjoy limited use alongside English in Northern Ireland, mainly in publicly commissioned translations.

The poetry of the time was highly formal, as exemplified by the works of Alexander Pope and the English novel became popular, with Daniel Defoe &apos;s Robinson Crusoe, Henry Fielding &apos;s Tom Jones and Samuel Richardson &apos;s Pamela. From the late 18th century, the Romantic period showed a flowering of poetry comparable with the Renaissance two hundred years earlier and a revival of interest in vernacular literature. In Scotland the poetry of Robert Burns revived interest in Scots literature, and the Weaver Poets of Ulster were influenced by literature from Scotland.

The Celtic Revival stimulated a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature. The Scottish Renaissance of the early 20th century brought modernism to Scottish literature as well as an interest in new forms in the literatures of Scottish Gaelic and Scots. The English novel developed in the 20th century into much greater variety and was greatly enriched by immigrant writers. It remains today the dominant English literary form.

Popular entertainment became more important in this period than ever before, with fair-booth burlesque and mixed forms that are the ancestors of the English music hall. These forms flourished at the expense of legitimate English drama, which went into a long period of decline. By the early 19th century it was no longer represented by stage plays at all, but by the closet drama, plays written to be privately read in a &quot; closet &quot; (a small domestic room). In 1847, a critic using the pseudonym Dramaticus published a pamphlet { Dramaticus The stage as it is (1847) } describing the parlous state of British theatre. Production of serious plays was restricted to the patent theatre s, and new plays were subjected to censorship by the Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Office. At the same time, there was a burgeoning theatre sector featuring a diet of low melodrama and musical burlesque; but critics described British theatre as driven by commercialism and a &apos;star&apos; system. { James Woodfield (1984) British theatre in transition, 1889-1914 p.94.

Also associated with it was the designer William Morris, whose efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs to some extent defining the Victorian aesthetic and instigating the Arts and Crafts movement.

However, baroque was quickly replaced by a return of the Palladian form. The Georgian architecture of the 18th century was an evolved form of Palladianism. Many existing buildings such as Woburn Abbey and Kedleston Hall are in this style. Among the many architects of this form of architecture and its successors, neoclassical and romantic, were Robert Adam, Sir William Chambers, and James Wyatt.

By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component; one of the greatest exponents of this was Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace. Paxton also continued to build such houses as Mentmore Towers, in the still popular retrospective Renaissance styles. In this era of prosperity and development British architecture embraced many new methods of construction, but ironically in style, such architects as August Pugin ensured it remained firmly in the past. At the beginning of the 20th century a new form of design arts and crafts became popular, the architectural form of this style, which had evolved from the 19th century designs of such architects as George Devey, was championed by Edwin Lutyens. Arts and crafts in architecture is symbolized by an informal, non symmetrical form, often with mullion ed or lattice windows, multiple gable s and tall chimneys.

Many bleak town centre redevelopments—criticised for featuring hostile, concrete -lined &quot; windswept plazas &quot; —were the fruit of this interest, as were many equally bleak public buildings, such as the Hayward Gallery. Many Modernist inspired town centres are today in the process of being redeveloped, Bracknell town centre being a case in point. However, in the immediate post-War years many thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of council house s in vernacular style were built, giving working class people their first experience of private garden s and indoor sanitation. Modernism remains a significant force in UK architecture, although its influence is felt predominantly in commercial buildings.

The Royal Society serves as the national academy for sciences, with members drawn from many different institutions and disciplines. Formed in 1660, it is the oldest learned society still in existence. { Isaac Newton &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { Principia &apos;&apos; is one of the most influential works in the history of science. } Sir Isaac Newton &apos;s publication of the Principia Mathematica ushered in what is recognisable as modern physics. The first edition of 1687 and the second edition of 1713 framed the scientific context of the foundation of the United Kingdom. He realised that the same force is responsible for movements of celestial and terrestrial bodies, namely gravity. He was the father of classical mechanics, formulated as his three laws and as the co-inventor (with Gottfried Leibniz ) of differential calculus. He also created the binomial theorem, worked extensively on optics, and created a law of cooling. { Charles Darwin } Since Newton&apos;s time, figures from the UK have contributed to the development of most major branches of science. Examples include Michael Faraday, who, with James Clerk Maxwell, unified the electric and magnetic force s in what are now known as Maxwell&apos;s equations; James Joule, who worked extensively in thermodynamics and is often credited with the discovery of the principle of conservation of energy; Paul Dirac, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics; naturalist Charles Darwin, author of On the Origin of Species and discoverer of the principle of evolution by natural selection; Harold Kroto, the discoverer of buckminsterfullerene; William Thomson (Baron Kelvin) who drew important conclusions in the field of thermodynamics and invented the Kelvin scale of absolute zero; botanist Robert Brown discovered the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid ( Brownian motion ); and the creator of Bell&apos;s Theorem, John Stewart Bell. Other British pioneers in their field include; Joseph Lister ( Antiseptic surgery ), Edward Jenner ( Vaccination ), Florence Nightingale ( Nursing ), Richard Owen ( Palaeontology ), Sir George Cayley ( Aerodynamics ), William Fox Talbot ( Photography ), Howard Carter ( Modern Archaeology, discovered Tutankhamun ), James Hutton (Modern Geology ). { James Hutton: The Founder of Modern Geology, American Museum of Natural History } John Harrison invented the marine chronometer, a key piece in solving the problem of accurately establishing longitude at sea, thus revolutionizing and extending the possibility of safe long distance sea travel. { Sobel, Dava (1995).

Under the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s most secondary modern and grammar schools were combined to become comprehensive school s. England has many prominent private schools, often founded hundreds of years ago, which are known as public schools or independent schools. Eton, Harrow, Shrewsbury and Rugby are four of the better known. Most primary and secondary schools in both the private and state sectors have compulsory school uniforms. Allowances are almost invariably made, however, to accommodate religious dress including the Islamic hijab and Sikh bangle (kara).

In the aftermath of the second world war, public housing was dramatically expanded to create a large number of council estates, although the majority of these have since been purchased by their tenants. There is a wealth of historic country house s and stately home s in rural areas, though the majority of these are now put to other uses than private living accommodation. In recent times, more detached housing has started to be built. Also, city living has boomed with city centre population&apos;s rising rapidly. Most of this population growth has been accommodated through new apartment blocks in residential schemes, such as those in Leeds, Birmingham and Manchester. Demographic changes (see below) are putting great pressure on the housing market, especially in London and the South East. [ Living arrangements ] { semis in } { Austhorpe, } { Leeds designed for family living. } Historically most people in the United Kingdom lived either in conjugal extended families or nuclear families. This reflected an economic landscape where the general populace tended to have less spending power, meaning that it was more practical to stick together rather than go their individual ways. This pattern also reflected gender role s. Men were expected to go out to work and women were expected to stay at home and look after the families. In the 20th century the emancipation of women, the greater freedoms enjoyed by both men and women in the years following the Second World War, greater affluence and easier divorce have changed gender roles and living arrangements significantly. The general trend is a rise in single people living alone, the virtual extinction of the extended family (outside certain ethnic minority communities), and the nuclear family arguably reducing in prominence. From the 1990s, the breakup of the traditional family unit, when combined with a low interest rate environment and other demographic changes, has created great pressure on the housing market, in particular regarding the accommodation of key workers such as nurse s, other emergency service workers and teacher s, who are priced out of most housing, especially in the South East. Some research indicates that in the 21st century young people are tending to continue to live in the parental home for much longer than their predecessors.

Scotland has the kilt and Tam o&apos;shanter, and tartan clothing — pattern consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours — is a notable aspect of Gaelic culture. { M.A. Newsome, &apos;The Scottish Tartans Museum&apos;: The Scottish Tartans Museum } A traditional Welsh costume with Welsh hat is worn by some women during Eisteddfod au. In England certain military uniform s such as the Beefeater or the Queen&apos;s Guard are considered to be symbolic of Englishness, though they are not official national costumes. Morris dance rs or the costumes for the traditional English May dance are sometimes cited as examples of traditional English costume, but are only worn by participants in those events. This is in large part due to the critical role that British sensibilities have played in world clothing since the eighteenth century. Particularly during the Victorian era, British fashions defined acceptable dress for men of business. Key figures such as the future Edward VII, Edward VIII, and Beau Brummell, created the modern suit and cemented its dominance.
