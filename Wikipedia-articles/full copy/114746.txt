[ 6 ] As of the 2010 census, the city population was 5,602. [ History ] Paola City Hall Native American Indians, then Spanish explorers such as Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in 1541, and French missionary explorers in 1673 lived and traveled throughout the area of what is now Paola. Settlement of the area primarily occurred however when Kaskaskia, Peoria, Wea, and Piankeshaw Indian tribes were forced to move to the area between 1827 and 1832. [ http://www.paolachamber.org/ Paola History 2009-12-02 Paola Chamber of Commerce ] These formed the Confederated Allied Tribe which was led by Baptiste Peoria who was of both French and Indian ethnicity. They called their settlement Peoria Village. { &quot; Miami County 2009 Visitors Guide &quot;, pages 13-15 } By the 1840s, settlers were moving into the area, and several missionaries lived in and near &quot; Peoria Village &quot;. One of those missionaries was an Italian priest who moved to the area in 1852. The priest, Father Paul D. Ponziglione, was credited with renaming Peoria Village to Paola, after a small town on the coast of Calabria, Italy. The Peoria Indians of the area continued to call it Paola, because they had great respect for Father Ponziglione. By 1854 there was a large number of settlers who moved to the settlement and a town plat was laid out by 1855. In 1855, the First Territorial Legislature passed an act that incorporated the Paola Town Company. The Paola Town Company and specifically its member Baptiste Peoria with his wife Mary Ann Isaacs are credited as being influential in the founding and development of Paola through the mid 1860&apos;s. Following Kansas&apos; admission to the Union in 1861, and after the American Civil War pressure to move the native American Indian tribes increased, and they were exiled to Oklahoma by 1868. Some individuals stayed and became citizens of the United States, however, their leader Baptiste Peoria left Paola with the tribe. From the late 1860s and through the 1870s, Paola grew and progressed, building its first school, jail, and bank. The railroad came to serve Paola in 1870, which also aided its progress through this time. Following the discovery of natural gas in 1882, Paola became the first town west of the Mississippi River to use it commercially and have the town illuminated using natural gas lanterns. In 1898 the Miami County Courthouse was built, designed by architect George Washburn. Several homes and buildings were designed by Washburn, including the Paola Park&apos;s gazebo and the Paola Free Library. Martha Smith had the Paola Library building constructed in honor of her husband John, a wine maker. It was completed in 1906 and the Paola Park Square&apos;s Victorian-style gazebo is from 1913. The library, courthouse, gazebo, and several homes are among those still in use today. [ Paola Park Square ] Paola Park Square&apos;s Gazebo Paola&apos;s town square has much historical significance, beginning with the Indian tribes who once lived in the area and used it as their primary gathering place. Prior to their exile to Oklahoma, Indian leader Baptiste Peoria gave this area to the Paola Town Company (of which he was a member) as a treaty of peace. The Paola Town Company later gave the square to the City of Paola, with the provision that no building be built on it. This provision has been honored to this day. In 1867, the original gazebo was put on the square, and was a bandstand. In the 1800s the square was used as a track for racing horses in addition to serving as a central point for parades, celebrations, and other community events. In 1913, a new Victorian-style gazebo was built, designed by George Washburn. Today, the Paola Park Square is still honored as the center of the downtown area, and remains a central meeting and gathering place during various community events each year. The 1913 gazebo is still used, a common place for events such as weddings. Next to the gazebo are two replicas of the Wellsbach gas street lanterns that once illuminated Paola. Also near the gazebo in the Paola Square is a bust of Paola founders Baptiste Peoria and his wife, Mary Ann Isaacs Dagenet. It is the only known monument in the United States featuring a Native American and his wife. A fountain in the center of the square was also added for people to enjoy.
