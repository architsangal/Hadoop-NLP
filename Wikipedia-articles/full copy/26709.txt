During filming, star Lana Turner &apos;s possessive gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery. He stormed onto the set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him flat on his back.

In 1959, Connery landed a leading role in Robert Stevenson &apos;s Walt Disney Productions film Darby O&apos;Gill and the Little People (1959) alongside Albert Sharpe, Janet Munro, and Jimmy O&apos;Dea. The film is a tale about a wily Irishman and his battle of wits with leprechauns. Upon the film&apos;s initial release, A. H.

He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. [ playboy196511 ] He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) – then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. Sean Connery&apos;s selection as James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of Cubby Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading Cubby that Sean Connery was the right man. { Sean Connery: The Measure Of A Man, by Christopher Bray and http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1455828/Dana-Broccoli.html and http://www.jamesbondwiki.com/page/Dana+Broccoli } James Bond&apos;s creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery&apos;s casting, saying, &quot; He&apos;s not what I envisioned of James Bond looks &quot; and &quot; I’m looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man, &quot; adding that Connery (muscular, 6&apos; 2 &quot;, and a Scot) was unrefined. However, Fleming&apos;s girlfriend told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma. Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No premiere; he was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for the literary James Bond in the later novels. Connery&apos;s portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Robert Cotton wrote in one Connery biography that Lois Maxwell (the first Miss Moneypenny ) noticed, &quot; Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat. &quot; Cotton wrote, &quot; Some cast members remarked that Connery was simply doing a Terence Young impression, but Young and Connery knew they were on the right track. &quot; [ http://www.hmss.com/films/young.htm Terence Young: James Bond&apos;s Creator? hmss.com 29 September 2007 ] The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbol s of film.

[ Beyond Bond ] Connery in 1988 Although Bond had made him a star, Connery did not like the role, saying that he was &quot; fed up to here with the whole Bond bit &quot;. [ playboy196511 ] While making the Bond films, Connery also starred in other acclaimed films such as Alfred Hitchcock &apos;s Marnie (1964) and Murder on the Orient Express (1974). Apart from The Man Who Would Be King and The Wind and the Lion, both released in 1975, most of Connery&apos;s successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts in films such as Murder on the Orient Express (1974) with Vanessa Redgrave and John Gielgud and A Bridge Too Far (1977) co-starring Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Olivier. { A Bridge Too Far (1977) – Full cast and crew } In 1981, Connery appeared in the film Time Bandits as Agamemnon. The casting choice derives from a joke Michael Palin included in the script, in which he describes the character removing his mask as being &quot; Sean Connery  — or someone of equal but cheaper stature &quot;.

After his experience with Never Say Never Again in 1983 and the following court case, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. Following the successful European production The Name of the Rose (1986), for which he won a BAFTA award, Connery&apos;s interest in more commercial material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in Highlander showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which would become a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed Irish-American cop in The Untouchables (1987) earned him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, his sole nomination throughout his career. His subsequent box-office hits included Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), in which he played Henry Jones Sr., the title character&apos;s father, The Hunt for Red October (1990) (where he was reportedly called in at two weeks&apos; notice), The Russia House (1990), The Rock (1996), and Entrapment (1999). In 1996, he voiced the role of Draco the dragon in the film Dragonheart. Both Last Crusade and The Rock alluded to his James Bond days. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wanted &quot; the father of Indiana Jones &quot; (although Connery is only 12 years older than Ford) to be Connery since Bond directly inspired the Indiana Jones series, while his character in The Rock, John Patrick Mason, was a British secret service agent imprisoned since the 1960s. In 1998, Sean Connery received a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award. In recent years, Connery&apos;s films have included several box office and critical disappointments such as First Knight (1995), The Avengers (1998), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), but he also received positive reviews, including his performance in Finding Forrester (2000). He also later received a Crystal Globe for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. [ Retirement ] Connery, 1999 Connery stated in interviews for the film (included on the DVD release) that he was offered a role in The Lord of the Rings series, [ February 2011 ] declining it due to &quot; not understanding the script. &quot; CNN reported that the actor was offered up to 15% of the worldwide box office receipts to play Gandalf, which had he accepted, could have earned him as much as $400  million for the trilogy.
