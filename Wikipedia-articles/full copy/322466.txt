Whitbread Best Beer commercial (1982). United Kingdom. } &quot; Abdul Abulbul Amir &quot; is a poem written in 1877 (during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) ) by Percy French and later set to music. It tells the story of two valiant heroes — a Russian, Ivan Skavinsky Skavar, and one of the Sultan&apos;s mameluke s, Abdul Abulbul Amir — who because of their pride end up in a fight and kill each other. The poem inspired an MGM cartoon in the 1940s and a series of beer ads by Whitbread in the 1980s. Frank Crumit, who was famous for his renditions of it, wrote three sequels: &quot; The Return of Abdul Abulbul Amir &quot;, &quot; The Grandson Of Abdul Abulbul Amir &quot;, and &quot; Minnie Skavinsky Skavar &quot;.

But the bravest of all, at least so I am told— Was Abdullah Bul Bul Ameer. If you wanted a man to encourage the van Or to harass the foe from the rear Or to storm a redoubt, you had but to shout For Abdullah Bul Bul Ameer There were heroes in plenty, good men known to fame In the army then led by the Czar. But none of more fame than a man by the name Of Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. He could imitate Irving, tell fortunes with cards He could play on the Spanish guitar In fact quite the cream of the Muscovite team Was Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. One day this bold Russian had shouldered his gun, And with his most cynical sneer, Was looking for fun when he happened to run Upon Abdullah Bul Bul Ameer. &quot; Young man, &quot; said Bul Bul, &quot; is existence so dull That you&apos;re anxious to end your career? For, infidel, know you have trod on the toe Of Abdullah Bul Bul Ameer. &quot; So take your last look upon sunshine and brook. Send your regrets to the Czar. By which I imply you are going to die Mr. Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. &quot; Then the brave Marmaduke drew his trusty skilbouk. Crying, &quot; Allah, il Allah! Allah ! &quot; And on slaughter intent, he ferociously went For Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. On a stone by the banks where the Danube doth roll, Inscribed in characters clear, Is &quot; Stranger, remember to pray for the soul Of Abdullah Bul Bul Ameer. &quot; A Muscovite maiden her sad vigil keeps In her home by the cold Northern Star And the name that she murmurs in vain as she weeps, Is Ivan Skavinsky Skivar. Lyrics as recorded in The New Harvard Songbook (1896) [ Cartoon ] &quot; Mr Ameer! Put up your hands and fight! &quot; The song was adapted in 1941 into an MGM cartoon, Abdul the Bulbul-Ameer, with Fred Quimby producing and direction by Hugh Harman.

In this version, Abdul is depicted as a bully who picks on Ivan&apos;s dwarf friend, provoking Ivan into treading on the Turk&apos;s toe. He has many traits of 1930s and 1940s cartoon villain s, such as Bluto, including thick lips, a beard and a big belly. There is a brief swordfight, which soon changes into a brawl, that ends with Ivan and Abdul literally &quot; out cold &quot;. The more positive portrayal of the Russians could have been due to the newly formed alliance between Britain and the USSR following Hitler&apos;s invasion of the Soviet Union in the year of the cartoon&apos;s production and release. [ January 2011 ] [ Commercial ] In the 1980s Whitbread adapted the song using their own lyrics for a series of commercials on British television, suggesting that the two protagonists were great fans of their beer who squabbled over trivialities, because they had forgotten that &quot; the best best needs no etiquette &quot;. The commercials starred Stephen Fry as Ivan, Tony Cosmo as Abdul, Tim McInnerny and Roy Castle, and were directed by Paul Weiland.
