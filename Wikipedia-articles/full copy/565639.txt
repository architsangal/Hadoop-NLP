It lies on the south shore of the Ottawa River about halfway between Downtown Ottawa and Downtown Montreal in United Counties of Prescott and Russell. The Long-Sault Bridge (replacing the Perley Bridge) links it to Grenville, Quebec, to the north. It is located 25  km west of Lachute, Quebec. Hawkesbury is touted as the third most bilingual town in Ontario, with about 70% of its inhabitants being fluent in English and French, the two official languages of Canada. ( West Nipissing is first with 73.4% followed by Hearst at 71%.) 89% of the population is made up of French speaking Franco-Ontarian s. Development on the outskirts has hurt some of the business and the Main Street is slowly recovering. [ History ] Founded in 1798, Hawkesbury was named after Charles Jenkinson, Baron Hawkesbury. { Hawkesbury, The Canadian Encyclopedia } Thomas Mears and David Pattee, two Americans, entered into a partnership in 1805 to harness the power of the lower Ottawa River and built the first sawmill on the Upper Canada side of the river. The town of Hawkesbury developed around this mill. { David Pattee, Dictionary of Canadian Biography online } Mears also built the Union, the Ottawa River&apos;s first steamer. Demand for timber during the Napoleonic Wars created a boom. Hamilton Sawmill, Hawkesbury, around 1859. Workers holding measuring sticks at the Hawksbury Mills, around 1895. Timber and pulp-and-paper industries have been supplanted by textiles, synthetic fibres, metal extrusions, steel, glass and plastics. Hawkesbury has also become the business and service centre of the county of Prescott-Russell, although recently Rockland has become the largest community. { According to Rockland has a population of 12,637, while according to, Hawkesbury has a population of 10,314 } The Grenville Canal on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River opposite Hawkesbury is an important link in the river&apos;s transportation system. The only interprovincial bridge between Ontario and Quebec east of Ottawa is located here. Part of Hawkesbury was submerged by a Hydro-Québec dam built between 1950 and 1962. New developments today are happening due to baby boomers from Ottawa, Montreal and area purchasing some of the many new condos in towers.
