[ Darwin&apos;s finches Darwin&apos;s finches by Gould.jpg Large Ground Finch, Medium Ground Finch Small Tree Finch, Warbler Finch Animal ia Chordata Aves Passeriformes Thraupidae Genera Geospiza Camarhynchus /Platyspiza Certhidea Pinaroloxias ] Darwin&apos;s finches (also known as the Galápagos finches or as Geospizinae) are a group of about 15 species of passerine birds. [ Grant Grant 2008 3 ] It is still not clear which bird family they belong to, but they are not related to the true finch es. They were first collected by Charles Darwin on the Galápagos Islands during the second voyage of the &apos;&apos;Beagle&apos;&apos;. All are found only on the Galápagos Islands, except the Cocos Island Finch from Cocos Island. The term Darwin&apos;s Finches was first applied by Percy Lowe in 1936, and popularised in 1947 by David Lack in his book Darwin&apos;s Finches. { Lack, David. 1947. Darwin&apos;s Finches. Cambridge University Press (reissued in 1961 by Harper, New York, with a new preface by Lack; reissued in 1983 by Cambridge University Press with an introduction and notes by Laurene M. Ratcliffe and Peter T. Boag). ISBN 0-521-25243-1 } [ Steinheimer 2004 300 ] The birds vary in size from 10 to 20  cm and weigh between 8 and 38  grams. The smallest is the Warbler Finch and the largest is the Vegetarian Finch. The most important differences between species are in the size and shape of their beaks, and the beaks are highly adapted to different food sources. The birds are all dull-coloured. [ Darwin&apos;s theory ] During the survey voyage of HMS &apos;&apos;Beagle&apos;&apos;, Darwin had no idea of the significance of the birds of the Galápagos. He had learned how to preserve bird specimens while at the University of Edinburgh and had been keen on shooting, but he had no expertise in ornithology and by this stage of the voyage concentrated mainly on geology. { Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. 2009 &quot; Darwin in Galapagos: Footsteps to a New World &quot; Princeton University Press, Princeton. } In Galápagos he mostly left bird shooting to his servant Syms Covington. [ Steinheimer 2004 301–303 ] Nonetheless, these birds were to play an important part in the inception of Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution by natural selection. On the Galápagos Islands and afterward, Darwin thought in terms of &quot; centres of creation &quot; and rejected ideas of transmutation of species. [ Keynes 2000 xix. ] {       } [ Eldredge 2006 ] From Henslow &apos;s teaching he was interested in geographical distribution of species, particularly links between species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents. On Chatham Island he recorded that a mockingbird was similar to those he had seen in Chile, and after finding a different one on Charles Island he carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught. In contrast he paid little attention to the finches. When examining his specimens on the way to Tahiti Darwin noted that all the mockingbirds on Charles Island were of one species, those from Albemarle of another, and those from James and Chatham Islands of a third species. As they sailed home about nine months later this, together with other facts including what he&apos;d heard about Galápagos tortoise s, made him wonder about the stability of species. [ http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html Darwin&apos;s field notes on the Galapagos: &apos;A little world within itself&apos; Gordon Chancellor Randal Keynes October 2006 Darwin Online ] [ Eldredge 2006 ] Following his return from the voyage, Darwin presented the finches to the Geological Society of London at their meeting on 4 January 1837, along with other mammal and bird specimens he had collected. The bird specimens, including the finches, were given to John Gould, the famous English ornithologist, for identification. Gould set aside his paying work and at the next meeting on 10 January reported that birds from the Galápagos Islands which Darwin had thought were blackbirds, &quot; gross-beaks &quot; and finch es were in fact &quot; a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar [as to form] an entirely new group, containing 12 species. &quot; This story made the newspapers. [ Desmond Moore 1991 209 ] [ Sulloway 1982 57–58 ] Darwin had been in Cambridge at that time. In early March he met Gould again and for the first time got a full report on the findings, including the point that his Galápagos &quot; wren &quot; was another closely allied species of finch. The mockingbird s Darwin had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties. Gould found more species than Darwin had anticipated, [ Desmond Moore 1991 248 ] and concluded that 25 of the 26 land birds were new and distinct forms, found nowhere else in the world but closely allied to those found on the South America n continent. Darwin now saw that if the finch species were confined to individual islands, like the mockingbirds, this would help to account for the number of species on the islands, and he sought information from others on the expedition. Specimens had also been collected by Captain Robert FitzRoy, FitzRoy’s steward Harry Fuller and Darwin&apos;s servant Covington, who had labelled them by island. [ Sulloway 2006 ] From these, Darwin tried to reconstruct the locations where he had collected his own specimens. The conclusions supported his idea of the transmutation of species. [ Text from the Voyage of the Beagle ] At the time he rewrote his diary for publication as Journal and Remarks (later The Voyage of the Beagle ), he described Gould&apos;s findings on the number of birds, noting that &quot; Although the species are thus peculiar to the archipelago, yet nearly all in their general structure, habits, colour of feathers, and even tone of voice, are strictly American &quot;. [ Darwin 1839 461–462 ] In the first edition of The Voyage of the Beagle Darwin said that &quot; It is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak, from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest gros-beak, to another differing but little from that of a warbler &quot;. [ Darwin 1839 462. ] In 1839 Darwin conceived of his theory of natural selection, and by the time of the second edition in 1845 Darwin had brought together his theory. He now added two closing sentences: &quot; Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends &quot;. [ Darwin 1845 379–380 ] [ Darwin 1887 ] [ Darwin 1845 380. ] [ Text from the Origin of Species ] Darwin discussed the divergence of species of birds in the Galápagos more explicitly in his chapter on geographical distribution in On the Origin of Species : [ Darwin 1859 397–398. ] [ Polymorphism in Darwin&apos;s finches ] Whereas Darwin spent just five weeks in the Galápagos, and David Lack spent three months, Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have made research trips to the Galápagos for about thirty years, particularly studying Darwin&apos;s finches. Here we look briefly at the case of the large cactus finch Geospiza conirostris on Isla Genovesa (formerly Tower Island) which is formed from a shield volcano, and is home to a variety of birds. These birds, like all well-studied groups, { Huxley J. 1955. Morphism in birds. 11th Int Ornith Cong (Basel 1954, p309-328) touches on this theme. } show various kinds of morphism. Males are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B are quite distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males. This is also a clear difference. With these beaks males are able to feed differently on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear Opuntia. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit and eat the fleshy aril pulp which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base and eat the pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce. If the population is panmixic, { B. Rosemary Grant and Peter R. Grant 1989. Evolutionary dynamics of a natural population: the large cactus finch of the Galápagos. Chicago, p241 first para. } { Grant, Peter R. 1999. Ecology and evolution of Darwin&apos;s finches. Princeton NJ, p428 in Afterword. } then Geospiza conirostris exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent sympatric speciation. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species&apos; niche by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified in the absence of a detailed breeding program, but two loci with linkage disequilibrium { Maynard Smith J. 1998. Evolutionary genetics. 2nd ed, Chapter 5, Oxford. } is a possibility. Another interesting dimorphism is for the bills of young finches, which are either &apos;pink&apos; or &apos;yellow&apos;. All species of Darwin&apos;s finches exhibit this morphism, which lasts for two months. No interpretation of this phenomenon is known. { Grant, Peter R. 1999. Ecology and evolution of Darwin&apos;s finches. Princeton NJ. (see plate 7) } [ Taxonomy ] [ Family ] For some decades taxonomists have placed these birds in the family Emberizidae with the New World sparrows and Old World buntings (Sulloway 1982). However, the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy puts Darwin&apos;s finches with the tanager s (Monroe and Sibley 1993), and at least one recent work follows that example (Burns and Skutch 2003). The American Ornithologists&apos; Union, in its North America n check-list, places the Cocos Island Finch in the Emberizidae but with an asterisk indicating that the placement is probably wrong (AOU 1998–2006); in its tentative South America n check-list, the Galápagos species are incertae sedis, of uncertain place (Remsen et al. 2007).

BMP4 acts in the developing embryo to lay down skeletal features, including the beak. [ Abzhanov Arhat Meredith Protas, B. Rosemary Grant, Peter R. Grant, Clifford J. Tabin September 3, 2004 Bmp4 and Morphological Variation of Beaks in Darwin&apos;s Finches Science 305 5689 1462–1465 AAAS USA 0036-8075 15353802 10.1126/science.1098095 1644869 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci%3B305/5689/1462 2008-03-08 ] The same group showed that the different beak shapes of Darwin&apos;s finches develop are also influenced by slightly different timing and spatial expression of a gene called calmodulin (CaM). [ Abzhanov Arhat Winston P. Kuo, Christine Hartmann, B. Rosemary Grant, Peter R. Grant and Clifford J. Tabin August 3, 2006 The calmodulin pathway and evolution of elongated beak morphology in Darwin&apos;s finches Nature 442 563–567 Nature Publishing Group UK 0028-0836 16885984 10.1038/nature04843 1586310 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7102/abs/nature04843.html 2008-03-08 7102 ] Calmodulin acts in a similar way to BMP4, affecting some of the features of beak growth. The authors suggest that changes in the temporal and spatial expression of these two factors are possible developmental controls of beak morphology.
