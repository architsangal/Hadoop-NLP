[ the term in mathematics Lexicographical order ] [ May 2009 ] Lexicography is divided into two related disciplines: Practical lexicography is the art or craft of compiling, writing and editing dictionaries. Theoretical lexicography is the scholarly discipline of analyzing and describing the semantic, syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships within the lexicon (vocabulary) of a language, developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situation, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries. This is sometimes referred to as &apos;metalexicography&apos;. A person devoted to lexicography is called a lexicographer. General lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of general dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that provide a description of the language in general use. Such a dictionary is usually called a general dictionary or LGP dictionary (Language for General Purpose). Specialized lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of specialized dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that are devoted to a (relatively restricted) set of linguistic and factual elements of one or more specialist subject fields, e.g. legal lexicography. Such a dictionary is usually called a specialized dictionary or LSP dictionary and following Nielsen 1994, specialized dictionaries are either multi-field, single-field or sub-field dictionaries. There is some disagreement on the definition of lexicology, as distinct from lexicography. Some use &quot; lexicology &quot; as a synonym for theoretical lexicography; others use it to mean a branch of linguistics pertaining to the inventory of words in a particular language. It is now widely accepted that lexicography is a scholarly discipline in its own right and not a sub-branch of applied linguistics, as the chief object of study in lexicography is the dictionary (see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp 2009). [ Etymology ] thumb Coined in English 1680, the word &quot; lexicography &quot; derives from the Greek &quot; λεξικογράφος &quot; (lexikographos), &quot; lexicographer &quot;, { λεξικογράφος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library } from &quot; λεξικόν &quot; (lexicon), neut. of &quot; λεξικός &quot; (lexikos), &quot; of or for words &quot;, { λεξικός, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library } from &quot; λέξις &quot; (lexis), &quot; speech &quot;, &quot; word &quot;, { λέξις, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library } (in turn from &quot; λέγω &quot; – lego, &quot; to say &quot;, &quot; to speak &quot; { λέγω, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library } ) + &quot; γράφω &quot; (grapho), &quot; to scratch, to inscribe, to write &quot;. { γράφω, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library } [ Aspects ] Practical lexicographic work involves several activities, and the compilation of well crafted dictionaries require careful consideration of all or some of the following aspects: Profiling the intended users (i.e. linguistic and non-linguistic competences) and identifying their needs Defining the communicative and cognitive functions of the dictionary Selecting and organizing the components of the dictionary Choosing the appropriate structures for presenting the data in the dictionary (i.e. frame structure, distribution structure, macro-structure, micro-structure and cross-reference structure) Selecting words and affixes for systematization as entries Selecting collocation s, phrases and examples Choosing lemma forms for each word or part of word to be lemmatized Defining words Organizing definitions Specifying pronunciations of words Labeling definitions and pronunciations for register and dialect, where appropriate Selecting equivalents in bi- and multilingual dictionaries Translating collocations, phrases and examples in bi- and multilingual dictionaries Designing the best way in which users can access the data in printed and electronic dictionaries One important goal of lexicography is to keep the lexicographic information cost s incurred by dictionary users as low as possible. Nielsen (2008) suggests relevant aspects for lexicographers to consider when making dictionaries as they all affect the users&apos; impression and actual use of specific dictionaries. Theoretical lexicography (or metalexicography) concerns the same aspects as lexicography, but is meant to lead to the development of principles that can improve the quality of future dictionaries, for instance in terms of access to data and lexicographic information costs. Several perspectives or branches of such academic dictionary research have been distinguished: &apos;dictionary criticism&apos; (or evaluating the quality of one or more dictionaries, e.g. by means of reviews (see Nielsen 2009)), &apos;dictionary history&apos; (or tracing the traditions of a type of dictionary or of lexicography in a particular country or language), &apos;dictionary typology&apos; (or classifying the various genres of reference works, such as dictionary versus encyclopedia, monolingual versus bilingual dictionary, general versus technical or pedagogical dictionary), &apos;dictionary structure&apos; (or formatting the various ways in which the information is presented in a dictionary), &apos;dictionary use&apos; (or observing the reference acts and skills of dictionary users), and &apos;dictionary IT&apos; (or applying computer aids to the process of dictionary compilation). One important consideration is the status of &apos;bilingual lexicography&apos;, or the compilation and use of the bilingual dictionary in all its aspects (see e.g. Nielsen 1994). In spite of a relatively long history of this type of dictionary, it is often said to be less developed in a number of respects than its unilingual counterpart, especially in cases where one of the languages involved is not a major language. Not all genres of reference works are available in interlingual versions, e.g. LSP, learners&apos; and encyclopedic types, although sometimes these challenges produce new subtypes, e.g. &apos;semi-bilingual&apos; or &apos;bilingualised&apos; dictionaries such as Hornby&apos;s (Oxford) Advanced Learner&apos;s Dictionary English-Chinese, which have been developed by translating existing monolingual dictionaries (see Marello 1998).
