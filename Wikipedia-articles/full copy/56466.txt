The disorder affects all neural crest cells ( Schwann cells, melanocytes and endoneurial fibroblasts). Cellular elements from these cell types proliferate excessively throughout the body, forming tumors; melanocytes also function abnormally in this disease, resulting in disordered skin pigmentation and café au lait spot s. The tumors may cause bumps under the skin, colored spots, skeletal problems, pressure on spinal nerve root s, and other neurological problems. [ Rubin&apos;s Pathology: Clinicopathologic Foundation of Medicine Raphael Rubin, David S. Strayer Wolters Kluwer Health: Lippincot Williams &amp; Wilkins 5 2008 Baltimore 201–3 978-0-7817-9516-6 ] Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means only one copy of the affected gene is needed for the disorder to develop. Therefore, if only one parent has neurofibromatosis, his or her children have a 50% chance of developing the condition as well. The severity in affected individuals can vary, this may be due to variable expressivity. Approximately half of cases are due to de novo mutations and no other affected family members are seen. It affects males and females equally. [ Classification ] [ Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) ] { morbidity in the affected individuals. } [ Neurofibromatosis type I ] Neurofibromatosis type 1 (also known as &quot; von Recklinghausen disease &quot; ) is the most common form of NF, accounting for up to 90% of the cases. NF 1 has a disorder frequency of 1 in 4,000, making it more common than neurofibromatosis type 2, with a frequency of 1 in 45,000 people. It occurs following the mutation of neurofibromin [ March 2012 ] on chromosome 17 q 11.2; the large size of the NF1 gene (286kbp) and presence of many homologous regions may predispose it to mutations. 100,000 Americans have neurofibromatosis. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor gene whose function is to inhibit the p21 ras oncoprotein. [ John Barone USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Pathology 2008 KAPLAN Inc 57 ] In absence of this tumor suppressor&apos;s inhibitory control on the ras oncoprotein, cellular proliferation is erratic and uncontrolled, resulting in unbalanced cellular proliferation and tumor development. The diagnosis of NF1 is made if any two of the following nine criteria are met: Patient with multiple small cutaneous neurofibromas and a &apos;café au lait spot&apos; (bottom of photo, to the right of centre). A biopsy has been taken of one of the lesions.

It accounts for only 10% of all cases of NF, and its frequency is lower than NF1. It is also caused by a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene NF2 (whose gene product is schwannomin or merlin). The normal function of merlin is not well understood. The disorder manifests in the following fashion: headaches balance problem s, and peripheral vertigo often due to schwannoma and involvement of the inner ear facial weakness / paralysis due to involvement or compression of the facial nerve (cranial nerve 7 or CN VII) patients with NF2 may also develop other brain tumors, as well as spinal tumors. deafness and tinnitus NF 2 increases the risk of meningiomas and ependymoma s. [ Schwannomatosis ] [ Schwannomatosis ] Schwannomatosis - mutation in both chromosomes 17 and 22 Multiple schwannoma s occur. The schwannomas develop on cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves. Chronic pain, and sometimes numbness, tingling and weakness About 1/3 of patients have segmental schwannomatosis, which means the schwannomas are limited to a single part of the body, such as an arm, a leg or the spine. Unlike the other forms of NF, the schwannomas do not develop on vestibular nerves, and as a result, no loss of hearing is associated with schwannomatosis. Patients with schwannomatosis do not have learning disabilities related to the disorder. One must keep in mind, however, that neurofibromatosis can occur in or affect any of the organ systems, whether that entails simply compressing them (from tumor growth) or in fact altering the organs in some fundamental way. This disparity in the disorder is one of many factors that makes it difficult to diagnose, and eventually find a prognosis for. [ Other variants ] [ January 2012 ] Neurofibromatosis type 3 Neurofibromatosis type 4 Neurofibromatosis type 5 [ Related disorders ] Neurofibromatosis is considered a member of the neurocutaneous syndrome s (phakomatoses). In addition to the types of neurofibromatosis, the phakomatoses also include tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome and von Hippel-Lindau disease. This grouping is an artifact of an earlier time in medicine, before the distinct genetic basis of each of these diseases was understood. [ Signs and symptoms ] Patients with neurofibromatosis can be affected in many different ways. Morbidity is often a result of plexiform neuromas, optic gliomas, or acoustic neuromas, but mortality can also be associated with malignant transformation of the neuromas, such as neurofibrosarcomas (often there is a malignant transformation in less than 3% of the cases of NF1 ). There is a high incidence of learning disabilities or cognitive deficit in patients with NF, particularly NF-1, however severe retardation is not part of the syndrome. Because of the tumor generating nature of the disorder and its involvement of the nervous system and also because of early onset macrocephaly in the pediatric population, there is often an increased chance of development of epilepsy in those affected. Neurofibromatosis also increases the risk of leukemia particularly in children; Children with NF-1 have 200 to 500 times the normal risk of developing leukemia compared to the general population. Since the tumors grow where there are nerves, they can also grow in areas that are visible, causing considerable social suffering for those affected. The tumors can also grow in places that can cause other medical issues that may require them to be removed for the patient&apos;s safety. [ Gamma Knife surgery for abducent nerve schwannoma.

[ Genetics ] { NF-1 and } { NF-2 may be inherited in an } { autosomal dominant fashion, as well as through random mutation. } Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by mutation on chromosome 17 q 11.2, the gene product being neurofibromin [ March 2012 ] (a regulator of the GTPase activating enzyme (GAP)). [ Fauci, et al Harrison&apos;s Principles of Internal Medicine (Small textbook) 16 2453 ] Neurofibromatosis type 2 is due to mutation on chromosome 22 q, the gene product is merlin, a cytoskeletal protein. Both NF-1 and NF-2 are autosomal dominant disorders, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene need be inherited to pass the disorder. A child of a parent with NF-1 or NF-2 and an unaffected parent will have a 50%-100% chance of inheriting the disorder, depending on whether the affected parent is heterozygous (Aa) or homozygous (AA) for the trait ( &quot; A &quot; depicts the affected dominant allele, while &quot; a &quot; depics the recessive allele). Complicating the question of heritability is the distinction between genotype and phenotype, that is, between the genetics and the actual manifestation of the disorder. In the case of NF1, no clear links between genotype and phenotype have been found, and the severity and the specific nature of the symptoms may vary widely among family members with the disorder. This is a good example of the phenomenon of variable expressivity: the differing severities of disease in different individuals with the same genotype. [ Bruce R. Korf, Allan E. Rubenstein Neurofibromatosis: a handbook for patients, families, and health care professionals Thieme 2005 2 978-1-58890-301-3 ] In the case of NF-2, however, manifestations are similar among family members; a strong genotype-phenotype correlation is believed to exist. Both NF-1 and NF-2 can also appear to be spontaneous de novo mutations, with no family history. These cases account for about one half of neurofibromatosis cases. Similar to polydactyly, NF is also an autosomally dominant mutation, that is not prevalent in the society. Neurofibromatosis-1 is found in approximately 1 in 2,500-3,000 live births (carrier incidence 0.0004, gene frequency 0.0002) and is more common than NF-2. [ Pathophysiology ] The gene affected in NF-1, is located on the long arm of the chromosome 17 (q11.2). It encodes for a protein called neurofibromin, otherwise known as a &quot; tumor suppressor &quot; protein. This protein is a negative regulator of the Ras kinase pathway (p21 oncoprotein). [ Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Peripheral Nerve Tumors: Aberrant Activation of the Ras Pathway Feldkamp MM, Angelov L, Guha A Surgical Neurology 1999 51 211–218 ] Neurofibromatosis alters or weakens this protein (due to deletion, missense mutation, or nonsense mutation s, ) allowing rapid, radical growth of cells all over the body, especially around the nervous system. The essential problem is the inability to inactivate GTP due to a defective GTP-ase (neurofibromin). This leads to the common symptoms for neurofibromatosis - clumpings of the tumors, called neurofibromas and schwannomas. Less is known about the NF-2 linked gene and its product, merlin. However, it is on the long arm of the chromosome 22q(11.1-13.1 ) and codes for the protein. [ Treatment ] Because there is no cure for the condition itself, the only therapy for patients with neurofibromatosis is a program of treatment by a team of specialists to manage symptoms or complications. Surgery may be needed when the tumors compress organs or other structures. Less than 10% of people with neurofibromatosis develop cancerous growths; in these cases, chemotherapy may be successful.

[ History ] Neurofibromatosis (or von Recklinghausen disease ) was first described in 1882 by the German pathologist, Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen. As a young scientist, Recklinghausen was the student of the then renowned Rudolf Virchow in Berlin. Recklinghausen was successful in generating some of the most descriptive medical observations of his time, making him the first person to describe and coin the term &quot; hemachromatosis &quot; (Hämochromatose, Tageblatt der Naturforschenden Versammlung). Recklinghausen is now known for his contributions to staining methods, and most importantly for his important paper on neurofibromatosis published in 1881, to honor Rudolf Virchow’s 25 year jubilee, in which he describes neurofibromatosis. Recognized as a distinguished histopathologist, and a great scientist to this date, he lends his name to the syndrome, which he himself elucidated.

One of the children featured on the documentary was Arianto, an Indonesian boy who suffered from a severe form of neurofibroma resulting in hemifacial giganticism. Also in that year, another documentary on BBC2 (edge of life) featured a neurofibromatosis case. On that documentary was a young teenager, Amit Ghose, who had decided for himself to have corrective surgery at the age of 14. In this case, the neurofibroma occurred on the face, resulting in the loss of sight in one eye and having to have it removed. This was a case of NF-2, resulting in the disfigurement of the one side of the face, while leaving the other side completely normal. In 2012, surgeons removed a 200-pound tumor caused by neurofibromatosis from a Vietnamese man&apos;s leg; the tumor weighed twice as much as the rest of his body.
