Video game s, board games, and tabletop role-playing game s, such as Cyberpunk 2020 (created by Mike Pondsmith )and Shadowrun, often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, some trends in fashion and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is also featured prominently in anime, Akira and Ghost in the Shell being among the most notable.

The genre&apos;s vision of a troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally utopia n visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Gibson defined cyberpunk&apos;s antipathy towards utopian SF in his 1981 short story &quot; The Gernsback Continuum, &quot; which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction.

Cyberpunk depicts the world as a dark, sinister place with networked computers dominating every aspect of life. Giant, multinational corporation s have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power. [ Protagonists ] Protagonist s in cyberpunk writing usually include computer hacker s, who are often patterned on the idea of the lone hero fighting injustice, such as Robin Hood. [ Seal Graham University Press http://books.google.com/books?id%3DfiShj7x47k8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA195%26amp%3Bdq%3Dcyberpunk%2BRobin%2BHood Cambridge 1996 195 0-521-55740-2 ] One of the cyberpunk genre&apos;s prototype characters is Case, from Gibson&apos;s Neuromancer. [ Taylor Todd W. Literacy Theory in the Age of the Internet http://books.google.com/?id%3DPt_CAYf8UgAC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA34%26amp%3Bdq%3Dcyberpunk%2Bcase%2BNeuromancer%2Bprototype Columbia University Press 1998 34 0-231-11331-5 ] Case is a &quot; console cowboy, &quot; a brilliant hacker who had betrayed his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew. Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. These anti-hero es — &quot; criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits &quot; { FAQ file (from the alt.cyberpunk Usenet group) } call to mind the private eye of detective novel s. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the &quot; punk &quot; component of cyberpunk. [ Society and government ] Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of culture revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic David Brin :...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others do depict Orwellian accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate elite. { Brin, David The Transparent Society, Basic Books, 1998 Book link } Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the Internet. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the World Wide Web entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and some social commentators such as James Burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form. { Clarke, Arthur C. &quot; } { The Last Question, &quot; Science Fiction Quarterly, 1956 } [ Media ] [ Cyborgs in fiction ] [ Literature ] [ List of cyberpunk works#Print media ] Probably the first novel to depict cyberspace and combat within it was John M. Ford&apos;s Web of Angels (1980). The science-fiction editor Gardner Dozois is generally acknowledged as the person who popularized the use of the term &quot; cyberpunk &quot; as a kind of literature, although Minnesota writer Bruce Bethke coined the term in 1980 for his short story &quot; Cyberpunk, &quot; which was published in the November 1983 issue of Amazing Science Fiction Stories. { Bethke, Bruce. &quot; Cyberpunk &quot; Amazing Science Fiction Stories, Vol. 57, No. 4; November 1983 Link } The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement&apos;s chief ideologue, thanks to his fanzine Cheap Truth. John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker&apos;s significance. { John Shirley. Two Cyberpunks: Sterling and Rucker 1999 Link } William Gibson with his novel Neuromancer (1984) is likely the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction trope s. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as &quot; the archetypal cyberpunk work, &quot; Neuromancer was awarded the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards. After Gibson&apos;s popular debut novel, Count Zero (1986) and Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988) followed. According to the Jargon File, &quot; Gibson&apos;s near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating. &quot; { Jargon File definition } Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality. { Brians, Paul. “Study Guide for William Gibson: Neuromancer (1984)” Washington State University, } Shortly thereafter, however, many critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF New Wave of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned. { James, Edward. Science Fiction in the 20th Century, Oxford University Press, Oxford &amp; New York, 1994. p. 197 } Furthermore, while Neuromancer &apos; s narrator may have had an unusual &quot; voice &quot; for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson&apos;s narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated Raymond Chandler, as in his novel The Big Sleep (1939). Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers&apos; works—often citing J. G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, Stanisław Lem, Samuel R. Delany, and even William S. Burroughs. For example, Philip K. Dick&apos;s works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities, and the influential cyberpunk movie Blade Runner is based on one of his books (its title is taken from a work by Burroughs). Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth&apos;s Wolfbane (1959) and Roger Zelazny &apos;s Creatures of Light and Darkness (1968). In 1994, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that Thomas Pynchon &apos;s 1973 novel Gravity&apos;s Rainbow &quot; not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace. &quot; { Brian Stonehill, &quot; Pynchon&apos;s Prophecies of Cyberspace. &quot; Delivered at the first international conference on Pynchon, the } { University of Warwick, England, November 1994. } Other important predecessors include Alfred Bester &apos;s two most celebrated novels, The Demolished Man and The Stars My Destination, [ Booker M.

[ Grebowicz Margret SciFi in the Mind&apos;s Eye: Reading Science Through Science Fiction Open Court Publishing Company 2007 147 0-8126-9630-1 ] Science-fiction writer David Brin describes cyberpunk as &quot; the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction. &quot; It may not have attracted the &quot; real punks, &quot; but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the &quot; self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution &quot; on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the &quot; rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt. &quot; { David Brin, Review of &apos;&apos;The Matrix&apos;&apos;. } Cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the &quot; original &quot; cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, such as George Alec Effinger &apos;s When Gravity Fails. Wired magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today’s cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims &quot; proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world. &quot; { Yoo, Paula. “CYBERPUNK  – IN PRINT  – HACKER GENERATION GETS PLUGGED INTO NEW MAGAZINE” Seattle Times. Seattle, Wash.: Feb 18, 1993. pg. G.3 } [ Film and television ] [ List of cyberpunk works ] { Los Angeles in Blade Runner. } The film Blade Runner (1982), adapted from Philip K. Dick&apos;s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called replicant s are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who &quot; retire &quot; (kill) them. Although Blade Runner was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a cult film.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision when he was working on Neuromancer. The film&apos;s tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as The Matrix (1999), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements. The number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since Blade Runner. Several of Philip K. Dick&apos;s works have been adapted to the silver screen. The films Johnny Mnemonic [ http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id%3D150 CTheory.net CTheory.net 2009-03-20 ] and New Rose Hotel, [ http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/newrosehotel.php DVD Verdict Review  – New Rose Hotel Dvdverdict.com 2000-01-10 2009-03-20 ] [ http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/100199rose-film-review.html &apos;New Rose Hotel&apos;: Corporate Intrigue, Steamy Seduction Nytimes.com 1999-10-01 2009-03-20 ] both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. [ Anime and manga ] See also: List of cyberpunk anime works Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson’s Neuromancer, whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan’s largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the mid 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture. Even though most anime and manga is written in Japan, the cyberpunk anime and manga have a more futuristic and therefore international feel to them so they are widely accepted by all. “The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.” { Ruh, Brian (2000), &quot; Liberating Cels: Forms of the Female in Japanese Cyberpunk Animation. &quot; AnimeResearch.com December 2000. } William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality: Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, &quot; You see? You see? It is Blade Runner town. &quot; And it was. It so evidently was. { Gibson, William. &quot; The Future Perfect: How Did Japan Become the Favored Default Setting for So Many Cyberpunk Writers? &quot;, Time International, 30 April 2001:48. } Cyberpunk has influenced many anime and manga including the ground-breaking Armitage III, Blame!, Akira, Battle Angel Alita and Ghost in the Shell. [ Gaming ] [ List of cyberpunk works#Role playing games ] [ List of cyberpunk works#Video games ] [ Category:Cyberpunk games ] Several role-playing games (RPGs) called Cyberpunk exist: Cyberpunk, Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk v3, by R. Talsorian Games, and GURPS Cyberpunk, published by Steve Jackson Games as a module of the GURPS family of RPGs. Cyberpunk 2020 was designed with the settings of William Gibson&apos;s writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval [ March 2009 ], unlike the approach taken by FASA in producing the transgenre Shadowrun game. Both are set in the near future, in a world where cybernetics are prominent. In addition, Iron Crown Enterprises released an RPG named Cyberspace, which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online PDF form. In 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the United States Secret Service raided Steve Jackson Games&apos;s headquarters and confiscated all their computers. This was allegedly because the GURPS Cyberpunk sourcebook could be used to perpetrate computer crime. That was, in fact, not the main reason for the raid, but after the event it was too late to correct the public&apos;s impression. { SJ Games Raided  – } { Jackson, Steve, } { Steve Jackson Games website, Friday 19 April 1990 } Steve Jackson Games later won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of GURPS Cyberpunk have a tagline on the front cover, which reads &quot; The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service! &quot; Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath. Cyberpunk has also inspired several tabletop, miniature and board game s. Netrunner is a collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the Cyberpunk 2020 role-playing game. There are many cyberpunk video game s. Popular series include the Deus Ex series, the Syndicate series, System Shock and its sequel. Other games, like Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and the Matrix series, are based upon genre movies, or role-playing game s (for instance the various Shadowrun games). [ Social impact ] [ Architecture and urban planning ] { Berlin &apos;s Sony Center } Some real life places have been described as cyberpunk, such as Japan, the Sony Center in the Potsdamer Platz public square of Berlin, Germany, [ Suzuki David David Suzuki Good News for a Change:How Everyday People Are Helping the Planet http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dnbvpz6NaZC8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA332%26amp%3Bdq%3DBerlin%2BSony%2BCenter%2Bcyberpunk Greystone Books 2003 332 1-55054-926-X ] Cyberport in Hong Kong, and Shanghai. { Sahr Johnny, &quot; Cybercity - Sahr Johnny&apos;s Shanghai Dream &quot; } { That&apos;s Shanghai, October 2005; quoted online by. } [ Society and counterculture ] Several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the Cyberdelic counter culture of the late 80s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as &quot; cyberpunks, &quot; attempted to blend the psychedelic art and drug movement with the technology of cyberculture. Early adherents included Timothy Leary, Mark Frauenfelder and R. U. Sirius. The movement largely faded following the dot-com bubble implosion of 2000. Cybergoth is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as rave and gothic subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years which rejects the raver and goth influences of cybergoth. [ Arts and aesthetics ] [ Literary subgenres and connected genres ] As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new sub-genres of science fiction emerged, some which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is &quot; steampunk, &quot; which is set in an alternate history Victorian era that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk&apos;s bleak film noir world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K.W. Jeter, but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel The Difference Engine the term was being used earnestly as well. { Michael Berry, &quot; Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows &apos;Cyberpunk&apos; Mold, &quot; } { The San Francisco Chronicle, 25 June 1987; quoted online by Wordspy. } Another subgenre is &quot; biopunk &quot; (cyberpunk themes dominated by biotechnology ) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by genetic manipulation. Paul Di Filippo is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious ribofunk. Bruce Sterling &apos;s Shaper/Mechanist cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as Neal Stephenson &apos;s The Diamond Age to be postcyberpunk. [ Music ] [ List of cyberpunk works#Music ] [ &quot; Much of the industrial/dance heavy &apos;Cyberpunk&apos;  – recorded in Billy Idol &apos;s Macintosh-run studio  – revolves around Idol&apos;s theme of the common man rising up to fight against a faceless, soulless, corporate world. &quot; 30% right ] Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include Psydoll, Front Line Assembly, Atari Teenage Riot, and Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Nine Inch Nails &apos; concept album Year Zero fits into this category. Billy Idol &apos;s Cyberpunk drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation. 1. Outside, a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by David Bowie, was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including Sonic Youth, whose albums Sister and Daydream Nation take influence from the works of Phillip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. Industrial music can be seen as cyberpunk, as well as various electronic body music acts.
