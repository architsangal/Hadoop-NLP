Digital hardcore fuses elements of hardcore punk with characteristics of techno and industrial music. The style developed in Germany during the early 1990s, and often features sociological or left -extremist lyrical themes. [ Characteristics ] Digital hardcore music is typically high- tempo and abrasive, combining the speed, heaviness and attitude of hardcore punk and riot grrrl { &quot; I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from &apos;male&apos; punk rock. &quot; The Punk Years, &quot; Typical Girls &quot; Access date: August 20, 2008. } with electronic music such as hardcore techno, jungle, and industrial rock. Some bands, such as Atari Teenage Riot, incorporate elements of hip-hop music, such as freestyle rap. The use of the electric guitar is retained and it is played in conjunction with samplers, synthesizer s and drum machine s. While the use of guitar (usually heavy distorted ) and electronic instruments is a requirement, traditional bass guitar s and drum kit s are optional. Vocals are more often shouted than sung by more than one member of the group. Typically, the lyrics are highly politicised and espouse left-wing or anarchist ideals. [ History ] [ 1990s ] The music was first defined by the band Atari Teenage Riot, who formed in Berlin, Germany in 1992. The band&apos;s frontman, Alec Empire, coined the term &quot; digital hardcore &quot;, setting up the independent record label Digital Hardcore Recordings in 1994. { Interview with J.

By the mid-1990s, a number of new record labels specializing in the genre were formed around the world. These included Gangster Toons Industries (Paris), Praxis (London), Cross Fade Enter Tainment (Hamburg), Drop Bass Network (U.S.), and Bloody Fist (Australia). DHR also had some kinship with the Frankfurt labels Mille Plateaux and Riot Beats. Alec Empire&apos;s work subsequently set the template for breakcore. { Alvin Chan, Music OMH, March 2008.
