Born Nguyễn Xuân Bảo, Thích Nhất Hạnh joined a Zen (Vietnamese: Thiền) monastery at the age of 16, and studied Buddhism as a novitiate. Upon his ordination as a monk in 1949, he assumed the Dharma name Thích Nhất Hạnh. Thích is an honorary family name used by all Vietnamese monks and nuns, meaning that they are part of the Shakya (Shakyamuni Buddha ) clan. { Phap Dung, Brother (2006), Plum Village website &apos;&apos;A Letter to Friends About Our Lineage&apos;&apos; accessed 2010-02-13 } He is often considered the most influential living figure in the lineage of Lâm Tế (Vietnamese Rinzai ) Thiền, and perhaps also in Zen Buddhism as a whole. In the early 1960s, he founded the School of Youth for Social Services (SYSS) in Saigon. This grassroots relief organization rebuilt bombed villages, set up schools, established medical centers, and resettled families left homeless during the Vietnam War. { 04-04-2006, BBC article } He traveled to the U.S. to study at Princeton University, and later to lecture at Cornell University and Columbia University. His focus at the time was to urge the U.S. government to withdraw from Vietnam. He urged Martin Luther King, Jr. to publicly oppose the Vietnam War; King nominated Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize in January 1967. He created the Order of Interbeing in 1966, establishing monastic and practice centers around the world. In 1973, the Vietnamese government denied Nhat Hanh permission to return to Vietnam and he went into exile in France. From 1976 to 1977 he led efforts to rescue Vietnamese boat people in the Gulf of Siam. Nhất Hạnh has become an important influence in the development of Western Buddhism.

By then he had gained fluency in French, Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali, Japanese and English, in addition to his native Vietnamese. In 1963, he returned to Vietnam to aid his fellow monks in their non-violent peace efforts. Nhat Hanh taught Buddhist psychology and Prajnaparamita literature at the Van Hanh Buddhist University, a private institution that focused on Buddhist studies, Vietnamese culture, and languages. At a meeting in April 1965 Van Hanh Union students issued a Call for Peace statement. It declared: &quot; It is time for North and South Vietnam to find a way to stop the war and help all Vietnamese people live peacefully and with mutual respect. &quot; Nhat Hanh left for the U.S. shortly afterwards, leaving Sister Chan Khong in charge of the SYSS. Van Hanh University was taken over by one of the Chancellors who wished to sever ties with Thich Nhat Hanh and the SYSS, accusing Chan Khong of being a communist. From that point the SYSS struggled to raise funds and faced attacks on its members. The SYSS persisted in their relief efforts without taking sides in the conflict.

[ Approach ] Nhat Hanh&apos;s approach has been to combine a variety of traditional Zen teachings with insights from other Mahayana Buddhist traditions, methods from Theravada Buddhism, and ideas from Western psychology—to offer a modern light on meditation practice. Hanh&apos;s presentation of the Prajñāpāramitā in terms of &quot; interbeing &quot; has doctrinal antecedents in the Huayan school of thought, { McMahan, David L. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford University Press: 2008 ISBN 978-0-19-518327-6 pg 158 } which &quot; is often said to provide a philosophical foundation &quot; for Zen. { Williams,Paul. Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd ed.Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 144 } Nhat Hanh has also been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism movement (he coined the term), promoting the individual&apos;s active role in creating change. He cites the 13th-century Vietnam ese King Trần Nhân Tông with the origination of the concept. Trần Nhân Tông abdicated his throne to become a monk, and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school in the Bamboo Forest tradition. [ Names applied to him ] Nhat Hanh at Hue City airport on his 2007 trip to Vietnam (aged 80) The Vietnamese name Thích ( 釋 ) is from &quot; Thích Ca &quot; or &quot; Thích Già &quot; ( 釋迦 ), means &quot; of the Shakya ( Shakyamuni Buddha ) clan. &quot; { Lineage - Order of Interbeing } All Buddhist monks and nuns within the East Asian tradition of Mahayana and Zen adopt this name as their &quot; family &quot; name or surname implying that their first family is the Buddhist community. In many Buddhist traditions, there are a progression of names that a person can receive. The first, the lineage name, is given when a person takes refuge in the Three Jewels. Thich Nhat Hanh&apos;s lineage name is Trừng Quang. The next is a Dharma name, given when a person, lay or monastic, takes additional vows or when one is ordained as a monastic. Thich Nhat Hanh&apos;s Dharma name is Phung Xuan. Additionally, Dharma titles are sometimes given, and Thich Nhat Hanh&apos;s Dharma title is &quot; Nhat Hanh &quot;. Neither Nhất ( 一 ) nor Hạnh ( 行 )—which approximate the roles of middle name or intercalary name and given name, respectively, when referring to him in English—was part of his name at birth. Nhất (一) means &quot; one &quot;, implying &quot; first-class &quot;, or &quot; of best quality &quot;, in English; Hạnh (行) means &quot; move &quot;, implying &quot; right conduct &quot; or &quot; good nature. &quot; Thích Nhất Hạnh has translated his Dharma names as Nhất = One, and Hạnh = Action. Vietnamese names follow this naming convention, placing the family or surname first, then the middle or intercalary name which often refers to the person&apos;s position in the family or generation, followed by the given name. [ http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1044 Vietnamese Names Geotravel Research Center, Kissimmee, Florida 1995 Excerpted from &quot; Culture Briefing: Vietnam &quot; Things Asian website 13 September 2010 ] Thich Nhat Hanh is often referred to as &quot; Thay &quot; ( [ Thầy ], &quot; master; teacher &quot; ) or Thay Nhat Hanh by his followers. On the Vietnamese version of the Plum Village website, he is also referred to as Thiền Sư Nhất Hạnh which can translated as &quot; Zen Master &quot;, or &quot; Dhyana Master &quot;. { Title attributed to TNH on the Vietnamese Plum Village site } Any Vietnamese monk or nun in the Mahayana tradition can be addressed as &quot; Thầy &quot; ( &quot; teacher &quot; ). Vietnamese Buddhist monks are addressed &quot; Thầy tu &quot; ( &quot; monk &quot; ) and nuns are addressed &quot; Sư Cô &quot; ( &quot; Sister &quot; ) or &quot; Sư Bà &quot; ( &quot; Elder Sister &quot; ).
