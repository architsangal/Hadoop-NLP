One famous example is the firefly luciferase ( [ 1.13.12.7 ] ) from the firefly Photinus pyralis. [ Gould SJ, Subramani S Firefly luciferase as a tool in molecular and cell biology Anal. Biochem. 175 1 5–13 1988 November 3072883 10.1016/0003-2697(88)90353-3 ] &quot; Firefly luciferase &quot; as a laboratory reagent usually refers to P. pyralis luciferase although recombinant luciferases from several other species of fireflies are also commercially available. The name is derived from Lucifer, the root of which means &apos;light-bearer&apos; (lucem ferre). [ Chemical reaction ] The chemical reaction catalyzed by firefly luciferase takes place in two steps: luciferin + ATP → luciferyl adenylate + PP i luciferyl adenylate + O 2 → oxyluciferin + AMP + light Light is emitted because the reaction forms oxyluciferin in an electronically excited state. The reaction releases a photon of light as oxyluciferin returns to the ground state. Luciferyl adenylate can additionally participate in a side reaction with O 2 to form hydrogen peroxide and dehydroluciferyl-AMP. About 20% of the luciferyl adenylate intermediate is oxidized in this pathway. [ Fraga H, Fernandes D, Novotny J, Fontes R, Esteves da Silva JC Firefly luciferase produces hydrogen peroxide as a coproduct in dehydroluciferyl adenylate formation Chembiochem 7 6 929–35 2006 June 16642538 10.1002/cbic.200500443 ] The reaction catalyzed by bacterial luciferase is also an oxidative process: FMNH 2 + O 2 + RCHO → FMN + RCOOH + H 2 O + light In the reaction, a reduced flavin mononucleotide oxidizes a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde to an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The reaction forms an excited hydroxyflavin intermediate, which is dehydrated to the product FMN to emit blue-green light. [ Fisher AJ, Thompson TB, Thoden JB, Baldwin TO, Rayment I The 1.5-A resolution crystal structure of bacterial luciferase in low salt conditions J. Biol. Chem. 271 36 21956–68 1996 September 8703001 ] Nearly all of the energy input into the reaction is transformed into light. The reaction is 80% [ Chemical and Engineering News 77 3 Jan 18, 1999 65 http://pubs.acs.org/cen/whatstuff/stuff/7703scit4.html What&apos;s That Stuff? Elizabeth Wilson ] to 90% [ 2009 EE times http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-blogs/planet-analog-designline-blog/4035489/Lighting-the-way Lighting the way Vanessa Knivett ] efficient. As a comparison, the incandescent light bulb only converts about 10% of its energy into light. { General Electric TP-110, page 23, table. } and a 150 lumen per Watt (lm/W) LED converts 20% of input energy to visible light. [ Mechanism ] Firefly luciferase generates light from luciferin in a multistep process. First, D-luciferin is adenylated by MgATP to form luciferyl adenylate and pyrophosphate. After activation by ATP, luciferyl adenylate is oxidized by molecular oxygen to form a dioxetanone ring. A decarboxylation reaction forms an excited state of oxyluciferin, which tautomerizes between the keto-enol form. The reaction finally emits light as oxyluciferin returns to the ground state. [ Baldwin TO Firefly luciferase: the structure is known, but the mystery remains Structure 4 3 223–8 1996 March 8805542 10.1016/S0969-2126(96)00026-3 ] Mechanism for luciferase. [ Luciferase Structure ] The protein structure of firefly luciferase consists of two compact domains : the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is composed of two β-sheets in an αβαβα structure and a β barrel. The two β-sheets stack on top of each other, with the β-barrel covering the end of the sheets. The C-terminal domain is connected to the N-terminal domain by a flexible hinge, which can separate the two domains. The amino acid sequence on the surface of the two domains facing each other are conserved in bacterial and firefly luciferase, thereby strongly suggesting that the active site is located in the cleft between the domains. [ Conti E, Franks NP, Brick P Crystal structure of firefly luciferase throws light on a superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes Structure 4 3 287–98 1996 March 8805533 10.1016/S0969-2126(96)00033-0 ] During a reaction, luciferase has a conformational change and goes into a “closed” form with the two domains coming together to enclose the substrate. This ensures that water is excluded from the reaction and does not hydrolyze ATP or the electronically excited product. Diagram of the secondary structure of luciferase. Arrows represent β-strands and circles represent α-helices. The locations of each of the subdomains in the sequence of luciferase is shown in the bottom diagram. [ Spectral differences in bioluminescence ] Luciferase bioluminescence color can vary between yellow-green (λ max = 550  nm) to red (λ max = 620). [ Ugarova NN Luciferase of Luciola mingrelica fireflies. Kinetics and regulation mechanism J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 4 1 406–18 1989 July 2801227 10.1002/bio.1170040155 ] There are currently several different mechanisms describing how the structure of luciferase affects the emission spectrum of the photon and effectively the color of light emitted. One mechanism proposes that the color of the emitted light depends on whether the product is in the keto or enol form. The mechanism suggests that red light is emitted from the keto form of oxyluciferin, while green light is emitted from the enol form of oxyluciferin. [ White EH, Rapaport E, Hopkins TA, Seliger HH Chemi- and bioluminescence of firefly luciferin J. Am. Chem. Soc. 91 8 2178–80 1969 April 5784183 ] [ Fraga H Firefly luminescence: a historical perspective and recent developments Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 7 2 146–58 2008 February 18264582 10.1039/b719181b ] However, 5,5-dimethyloxyluciferin emits green light even though it is constricted to the keto form because it cannot tautomerize. [ Branchini BR, Southworth TL, Murtiashaw MH, et al. An alternative mechanism of bioluminescence color determination in firefly luciferase Biochemistry 43 23 7255–62 2004 June 15182171 10.1021/bi036175d ] Another mechanism proposes that twisting the angle between benzothiazole and thiazole rings in oxyluciferin determines the color of bioluminescence. This explanation proposes that a planar form with an angle of 0° between the two rings corresponds to a higher energy state and emits a higher-energy green light, whereas an angle of 90° puts the structure in a lower energy state and emits a lower-energy red light. [ McCapra F,Gilfoyle DJ, Young DW, et al. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Fundamentals and Applied date of publication: 1994 ] The most recent explanation for the bioluminescence color examines the microenvironment of the excited oxyluciferin. Studies suggest that the interactions between the excited state product and nearby residues can force the oxyluciferin into an even higher energy form, which results in the emission of green light. For example, Arg 218 has electrostatic interactions with other nearby residues, restricting oxyluciferin from tautomerizing to the enol form. [ Nakatani N, Hasegawa JY, Nakatsuji H Red light in chemiluminescence and yellow-green light in bioluminescence: color-tuning mechanism of firefly, Photinus pyralis, studied by the symmetry-adapted cluster-configuration interaction method J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129 28 8756–65 2007 July 17585760 10.1021/ja0611691 ] Similarly, other results have indicated that the microenvironment of luciferase can force oxyluciferin into a more rigid, high-energy structure, forcing it to emit a high-energy green light. [ Nakamura M, Niwa K, Maki S, et al. Construction of a new firefly bioluminescence system using L-luciferin as substrate Anal. Biochem. 47 1 1197–1200 2006 December 10.1016/j.tetlet.2005.12.033 ] [ Bifunctionality of luciferase ] Luciferase can function in two different pathways: a bioluminescence pathway and a CoA -ligase pathway. [ Oba Y, Ojika M, Inouye S Firefly luciferase is a bifunctional enzyme: ATP-dependent monooxygenase and a long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase FEBS Lett. 540 1-3 251–4 2003 April 12681517 ] In both pathways, luciferase initially catalyzes an adenylation reaction with MgATP. However, in the CoA-ligase pathway, CoA can displace AMP to form luciferyl CoA. Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase similarly activates fatty acid s with ATP, followed by displacement of AMP with CoA. Because of their similar activities, luciferase is able to replace fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and convert long-chain fatty acids into fatty-acyl CoA for beta oxidation. Luciferase has two modes of enzyme activity: bioluminescence activity and CoA synthetase activity. Nakamura M, Maki S, Amano Y, Ohkita Y, Niwa K, Hirano T, Ohmiya Y, Niwa H Firefly luciferase exhibits bimodal action depending on the luciferin chirality Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 331 2 471–5 2005 June 15850783 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.202 [ Regulation ] D-luciferin is the substrate for luciferase’s bioluminescence reaction, while L-luciferin is the substrate for luciferyl-CoA synthetase activity. Both reactions are inhibited by the substrate’s enantiomer: L-luciferin and D-luciferin inhibit the bioluminescence pathway and the CoA-ligase pathway, respectively. This shows that luciferase can differentiate between the isomers of the luciferin structure. L-luciferin is able to emit a weak light even though it is a competitive inhibitor of D-luciferin and the bioluminescence pathway. [ Lembert N Firefly luciferase can use L-luciferin to produce light Biochem. J. 317 1 273–7 1996 July 8694774 1217473 ] Light is emitted because the CoA synthesis pathway can be converted to the bioluminescence reaction by hydrolyzing the final product via an esterase back to D-luciferin. [ Nakamura M, Maki S, Amano Y, et al. Firefly luciferase exhibits bimodal action depending on the luciferin chirality Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 331 2 471–5 2005 June 15850783 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.202 ] Luciferase activity is additionally inhibited by oxyluciferin [ Ribeiro C, Esteves da Silva JC Kinetics of inhibition of firefly luciferase by oxyluciferin and dehydroluciferyl-adenylate Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 7 9 1085–90 2008 September 18754056 10.1039/b809935a ] and allosterically activated by ATP. When ATP binds to the enzyme’s two allosteric sites, luciferase’s affinity to bind ATP in its active site increases. [ Examples ] A variety of organisms regulate their light production using different luciferases in a variety of light-emitting reactions. The most famous are the fireflies, although the enzyme exists in organisms as different as the Jack-O-Lantern mushroom ( Omphalotus olearius ) and many marine creatures. In fireflies, the oxygen required is supplied through a tube in the abdomen called the abdominal trachea. The luciferases of fireflies - of which there are over 2000 species - and of the Elateroidea (fireflies, click beetles and relatives) in general - are diverse enough to be useful in molecular phylogeny. The most thoroughly studied luciferase is that of the Photinini firefly Photinus pyralis, which has an optimum pH of 7.8. [ Steghens JP, Min KL, Bernengo JC Firefly luciferase has two nucleotide binding sites: effect of nucleoside monophosphate and CoA on the light-emission spectra Biochem. J. 336 1 109–13 1998 November 9806891 1219848 http://www.biochemj.org/bj/336/0109/bj3360109.htm ] Also well studied is the luciferase from Renilla reniformis. In this organism, the luciferase ( Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase )is closely associated with a luciferin-binding protein as well as a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ). Calcium triggers release of the luciferin ( coelenterazine ) from the luciferin binding protein. The substrate is then available for oxidation by the luciferase, where it is degraded to coelenteramide with a resultant release of energy. In the absence of GFP, this energy would be released as a photon of blue light (peak emission wavelength 482  nm). However, due to the closely associated GFP, the energy released by the luciferase is instead coupled through resonance energy transfer to the fluorophore of the GFP, and is subsequently released as a photon of green light (peak emission wavelength 510  nm). The catalyzed reaction is: [ Shimomura O Bioluminescence in the sea: photoprotein systems Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 39 351–72 1985 2871634 ] coelenterazine + O 2 → coelenteramide + CO 2 + photon of light Newer luciferases have recently been identified that, unlike Renilla or Firefly luciferase, are naturally secreted molecules. One such example is the Metridia luciferase (MetLuc)that is derived from the marine copepod Metridia longa. The Metridia longa secreted luciferase gene encodes a 24 kDa protein containing an N-terminal secretory signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. The sensitivity and high signal intensity of this luciferase molecule proves advantageous in many reporter studies. Some of the benefits of using a secreted reporter molecule like MetLuc is its no-lysis protocol that allows one to be able to conduct live cell assays and multiple assays on the same cell.

[ Schultz LW, Liu L, Cegielski M, Hastings JW Crystal structure of a pH-regulated luciferase catalyzing the bioluminescent oxidation of an open tetrapyrrole Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The N-terminal domain is conserved between dinoflagellate luciferase and luciferin binding proteins (LBPs). It has been suggested that this region may mediate an interaction between LBP and luciferase or their association with the vacuolar membrane. [ Okamoto OK, Liu L, Robertson DL, Hastings JW Members of a dinoflagellate luciferase gene family differ in synonymous substitution rates Biochemistry 40 51 15862–8 2001 December 11747464 ] The helical bundle domain has a three helix bundle structure that holds four important histidines that are thought to play a role in the pH regulation of the enzyme. [ Applications ] Luciferase can be produced in the lab through genetic engineering for a number of purposes. Luciferase gene s can be synthesized and inserted into organisms or transfected into cells. Mice, silkworm s, and potato es are just a few organisms that have already been engineered to produce the protein. [ Contag CH, Bachmann MH Advances in in vivo bioluminescence imaging of gene expression Annu Rev Biomed Eng 4 235–60 2002 12117758 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.4.111901.093336 ] In the luciferase reaction, light is emitted when luciferase acts on the appropriate luciferin substrate. Photon emission can be detected by light sensitive apparatus such as a luminometer or modified optical microscopes. This allows observation of biological processes. [ http://www.promega.com/multimedia/bioLum01.htm Introduction to Bioluminescence Assays Promega Corporation 2009-03-07 ] In biological research, luciferase commonly is used as a reporter to assess the transcription al activity in cells that are transfected with a genetic construct containing the luciferase gene under the control of a promoter of interest.

Such substrates have been used to detect caspase activity and cytochrome P450 activity, among others. Luciferase can also be used to detect the level of cellular ATP in cell viability assay s or for kinase activity assays.

Biotinylation will immobilize luciferase on the cell-surface by binding to a streptavidin - biotin complex. This allows luciferase to detect the efflux of ATP from the cell and will effectively display the real-time release of ATP through bioluminescence.

The intensity of the signal measured by in vivo imaging may depend on various factors, such as D-luciferin absorption through the peritoneum, blood flow, cell membrane permeability, availability of co-factors, intracellular pH and transparency of overlying tissue, in addition to the amount of luciferase.

Forensic investigators can use a dilute solution containing the enzyme to uncover traces of blood remaining on surfaces at a crime scene. Luciferase is a heat sensitive protein that is used in studies on protein denaturation, testing the protective capacities of heat shock proteins.
