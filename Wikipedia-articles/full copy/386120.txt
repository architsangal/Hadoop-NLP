Gurgur mineral water spring Mineral water is water from a mineral spring containing various mineral s such as salt s and sulfur compounds. Mineral water can be sparkling (with effervescence ), or still (without effervescence). Traditionally, mineral waters were used or consumed at their spring sources, often referred to as &quot; taking the waters &quot; or &quot; taking the cure, &quot; at developed sites such as spa s, baths or well s. The term spa was used for a place where the water was consumed and bathed in; bath where the water was used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and well where the water was to be consumed. Active tourist centres have grown up around many mineral water sites since ancient times, such as Hungary, Hisarya (Bulgaria), Bílina (Czech Republic), Vichy (France), Jermuk (Armenia), Yessentuki (Russia), Spa (Belgium), Krynica-Zdrój (Poland), Sulphur Baths (Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia), Bath (England), or Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic).

Tourist development resulted in spa town s and hydropathic hotels (often shortened to &quot; hydros &quot; ). In modern times, it is far more common for mineral waters to be bottled at the source for distributed consumption. Travelling to the mineral water site for direct access to the water is now uncommon, and in many cases not possible (because of exclusive commercial ownership rights). There are more than 3,000 brands of mineral water commercially available worldwide. { Mineral Waters of the World, &apos;&apos;Home page&apos;&apos; } The more calcium plus magnesium ions are dissolved in water, the harder it is said to be; water with few dissolved calcium plus magnesium ions is described as being soft. [ http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education/quality-water-hard.htm Hard vs. Soft Water Explained 2009-02-05 ] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS), originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water. { FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration, &apos;&apos;Regulation of Bottled Water: Appendix&apos;&apos;: &quot; Mineral Water &quot; Retrieved 2010-03-28 } However, in many places, the term &quot; mineral water &quot; is colloquially used to mean any bottled carbonated water or soda water, as opposed to tap water.
