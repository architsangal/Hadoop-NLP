George Ignatieff George Pavlovich Ignatieff, CC ( [ Георгий Па́влович Игнатьев ]; December 16, 1913 - August 10, 1989) was a noted Russia n - Canadian diplomat. His career spanned nearly five decades in World War II and the postwar period. [ Early life and education ] Ignatieff was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, the youngest of five sons, to a distinguished Russian family. His mother was Princess Natalia Nikolayevna Meshcherskaya and his father was Count Paul Ignatieff, a close advisor to Tsar Nicholas II serving as his last Minister of Education. In 1918, the year after the Russian Revolution, Count Ignatieff was imprisoned, but his release was negotiated by sympathetic supporters. The family fled to France, and later moved to Canada. George Ignatieff was educated at St Paul&apos;s School, London, Lower Canada College (having first been rejected by Selwyn House School ), and the University of Trinity College, University of Toronto, before being awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford. [ Wartime service and postwar diplomacy ] With the advent of war, Ignatieff joined the Royal Artillery, where he worked in photographic intelligence. In 1940 he joined the Canadian Department of External Affairs. He became personal assistant to the Canadian High Commissioner in London, Vincent Massey, { Davies DT, (editor). Canada From Afar: the Daily Telegraph Book of Canadian Obituaries, p.194 - 195. Toronto, Dundurn Press, 1996. } and during his London posting began a friendship with Lester Pearson, later Prime Minister of Canada. Ignatieff also served as the wartime Canadian delegate to the International Red Cross. { Greenhous B. &quot; C &quot; Force to Hong Kong. A Canadian Catastrophe. Toronto, Dundurn Press, 1997. } Ignatieff was a key figure in Canadian diplomacy and international relations through the postwar period. He was Ambassador to Yugoslavia (1956-1958), permanent representative to NATO (1963-1966), Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations (1966-1969) and president of the United Nations Security Council (1968-1969). In 1984 Ignatieff was appointed Ambassador for Disarmament by Prime Minister John Turner. Ignatieff was unimpressed by the foreign policy of the Trudeau governments of the 1970s and 1980s, and was unafraid to provoke government functionaries. He advocated cautious realignment of Canadian defence policy, and a complete nuclear test ban. Like his mentor Pearson, Ignatieff believed in the interdependence of nations, and had an acute prescience for the impending threats of terror, economic breakdown, and environmental degradation. { Roche D.
