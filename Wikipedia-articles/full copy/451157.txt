( [ icon k ɑr ˈ l aɪ l ] or [ ˈ k ɑr l aɪ l ] ) is an English football club based in Carlisle, Cumbria, where they play at Brunton Park. Formed in 1904, the club currently compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system. They have won three league titles and two cup competitions in their long history. Carlisle is the smallest location, by population, to have had a resident top flight English football club since 1906.

Acrington, Darwen, Grimsby Town &amp; Glossop North End competed before 1906. The club has reached the final of the Football League Trophy 6 times, more than any other team, winning it on two occasions in 1997 and 2011. The club&apos;s traditional kit is blue with white and red detail. The badge takes elements from the city&apos;s coat of arms including two wyvern s which are the regent of Cumbria. [ History ] [ History of Carlisle United F.C. ] [ (1904–1928) Early years ] The club was formed on 17 May 1904 at Shaddongate United&apos;s annual general meeting [ http://www.carlisleunited.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/ The Carlisle United Story 21 June 2010 Carlisle United F.C. 29 April 2011 ] where the club&apos;s members voted to change the team&apos;s name to Carlisle United. The newly formed club initially played at Milhome Bank and later at Devonshire Park, finally settling at their current home Brunton Park in 1909. In 1905, Carlisle United joined the Lancashire Combination but were only admitted after agreeing to pay all visiting teams’ travel expenses for two years, due to Carlisle not being located in Lancashire. After the league reorganised four years later the board at United decided it did not suit the club&apos;s best interests to be there any longer and the club entered the North Eastern League in place of their reserve team who had previously played in the league and been a founding member. When the Carlisle United first team left to join the Football League the reserve team resumed its place in the competition. [ http://www.fchd.btinternet.co.uk/CARLISU2.HTM Carlisle United Reserves Football Club History Database 29 April 2011 ] Carlisle United were crowned champions of the North Eastern League in 1922. The 1927–28 season was Carlisle&apos;s last in the North Eastern League. An excellent home record helped them to second in the table finishing a full 10 points behind Champions Sunderland Reserves. The close season meant the usual round of applications to join (and be re-elected to) the Football League. Carlisle went up against Chester City, Durham City (applying for re-election), Nelson and York City. On June 4, 1928 a delegation of representatives from Carlisle United took their seats at the Football League meeting in London to hear the results of the vote. They were cast as follows: Nelson – 37, Carlisle – 33, Durham – 11, York – 7, Chester – 2. The result meant Carlisle would replace Durham City as members of the Football league. [ (1928–1964) The Football League ] Carlisle United won their first game in the Football League Third Division North with the side of Prout, Coulthard, Cook, Harrison, Ross, Pigg, Agar, Hutchison, McConnell, Ward and Watson beating Accrington Stanley 3–2.

The News &amp; Star 16 July 2008 26 April 2011 ] Their next game was played against Hartlepool United and still stands to this day as their record victory at 8 goals to nil. When the Second World War began in 1939, Carlisle United withdrew from national and regional competitions and only played local football. When the war was over the club returned to the Football League and appointed Ivor Broadis as player-manager, making him the youngest league club manager in history. He then had the distinction of becoming the first manager to transfer himself when he moved to Sunderland, he continued to live and train in Carlisle. Broadis returned to Carlisle United in 1955 an ex-England international. In 1949, the club became the first to appoint Bill Shankly as manager. Shankly, a former player at Carlisle, later went on to manage local rivals Workington (helping them finish above Carlisle for the first time) before being appointed as manager of Liverpool in 1959; over the next 15 years he would guide the club to numerous trophy successes.

[ http://www.northtrek.plus.com/Shankly.html The Unforgettable Football Manager Perspective UK 1 March 2007 26 April 2011 ] Broadis, who was playing for Sunderland but living and training with Carlisle, once arrived late for training and Shankly asserted that he would play by United&apos;s training rules even if he didn&apos;t play there. According to Shankly, he said to Broadis: &quot; What do you think you&apos;re doing? Who do you think you are? If you do the training we do you can train with us and we&apos;ll play five-a-side and you&apos;ll run your guts out as an example to everybody else &quot;. Carlisle were members of the Third Division North until 1958 when it combined with the Third Division South to become the Fourth Division. They remained there until 1962 when they won their first promotion, they were relegated the following season but immediately bounced back to begin the most prosperous period in the club&apos;s history. [ (1964–1985) The Golden Era ] Upon gaining promotion to the Third Division in 1964 United immediately won the Third Division Championship the following year. In the period which followed Carlisle enjoyed their greatest success outside of cup competitions. Over twelve years the club cemented themselves as a solid Second Division (Then 2nd Tier in English football) side. Within that period Carlisle finished 7 out of 11 seasons in the top half of the table including 3rd in 66/67, 4th in 70/71 and a 3rd in 73/74 which saw them promoted to the top tier of English football. The 71/72 season also saw Carlisle play their only European competition in the club&apos;s history, in June 1972 they beat A.S. Roma 3–2 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Playing in the First Division for the 1974–75 season. Carlisle won their first three fixtures to go top of the English football pyramid, partly due to the likes of Chris Balderstone, scoring the penalty which put them at the top, and Bobby Parker who both went on to make at least 375 league appearances for Carlisle. The success was short lived however, they finished the season in bottom place and were relegated. Highlight victories include doing a double over Everton, and home victories over eventual champions Derby County, and former title holders Ipswich Town, Arsenal, Burnley, Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. { Third Division title in } { 81/82 by goal difference alone. } Carlisle still remains the smallest location in England, by local population, to have had a resident top flight football team since 1906. Bill Shankly, an FA Cup and League Championship winning manager by that time, branded Carlisle&apos;s climb to the top as “the greatest feat in the history of the game.” [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2386691/Carlisle-on-a-recovery-mission.html Carlisle on a recovery mission Ricky George The Telegraph 14 September 2004 26 April 2011 ] Another relegation followed in 76/77 before returning to the Second Division in 1982 under Bob Stokoe. With a team including Malcolm Poskett and Tommy Craig they mounted a promotion challenge in the 83/84 season but finished 7th after a late slump. [ (1986–2005) The Doldrums ] Carlisle ended their most prosperous period as rapidly as it had started. Back to back relegations in 86 and 87 saw them enter the Fourth division for the first time in 21 years. Their first season in there saw them finish second from bottom but 19 points ahead of relegated [ Newport County ]. In contrast, the same year they reached the FA Cup third round but were defeated by eventual champions Liverpool. The lull in league performance continued. A promotion push in 1990 was thwarted by a last match defeat to Maidstone United and near 20th placed finish in 91 saw manager Clive Middlemass replaced by Aidan McCaffrey. The change in management didn&apos;t do much to reverse fortune however and the following season Carlisle finished bottom of the Football League, only avoiding relegation due Aldershot being expelled due to bankruptcy. Some good then came of a new owner in the form of Michael Knighton whose financial input helped the club steer clear of relegation in 92/93 gain two promotions in 95, 97 to the second division (now 3rd tier) and gain success in the Football League Trophy. Unfortunately the promotions were immediately followed by relegations in 96 and 98 respectively. In the 1998–99 season Carlisle found themselves in their second successive relegation battle and needing to gain three points from the final game of the season at home to Plymouth Argyle. At 90 minutes the crowd at Scarborough (Carlisle&apos;s relegation rival) were already celebrating before the fourth official stated four minutes of extra time would be played at Brunton Park. In the last kick of the game goalkeeper Jimmy Glass, who had signed in an emergency loan deal from [ Swindon Town ] after the transfer deadline, scored from a corner kick which he came up to in a last gasp effort to win the match. [ One Hit Wonder: The Jimmy Glass Story The History Press Roger Lytollis 1 September 2004 ] In the following years Carlisle continued to narrowly avoid relegation one season after the other. From the 97/98 season through to 03/04 the club only once finished above 22nd in the English fourth tier. The bullet dodging did eventually cease however when in 2004 they lost Football league status for the first time since 1928. [ (2005–present) Resurgence ] { Wembley after winning the } { Johnstone&apos;s Paint Trophy in 2011. } Carlisle were promoted out of the non-league conference at the first time of asking in 2005, winning the play-off final at the Britannia Stadium, Stoke. Carlisle&apos;s excellent form under manager Paul Simpson continued into the following season as they returned to the Football League with a bang, clinching the League Two title. Simpson then departed for Preston North End, and was succeeded by Neil McDonald. The following few seasons saw Carlisle achieve their highest league finishes for 22 years and the highest average crowds for 30 years. This coincided with several seasons at the top half of League One including a playoff finish in 2008. The 2008–09 season saw Carlisle start promisingly but it was soon followed by one of the worst runs of form in the club&apos;s history. Because of this manager John Ward was sacked and replaced by caretaker manager Gregg Abbot, signing him permanently after he uplifted the clubs form in the following games. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/carlisle_united/7767539.stm Abbot appointed as Carlisle manager BBC Sport 5 December 2008 29 April 2011 ] Carlisle eventually avoided relegation that season. Carlisle have since completed two seasons with Abbot at the helm and achieved comfortable mid table finishes in both. More noteworthy is the two runs in the Football League Trophy which took place in those seasons. The team were beaten in the final in 2010 but returned the following year, with new signings including François Zoko and James Berrett, to win the trophy in 2011. [ Football League Trophy ] Since its inception Carlisle have competed in almost every season of the Football League Trophy, including in 2004–05 when they did not hold Football League status. In total they have reached the final six times, more than any other team. The club first won the competition in 1997, beating Colchester United. The game, which took place at Wembley Stadium, was drawn 0–0 in 90 minutes and continued to a penalty shoot-out. Thanks to Tony Caig &apos;s heroics in goal Carlisle won the shoot-out 4–3. The second win came in 2011, a year after suffering a 4–1 defeat to Southampton in the previous final. This time Carlisle were able to defeat Brentford by a single goal.

Admiral Le Coq Sportif [ http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Carlisle_United/Carlisle_United.htm Carlisle United Kits Historic Football Kits 26 April 2011 ] Upon the decision to change the name of Shaddongate F.C. to Carlisle United in 1904 the club also changed their shirt colours from gold and navy stripes to blue. In 1907 white shorts were introduced and since then various combinations of blue and white have been used by the club. In 1973 the first shirt to feature a sportswear sponsor was worn by United. Made by Admiral, the shirt was based on an earlier Birmingham City shirt and was the first to feature red detailing. Since then red detailing became a common feature on Carlisle shirts. The first evidence of Carlisle wearing a crest dates to the 1950/51 season, first adorning it in a FA Cup tie against Arsenal. The design itself was based on the city&apos;s own coat of arms which was registered at the College of Arms in 1924. The crest itself may have been derived from Sir William de Carlyell of Cumberland, in the reign of Edward II, who bore a red cross. The supporting red wyverns to either side of the shield are a symbol of the British Kingdom of Cumbria. The motto on the underlying scroll reads: ‘Be just and fear not’, which is a quote from Shakespeare&apos;s &apos;Henry VIII&apos;. Carlisle were often referred to as &apos;The Foxes&apos; due to the local connection with huntsman John Peel. In 1970 the club badge changed to reflect this and featured a golden fox jumping over the abbreviation C.U.F.C. The fox further became part of the club&apos;s image with a mounted stuffed fox named Olga (Goal rearranged) which is traditionally carried onto the pitch by the mascot before the match. Later versions of this badge featured a fox&apos;s head with a castle (representing Carlisle Castle ) and a fox jumping through a ring of stars, somewhat resembling the European Union emblem. Since 1995 the club has reverted back to using the city&apos;s coat of arms. However the club still sell merchandise with branding similar to their former fox badge and the club mascot (who is now Olga the Fox also) still carries the stuffed fox onto the pitch. [ Sponsorship ] Local based and founded business the Stobart Group have been the club&apos;s main shirt sponsor since 1995. Before 2007 the shirt displayed the &apos;Eddie Stobart&apos; name associated with the haulage arm of the business (with the exception of the 1997–2000 shirt), in 2007 this changed to just &apos;Stobart&apos; in order to reflect the wider company. The Stobart Group have been strong supporters of the club in general also. In 2010, to celebrate the company&apos;s 40th anniversary, the group bought 4,000 tickets for the League One game against Rochdale and gave them away to the general public. On the 3rd of April 2011 Carlisle United wore black armbands in the Johnstone&apos;s Paint Trophy Final in respect of Edward Stobart (son of Eddie), who passed away just three days earlier.

In 1909, five years after becoming Carlisle United, the club moved to Brunton Park and have been residents ever since. [ http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/carlisle-united/ Carlisle United: Crests, Colours and Nicknames The Beautiful History 26 April 2011 ] The stadium has a capacity of 16,800 and comprises both seated and terraced areas. The four stands are known as Main (West) Stand &amp; Paddock, the East Stand, the &quot; Waterworks &quot; Petteril Stand and the Warwick Road End which usually hosts the most vocal supporters on match days. In the past the stadium has been the victim of severe flooding and a fire which burned down the wooden grandstand which stood until 1953. [ Cumberland_Building_Society_Stand_cropped.jpg 1000px 350 center A view over Brunton park from the Paddock towards the East (Then Cumberland Building Society) Stand. ] In 2011 a plan was introduced to move to a 12,000 capacity all-seater stadium to be built in the Kingmoor Park area of the city. Though considerably smaller than Brunton Park, the new ground could be upgraded to a larger capacity if demand was met. The proposals have received mixed responses from Carlisle fans.

Then began a ten year ownership in which much of the talk around the club concerned Knighton himself.

Knighton placed himself in charge of the club&apos;s management with the uncredited help of Dave Wilkes and John Halpin. The club was relegated to the English fourth tier that season and only narrowly avoided losing Football League status thanks to a last minute goal by goalkeeper Jimmy Glass in 1999. Knighton became increasingly unpopular with the fans in the following years and the supporters&apos; &apos;United Trust&apos; was formed to push for better ownership, this came in the form of John Courtenay in 2002. [ Supporters and rivalries ] The main area of Carlisle support can be found within and around Carlisle itself and, due to being the only professional football club for a long distance, it attracts fans from across the county of Cumbria, South West Scotland and parts of West Northumberland. The club&apos;s supporters are known as the Blue Army. The most vocal supporters on match days reside in Brunton Park&apos;s Warwick Road End, known affectionately to the fans as &apos;The Warwick.&apos; In addition to generic English football chants Carlisle&apos;s supporters sing Proud to be a Cumbrian, Super Carlisle from the North and an adapted version of Peggy March&apos;s I Will Follow Him.

Carlisle&apos;s traditional local rivals are Workington, however the west Cumbria n club have not featured in the Football League since 1977 and consequently competitive matches between the two teams are extremely rare. Prior to 2008 the club&apos;s nearest professional football club was Gretna F.C., who at one time played in European football thanks to the financial input of Brooks Mileson (A United supporter also, who once tried to buy United).
