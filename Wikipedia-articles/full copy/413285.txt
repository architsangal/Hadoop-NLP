He currently holds the record for playing more games for England than anyone else, earning 125 caps. His 30-year career included eleven different clubs, three World Cup s, two European Cup finals and more than 1,000 competitive matches. He has the rare distinction of having played over 100 league games for five different clubs. Shilton did not make his World Cup finals debut until the age of 32 but he played in 17 finals matches and shares the record 10 clean sheets in World Cup finals with French keeper Fabien Barthez. During his time at Nottingham Forest he won two European Cup s, a UEFA Super Cup, the First Division championship, the Football League Cup and many other honours. Shilton also holds the all-time record for the most competitive appearances in world football. { http://www.rsssf.com/players/duizend.html List of Official Appearances Records } { http://www.cityspeakersinternational.co.uk/speakers/speaker_peter_shilton.php?PHPSESSID=apsf2dvv96m Peter Shilton – Background } [ Biography ] [ Early career ] Shilton was a 13 year old pupil at King Richard III Boys School, Leicester, when he started training at schoolboy level with his local club Leicester City in 1963. He caught the eye of first-team goalkeeper Gordon Banks, who commented to the coach about how promising he was. Within four years, Shilton had forced Banks&apos; own departure from Leicester after the teenager gave the club an ultimatum over which goalkeeper should be first choice. [ January 2012 ] In May 1966, a 16 year old Shilton made his debut for Leicester against Everton and his potential was quickly spotted to the extent that the Leicester City management sided with their teenage prodigy and soon sold World Cup winner Banks, to Stoke City. Shilton settled into first team life thereafter, even managing to score a goal at The Dell against Southampton in October 1967 direct from a clearance at the opposite end of the pitch. The Southampton goalkeeper, Campbell Forsyth, misjudged Shilton&apos;s long punt upfield, which, instead of splashing harmlessly in the mud, spun off The Dell pitch and flew over Forsyth&apos;s head into the goal. &quot; The Saints &quot; lost the game 5–1. [ In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC Holley Duncan Chalk, Gary Hagiology 2003 0-9534474-3-X 512 ] The following season Leicester had a mixed season; suffering relegation from the First Division, but reaching the FA Cup final at Wembley and a 19 year old Shilton became one of the event&apos;s youngest-ever goalkeepers. It did not go his way, however, as a single goal from Manchester City &apos;s Neil Young early in the match was enough to win the game. Despite the many honours and accolades which were to come Shilton&apos;s way, he would not appear in an FA Cup Final again. [ England calls ] An ambitious Shilton considered moving from Leicester after relegation, but decided to stick with his boyhood team. [ January 2012 ] This decision was vindicated when, despite playing at a lower level, he impressed England manager Alf Ramsey sufficiently to give him his debut against East Germany in November 1970. England won 3–1. Little more than six months later, Shilton&apos;s outstanding performances [ January 2012 ] helped Leicester to promotion back to the First Division. His second England cap came in a goalless draw against Wales at Wembley; and his first competitive match for his country was his third appearance as England drew 1–1 with Switzerland in a qualifying game for the 1972 European Championships. At this stage, Banks was still England&apos;s first choice keeper, but the remaining brace of back-ups from the 1970 World Cup, Peter Bonetti and Alex Stepney, had been cast aside by Ramsey so Shilton could begin to regard himself as his country&apos;s number two goalkeeper at the age of 22. Life with Leicester City continued uneventfully as Shilton&apos;s England career progressed. His fourth and fifth England caps came towards the end of 1972 (England had failed to qualify for the European Championship competition) before a tragic incident suddenly saw Shilton propelled into the limelight as England&apos;s number one keeper. In October 1972, Gordon Banks was involved in a car crash which resulted in the loss of the sight in one eye and thus ended his career. Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence was called up to make his debut a month later in England&apos;s opening qualifier for the 1974 World Cup, (a 1–0 win over Wales). Shilton ended up with over 100 caps compared to Clemence&apos;s 61. Shilton in the summer of 1973 kept three clean sheets as England defeated Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, while drawing with Czechoslovakia – a match which earned Shilton his tenth cap – as a warm-up to a crucial World Cup qualifier against Poland in Chorzów a week later. This went badly for England, with Shilton unable to stop both goals in a 2–0 defeat and therefore making victory in the final qualifier, against the same opposition at Wembley four months later, a necessity if England were to make the finals. [ Mistake against Poland ] Shilton was selected by Ramsey for the match, walking out behind captain Martin Peters to earn his 15th cap. Aside from one infamous incident, he spent pretty much all of the game watching the heroics of his opposite number Jan Tomaszewski as he kept chance after chance out of his net. When the ball finally did get into the net it was at Shilton&apos;s end, in the first moment which formed part of the whole definition of Shilton&apos;s career. Midway through the second half, Norman Hunter trod on the ball near the touchline and Poland broke, with Grzegorz Lato feeding the ball across to the onrushing Jan Domarski. As Domarski shaped to hit the ball first time, Shilton got himself into position to attempt to block the shot. Domarski&apos;s drive, struck beyond Emlyn Hughes &apos; challenge, was low and not well hit but it was on target for inside the near post and very close to Shilton. Shilton needed to deal with it, yet dived late to a shot too close to his body, and Poland scored. Shilton later said he was trying to make &quot; the perfect save &quot; and momentarily forgot that his first priority was to keep the ball out of the net, rather than make sure he held on to it. He also claimed in his autobiography that this is the only mistake he made in his 125 caps for England. England equalised swiftly through a penalty from Allan Clarke, with Shilton famously turning his back on the ball at the opposite end because he could not bear to look, but Tomaszewski&apos;s continued heroics kept England out to the final whistle, and England failed to qualify for the World Cup. Poland would go on to finish third in the competition. [ Stoke City ] As the season came to an end, Leicester got to the FA Cup semi finals where Shilton was beaten – in a replay after the initial game ended goalless – by a lobbed volley from Liverpool&apos;s Kevin Keegan. Shilton left Leicester that summer joining Stoke City for £325,000. By now he and Ray Clemence were battling to be regarded as England&apos;s top goalkeeper, and each were given their share of caps. In 1975, however, Clemence seemed to be getting the edge, winning eight of the nine caps available under new coach Don Revie, though England failed to reach the 1976 European Championships during this period. Shilton played just once for England in 1975, not at all in 1976 and just twice in 1977; he became so frustrated at his lack of chances that in the summer of 1976, he pulled out of the squad which was heading for the United States for a bi-centennial celebration tournament and asked not to be considered again, only to reverse his decision three months later. Clemence was in control, overtaking Shilton&apos;s caps total in the process as England fought in vain to reach the 1978 World Cup. The summer of 1976 also saw Manchester United lodge a bid for Shilton. Stoke agreed a fee of £275,000 for the goalkeeper, but the United board baulked at Shilton&apos;s wage demands, which would have made him the highest paid player at the club. [ Morgan Scott 2008 September Deal or No Deal? Inside United 194 pp.42–46 Haymarket Network Teddington ] Shilton remained at Stoke with whom he was relegated in 1977. [ Nottingham Forest and cups with Clough ] Nottingham Forest made an offer of £250,000 [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/29/napoli.barcelona Guardian – Inspired Football Transfers The Guardian London Rob Smyth 29 August 2008 22 May 2010 ] and Shilton signed a month into the new season. Forest had just been promoted to the First Division and were riding high under the management of Brian Clough. They won the League Cup in a replay after initially drawing with Liverpool at Wembley, though Shilton missed that as he was cup-tied, and then won the League title in their first season back in the first division. Shilton made a save in the clinching 0–0 draw against Coventry City which critics regarded as his greatest ever – a vicious close range header from Mick Ferguson seemed destined for the net with Shilton slightly out of position, but he got across to palm it over the bar. During the season as a whole, Shilton conceded just 18 goals in 37 league appearances. [ Peter Shilton http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/sport/2004/05/where_are_they_now_shilton.shtml BBC Nottingham May 2004 2007-09-07 ] Shilton subsequently won the PFA Player of the Year award, voted for by his fellow professionals. New England coach Ron Greenwood started to select Shilton as regularly as Clemence, eventually reaching the stage where he made a point of alternating them, seemingly unable to choose. This indecision attracted some adverse comment, with some commentators questioning Greenwood&apos;s ability to manage at the highest level. Brian Clough famously summed up the situation when he said &apos;Shilton was head and shoulders above Clemence in every aspect of goalkeeping, it was the biggest insult to Shilton to alternate between the two.&apos; [ January 2012 ] Forest won the League Cup again in 1979 – this time Shilton played as they defeated Southampton 3–2 at Wembley – before reaching the European Cup final where a Trevor Francis goal was enough to beat Swedish side Malmö in Munich. Shilton then featured heavily as England qualified for the 1980 European Championships in Italy – their first tournament for a decade. Prior to competing in Italy, Shilton had another eventful season with Forest, reaching a third consecutive League Cup final, with Wolverhampton Wanderers the opponents at Wembley. There was no third successive victory, however, a communication error between Shilton and defender David Needham resulted in a collision on the edge of the Forest penalty area, leaving Andy Gray free to tap the ball into the net for the game&apos;s only goal. Forest then reached the European Cup final again in 1980 – as holders they were entitled to defend the trophy and faced SV Hamburg in Madrid. Like the 1979 final, the game was tight and one goal settled it from Forest winger John Robertson. Among the disappointed Hamburg players was Keegan, now Shilton&apos;s captain at international level. Shilton&apos;s tenure at Nottingham Forest was the most successful of his professional career. [ Spain and Southampton ] Shilton had won his 30th England cap in a 2–0 win over Spain in March 1980; his 31st wouldn&apos;t come until the European Championships themselves. It was a 1–0 defeat to Italy, which proved crucial as England failed to get through to the knockout phase. Life began to decline for Shilton afterwards. Forest failed to continue their trophy-winning form while Shilton began what would be a long-standing gambling addiction which would cause considerable strain to his family. There were also stories of an extramarital affair and a conviction for drink-driving,with the player fined £350 for the offence. [ http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0%2C%2C583485%2C00.html London The Guardian The 10 worst examples of footballers behaving badly ] All of this contributed to Shilton&apos;s decision to leave Nottingham Forest in 1982 and start afresh. In the midst of all this, he had the matter of the 1982 World Cup to consider. Shilton had played in half of the qualifying games – wins over Norway, and Switzerland, a goalless draw against Romania, and a vital 1–0 win over Hungary. The latter was the last game of the campaign, and England had to win to qualify for the finals in Spain, leading to a potential repeat of the events against Poland in 1973. The result went England&apos;s way this time and they qualified for their first World Cup for a dozen years, with Shilton appearing in the finals for the first time at the comparatively mature age of 32. Clemence had played in the friendlies building up to the competition, but it was Shilton who was selected for the opening group game against France in Bilbao. England won 3–1 and Shilton stayed in goal for the two remaining group games. That was sufficient to advance to the second phase. Shilton duly left Forest and, despite interest from Arsenal [ January 2012 ], opted to join Southampton, where his former international team-mates Keegan and Alan Ball were both playing. With Bobby Robson now running the England team, Shilton&apos;s international career flourished, playing in Robson&apos;s first ten matches and even captaining the side in seven of them in the absence of Bryan Robson and Ray Wilkins. One game, a 2–0 win over Scotland, earned Shilton his 50th cap. Clemence returned for a qualifier for the 1984 European Championships against Luxembourg, but this game, Clemence&apos;s 61st for his country, also proved to be his last. England failed to qualify for the European Championships, while at Southampton, Shilton suffered FA Cup semi final defeat again when he was beaten by a last minute Adrian Heath header which gave Everton a place in the final. However, he was now the established first pick goalkeeper for his country, and would remain so through to the end of his international career. Almost half his international caps (61 out of 125) were earned after his 35th birthday. It was 1985 before another goalkeeper was selected for an England game, when Robson could gave a debut to the Manchester United goalkeeper Gary Bailey in a relatively unimportant friendly match. Shilton was still the keeper for the qualifying campaign for the 1986 World Cup, which thus far had seen three wins from three matches and no goals conceded. A 70th cap came Shilton&apos;s way in a 1–0 defeat against Scotland at Hampden Park; he later saved a penalty from Andy Breheme as England beat West Germany 3–0 in a tour match in Mexico, a year before England were hoping to return there for the World Cup. England accomplished going through the whole qualifying campaign undefeated. By the time they played Mexico in an acclimatisation match prior to the competition, Shilton was 80 games into his England career, having beaten Banks&apos; record for a goalkeeper of 73 caps the previous year against Turkey. [ The &quot; Hand of God &quot; ] [ Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)#Hand of God ] At the World Cup itself, England started slowly, losing the opening group match to Portugal and then drawing against outsiders Morocco, during which time Robson was led off injured and Wilkins was sent off. In their absences, Shilton was handed the captaincy as England found their form to defeat Poland 3–0 in their final group game – Gary Lineker scored them all – and progress to the second round. There they met Paraguay and though Shilton did have to make one fingertip save during the first half, England were rarely troubled. Lineker scored twice and Peter Beardsley once as England went through 3–0 and into a quarter final meeting with Argentina, a match which again would ultimately form part of the legend of Shilton&apos;s whole career. Argentina captain Diego Maradona had been the man of the tournament thus far, but in a tight first half England managed to keep his creativity reasonably at bay. But early in the second half, Maradona changed the game, much to Shilton&apos;s anger. Maradona began an attack which seemingly broke down on the edge of the England box as Steve Hodge got a foot to the ball. The ball was skewed back towards the penalty area and Maradona, continuing the run from his initial pass, went after it as Shilton came out to punch the ball clear. Maradona managed to get higher than Shilton and knock the ball into the net. Shilton and his teammates signalled that Maradona had used his hand — a foul for any player except a goalkeeper — but the Tunisia n referee Ali Bin Nasser allowed the goal. A photograph subsequently showed Maradona outjumping Shilton and his fist making contact with the ball as Shilton was still midway through his own stretch, arm extended (but, curiously, jumping only an inch or two). Maradona later said the goal was scored by the Hand of God. Nasser never refereed at such a high level again. Shilton largely escaped criticism for the goal because the English media focused on Maradona involvement. Shortly afterwards, Maradona scored a legitimate individual goal, taking on almost the whole England defence and Shilton before shooting into an empty net. Lineker pulled one back and nearly equalised in the closing seconds, but England were out. In 1987, Grandslam Entertainment released a computer game with the unsubtle title of &apos; Peter Shilton&apos;s Handball Maradona! &apos; [ Disaster at Euro 88 ] However, he continued to play for England, featuring in a straightforward and successful qualification campaign for the 1988 European Championships, which were to be held in West Germany. Shilton had won his 90th cap for England in a 2–0 win over Northern Ireland in a European Championship qualifier. Shilton&apos;s 99th cap came in a 1–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland with Shilton beaten by an early Ray Houghton header. Shilton&apos;s 100th was against the Netherlands. Marco van Basten ruined Shilton&apos;s day and England&apos;s hopes of progress with a second half hat-trick as England lost 3–1. Robson left Shilton out of the third and final group game as it was now meaningless, but England still managed to lose it, also 3–1. Chris Woods, longtime understudy to Shilton (and his teenage understudy a decade earlier at Forest — he had played in the League Cup final when Shilton was cup-tied) was given a rare game. Shilton played in all bar one of the England games over the next 18 months — the one he missed saw a debut for a future England goalkeeping first choice, David Seaman of Queens Park Rangers. [ Derby County &amp; amp; Italia 90 ] In June 1989, Shilton broke his old England skipper Bobby Moore &apos;s record of 108 appearances for his country when he won his 109th cap in a friendly against Denmark in Copenhagen. Prior to the match he was handed a framed England goalkeeper&apos;s jersey with &apos;109&apos; on the front. He had, by this time, kept three clean sheets in three qualifying matches for the 1990 World Cup and would ultimately concede no goals at all as England qualified for the tournament, to be held in Italy. 1989 was also a good year at club level for Shilton. He helped the Derby side of Mark Wright, Dean Saunders and Ted McMinn finish fifth in the league, and they only missed out on competing in the UEFA Cup due to the ban on English clubs in European competition (which ran from 1985 to 1990) arising from the Heysel disaster. It was his 119th appearance for his country as England drew 1–1 with the Republic of Ireland in the opening group game; Shilton would later perform heroics as England got through the group [ January 2012 ], beat Belgium 1–0 in the second round match, and then edged past Cameroon 3–2 in the quarter finals, thanks to two Lineker penalties after England went 2–1 down. Then came the West Germans in the semi finals, Shilton&apos;s 124th England game. It was goalless at half time, but shortly after the restart Shilton was beaten by Andreas Brehme &apos;s deflected free kick that looped off Paul Parker &apos;s shin and dropped into the net over Shilton&apos;s head, despite his back pedalling attempts to tip the ball over. Lineker&apos;s late equaliser salvaged a draw for England but Shilton could not get close enough to any of the penalties taken by the Germans in the deciding shoot out, while England missed two of theirs and went out of the tournament. In his biography Bobby Robson later admitted that he had toyed with the idea of substituting Shilton with second understudy Dave Beasant for the shoot out, as Beasant, who played for Chelsea, had a particularly impressive record at saving penalties. [ May 2011 ] Although in his autobiography, Shilton is said to have defended the decision to leave him on as he stated he guessed the correct way the penalties were going for all the four kicks. [ May 2011 ] Shilton was the keeper for the third place play-off game, which ended in a 2–1 win for hosts Italy, Shilton suffering an embarrassing moment when he dithered over a back pass and was tackled by Roberto Baggio who scored as a result of Shilton&apos;s error. It was his 125th appearance for his country and, after the tournament ended, he announced it would be his last. Of his 125 international appearances (then a world record), 15 of them had been as captain. [ http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3480083/John-Terry-I-never-gave-up-my-England-skipper-dream.html London The Sun Shaun Custis JT I never gave up skipper dream 20 March 2011 ] His final appearance came just four months before the 20th anniversary of his international debut, making his full international career one of the longest on record. He was never booked or sent off at full international level. This allowed Shilton to concentrate on his playing career at Derby County, where he had been since signing from Southampton in 1987. [ Management ] In 1991, Derby were relegated and Shilton started to consider his playing future. He was in his 42nd year and was ready to become a coach or manager. In early 1991, he had rejected an offer to replace Stan Ternent as Hull City manager for geographical reasons. He finally left Derby in February 1992 on accepting an offer to become player-manager of Plymouth Argyle – a turbulent era that is documented in the 2009 book, Peter Shilton&apos;s Nearly Men. Plymouth were battling against relegation in the Football League Second Division but Shilton&apos;s efforts were unable to save Plymouth from the drop. His £300,000 record signing Peter Swan proved to be a disaster as the player had a awful relationship with both his teammates and the fans. [ Swan Peter Andrew Collomosse Swanny: Confessions of a Lower-League Legend John Blake 2008 978-1-84454-660-2 ] In 1994, he started to concentrate solely on management and Plymouth reached the Division Two play-offs, but lost in the semi finals to Burnley. In January 1994, he had been linked with Southampton for a possible return as manager following the departure of Ian Branfoot, but the job went to Alan Ball, Jr instead. [ Henry Winter Ardiles looking to Angell or Allen http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-ardiles-looking-to-angell-or-allen-1406880.html The Independent 14 January 1994 13 October 2009 London ] The following February, with Plymouth heading for relegation, he left the club and announced his intention to start playing again. He was now 46 years old. He joined Wimbledon in the Premier League, as cover for the first choice keeper Hans Segers, but did not play a first team game for them. He subsequently signed for Bolton Wanderers, making one appearance in the Division One play off semi final vs Wolves at Molineux. Bolton lost 2–1, but eventually overcame Wolves in the second leg, Shilton however did not play in this game. He then signed for Coventry City, where he failed to make a first-team appearance, before joining West Ham United, where again he never played a first-team game, although he was selected as a substitute on several occasions. [ One thousand matches and beyond ] With 996 Football League matches to his name, Shilton was anxious to reach the 1,000 mark and this he did when he joined Leyton Orient in November 1996, in an exchange deal for 39-year-old Les Sealey. His thousandth League game came on 22 December 1996, against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, which was screened live on Sky Sports and was preceded by the presentation from the Football League of a special edition of the Guinness Book of Records to Shilton. He played five more matches before retiring on 1005 league games at the age of 47. By the time of his retirement, he was the fifth oldest player ever to have played in the Football League or Premier League. { http://www.allfootballers.com/statsc.php?bid=oldestlp } [ Personal life ] Shilton recovered from financial troubles caused by business decisions and gambling, [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml%3D%2Farts%2F2004%2F12%2F05%2Fbosport.xml%26amp%3BsSheet%3D%2Farts%2F2004%2F12%2F05%2F Telegraph – Sporting Heros Book Reviews The Daily Telegraph London Leo McKinstry 12 December 2004 22 May 2010 ] and became a prolific after-dinner speaker. He and wife Sue were married in 1970 and they have two sons, Michael and Sam. His son Sam is a professional footballer, though a midfielder rather than a goalkeeper. He has played for several senior clubs, including Plymouth Argyle and Coventry City. Shilton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and later an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) during his playing career for services to football. In 1990, following his retirement from international football, he was awarded the Order of Merit by the PFA and a year later he received the Football Writers&apos; Tribute Award. Shilton was made an Inaugural Inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. He also features in football games FIFA 10, FIFA 11 and FIFA 12 in the Classic XI squad. He took part in the 2010 series of BBC&apos;s Strictly Come Dancing.
