The population was 100 at the 2010 census. The community is famous for its celebration of its Norwegian-American heritage. The local Sunburg Creamery Cafe serves Norwegian dishes including Klub and Lutefisk. The community is home to Hope Lutheran Church and Sunburg Community Bible Church. There are also several smaller Lutheran congregations within a few miles of the city. Despite its small size, Sunburg is home to several businesses including Skindelien hardware, a gas station, N &amp; J&apos;s grocery store, Lake Region bank, Jorgenson&apos;s auto delearship, and the aforementioned Sunburg Creamery cafe. Sunburg is also home to a baseball team. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.5  square miles (1.3  km²), of which, 0.5  square miles (1.2  km²) of it is land and 0.04  square miles (0.1  km²) of it (4.00%) is water. Minnesota State Highways 9 and 104 are two of the main routes in the community. Monson Lake State Park is just west of the town. [ History ] Originally, Sunburg was established in hopes that a planned railroad line would travel through the community; however the plans for the railroad never materialized. Nevertheless, Sunburg became an important part of the local farming economy. An elementary school existed from 1955 to 1989, as part of the Kerkhoven -Murdock-Sunburg School District. The school closed due to shrinking enrollment. The school building was later sold to the community of Sunburg for $1, which uses it as a community center and fire hall. The fire hall was expanded due to proceeds from a $1 million estate bequeathment. Many local residents were angered that the bequeathment was misappropriated from its intended purpose of being used only for senior housing; controversy still exists within the community regarding this issue (the degree of the current controversy could be debated because a new senior housing facility has been built and is operational near the cafe).
