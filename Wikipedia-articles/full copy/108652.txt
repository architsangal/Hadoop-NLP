Summer in Breckenridge attracts outdoor enthusiasts with hiking trails, wildflower s, fly-fishing in the Blue River, mountain biking, nearby Lake Dillon for boating, white water rafting, alpine slides, and several shops up and down Main Street. Every year, Breckenridge hosts the Breckenridge Festival of Film, established in 1981, Uller Fest every January, as well as an annual Fourth of July parade. [ Breckenridge Festival of Film http://www.breckfilmfest.com/home/index.php 2007-10-28 ] [ Name ] The town of Breckenridge was formally created in November 1859 by General George E. Spencer. Spencer chose the name &quot; Breckinridge &quot; after John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, Vice President of the United States, in the hopes of flattering the government and gaining a post office. Spencer succeeded in his plan and a post office was built in Breckinridge; it was the first post office between the Continental Divide and Salt Lake City, Utah. However, when the Civil War broke out in 1861, the former vice president sided with the Confederates (as a brigadier general ) and the pro-Union citizens of Breckinridge decided to change the town&apos;s name. The first i was changed to an e, and the town&apos;s name has been spelled Breckenridge ever since.

Breckenridge was founded to serve the miners working rich placer gold deposits discovered along the Blue River. Placer gold mining was soon joined by hard rock mining, as prospectors followed the gold to its source veins in the hills. Gold in some upper gravel benches east of the Blue River was recovered by hydraulic mining. Gold production decreased in the late 1800s, but revived in 1908 by gold dredging operations along the Blue River and Swan River. The Breckenridge mining district is credited with production of about one million troy ounces (about 31,000 kilograms) of gold. { A. H. Koschman and M. H. Bergendahl (1968) Principal Gold-Producing Districts of the United States. US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 610, p.116-117 } The gold mines around Breckenridge are all shut down, although some are open to tourist visits. The characteristic gravel ridges left by the gold dredges can still be seen along the Blue River and Snake River, and the remains of a dredge are still afloat in a pond off the Swan River. Notable among the early prospectors was Edwin Carter, a log cabin naturalist who decided to switch from mining to collecting wildlife specimens. His log cabin built in 1875 exists today and has been recently renovated by the Breckenridge Heritage Alliance with interactive exhibits and a small viewing room with a short creative film on his life and the early days around Breckenridge. The Breckenridge Heritage Alliance reports that in the 1930s, a women&apos;s group in Breckenridge stumbled upon an 1880s map that failed to include Breckenridge. They speculated that Breckenridge had never been officially annexed into the United States, and was thus still a &quot; No Man&apos;s Land &quot;. This was completely false—official US maps did include Breckenridge—but these women created an incredibly clever marketing campaign out of this one map. In 1936 they invited the Governor of Colorado to Breckenridge to raise a flag at the Courthouse officially welcoming Breckenridge into the union—and he came. There was a big party. And the entire event/idea of Breckenridge being left off the map made national news. The &quot; No Man&apos;s Land &quot; idea later morphed into a new theme of Breckenridge being referred to as &quot; Colorado&apos;s Kingdom &quot;, and the theme of Breck&apos;s independent spirit is still celebrated to today during Breck&apos;s annual &quot; Kingdom Days &quot; celebrations every June. Breckenridge was the film location of the 1989 comedy National Lampoon&apos;s Christmas Vacation and some scenes in Dumb and Dumber (shots of Aspen in the movie are actually Breckenridge). On November 3, 2009, voters passed ballot measure 2F by a nearly 3 to 1 margin (73%), which legalized marijuana possession for adults. The measure allows possession of up to an ounce of marijuana and also decriminalizes the possession of marijuana-related paraphernalia. Possession became legal January 1, 2010. Possession is still illegal by state law however. The measure was written mainly to be symbolic.
