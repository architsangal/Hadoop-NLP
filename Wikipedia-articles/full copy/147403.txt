Among their innovations was a fusion with classical music, most notably in their 1967 album Days of Future Passed. The Moody Blues have sold in excess of 70 million albums worldwide and have been awarded 14 platinum and gold discs. As of 2012 they remain active with one member from the original band from 1964 and two more from the 1967 lineup. [ Founding and early history ] [ Early years, Decca Records 1964–1967 ] The Moody Blues formed on 4 May 1964, in Erdington, Birmingham, England. Ray Thomas, John Lodge, and Michael Pinder had been members of El Riot &amp; the Rebels. They disbanded when Lodge, the youngest member, went to technical college and Michael Pinder joined the army. Michael Pinder then rejoined Thomas to form the Krew Cats. The pair recruited guitarist/vocalist Denny Laine, band manager-turned-drummer Graeme Edge, and bassist Clint Warwick. The five appeared as the Moody Blues for the first time in Birmingham in 1964. The name developed from a hoped-for sponsorship from the M &amp; B Brewery which failed to materialise, the band calling themselves both &quot; The M B&apos;s &quot; and &quot; The M B Five &quot; and was also a subtle reference to the Duke Ellington song, &quot; Mood Indigo &quot;. { Gary James&apos; interview with Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues; Classicbands.com } Soon, the band obtained a London-based management company, &apos;Ridgepride&apos;, formed by ex-Decca A &amp; R man Alex Murray ( Alex Wharton ), who helped them land a recording contract with Decca Records in the spring of 1964. Initially they were signed to a management company who then leased their recordings to Decca. They released a single, &quot; Steal Your Heart Away &quot;, that year which failed to chart. The Moody Blues appeared on the cult UK series &quot; Ready Steady Go! &quot; singing the uptempo &apos;B&apos; side &quot; Lose Your Money (But Don&apos;t Lose your Mind) &quot;. But it was their second single, &quot; Go Now &quot; (released later that year), which really launched their career, being promoted on TV with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the pop era, produced and directed by Alex Wharton. The single became a hit in the United Kingdom (where it remains their only Number 1 single to date) { &quot; Moody Blues &quot; article at Britishinvasionbands.com } and in the United States, where it reached #10. The band encountered management problems after the chart-topping hit and subsequently signed to Decca Records in the UK (London Records in the US) as actual recording artists. A four track Extended Play release titled: &quot; The Moody Blues &quot; featuring both sides of their first two Decca singles was issued in a colour picture sleeve in early 1965. Their debut album The Magnificent Moodies, produced by Denny Cordell with a strong Merseybeat / R &amp; B flavour, was released on Decca in mono only in 1965. It contained the hit single together with one side of classic R &amp; B covers, and a second including four Laine/Pinder originals. &quot; Bye Bye Bird &quot; (Decca AT 15048) was lifted from the album in December 1965 as an overseas single charting in France (no.3). Alex Wharton left the management firm and the group released a series of relatively unsuccessful singles. They enjoyed a minor UK hit with a cover of &quot; I Don&apos;t Want To Go On Without You &quot; (no.33) in February 1965, while the Pinder-Laine original &quot; From The Bottom of My Heart (I Love You) &quot; (no.22) produced by Denny Cordell (with a vocal choral sound towards the conclusion that anticipated their later more famous vocal sound on &quot; Nights in White Satin &quot; ) was issued as a UK single in May 1965. Further UK singles were: &quot; Everyday &quot; (no.44) in October 1965, another Pinder-Laine song, plus their later &quot; This is My House (But Nobody Calls) &quot; (Decca F 12498,1966) and &quot; Boulevard de la Madeleine &quot; also issued in late 1966. In June 1966 Warwick left the group. He was briefly replaced by Rod Clark (born Rodney Clark, 23 November 1942, Surlingham, near Norwich, Norfolk), but in October, Clark departed the group, which split for a month.Denny Laine quit in late 1966 and a final &apos;Mark one&apos; Moodies single Pinder-Laine&apos;s &quot; Life&apos;s Not Life &quot; was scheduled for release in January 1967 (Decca F 12543) c/w &quot; He Can Win &quot;. (This single&apos;s release is often listed as being cancelled, however, both promo and regular stock copies have been seen over the years.) [ Arrival of Hayward and Lodge ] The group re-formed in November 1966 and new members were John Lodge, their bassist from El Riot, and Justin Hayward, formerly of The Wilde Three. Hayward was recommended to Pinder by Eric Burdon of The Animals and was endorsed by famed UK singer Marty Wilde, the leader of The Wilde Three. Pinder phoned Hayward after reading his application, and was impressed when Hayward played him his 45 rpm single &quot; London Is Behind Me &quot; during their car ride to meet the other members in Esher. [ January 2010 ] After financial misfortune and a confrontation from an audience member, the band soon realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working for them and they decided that they would only perform their own material. The band were introduced to Decca staff producer Tony Clarke who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward&apos;s &quot; Fly Me High &quot; &amp; Mike Pinder&apos;s older-styled &quot; Really Haven&apos;t Got the Time &quot; (Decca F12607) as the &apos;Mark Two&apos; Moodies first single released in May 1967. This picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However the sound gave clues to the direction their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder&apos;s Mellotron, was first introduced on Pinder&apos;s song &quot; Love And Beauty &quot; (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward&apos;s rocker &quot; Leave This Man Alone &quot; in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their &apos;new&apos; Moodies identity. Ray Thomas&apos;s flute had been in evidence earlier ( &quot; I&apos;ve Got A Dream &quot; ) on their debut album, however it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of everyman. [ Deram Records, Threshold Records, 1967–1972 ] [ Days Of Future Passed ] The Moody Blues&apos; contract with Decca Records was set to expire and they owed the label several thousand pounds in advances. They had the support, however, of Decca A &amp; R manager Hugh Mendl, who had been instrumental in the recent establishment of London/Decca&apos;s new subsidiary imprint Deram Records. With Mendl&apos;s backing, The Moody Blues were offered a deal to make a rock and roll version of Antonín Dvořák &apos;s New World Symphony that would promote the company&apos;s new Deramic Stereo Sound (DSS) audio format [ Eder Bruce The Moody Blues: Biography AMG [All Music Group, a subsidiary of Macrovision] 2009 2009-07-28 ] in return for which the group would be forgiven their debt. The Moody Blues agreed, but they insisted that they be given artistic control of the project, and Hugh Mendl (as executive producer) was able to provide this in the face of Decca&apos;s notoriously tight-fisted attitude to their artists. { Obituaries – Hugh Mendl: Producer at Decca Records; } { The Independent, 25 July 2008. } The group were unable to complete the assigned project, [ January 2010 ] which was abandoned. However, they managed to convince Peter Knight, who had been assigned to arrange and conduct the orchestral interludes, to collaborate on a recording that used the band&apos;s original material instead. Although Deram executives were initially skeptical about the hybrid style of the resulting concept album. Days of Future Passed (released in November 1967) became one of the most successful pop/rock releases of the period, earning a gold record award and reaching #27 on the British album chart. Five years later it was to reach #3 in the U.S./Billboard charts. The album was a song cycle or concept album that (like James Joyce &apos;s Ulysses ) took place over the course of a single day. In production and arrangement the album drew inspiration from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by The Beatles to whom Pinder had introduced the Mellotron that year. It took the form to new heights using the London Festival Orchestra, { Show 49 – The British are Coming! The British are Coming!: With an emphasis on Donovan, the Bee Gees and the Who. [Part 6 &amp; #93; : UNT Digital Library } a loose affiliation of Decca&apos;s classical musicians given a fictitious name adding the term &quot; London &quot; to sound impressive, to provide an orchestral linking framework to the Moodies already written and performed songs, plus overture &amp; conclusion sections on the album including backing up Graeme Edge&apos;s opening &amp; closing poems recited by Pinder. Strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of Hayward&apos;s &quot; Nights in White Satin &quot; (absent on the single hit version) as was Pinder&apos;s &quot; The Sun Set &quot;. The orchestra and group never actually perform together on the recording with the band&apos;s rock instrumentation centred on Pinder&apos;s Mellotron. The album, despite being a lush concept album, was in fact cut in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable &quot; linking &quot; orchestral portion which the Decca musicians (&apos;London Festival Orchestral&apos;) then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credits were listed on the sleeve as: &quot; Redwave-Knight &quot;, when in fact Hayward wrote &quot; Nights... &quot; and &quot; Tuesday Afternoon &quot;, Thomas provided &quot; Another Morning &quot; and &quot; Twilight Time &quot;, Lodge penned &quot; Peak Hour &quot; and &quot; Evening (Time To Get Away) &quot;, and Edge contributed the opening and closing poems (the first &apos;Morning Glory&apos; and the latter titled &quot; Late Lament &quot; ) read by Mike Pinder who composed both &quot; The Sun Set &quot; and &quot; Dawn is a Feeling &quot; (sung by Hayward, with Pinder himself singing the bridge section). Decca staff producer Tony Clarke produced the album, and afterwards continued working with the band. Sometimes known to fans as &quot; The Sixth Moodie &quot; he went on to produce all of their albums and singles for the next eleven years. Engineer Derek Varnals would also contribute heavily to the creation of the early Moodies&apos; studio sound, working with Pinder &amp; Clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the Mellotron as opposed to the sharp &apos;cut off&apos; the instrument would normally give, partly achieved by removing all the &quot; sound effects &quot; tapes (trains, whistles, cockerel crowing, etc.) and then &apos;doubling up&apos; the tapes of orchestral instruments&apos; sounds, which combined with Pinder&apos;s ability and sensitivity at playing (Pinder having earlier worked for the company that manufactured the Mellotron) and Varnals&apos; recording skills at creating an orchestral &apos;wave&apos; sound that characterised their non-orchestra accompanied sound thereafter. The album plus two singles, &quot; Nights in White Satin &quot; and &quot; Tuesday Afternoon &quot; (as a medley with &quot; Forever Afternoon, &quot; listed as &quot; Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?) &quot; on the album), became massively popular. [ In Search of the Lost Chord ] The 1968 follow-up LP, In Search of the Lost Chord included &quot; Legend of a Mind &quot;, a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to LSD guru Timothy Leary which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas – four members of the group had taken LSD together at the start of 1967. A promotional film for the song was filmed on location at Groot-Bijgaarden Castle ﻿ near Brussels in Belgium. Lodge provided a two part song &quot; House of Four Doors &quot; set either side of this Thomas&apos; epic piece. Justin Hayward began playing sitar and incorporating it into Moody Blues music ( &quot; Voices... &quot;, &quot; Visions of Paradise &quot;, etc.), having been inspired by George Harrison. Hayward&apos;s &quot; Voices in The Sky &quot; charted as a single in the UK (no.27), as did Lodge&apos;s &quot; Ride my See Saw &quot; (no.42, No.15 in France) – still their concert finale number today – which featured Pinder&apos;s non-album song &quot; A Simple Game &quot; as &apos;B&apos; side. Pinder&apos;s &quot; The Best Way To Travel &quot; was another high point, as was his closing song &quot; Om &quot; (sung by Pinder and Thomas, again featuring Hayward on sitar). Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, and some of their early albums from the late Sixties begin with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that would follow. Edge himself narrating his brief &quot; Departure &quot; poem on &quot; Lost Chord &quot;. [ On the Threshold of a Dream ] On 1969&apos;s On the Threshold of a Dream Hayward, Edge, &amp; Pinder share the opening narration on Edge&apos;s &quot; In The Beginning &quot;, leading into Hayward&apos;s &quot; Lovely To See You &quot;. His &quot; Never Comes The Day &quot; was issued as a UK single, while Thomas&apos; wry observations of life in &quot; Dear Diary &quot; and &quot; Lazy Day &quot; were striking features. Pinder contributed the closing track on side one, &quot; So Deep Within You &quot;. Side two closes with the &quot; Dream Sequence &quot;, Edge&apos;s poem &quot; The Dream &quot; leading into Pinder&apos;s &quot; Have You Heard &quot; parts I and II with the two parts separated by his classically themed instrumental piece &quot; The Voyage &quot;. [ To Our Children&apos;s Children&apos;s Children ] The band&apos;s music continued to become more complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of reverberation on the vocal tracks, resulting in 1969&apos;s To Our Children&apos;s Children&apos;s Children  — a concept album inspired by the first moon landing. The opening track &quot; Higher And Higher &quot; saw Pinder simulate a rocket blast-off on keyboards, then narrate Edge&apos;s lyrics. Thomas&apos; &quot; Floating &quot; and &quot; Eternity Road &quot; stood out, as did Hayward&apos;s &quot; Gypsy &quot; and a rare Pinder-Lodge collaboration &quot; Out And In &quot;. Lodge provided his two part &quot; Eyes of A Child &quot; and &quot; Candle of Life &quot; while Pinder contributed &quot; Sun is Still Shining &quot;. The album closes with &quot; Watching and Waiting &quot;, composed by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward and sung by Hayward. This song was issued as a single on the Threshold label but failed to chart. [ A Question of Balance ] Although the Moodies had by now defined a somewhat psychedelic style and helped to define the progressive rock (then also known as &apos;art rock&apos;) sound, the group decided to record an album that could be played in concert, losing some of their full-blown sound for A Question of Balance (1970). This album, reaching #3 in the American charts and #1 in the British charts, was indicative of the band&apos;s growing success in America. Hayward&apos;s &quot; Question &quot; (in a differing version) was issued as a single hitting No.2 in the UK (only kept from top spot by The England World Cup football team&apos;s novelty record &quot; Back Home &quot; ). Justin Hayward began an artful exploration of guitar tone through the use of numerous effects pedals and fuzz-boxes, and developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitar-solo sound. The Moody Blues had by now become a bill-topping act in their own right, they appeared twice at the famous &quot; Isle of Wight Festivals &quot; (A DVD of their 1970 performance has now been released). Pinder&apos;s &quot; Melancholy Man &quot; (a no. 1 single in France) stood out besides Hayward&apos;s &quot; Question &quot; on the 1970 album. [ Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Seventh Sojourn ] For their next two albums, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1971) – from which Hayward&apos;s &quot; The Story in Your Eyes &quot; was taken as a US Charting single (no.23), and Seventh Sojourn (1972) (which reached #1 in the U.S.), the band returned to their signature orchestral sound which, while difficult to reproduce in concert, had become their trademark. The title &quot; Every Good Boy Deserves Favour &quot; was borrowed, tongue-in-cheek, from a mnemonic used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef: EGBDF. The opening track &quot; Procession &quot; was the only item composed by all five band members, a fascinating track depicting the &quot; evolution &quot; of music, leading into Hayward&apos;s &quot; Story in Your Eyes &quot;. Thomas&apos;s reflective &quot; Our Guessing Game &quot; and whimsical &quot; Nice To Be Here &quot; offset the deeper drama of Hayward&apos;s &quot; You Can Never Go Home &quot;, Lodge&apos;s &quot; One More Time To Live &quot; and Pinder&apos;s &quot; My Song &quot;. Edge, the long standing drummer-poet, started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken – his &quot; After You Came &quot; (1971) featured each of the four Lead singers taking a vocal section. Then in 1972 Lodge&apos;s songs &quot; Isn&apos;t Life Strange ? &quot; (no.13) and &quot; I&apos;m Just A Singer (in A Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll Band) &quot; (no.36) were lifted from &quot; Seventh Sojourn &quot; as charting UK singles. &quot; Sojourn &quot; also saw Pinder using the new Chamberlain instrument in place of Mellotron and Edge use an electronic drum kit. Pinder&apos;s stirring lament &quot; Lost in A Lost World &quot; opened this last &quot; Core Seven &quot; outing, while his sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary &quot; When You&apos;re A Free Man &quot;, Thomas&apos;s romantic &quot; For My Lady &quot;, and Hayward&apos;s serene &quot; New Horizons &quot; all stood out. They each provided well known songs during this period,in addition to the singles, Pinder&apos;s songs &quot; A Simple Game &quot; (1968) &amp; &quot; So Deep Within You &quot; (1969) were successfully covered by The Four Tops, Pinder winning an Ivor Novello Award for &quot; A Simple Game &quot;, Elkie Brooks later covered Hayward&apos;s &quot; Nights in White Satin &quot;. Pinder also appeared on John Lennon &apos;s &quot; Imagine &quot; album in 1971, providing additional percussion on &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Be A Soldier (I Don&apos;t Want To Die) &quot;. The 1968 to 1972 album sleeves, plus several solo sets up to Ray Thomas&apos;s &quot; Hopes, Wishes &amp; Dreams &quot; in 1976, were characterised by striking surreal scenic sleeve artwork (mostly gatefold sleeves) by artist Phil Travers. In late 1972, a re-issue of the five-year-old Nights in White Satin became the Moody Blues&apos; biggest US hit, soaring to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming a certified million-seller; the song had &quot; bubbled under &quot; the Hot 100 charts on its original release. The song also returned to the UK charts, reaching #9, ten places higher than its original release in 1967. [ Threshold Records ] The Moodies were also among the pioneers of the idea that a successful rock band could promote itself through their own label, following the Beatles&apos; creation of Apple Records. After their On the Threshold of a Dream album (1969), they created Threshold Records, prompted in part by disputes with London/Deram over album design costs (their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives). Threshold would produce new albums and deliver them to London/Decca who acted as distributor. The group attempted to build Threshold into a major label by developing new talent  — most notably the UK hard rock band Trapeze and the Portland, Oregon, classical-acoustic sextet Providence  — but these efforts proved unsuccessful and the Moodies eventually returned to more traditional recording contracts. They did lay the groundwork, however, for other major acts to set up similar personal labels and distribution deals including The Rolling Stones &apos; own label and Led Zeppelin &apos;s Swan Song, and all of the Moodies&apos; studio releases from 1969 to 1999 would bear the Threshold logo on at least one of their format versions. [ Hiatus and solo work, 1974–1976 ] In the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group took an extended break, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this said by Hayward himself in the final issue of Higher &amp; Higher magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), with Hayward the principal guitarist/vocalist, Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas handled much of the Moodies onstage audience liaison work (as the 1969 &quot; Caught Live &quot; album displays). Before the band&apos;s 1973–74 world tour, Hayward wrote a song called &quot; Island &quot; with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. Major reasons for the hiatus was their standing had become almost frightening by this time with so many employees the band members could not recognise and misguided fans seeking some kind of Papal blessings &amp; cures for illness; etc.. This overblown adoration deeply disturbed the band members who were also feeling the strain of trying to run their own record label (as The Beatles had earlier) – Ray Thomas remarked that he found himself on the tube with a stack of legal papers. [ January 2010 ] An additional cause of the hiatus was the long tours had by this time strained Mike Pinder who needed a rest. [ January 2010 ] In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album This Is The Moody Blues which was released that year. Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, &quot; Blue Guitar &quot; (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward &amp; Lodge even though it was actually just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward &amp; Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. &quot; Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to England for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise. &quot; { History of the Mellotron } Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which would be followed up in later years by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996), and Live In San Juan Capistrano (1998); Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976). [ Reunion, 1977–1990 ] [ Reunion ] { Patrick Moraz, } { Ray Thomas, } { Graeme Edge, } { Justin Hayward, and } { John Lodge } In 1977, as the group made a decision to record together again, with their record company Decca (UK) urging a reunion album. London Records decided to release a somewhat poorly mixed then-eight-year-old recording of the band performing at the Royal Albert Hall, against their artistic wishes. London/Decca did this in an attempt to re-energise a somewhat waning public interest in the Moody Blues before their anticipated new album. By this time Pinder had married and started a family in California, so for their reunion recording, the band decamped stateside with producer Clarke. The sessions were marked with tension and division, first there was a fire at the studios they were using, then after quickly re-locating to Pinder&apos;s home studio a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them inevitably causing tensions to rise (with Pinder then dropping out before completion). Producer Tony Clarke was also forced to leave because of non-musical reasons before the album was completed, but by the spring of 1978 Octave was ready for release. Pinder, citing his young family, and by then probably considering their touring days behind them, excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow. Pinder&apos;s decision caused some open acrimony within the band (notably from Edge), Ray Thomas had said Pinder was initially agreeable to touring, and his opting out later on (with a major comeback tour already planned) was a severe and embarrassing blow to them. Attempts were made by their management to completely downplay Pinder&apos;s absence, notably at a major UK music press party Decca organised, when the top Decca dignitary guest, while making a &quot; welcome back &quot; speech, openly referred to &quot; Mike Pinder being currently absent over in the States &quot;, much to their dismay. [ Octave, Pinder departs, and arrival of Moraz ] During this period, the prog-rock band Yes had asked their keyboard player, Patrick Moraz, to leave. Moraz&apos;s management had some contacts with the Moodies, and after a successful audition with the band in England in 1978, he was hired as keyboard player for the Octave World Tour that began in Germany in October. In spite of these difficulties, the album itself sold well and produced the hits &quot; Steppin&apos; in a Slide Zone &quot;, (no. 39 US) written by Lodge and &quot; Driftwood &quot;, (no. 59 US) written by Hayward. The music video produced for &quot; Driftwood &quot; features Moraz, although Mike Pinder was the one who played on the actual recording; the video for &quot; Steppin&apos; in a Slide Zone &quot; simply shows the other four members without Pinder (which was rather awkward as Pinder&apos;s keyboards featured extensively on the song, notably on the distinctive intro and during a solo section of the piece). A group performance of Hayward&apos;s &quot; Had to Fall in Love &quot; &amp; Lodge&apos;s &quot; Slide Zone &quot; on the UK &quot; Kenny Everett Show &quot; also depicted them as a four piece. On Octave Hayward had some four solo composed songs (more in fact than on &quot; The Other Side of Life &quot; later in 1986), Edge contributed &quot; I&apos;ll Be Level With You &quot; (aka &quot; Little Man &quot; ) one of only a number of songs showing a complete group unity. In truth, a few songs sounded like solo efforts, while Lodge&apos;s &quot; Survival &quot;, Hayward&apos;s appropriate closing &quot; The Day We Meet Again &quot; and Pinder&apos;s lone final contribution and lead vocal, &quot; One Step Into The Light &quot; (curiously as the band is depicted as doing so on the cover photo – where Pinder is perhaps significantly barely glimpsed at all and almost out of focus) were all high points on the album. Around this time Justin Hayward enjoyed a solo hit (no.5) in the UK (US #47) with the song &quot; Forever Autumn &quot; from Jeff Wayne&apos;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds. In recent times Hayward has sung both this and &quot; The Eve of The War &quot; live in the touring version of the album, as featured on Wayne&apos;s original big selling double album. The Moodies toured the US and Europe during much of 1979. By 1980 they were ready to record again, this time bringing in producer Pip Williams. Moraz was retained as the band&apos;s permanent keyboardist, though Pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band. Pinder attempted legal measures to prevent the new Moody Blues album from reaching the public without his contributions, but he was not successful, and ultimately, he never returned to the fold. Nevertheless when released in 1981, Long Distance Voyager was a colossal success, reaching #1 on Billboard and top 5 in the UK. The album yielded two hits, &quot; The Voice &quot;, (no. 15 US) written by Hayward, and &quot; Gemini Dream &quot;,(no.12 US) written by Hayward and Lodge. John Lodge&apos;s &quot; Talking out of Turn &quot; also charted in the US reaching no. 65. Edge provided &quot; 22,000 Days &quot; (featuring Thomas as lead voice with Hayward &amp; Lodge) while Thomas&apos; own contributions were the final portion of the set with his singing on the final two songs; &quot; Painted Smile &quot;, &quot; Reflective Smile &quot; (a poem narrated by a DJ friend of the band) and &quot; Veteran Cosmic Rocker &quot;. By now, the mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio albums and the band embraced a more modern, less symphonic approach, though still retaining a lush keyboard-led sound as Moraz gave a more contemporary edge [ June 2011 ] to their sound. In live concerts the mellotron would still be used heavily by Patrick Moraz until the mid-1980s, strikingly also on songs which originally did not originally feature the mellotron. [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D7X9TKJEDGDQ%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dchannel_video_title Stepping In A Slide Zone – LIVE YouTube 2011-05-15 2012-04-17 ] The marketing formula for the band demanded from this time forward that a Justin Hayward song would be used to lead off their studio albums [ June 2011 ], as his material was the most popular [ June 2011 ]. Hayward had always written most of their hit singles, followed by Lodge, however from this point onwards Hayward had to carry far more of the composing burden, most notably in Pinder&apos;s absence. Also Ray Thomas&apos; song contributions began to diminish soon after, Hayward and Lodge also then teaming up to provide songs in addition to their own compositions. The Present (1983), again produced by Williams, proved less successful than its predecessor, though it did spawn a UK top 40 hit (No. 35) in &quot; Blue World &quot; (#62 in the U.S.) and a US top 40 hit in &quot; Sitting at the Wheel &quot; (which failed to chart in the UK). Videos were also produced for both singles. &quot; The Present &quot; was released in conjunction with Talencora Ltd. shortly before Decca were bought out by Polydor Records. [ The Other Side of Life, Sur La Mer ] In 1986 they enjoyed renewed success with their album The Other Side of Life and in particular with the track &quot; Your Wildest Dreams &quot; – a US Top 10 hit (and #1 on Billboard&apos;s Adult Contemporary singles chart for two weeks) which garnered a Billboard Video of the Year award after being frequently featured on MTV. Newly hired producer Tony Visconti, and Barry Radman, a synth programmer formerly hired by Moraz, delivered a modern sound the Moodies had been after in order to remain competitive with their pop contemporaries. The album&apos;s title song also charted in the US, at #58. The renewed interest in the band ensured a younger audience from this point on, with many of their longtime followers remaining loyal despite a fair number of older fans finding the current albums of this period far more lightweight in content. For example, John Lodge had gone from writing powerfully reflective mystical or humanitarian themed pieces such as &quot; House of Four Doors &quot;, &quot; Candle of Life &quot; and &quot; One More Time To Live &quot; to quirkier items such as &quot; Here Comes The Weekend &quot;, &quot; Rock and Roll Over You &quot; and &quot; Love is On The Run (From Me) &quot;, while Hayward&apos;s songs seemed [ April 2010 ] less the deeper drama of numbers such as &quot; The Actor &quot;, &quot; Dawning is the Day &quot;, &quot; You Can Never Go Home &quot;, &quot; The Land of Make Believe &quot;, etc., to pleasant (and more radio-friendly) perennial far simpler songs about lost love and romance ( &quot; Your Wildest Dreams &quot;, &quot; No More Lies &quot;, &quot; I Know You&apos;re Out There Somewhere &quot; etc.). There were still some deeper songs being created by the band, however, ( &quot; The Voice &quot;, &quot; 22,000 Days &quot;, &quot; The Other Side of Life &quot;, &quot; The Spirit &quot;, &quot; Deep &quot;, etc.) but the overall tone of the band had become noticeably a more lightweight commercialised one; presumably this was with record company agreement to keep in accordance with the then prevailing times. [ April 2010 ] Significantly their live shows from this period included a good number of their eighties album tracks, however over time more of the &quot; Core Seven &quot; album era favourites would gradually begin to reappear in their playlist. The Moody Blues performed live at the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986 which raised money for the Birmingham Children&apos;s Hospital. The band played four songs, and later provided backup with the Electric Light Orchestra for George Harrison. The Moodies continued their early video-generation success with Sur La Mer (1988) and its video and single, &quot; I Know You&apos;re Out There Somewhere &quot; (#30 US, #52 UK, #2 US Mainstream Rock), a sequel to &quot; Your Wildest Dreams &quot;. Their sound took on an ever-increasingly synthetic and technical quality as Moraz and Visconti began using modern sequencers, samplers and drum machines. During this time, Justin Hayward and John Lodge wrote and sang on most of the songs as the band came under pressure from their new record company, PolyGram Records, to promote those it deemed to be the two more commercial-looking and -sounding members. Ray Thomas was playing a diminished role in the studio. The band was evolving into a synthpop act, with music not at all fit for a flute (although Thomas actually provided additional percussion, notably a brisk tambourine, on many more Moodies songs which continued to be featured, plus occasional harmonica), and at this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer. Thomas was also unwell during this period, further limiting his involvement with the band in the recording studio. He provided some backing vocals for both The Other Side of Life and Sur La Mer; however, multiple production considerations led Visconti to leave Thomas&apos; vocals off of the latter of these two albums, thereby further reducing the texture of their overall vocal sound, which had been rich four-part harmonies, then went down to three, now reduced still further to just the more similar-sounding voices of Hayward and Lodge (Lodge also providing falsetto vocals and high harmonies), with Pinder and Thomas each having provided both lower- and higher-pitched vocal harmonies in the group&apos;s earlier vocal sound. The band&apos;s &quot; sound &quot; had become unrecognizable. [ 1990s to present ] [ Departure of Moraz ] Thomas&apos; high value remained on stage primarily from his continued ability to sing out his 1960s and 1970s Moodies classics, and also in flute and keyboard duets he composed with Moraz which were only performed by the two during Moodies&apos; concerts. The band had begun to reinforce their concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist ( Bias Boshell was the first, replaced in 1987 by Guy Allison before Boshell returned by 1990), as well as female backing singers (see Personnel below). In 1991, halfway through the production of their new studio album, Patrick Moraz made some comments in an article in Keyboard Magazine that suggested dissatisfaction with his role in the Moodies. His complaints ranged from the Moodies&apos; music becoming too simple in structure, to the other members&apos; reluctance to allow him to make significant contributions to the songwriting on their albums. He also was spending long amounts of time planning a music concert to celebrate his native Switzerland&apos;s 700th anniversary, instead of rehearsing with the Moodies. He was dismissed from further participation in the group before the project was completed. Boshell, as well as new keyboardist Paul Bliss, were brought in to finish the new album&apos;s keyboard tracks. Despite credits as an &apos;official band member&apos; being included in any group photos on the four Eighties studio albums from &quot; Long Distance Voyager &quot; to &quot; Sur La Mer &quot; in recent years Moodies compilations now refer to Moraz as merely being an &apos;Additional keyboardist&apos;. Moraz later took legal action against the group in the United States, which he won, but was then awarded only a nominal sum. [ Keys of the Kingdom ] Keys of the Kingdom (1991) had modest commercial success. Once again, Hayward&apos;s songs led off the album, with the new singles &quot; Say It With Love &quot; and &quot; Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back). &quot; Also included was a new ambient flute piece by Ray Thomas entitled &quot; Celtic Sonant. &quot; Hayward and Thomas also co-wrote &quot; Never Blame The Rainbows For The Rain &quot; to close the album. John Lodge would make a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as &quot; Lean On Me (Tonight) &quot; (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as &quot; Emily&apos;s Song &quot; for his daughter in 1971 and &quot; Survival &quot; in 1978, plus &quot; Talking out of Turn &quot; in 1981), while Lodge&apos;s more powerful songs continued with &quot; Magic &quot; and the Lennonesque &quot; Shadows On the Wall &quot;. This gentler trend would continue on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece &quot; Say What You Mean. &quot; Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on &quot; Keys &quot;, as did Christopher Neil and Alan Tarney. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the Montreux Jazz Festival. A non-album Hayward-Lodge song cut at these sessions, &quot; Highway &quot;, was included on the &quot; Say it With Love &quot; twelve-inch single and on a later box set, while the vinyl album did not include their song &quot; Once is Enough &quot; as on the compact disc version. The group remained a steady concert draw, and a series of video and audio versions of their 1992 Night at Red Rocks concert enjoyed great success, particularly as a fund-raiser for American public television where it had been first broadcast. The concert was conducted and arranged by Larry Baird, who has participated in many other bands&apos; orchestral live concerts, such as Kansas, Michael Bolton, Three Dog Night, Al Jarreau and Alan Parsons. The group also continued their use of additional musicians on stage and in the studio. After the two legal suits from both Pinder in 1981 and Moraz in 1992, the band were careful not to recognize future keyboard players as official members. Following on from his contributions as keyboardist on the &apos;Keys Of The Kingdom&apos; album, Paul Bliss has played keyboards for the band live since 1991, being promoted to first keyboardist in 2001 (but has since been replaced in March 2010 after 19 years continuous service with the band). Thomas and Bliss continued the tradition of a flute/keyboard duet for many tours. After Edge injured himself in 1991, second drummer Gordon Marshall was brought in to back him up; he stayed with the group after Edge recovered and has remained in the position since. [ Strange Times,1990s tours ] From 1991 to 1998, the group took a hiatus from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. The recording hiatus ended in 1999, with the album Strange Times, which proved to be the group&apos;s first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by UK critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album&apos;s chart performance – probably not helped by the long recording hiatus – which was notably less than &apos;Keys of the Kingdom&apos; in 1991. It was recorded in Recco, Italy, at Hayward&apos;s suggestion, and was the band&apos;s first self-produced effort. The album also featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who has worked in-studio with the band since. The album opened with &quot; English Sunset &quot;, a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. The song &quot; This is The Moment &quot; (which is not on &quot; Strange Times &quot; ), which was originally featured in the Broadway production of &quot; Jekyll and Hyde &quot;, was a minor hit in the US. Strange Times was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge &quot; Nothing Changes &quot;, narrated by Edge himself, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder&apos;s 1968 song title &apos;A Simple Game&apos;. Also in 1999, The Moody Blues appeared in one episode of &quot; The Simpsons &quot; called &quot; Viva Ned Flanders &quot;. On &quot; Strange Times &quot; Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward &amp; Lodge on &quot; Sooner or Later (Walkin&apos; on Air) &quot; and his own brief song &quot; My Little Lovely &quot;, plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on Hayward&apos;s &quot; English Sunset &quot;; these would prove to be his recorded vocal swan song with the band. In 2000, the band released &quot; Hall of Fame &quot;, a new live concert from Royal Albert Hall, with a concurrent DVD release. This was taken from the last tour on which Boshell played. He left the live lineup in 2001; Bliss took over first keyboard duties, with his former second keyboard role filled by Bernie Barlow, and Julie Ragins when Barlow took maternity leave from 2006 to 2009. In 2001, an IMAX film was released, entitled Journey into Amazing Caves, which featured two new songs written and performed by the Moody Blues. The soundtrack also featured Justin Hayward performing vocals and playing guitar throughout. One of these songs, entitled &quot; Water &quot;, is the Moody Blues&apos; first instrumental studio recording since their 1983 piece &quot; Hole in the World &quot; from The Present LP. Hayward and Lodge live in 2007 [ Thomas retires, December ] The new millennium saw the Moody Blues reducing their touring schedule. At the end of 2002, founding member Ray Thomas retired from the group, reducing the Moody Blues to the trio of Hayward, Lodge, and Edge, the latter being the only original member remaining. Flautist &amp; rhythm guitarist Norda Mullen was recruited early the following year for their North America tour, and has worked with the band live and in the studio since. Toward the end of 2003, they released an album entitled December. The songs included originals and four covers: John Lennon &apos;s &quot; Happy Xmas (War Is Over) &quot;, Mike Batt&apos;s &quot; A Winter&apos;s Tale &quot;, &quot; When A Child is Born &quot; and Bing Crosby&apos;s &quot; White Christmas &quot;. December was the group&apos;s first album to include covers since their 1965 debut album The Magnificent Moodies. In March 2006, the first five of the band&apos;s &apos;Core Seven&apos; albums (the seven albums from Days of Future Passed to Seventh Sojourn ) were re-released in SACD format with Deluxe Editions, featuring bonus songs and some rare previously unreleased tracks by the group. In April 2007, the last two of these classic albums were re-released by Universal/Threshold. These deluxe editions were unique for an art rock group like the Moodies in that one of their members, Justin Hayward, was the one hired to do the work, instead of a professional master technician. Hayward stated that he listened to virgin vinyl copies of these albums and used them as reference points for the new compact discs. In September 2008, Hayward announced the impending release of remastered versions of Octave, Long Distance Voyager and The Present which will be released on Universal Records in the months to come. On May 21, 2007 the Moodies released a forty-one track, two-disc compilation of sessions recorded at BBC Studios, various television appearances, and a previously &apos;lost&apos; performance done on the Tom Jones show titled Live at the BBC: 1967-1970. { The Moody Blues official website. } { The Moody Blues – Live at the BBC 1967–1970. } [ Latest work ] { Santa Ynez, California in 2005. L-R: Justin Hayward, Graeme Edge and John Lodge } In 2007, the now defunct Hard Rock Park theme park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, announced the building of a dark ride entitled &quot; Nights in White Satin: The Trip &quot;. The ride incorporated multi-sensory experiences as well as a re-orchestrated version of the song by Justin Hayward. A re-recorded version of Graeme Edge&apos;s &quot; Late Lament &quot; again followed, which had each group member reading a verse of the poem. { Hard Rock Park; News &amp; Rumours, 24 January 2009. } In March 2009, the ride closed because of the conversion of the park to the Freestyle Music Park, with the new owners desiring to make the park more &quot; family friendly. &quot; The group continue to tour; they toured the US, Canada and the UK in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. In addition, Hayward took part in the UK tour of Jeff Wayne&apos;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds in April 2006, and a second tour in November 2007, also with dates in 2009. The Moody Blues also toured Australia and New Zealand in 2006. Their long-time producer, Tony Clarke, died in January 2010. The Moody Blues added keyboardist Alan Hewitt for their 2010 North American and UK Tours. [ Moody Bluegrass ] The Moody Bluegrass project is a group of Nashville artists who have recorded an album of 12 Moody Blues songs in the Bluegrass style, under the title Moody Bluegrass – A Nashville Tribute to the Moody Blues. Those involved include Alison Krauss, Harley Allen, Tim O&apos;Brien, John Cowan, Larry Cordle, Jan Harvey, Emma Harvey, Sam Bush and John Randall. A second Moody Bluegrass album entitled Two...Much Love with a further 16 Moody Blues songs will include guest performances from Hayward, Lodge and Edge, (each of whom is credited as the lead on one song) plus Thomas and Pinder, making this the first time since 1978 that these five musicians all appeared on one newly-recorded album.
