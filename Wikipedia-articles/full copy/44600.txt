Similar to carnelian is sard, which is generally harder and darker. (The difference is not rigidly defined, and the two names are often used interchangeably.) Both carnelian and sard are varieties of the silica mineral chalcedony colored by impurities of iron oxide. The color can vary greatly, ranging from pale orange to an intense almost-black coloration.

Michael Hogan, &apos;&apos;Knossos fieldnotes&apos;&apos;, Modern Antiquarian (2007) } this use dates to approximately 1800 BC. Carnelian was used widely during Roman times to make engraved gems for signet or seal ring s for imprinting a seal with wax on correspondence or other important documents. Hot wax does not stick to carnelian. { Section 12 of the translation of Weilue - a 3rd century Chinese text by John Hill under &quot; carnelian &quot; and note 12.12 (17) } Sard was used for Assyria n cylinder seal s, Egyptian and Phoenicia n scarabs, and early Greek and Etruscan gems. [ Sard ] The Hebrew odem (translated sardius), the first stone in the High Priest&apos;s breastplate, was a red stone, probably sard but perhaps red jasper. { Cypriot artwork with } { Mycenaean inspiration, ca. 1400–1200 BC.

[ &apos;Cornelian&apos; http://www.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary Oxford University Press 14 February 2012 ] Cornelian, cognate with similar words in several Romance languages, comes from the Mediaeval Latin corneolus, itself derived from the Latin word cornum, the cornel cherry, [ Carnelian ] whose translucent red fruits resemble the stone. The Oxford English Dictionary calls &quot; carnelian &quot; a perversion of &quot; cornelian &quot;, by subsequent analogy with the Latin word caro, carnis, flesh. According to Pliny the Elder, sard derives its name from the city of Sardis in Lydia, but it more likely comes from the Persian word سرد sered, meaning yellowish-red. [ Distinction between carnelian and sard ] The names carnelian and sard are often used interchangeably, but they can also be used to describe distinct subvarieties. The general differences are as follows:   Carnelian Sard Color Lighter, with shades ranging from orange to reddish-brown. Darker, with shades ranging from a deep reddish-brown to almost black. Hardness Softer Harder and tougher. Fracture Uneven, splintery and conchoidal Like carnelian, but duller and more hackly. All of these properties vary across a continuum, and so the boundary between carnelian and sard is inevitably blurred.
