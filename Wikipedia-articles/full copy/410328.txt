ISBN 0-901824-25-9 } The Isle of Mull ( Scottish Gaelic Muile, [ ˈmulə pron ] ) — or simply Mull — is the second largest island of the Inner Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland in the council area of Argyll and Bute. With an area of [ 875.35 km2 sqmi ] Mull is the fourth largest Scottish island and the fourth largest island surrounding Great Britain. In the 2001 census the usual resident population of Mull was 2,667; in the summer this is supplemented by many tourist s. Much of the population lives in Tobermory, the only burgh on the island until 1973, and its capital. Tobermory is also home to Mull&apos;s only single malt Scotch whisky distillery, Tobermory (formerly Ledaig). { Tobermory Distillery tobermory.co.uk Retrieved 2010-07-10. } [ History ] It is widely understood that Mull was inhabited shortly after the end of the last Ice Age, from around 6000 BC. Bronze Age inhabitants built menhir s, broch s and a stone circle with examples of burial cairns, cists, standing stones, stone circles, pottery and knife blades providing compelling evidence. Between 600 BC to 400 AD Iron Age inhabitants were building protective forts, duns and crannogs. The early Christian period began in the 6th Century, with 563AD being a pivotal point as it is believed that Christianity was brought to this part of northern Britain by St. Columba, when he arrived from Ireland to set up a monastery on the Island of Iona just off the south-west point of Mull. In the 14th century Mull became part of the Lordship of the Isles. After the collapse of the Lordship in 1493 the island was taken over by the clan MacLean, and in 1681 by the clan Campbell. Legend has it that the wreck of a Spanish galleon, laden with gold, lies somewhere in the mud at the bottom of Tobermory Bay - although the ship&apos;s true identity, and cargo, are in dispute. By some accounts, the Florencia (or Florida, or San Francisco), a member of the defeated Spanish Armada fleeing the English fleet in 1588, anchored in Tobermory to take on provisions. Following a dispute over payment, the ship caught fire and the gunpowder magazine exploded, sinking the vessel. In her hold, reputedly, was £300,000 in gold bullion. { A Clan Feud, a Spanish Galleon, and a Big Bang. lostfort.blogspot.com Retrieved 2010-07-10. } Other sources claim the vessel was the San Juan de Sicilia (or San Juan de Baptista), which, records indicate, carried troops, not treasure. { The Galleon San Francisco. shipmodeling.net Retrieved 2010-07-10. } { The Tobermory Wreck. news.scotsman.com Retrieved 2010-07-10. } According to that account, the island&apos;s chief, Lachlan Mor Maclean, struck a deal with the Spanish commander to reprovision and refit the ship in return for military intervention on the side of the MacLeans in their feud with enemies on nearby islands.

During the Highland Clearances in the 18th and 19th centuries, the population fell from 10,000 to less than 3,000. The whole island became a Restricted Area during World War 2. The bay at Tobermory became a naval base commanded from HMS &apos;&apos;Western Isles&apos;&apos;. The base and the Restricted Area were under Commodore (later Vice Admiral) Sir Gilbert Stephenson, whose strict discipline and ferocious temper earned him the nickname &quot; The Terror of Tobermory &quot;. [ The Terror of Tobermory: Vice-Admiral Sir Gilbert Stephenson, KBE, CB, CMG Baker Richard Richard Baker (broadcaster) 1972 W.H. Allen 978-1-84158-197-2 ] The base was used to train Escort Groups in anti-submarine warfare. 911 ships passed through the base between 1940 and 1945. Mull boasts such historic buildings as Duart Castle and Torosay Castle, both open to the public from Easter to September. (Torosay Castle is to open Easter until end of June 2011(subject to change due to sale of castle.) Moy Castle is a small distressed castle on the shore of Lochbuie. The mausoleum of Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales from 1809 to 1822, may be found in the village of Gruline on the island (Macquarie had been born on the nearby island of Ulva ).A notable 17th-century poetess Mary Macleod (Mairi Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh) was said to have been banished here. [ Schooling ] There is one secondary school on the island, based in Tobermory, and several primary schools. Secondary pupils (age 11 - 18) from Iona, Bunessan and Fionnphort in the south west attend Oban High School, staying in an Oban hostel from Monday to Thursday. [ Geography ] { Ordnance Survey map of Mull and surrounding area } Mull has a coastline of [ 480 km mi ] and its climate is moderated by the Gulf Stream. The island has a mountainous core, the highest peak on the island being Ben More, which reaches [ 966 m ft ]. Various peninsulas, which are predominantly moorland, radiate from the centre. The Aros peninsula to the north includes the main town of Tobermory, which was a burgh until 1973 when burghs were abolished. Other settlements include Salen and Calgary. The Ross of Mull lies to the south west and includes the villages of Bunessan, Pennyghael, Uisken and Fionnphort. Lochbuie, Lochdon and Craignure lie to the east. Numerous islands lie off the west coast of Mull, including Erraid, Inch Kenneth, Iona and Ulva. Smaller uninhabited islands include Eorsa, Gometra, Little Colonsay, the Treshnish Isles and Staffa of Fingal&apos;s Cave fame. Calve Island is an uninhabited island in Tobermory Bay.Two outlying rock lighthouses are also visible from the south west of Mull, Dubh Artach and Skerryvore. The Torran Rocks are a large shoal of reefs, islets and skerries, approximately [ 15 sqmi km2 ] in extent, located two miles (3  km) to the south west, between the Ross of Mull peninsula and Dubh Artach. Frank Lockwood&apos;s Island near Lochbuie is named after the brother-in-law of the 21st MacLean of Lochbuie, who was Solicitor General from 1894-5. { Baird (1995) p. 142 } Part of the indented west coast of Mull and some of the offshore islands there are part of the Loch Na Keal National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland. { &quot; National Scenic Areas &quot;.

Retrieved 30 Mar 2011. } [ Economy ] Farming, fishing and burning seaweed to kelp ash (used in the manufacture of soap and glass ) were the main economic activities on the island until the 19th century. Tobermory was built by the British Fisheries Society in 1788 as a planned settlement to support the fishing industry. In the mid 19th century the Highland Potato Famine and the Highland Clearances reduced the population by two thirds and the island economy collapsed. In the early 20th century there were more sheep than people. The economy began to revive when the construction of Craignure Pier in 1964 started to bring tourists. Tourism is now the mainstay of the island&apos;s economy. Ecotourism became popular from the 1990s and the re-introduction of White-tailed eagle s in 2005 became a particular ecotourist drawcard.
