Percy is known for his philosophical novels set in and around New Orleans, Louisiana, the first of which, The Moviegoer, won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. He devoted his literary life to the exploration of &quot; the dislocation of man in the modern age. &quot; { Kimball, Roger. Existentialism, Semiotics and Iced Tea, Review of Conversations with Walker Percy New York Times, August 4, 1985. Retrieved 2010-06-12. } His work displays a unique combination of existential questioning, Southern sensibility, and deep Catholic faith. [ Biography ] Percy was born in Birmingham, Alabama as the oldest son of three boys, to LeRoy Pratt Percy and Martha Susan Phinizy. His father&apos;s Mississippi Protestant family included his uncle LeRoy Percy, a U.S. Senator, and LeRoy Pope Percy, a Civil War hero. Prior to Percy&apos;s birth, in 1917, his grandfather died by suicide, setting a family pattern of emotional struggle and deaths that would haunt Percy throughout his life. In 1929 when Percy was 13, his father died by suicide. His mother took the family to her mother&apos;s in Athens, Georgia. Two years later, his mother died in a car crash when she drove off a country bridge and into Deer Creek near Leland, Mississippi, an accident which Percy regarded as another suicide. { Samway, Patrick. Walker Percy: A Life. (Loyola Press USA, 1999) p. 4 } Walker and his two younger brothers, LeRoy (Roy) and Phinizy (Phin), moved to Greenville, Mississippi, where their paternal uncle William Alexander Percy, a bachelor lawyer and poet, became their guardian and adopted them. Percy was raised an agnostic, though nominally affiliated with a theologically liberal Presbyterian church. { O&apos;Gorman, Farrell. Extract from &quot; Walker Percy, the Catholic Church and Southern race relations (ca. 1947–1970) &quot;, The Mississippi Quarterly, Winter, 1999/2000. } &quot; Uncle Will &quot; introduced him to many writers and poets, and to a neighboring boy his own age: Shelby Foote, who became his life-long best friend. { Elie, Paul (2003). The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. } Later, he and his wife would both join the Roman Catholic Church. Percy insisted on being confirmed with the children, as a sign of his new life. As young men, Percy and Foote decided to pay their respects to William Faulkner by visiting him in Oxford, Mississippi. But, when they arrived at his home, Percy was so in awe of the literary giant that he could not bring himself to talk to him. Later on, he recounted how he could only sit in the car and watch while Foote and Faulkner had a lively conversation on the porch. Percy joined Foote at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was initiated into the Xi chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He trained as a medical doctor at Columbia University in New York City, receiving his medical degree in 1941. He also underwent psychotherapy to deal with the legacy of suicide in his family. After contracting tuberculosis from performing an autopsy while interning at Bellevue Hospital Center, Percy spent the next several years recuperating at the Trudeau Sanitorium in Saranac Lake, New York in the Adirondacks. During this period, Percy read the works of the Danish existentialist writer, Søren Kierkegaard, and the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky; he began to question the ability of science to explain the basic mysteries of human existence. Having been influenced by the example of one of his college roommates to rise daily at dawn and go to Mass, Percy decided to convert, and he was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1947. { Hanley, Lorene Duquin. A Century of Catholic Converts. Our Sunday Visitor, 2003. 151-53. Print. } [ Marriage and family ] He married Mary Bernice Townsend, a medical technician, on November 7, 1946. Fearing that he was sterile, the married couple adopted their first daughter, Mary Pratt. They later managed to conceive their second daughter Ann, who was deaf from an early age. The family settled in Covington, Louisiana. Percy&apos;s wife and one of their daughters had a bookstore, where he often wrote in an office on the second floor. Walker Percy died of prostate cancer in 1990, eighteen days before his 74th birthday. He is buried on the grounds of St. Joseph Benedictine Abbey in St. Benedict, Louisiana. He was a secular oblate of the Abbey&apos;s monastic community, making his final oblation on February 16, 1990, less than three months before his death. { &quot; Remembering Walker Percy as a Benedictine Oblate &quot;, Plastic Beatitude blog. } [ Literary career ] After many years of writing and rewriting in collaboration with editor Stanley Kauffmann, Percy published his first novel, The Moviegoer in 1961. Percy later wrote of the novel that it was the story of &quot; a young man who had all the advantages of a cultivated old-line southern family: a feel for science and art, a liking for girls, sports cars, and the ordinary things of the culture, but who nevertheless feels himself quite alienated from both worlds, the old South and the new America. &quot; { Andrews, Deborah. Annual Obituary, 1990. St. James Press, 1991. 317. Print. } Subsequent works included The Last Gentleman (1966), Love in the Ruins (1971), Lancelot (1977), The Second Coming (1980), and The Thanatos Syndrome in 1987. Percy also published a number of non-fiction works exploring his interests in semiotics and Existentialism, the most popular work being Lost in the Cosmos. Percy taught and mentored younger writers. He was instrumental in getting John Kennedy Toole &apos;s novel A Confederacy of Dunces published in 1980, more than a decade after Toole&apos;s suicide, in part because he was despondent about not being able to get his book recognized. Set in New Orleans, it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

[ Legacy and honors ] In 1989 the University of Notre Dame awarded Percy its Laetare Medal, which is bestowed annually to a Catholic &quot; whose genius has ennobled the arts and sciences, illustrated the ideals of the Church, and enriched the heritage of humanity. &quot; { Notre Dame website } Also in 1989, the National Endowment for the Humanities chose him as the winner for the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, for which he read &quot; The Fateful Rift: The San Andreas Fault in the Modern Mind. &quot; { The San Andreas Fault in the Modern Mind, National Endowment for the Humanities.
