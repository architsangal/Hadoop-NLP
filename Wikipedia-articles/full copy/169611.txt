It is one of the two autonomous provinces that make up the autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. The province has an area of [ 7400 km2 sqmi 0 ] and a total population of more than 500,000 inhabitants. Its capital is the city of Bolzano (German: Bozen; Ladin: Balsan or Bulsan). The majority of the population speak German. Around a quarter of the population speak Italian, and a small minority have Ladin as their mother language. South Tyrol is granted a considerable level of self-government, consisting of a large range of exclusive legislative powers and a fiscal regime that allows the province to retain 90% of all levied taxes. In the wider context of the European Union, the province is one of the three members of the Euroregion of Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, which corresponds almost exactly to the historical region of Tyrol. { Cortina d&apos;Ampezzo, Livinallongo del Col di Lana and Colle Santa Lucia, formerly parts of Tyrol, now belong to the region of Veneto } [ Name ] The &apos;&apos;Atlas Tyrolensis&apos;&apos;, a map created between 1760 and 1770 showing the entire County of Tyrol South Tyrol (occasionally South Tirol) is the term most commonly used in English for the province, [ July 2011 ] and its usage reflects that it was created from a portion of the southern part of the historic County of Tyrol.

[ History ] [ History of South Tyrol ] [ Italian annexation of 1919 ] South Tyrol is an administrative entity whose origins go back to World War I. In 1915, the Entente promised the area to Italy in London as an incentive to enter the war on their side. Until 1918 part of the Austro-Hungarian Princely County of Tyrol, this almost completely German-speaking territory was occupied by Italy at the end of the war in November 1918 and was annexed in 1919. The province as it exists today was created in 1926 after an administrative reorganization of the Kingdom of Italy and was incorporated together with the province of Trent into the newly created region Venezia Tridentina. { Bolzano Victory Monument was constructed on the orders of the fascist dictator } { Benito Mussolini to commemorate the annexation of South Tyrol to Italy } Under the fascist government, huge efforts were made to bring forward the Italianization of South Tyrol. The German language was banished from public service, German teaching was officially forbidden and German newspapers were censored with the exception of the fascist Alpenzeitung. The regime massively favoured immigration from other Italian regions. The subsequent alliance between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini declared that South Tyrol would not follow the destiny of Austria, which had been annexed to the Third Reich. Instead the dictators agreed that the German-speaking population be transferred to German-ruled territory or dispersed around Italy, but the outbreak of the Second World War prevented them from fully carrying out their relocation. In 1943, when the Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies, the region was occupied by Germany, which reorganised it as the Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills and put it under the administration of Gauleiter Franz Hofer. The region was de facto annexed to the German Reich (with the addition of the province of Belluno ) until the end of the war. This status ended along with the Nazi regime, and Italian rule was restored in 1945. [ Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement ] Austrians demonstrating in 1946 at a peace conference in favour of having the southern Tyrol region returned to Austria After the war the Allies decided that the province would remain a part of Italy, under the condition that the German-speaking population be granted an important level of self-government. Italy and Austria negotiated an agreement in 1946, recognizing the rights of the German minority. Alcide De Gasperi, Italy&apos;s prime minister, a native of Trentino, wanted to extend the autonomy to his fellow citizens. This led to the creation of the region called Trentino-Alto Adige/Tiroler Etschland. The Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement was signed by the Italian and Austrian Foreign Ministers, creating the autonomous region of Trentino-South Tyrol, consisting of the autonomous provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol. German and Italian were both made official languages, and German-language education was permitted once more. However, as the Italians were the majority in the combined region, the self-government of the German minority became impossible. This, together with the arrival of new Italian-speaking immigrants, led to strong dissatisfaction among South Tyroleans, which culminated in terrorist acts perpetrated by the Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol (BAS  — Committee for the Liberation of South Tyrol). In a first phase only public edifices and fascist monuments were targeted. The second phase was bloodier, costing 21 lives (15 members of Italian uniformed services, 2 civilians and 4 terrorists). [ Südtirolfrage ] The South Tyrolean question (Südtirolfrage) became an international issue. As the implementation of the post-war agreement was not seen as satisfactory by the Austrian government, it became a cause of significant friction with Italy and was taken up by the United Nations in 1960. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of the campaign of terrorism. The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new Austro-Italian treaty was signed and ratified. It stipulated that disputes in South Tyrol would be submitted for settlement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, that the province would receive greater autonomy within Italy, and that Austria would not interfere in South Tyrol&apos;s internal affairs. The new agreement proved broadly satisfactory to the parties involved and the separatist tensions soon eased. The new autonomous status, granted from 1972 onwards, has resulted in a considerable level of self-government, [ February 2012 ] also due to the large financial resources of South Tyrol, retaining almost 90% of all levied taxes.

The boundaries of the association correspond to the old County of Tyrol. The aim is to promote regional peace, understanding and cooperation in many areas. The region&apos;s assemblies meet together as one on various occasions and have set up a common liaison office to the European Union in Brussels. [ Geography ] Detailed map of South Tyrol. South Tyrol is located at the northernmost point in Italy. The province is bordered by Austria to the east and north, specifically by the Austrian federal-states Tyrol and Salzburg, and by the Swiss canton of Graubünden to the west. The Italian provinces of Trento, Belluno, and Sondrio border to the southeast, south, and southwest, respectively. The landscape itself is mostly cultivated with different types of shrubs and forests and is highly mountainous. Entirely located in the Alps, the province&apos;s landscape is dominated by mountains. The highest peak is the Ortler (3,905 m) in the far west, which is also the highest peak in the Eastern Alps outside the Bernina range. Even more famous are the craggy peaks of the Dolomites in the eastern part of the region. The following mountain groups are (partially) in South Tyrol. All but the Sarntal Alps are on the border with Austria, Switzerland, or other Italian provinces. The ranges are clockwise from the west and for each the highest peak is given that is within the province or on its border. { Tre Cime di Lavaredo in the } { Sexten Dolomites bordering the province of Belluno. } Name Highest peak (German/Italian) metres feet Ortler Alps Ortler/Ortles 3,905 12,811 Sesvenna Range Muntpitschen/Monpiccio 3,162 10,374 Ötztal Alps Weißkugel/Palla Bianca 3,746 12,291 Stubai Alps Wilder Freiger/Cima Libera 3,426 11,241 Sarntal Alps Hirzer/Punta Cervina 2,781 9,124 Zillertal Alps Hochfeiler/Gran Pilastro 3,510 11,515 Hohe Tauern Dreiherrnspitze/Picco dei Tre Signori 3,499 11,480 Eastern Dolomites Dreischusterspitze/Punta Tre Scarperi 3,152 10,341 Western Dolomites Langkofel/Sassolungo 3,181 10,436 Located in between the mountains are a large number of valleys, which is where the majority of the population lives. [ Administrative divisions ] [ Municipalities of South Tyrol ] The province is divided into eight districts (German: Bezirksgemeinschaften, Italian: comunità comprensoriali), one of them being the chief city of Bolzano. Each district is headed by a president and two bodies called the district committee and the district council. The districts are responsible for intermunicipal disputes, roads, schools and social services such as retirement homes. The province is further divided into 116 Gemeinden or comuni.

Climatically South Tyrol may be divided into five distinct groups: The Etsch valley area, with cold winters (24-h averages in January of about 0°C) and warm summers (24-h averages in July of about 23°C), usually classified as Humid subtropical climate  — Cfa. It is the driest and sunniest climate of the province. The main city in this area is Bolzano. The midlands between 300 and 900 metres, with cold winters (24-h averages in January between -3°C and 1°C) and mild summers (24-h averages in July between 15°C and 21°C); This is a typical Oceanic climate, classified as Cfb. It is usually wetter than the subtropical climate, and very snowy during the winters. During the spring and autumn, there is a large foggy season, but fog may occur even on summer mornings. Main towns in this area are Merano, Bruneck, Sterzing, Brixen. Near the lakes in higher lands (between 1000 and 1400 meters) the humidity may make the climate in these regions milder during winter, but also cooler in summer, then, a Subpolar oceanic climate, Cfc, may occur. The alpine valleys between 900 and 1400 metres, with a typically Humid continental climate  — Dfb, covering the largest part of the province. The winters are usually very cold (24-h averages in January between -8°C and -3°C), and the summers, mild with averages between 14 and 19°C. It is a very snowy climate; snow may occur from early October to April or even May. Main municipalities in this area are Urtijëi, Badia, Sexten, Toblach, Stilfs, Vöran, Mühlwald. The alpine valleys between 1400 and 1700 metres, with a Subarctic climate  — Dfc, with harsh winters (24-h averages in January between -9°C and -5°C) and cool, short, rainy and foggy summers (24-h averages in July of about 12°C). These areas usually have five months below the freezing point, and snow sometimes occurs even during the summer, in September. This climate is the wettest of the province, with large rainfalls during the summer, heavy snowfalls during spring and fall. The winter is usually a little drier, marked by freezing and dry weeks, although not sufficiently dry to be classified as a Dwc climate. Main municipalities in this area are Corvara, Sëlva, Santa Cristina Gherdëina. The highlands above 1700 meters, with an alpine tundra climate, ET, which becomes an Ice Cap Climate, EF above 3000 meters. The winters are cold, but sometimes not as cold as the higher valleys&apos; winters. In January, most of the areas at 2000 meters have an average temperature of about -5°C, while in the valleys at about 1600 meters, the mean temperature may be as low as -8 or -9°C. The higher lands, above 3000 meters are usually extremely cold, with averages of about -14°C during the coldest month, January. [ Politics ] [ Politics of South Tyrol ] The assembly building of South Tyrol. Luis Durnwalder has been governor of South Tyrol since 1989. The local government system is based upon the provisions of the Italian Constitution and the Autonomy Statute of the Region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.

The considerable legislative power of the province is vested in an assembly (German: Südtiroler Landtag; Italian: Consiglio della Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano; Ladin: Cunsëi dla Provinzia Autonoma de Bulsan).The legislative powers of the assembly cover all those subject matters that are not expressly reserved to the exclusive legislative power of the Italian State or to concurrent legislation per article 117 of the Italian Constitution. The executive powers are attributed to the government (German: Landesregierung; Italian: Giunta Provinciale) headed by the Landeshauptmann Luis Durnwalder, who has been in power since 1989. He belongs to the South Tyrolean People&apos;s Party, which has been governing with absolute majority since 1948.

Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU27, 2009 } The majority of people are employed in a variety of sectors, from agriculture  — the province is a large producer of apples, its wines are also renowned  — to industry to services, especially tourism. The unemployment level in 2007 was roughly 2.4 % (2.0 % for men and 3.0 % for women). [ Transport ] { Brenner Pass at Pflersch (2006) } License plate of South Tyrol ( Bz ) The region is, together with northern and eastern Tyrol, an important transit point between southern Germany and Northern Italy. Freights by road and rail pass through here. One of the most important highways is the A22, also called the Autostrada del Brennero. It connects to the Brenner Autobahn in Austria. The vehicle registration plate of South Tyrol is the two-letter provincial code Bz for the capital city. Along with the autonomous Trentino ( Tn ) and Aosta Valley ( Ao ), South Tyrol is allowed to surmount its license plates with its coat of arms. Rail transport goes over the Brenner Pass. The Brenner Railway is a major line connecting the Austrian and Italian railways from Innsbruck and Verona climbing the Wipptal, passing over the Brenner Pass and descending down the Eisack Valley to Bolzano and then down the Adige Valley from Bolzano to Rovereto and to Verona. The line is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). Other railways are the Pustertalbahn, Ritten Railway and Vinschgaubahn. Due to the steep slopes of the mountains, a number of funicular s exist, such as the Gardena Ronda Express funicular and Mendel Funicular. The Brenner Base Tunnel is under construction and slated to be completed by 2020. It will have a length of 55  km and will become the world&apos;s second longest railway tunnel after the Gotthard Base Tunnel. This tunnel will considerably reduce travel time by hours. Larger cities used to have their own tramway system, such as the Meran Tramway and Bolzano Tramway. These were replaced after the Second World War with buses. Many other cities and municipalities have their own bus system or are connected with each other by it. The Bolzano Airport is the only airport serving the region.

In some eastern municipalities Ladin is the third official language. A majority of the inhabitants of contemporary South Tyrol speak Austro-Bavarian dialects of the German language. Every citizen has the right to use their own mother tongue, even at court. Schools are separated for each language group. All traffic signs are bi- or trilingual. Only panels in railway stations run by the province are sometimes monolingual (German). Most Italian toponyms are translations performed by Ettore Tolomei, the author of the Prontuario dei nomi locali dell&apos;Alto Adige. [ Steininger Rolf 2003 South Tyrol: A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century Transaction Publishers New Brunswick, New Jersey 21–46 978-0-7658-0800-4 ] In order to reach a fair allocation of jobs in public service a system called ethnic proportion (Ita. proporzionale etnica, Ger. ethnischer Proporz) has been established. Every ten years, when the general census of population takes place, each citizen has to declare to which linguistic group they belong or want to be aggregated to. According to the results they decide how many people of which group are going to be hired for public service. At the time of the annexation of the southern part of Tyrol by Italy in 1919, the overwhelming majority of the population spoke German: In 1910, according to the last population census before World War I, the German-speaking population numbered 224,000, the Ladin 9,000 and the Italian 7,000. { Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): &quot; South Tyrol in Figures 2008 &quot;, Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11 } As a result of the italianization of South Tyrol nowadays about 25% of the population are Italian-speakers (they were roughly 35% in the 1960s). According to the census of 2001, 103 out of 116 comuni have a majority of German native speakers  — with Sankt Pankraz reaching 99.81%  — 8 Ladin and 5 Italian speakers. The Italian-speaking population is mainly based around the city of Bolzano, where they are the majority (73% of the inhabitants), and is a direct result of Benito Mussolini &apos;s policy of Italianisation after he took power in 1922, when he encouraged immigration from the rest of Italy. [ Steininger Rolf South Tyrol, A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century Transaction Publishers 2003 0-7658-0800-5 ] The other four comuni where the Italian-speaking population is the majority are Laives, Salorno, Bronzolo and Vadena.
