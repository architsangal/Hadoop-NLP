The PRC is described as a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States.

Following the attack, the US demanded that the Palestinian Authority find those responsible and bring them to justice. Palestinian officials said that because of lack of progress in the attack investigation, the US halted financial support for the PA and placed unofficial sanctions on its accounts. After heavy US pressure, the PA tried four &quot; suspects &quot; in a Palestinian military court, but intelligence agencies dismissed the tribunal as a &quot; mock trial &quot; and said while the suspects were PRC activists, they were not those responsible for the attack. The men were released in March 2004, less than one year after the attack. On July 17, 2004, Jenin Martyr&apos;s Brigade, a part of the PRC, kidnapped Palestinian Civil Police Force s Chief Ghazi al-Jabali at gunpoint in an ambush of his convoy which wounded two bodyguards.

In early June 2006, PRC leader Jamal Abu Samhadana was killed by IDF forces. As the man considered responsible for a number of attacks, including the bombing of a children&apos;s school bus near Kfar Darom in November 2000 and for the 2003 infiltration into an IDF outpost in Rafah that left several soldiers dead, he was considered one of the most wanted Palestinians on the IDF &apos;s hit-list. { Ynet } On Sunday, June 25, 2006, PRC, together with Hamas and Jish al-Islam ( &quot; the Army of Islam &quot; ) launched a major attack via tunnel near the Kerem Shalom outpost. Eight Palestinian fighters used a nearly one km tunnel that they had dug over the past several months to cross the border between Gaza and Israel. The unexpected attack ended with one soldier- Corporal Gilad Shalit - captured, two dead and four wounded. Two of the Palestinian attackers were killed while the other six made it back to the Gaza Strip with Shalit. Shalit was released five years later in a prisoner exchange. { Ha&apos;aretz } The same day of the tunnel attack, Eliyahu Asheri, an 18 year old Israeli student, went missing near the West Bank. The PRC shortly claimed responsibility for kidnapping and murdering him. Spokesman for the group, Abu Abir, also announced that the PRC had formed special units in the West Bank whose sole purpose is to kidnap soldiers and settlers, in accordance with the continued Operation &quot; Cavaliers&apos; Wrath. &quot; { Jpost } { Ynet } On August 8, 2007, the PRC announced that it would form a political party to run in future Palestinian elections.

Israel alleges the organization enjoys financing and technical support from Hezbollah since its founding, and is a sort of proxy of Hezbollah&apos;s influence in the Gaza Strip. The organization outwardly projects this relation through its mimicry of the Hezbollah flag which also bears a fist clenching a Kalashnikov rifle and stylized writing.
