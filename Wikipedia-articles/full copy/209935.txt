[ History ] [ Birmingham Medical School and Mason Science College ] A view across Chancellor&apos;s Court, towards the Law building Although the earliest beginnings of the University were previously traced back to the Birmingham Medical School which is linked to William Sands Cox in his aim of creating a medical school along strictly Christian lines, unlike the London medical schools. Further research has now revealed the roots of the Birmingham Medical School in the medical education seminars of Mr John Tomlinson the first surgeon to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary, and later to the General Hospital. These classes were the first ever held outside London or south of the Scottish border in the winter of 1767-68. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical and surgical apprentices at the General Hospital, opened in 1779. { http://www.medicine.bham.ac.uk/histmed/history.shtml#TheBeginning } The medical school which grew out of the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary was founded in 1828 but Cox began teaching in December 1825. Queen Victoria granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham and allowed it to be styled &quot; The Queen&apos;s Hospital &quot;. It was the first provincial teaching hospital in England. In 1843, the medical college became known as Queen&apos;s College. On 23 February 1875, Sir Josiah Mason, the Birmingham industrialist and philanthropist, who made his fortune in making key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating, founded Mason Science College. It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham. In 1882, the Departments of Chemistry, Botany and Physiology were transferred to Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of Physics and Comparative Anatomy. The transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a university college was made. As the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 it became incorporated as Mason University College on 1 January 1898, with the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors. [ Royal Charter ] Ceiling of the Aston Webb building It was largely due to Chamberlain&apos;s tireless enthusiasm that the university was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900. The Calthorpe family offered twenty-five acres (10 hectares) of land on the Bournbrook side of their estate in July. The Court of Governors received the Birmingham University Act 1900, which put the Royal Charter into effect, on 31 May. Birmingham was therefore arguably the first so-called red brick university, although several other universities claim this title. The transfer of Mason University College to the new University of Birmingham, with Chamberlain as its first Chancellor and Sir Oliver Lodge as the first Principal, was complete. All that remained of Josiah Mason&apos;s legacy was his Mermaid in the sinister chief of the university shield and of his college, the double-headed lion in the dexter. It became the first civic and campus university in England. The University Charter of 1900 also included provision for a Faculty of Commerce, as was appropriate for a university itself founded by industrialists and based in a city with enormous business wealth, in effect creating the first Business School in England. Consequently, the faculty, the first of its kind in Britain, was founded by Sir William Ashley in 1901, who from 1902 until 1923 served as first Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty. From 1905 to 1908, Edward Elgar held the position of Peyton Professor of Music at the university. He was succeeded by his friend Granville Bantock. { Keith Anderton, slevenotes, Bantock: Hebridean Symphony, Naxos 8.555473, 1989 } The heritage archives of the Univeirsty of Birmingham are accessible for research through the University&apos;s Special Collections. [ Expansion ] { Barber Institute of Fine Arts } In 1939, the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, designed by Robert Atkinson, was opened. In 1956, the first MSc programme in Geotechnical Engineering commenced under the title of &quot; Foundation Engineering &quot;, and has been run annually at the University of Birmingham since. It was the first geotechnical post-graduate school in England. The UK&apos;s longest-running MSc programme in Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors also started at the University of Birmingham in 1956, the same year that the world&apos;s first commercial nuclear power station was opened at Calder Hall in Cumbria. In 1957, Sir Hugh Casson and Neville Conder were asked by the university to prepare a masterplan on the site of the original 1900 buildings which were incomplete. The university drafted in other architects to amend the masterplan produced by the group. During the 1960s, the university constructed numerous large buildings, expanding the campus. In 1963, the University of Birmingham helped in the establishment of the faculty of medicine at the University of Rhodesia, now the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). UZ is now independent; however, student exchange programs persist. Birmingham also supported the creation of Keele (formerly University College of North Staffordshire) and Warwick Universities under the Vice-Chancellorship of Sir Robert Aitken who acted as &apos;Godfather to the University of Warwick&apos;. { Ives, 2000, p.342. } The initial plan was for a university college in Coventry attached to Birmingham but Aitken advised an independent initiative to the University Grants Committee. { Ives, 2000, p.343. } [ Achievements ] The university has been involved in many important inventions and developments in science. The cavity magnetron was developed at the university in the Physics Department by John Randall, Harry Boot and James Sayers. This was vital to the Allied victory in World War II. In 1940, the Frisch-Peierls memorandum, a document which demonstrated that the atomic bomb was more than simply theoretically possible, was written in the Physics Department. The university also hosted early work on Gaseous diffusion in the Chemistry department when it was located in the Hills building. Many windows in the Aston Webb building overlooking the former fume cupboards were opaque from being attacked by hydrofluoric acid well into recent years. In 1943, Mark Oliphant made an early proposal for the construction of a proton- synchrotron, however he made no assurance that the machine would work. When phase stability was discovered in 1945, the proposal was resurrected and construction of a machine at the university that could surpass 1 GeV. The university was aiming to construct the first machine to do this, however, funds were short and the machine did not start until 1953. They were beaten by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, who managed to start their Cosmotron in 1952, and get it fully working in 1953, before the University of Birmingham. [ Laurie M.

The first, Ridge Hall, opened for 139 women in January 1964, with its counterpart High Hall (now Chamberlain Hall) admitting its first male residents the following October. { Ives, 2000, p.338 } [ 1960s and modern expansion ] The university&apos;s Learning Centre (left), School of Computer Science (right) and Faraday sculpture The university underwent a major expansion in the 1960s due to the production of a masterplan by Casson, Conder and Partners. The first of the major buildings to be constructed to a design by the firm was the Refectory and Staff House which was built in 1961 and 1962. The two buildings are connected by a bridge. The next major buildings to be constructed were the Wyddrington and Lake Halls and the Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, all completed in 1965. The Wyddrington and Lake Halls, on Edgbaston Park Road, were designed by H. T. Cadbury-Brown and contain three floors of student dwellings above a single floor of communal facilities. The Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, now known as the Ashley Building, was designed by Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and is a long, curving two-storey block linked to a five-storey whorl.

After taking up his post as vice-chancellor in April 2009, David Eastwood said: When I was appointed, people described this university as a sleeping giant, and there is this feeling that although this is a great university, we could do even better. This is a university which can do yet more and I am here to play my part. That is the challenge, but it&apos;s not an easy challenge as we are competing in a global environment. We have some terrific, genuinely global leading research at this university, but we need to build on our research strengths and increase further the quality of our research and the impact of our research. Cancer research is as good here as anywhere, we have one of the best three psychology courses in the country, the best music departments and best sports science degrees in the country, and very good engineering. One of the great attractions of this university is that we have the breadth that other universities dream of, but it&apos;s fundamentally about building on our strengths.

Originally the Guild of Undergraduates, the Institution had its first foundations in the Mason Science College in the centre of Birmingham around 1876. The University of Birmingham itself formally received its Royal Charter in 1900 with the Guild of Students being provided for as a Student Representative Council. [ Cheesewright 1975 35 ] It is not known for certain why the name &apos;Guild of Students&apos; was chosen as opposed to &apos;Union of Students&apos;, however, the Guild shares its name with Liverpool Guild of Students, another &apos;redbrick university&apos;; both organisations subsequently founded the National Union of Students. The Union Building, the Guild&apos;s bricks and mortar presence, was designed by the architect Holland W. Hobbiss. The Guild&apos;s official purposes are to represent its members and provide a means of socialising, though societies and general amenities. The university provides the Guild with the Union Building effectively rent free as well as a block grant to support student services. The Guild also runs several bars, eateries, social spaces and social events. The Guild supports a variety of student societies and volunteering projects, roughly around 180 at any one time. The Guild complements these societies and volunteering projects with professional staffed services, including its walk-in Advice and Representation Centre (ARC), Student Development, Job Zone, Student Mentors in halls, and Community Wardens around Bournbrook. { BUGS: Community Wardens } [ April 2010 ] The Guild of Students was where the international volunteering charity InterVol was conceived and developed, initially as a student society. { University of Birmingham Buzz Magazine.

Elections are held yearly, conventionally February, for the following academic year. These officers have regular contact with the university&apos;s officer-holders and managers. In theory, the Guild&apos;s officers are directed and kept to account over their year in office by Guild Council, a 500 seat pseudo-legislature. The Guild also supports the university &quot; student reps &quot; scheme, which aims to provide an effective channel of feedback from students on more of a departmental level. [ Sport ] One of the many university athletics fields The university has many successful sports teams and has been consistently ranked in the top four of the British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport (BUCS) league table. { The BUSA Championship Results 2005/2006, BUSA, 6 July 2006 } The university&apos;s reputation for sport is a long-standing one; in 1954 it became the first UK university to offer a sports degree, and until 1968 exercise was compulsory for all students. In 2004 six graduates and one current student competed in the Athens Olympic games. Four alumni competed at the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, including cyclist Paul Manning who won an Olympic Gold.

Alongside fitness classes such as yoga and aerobics, UBS offers over 40 different sport teams, including rowing, cricket, football, rugby union (UBRFC), field hockey, American football (Birmingham Lions), triathlon and many more. The wide selection has ensured the university has remained one of the country&apos;s most active and colourful campuses with over 2000 students participating in sport. UBS offers over 40 scholarships and bursaries to national and international students of exceptional athletic ability. The university sports centre was originally designed to have the swimming pool on stilts. The design had to be revised once it was realised that the structure would be unable to support the weight of water. The model of the university in the Great Hall shows the original design. [ Housing ] The university provides housing for most first-year students, running a guarantee scheme for all those UK applicants who choose Birmingham as their firm UCAS choice. 90 per cent of university-provided housing is inhabited by first-year students.

Shackleton is now the only hall providing catering, although other students are welcome to join its meal plan. In the summer of 2006, the university sold three of its most distant halls (Hunter Court, the Beeches and Queens Hospital Close) to private operators, while later in the year and during term, the university was forced urgently to decommission both Chamberlain Tower and Manor House over fire safety inspection failures. [ December 2007 ] The university has rebranded its halls offerings into three villages. [ Vale Village ] The Vale Village includes Chamberlain Hall, Shackleton, Maple Bank, Tennis Court, Elgar Court, Aitken and Chelwood residences.

However, alongside the former university halls of Hunter Court, the Beeches and Queens Hospital Close, a number of other private halls aimed at the University of Birmingham market opened for business in 2007, such as Opal 1 on Bristol Road and IQFive on Bath Row near Five Ways. A large number of students cohabit in rented houses, mainly in the Bournbrook and Selly Oak areas. However an increasingly large number of students are thought to be local, continuing to live in the family home. [ December 2007 ] [ In popular culture ] David Lodge &apos;s novel Changing Places tells the story of exchange of professors between the universities of Rummidge and Euphoric State, Plotinus, thinly disguised fictional versions of Birmingham and UC Berkeley, which in the book both have replicas of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on campus. [ Showalter Elaine Faculty Towers: The Academic Novel and Its Discontents Oxford University Press 2005 Oxford 77 http://books.google.com/?id%3Djnpf3RJXnF8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA77%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA77%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22changing%2Bplaces%22%2Bnovel%2Bpisa 978-0-19-928332-3 ] The university campus has been used as a filming location for a number of film and television productions, particularly those of the BBC which has a presence at the university&apos;s Selly Oak campus, the BBC Drama Village. Scenes from the John Cleese film Clockwise were filmed at the campus&apos; east entrance, while several episodes of the BBC detective series Dalziel and Pascoe, [ http://www.buzz.bham.ac.uk/3468Buzz34.pdf Buzz Issue 34 vol.3 November 2003 University of Birmingham 2007-02-24 ] daytime soap Doctors [ http://www.buzz.bham.ac.uk/3513Buzz35.pdf Buzz Issue 35 vol.3 November 2003 Mid-month edition University of Birmingham 2007-02-24 ] and CBBC series Brum have been filmed in and around campus. Interior and exterior scenes for a BBC adaptation of Birmingham alumnus David Lodge &apos;s novel Nice Work and BBC comedy drama A Very Peculiar Practice were also shot in and around the University campus and halls of residence with a number of students appearing as extras. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/peculiar.shtml A Very Peculiar Practice BBC 2007-02-15 ] A trailer for the BBC&apos;s Red Nose Day 2007, featuring Lou and Andy from Little Britain, was filmed near the School of Biosciences. { [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMFIp1Ao9Y } More recently, an episode of the BBC show Hustle was filmed on campus with interior and exterior shots of the Aston Webb building, in addition to internal shots of the School of Biosciences. Post punk band Joy Division played their final gig at the University High Hall on 2 May 1980 (now known as Chamberlain Hall), 16 days before the suicide of singer/songwriter, Ian Curtis. [ Paul Morley and Adrian Thrills Don&apos;t walk away in silence NME 1980-06-14 ] A recording of the performance accompanies the Still compilation album. It includes one of only two available recordings of the song &quot; Ceremony &quot; (the other being a demo rehearsal), which later became a single for New Order. Fairport Convention recorded much of the live album &quot; Farewell, Farewell &quot; at Lake Hall during the May Ball on 11 May 1979, using the Island Records mobile studio. [ Branding ] The University&apos;s logo from the 1980s until 2005 The original coat of arms was designed in 1900. It features a double headed lion (on the left) and a mermaid holding a mirror and comb (to the right). These symbols owe to the coat of arms of the institution&apos;s predecessor, Mason College. In 2005 the university began rebranding itself. A simplified edition of the shield which had been introduced in the 1980s reverted to a detailed version based on how it appears on the university&apos;s original Royal Charter. After a research project into the image of the university, it was decided that a separate logo was required to redefine the institution as modern and contemporary. A new &apos;word marque&apos;, using the &quot; U and B &quot; letters and the Baskerville font (in honour of the Birmingham printer John Baskerville ) is used as the primary logo when trying to attract both prospective investors and students. It is also found on campus vehicles. The traditional coat of arms, by contrast, appears on degree certificates and academic documents. The introduction of new signage throughout the campus, featuring the shield rather than the &quot; U and B &quot; logo, was completed at the end of 2006.
