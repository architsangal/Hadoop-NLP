[ Commuter Rail in Canada ] [ June 2011 ] [ ussg ] { ( } { standard gauge ) } { 1 } { 5 } { 2 to 5, 7 days a week. } { 8 } { 10,500 West Coast Express: Facts and Figures 2008 Retrieved 8 December 2009 } { TransLink } { Canadian Pacific Railway } { Via Rail } { WCEX } West Coast Express [ WCEX ] is the only interregional commuter railway in British Columbia, Canada. Opened in 1995, it links Mission, Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, and Port Moody with Waterfront Station in Downtown Vancouver, where it interchanges with SkyTrain rapid transit, SeaBus and other public transportation services. [ Operation ] The West Coast Express operates from Monday to Friday excluding holidays, with five trains per day running from Mission to Vancouver in the morning peak hours and returning to Mission in the evening peak. A one-way trip the length of the line takes 73 minutes, which is faster and more reliable than driving to Downtown Vancouver. In addition, there are two buses (called the &quot; TrainBus &quot; ) which operate from Mission to Vancouver in the morning (after all the trains depart) and five returning to Mission in the evening (two prior, and three after all trains leave Vancouver eastbound), stopping at all West Coast Express stations. There are also three Trainbus departures in each direction on Saturdays and two on Sundays. { West Coast Express: TrainBus Schedule Retrieved 9 October 2009 } The commuter railway is operated by TransLink, the transportation authority of the Metro Vancouver region, and a member of Canadian Urban Transit Association. The South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service, as well as Transit Security Officers conduct random fare inspections on board trains. Persons caught without valid fare can be removed from the train, and/or fined $173. Contracted Commissionaires can be found providing a security presence and even checking fares on occasion at some stations, but do not conduct enforcement. Enforcement of fares and other conduct regulations are conducted by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service. [ Equipment ] Each train consists of a General Motors / EMD F59PHI diesel-electric locomotive and between five and ten Bombardier BiLevel passenger carriages. West Coast Express also operates a MPI MP36PH-3C for backup. The total fleet of passenger coaches is 44. { Translink: New West Coast Express Cars Roll Into Town Retrieved 10 December 2010 } Each passenger carriage has a seating capacity of 144 people. Like many commuter railways, West Coast Express uses push-pull operation; instead of moving the locomotive to the other end of the train, it is simply controlled remotely from a second cab in the last passenger carriage, allowing the train to run &apos;backwards&apos;; this occurs during mornings, as during afternoons the locomotive is at the front of train. Passenger amenities include washrooms, a cappuccino bar, power outlets, wheelchair accessibility, and space for bicycle s. The carriages and locomotives are maintained by Via Rail, and the train tracks belong to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) who is also the operator of the service. Track time is negotiated with the CPR, which balances the use by the West Coast Express with its mainstay freight operation.
