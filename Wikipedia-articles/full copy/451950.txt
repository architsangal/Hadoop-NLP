{ Francis Galton, one of the pioneers of historiometry. } Historiometry is the historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, using statistics to analyze reference s to geniuses, their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts. Historiometry combines techniques from cliometrics, which studies the history of economics and from psychometrics, the psychological study of an individual&apos;s personality and abilities. [ Origins ] Historiometry started in the early 19th century with studies on the relationship between age and achievement by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the careers of prominent French and English playwrights [ Emily Eakin A Cultural Scorecard Says West Is Ahead http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res%3DF20C15FF39550C768EDDA90994DB404482 New York Times 9 2003-10-25 2006-09-13 ] [ David Neiwert Evading reality http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2003/10/evading-reality.html blog 2003-10-26 2006-09-13 ] but it was Sir Francis Galton, a pioneering English eugenist who popularized historiometry in his 1869 work, Hereditary Genius. [ Galton Francis Hereditary Genius http://galton.org/books/hereditary-genius/ 2006-09-13 MacMillan &amp; Co London 1869 0-312-36989-1 ] It was further developed by Frederick Adams Woods (who coined the term historiometry [ Simonton Dean Keith 2003 Qualitative and quantitative analyses of historical data Annua. Rev. Psychol. 54 12171999 617–640 http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145034?journalCode%3Dpsych 2006-09-13 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145034 ] [ Woods Frederick Adams 1909 A new name for a new science Science 30 697–736 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol30/issue777/ 2006-09-13 10.1126/science.30.777.703 17792096 777 ] ) in the beginning of the 20th century.

Meehl published several papers on historiometry later in his career, mainly in the area of medical history, although it is usually referred to as cliometric metatheory by him.

Historiometry is defined by Dean Keith Simonton as: a quantitative method of statistical analysis for retrospective data. In Simonton&apos;s work the raw data comes from psychometric assessment of famous personalities, often already deceased, in an attempt to assess creativity, genius and talent development. [ Simonton Dean Keith Genius Creativity and Leadership: Historiometric Inquiries 1999 iUniverse.com 1-58348-438-8 1999 ] Charles Murray&apos;s Human Accomplishment is one example of this approach to quantify the impact of individuals on technology, science and the arts. It tracks the most important achievements across time, and for the different peoples of the world, and provides a thorough discussion of the methodology used, together with an assessment of its reliability and accuracy. [ Murray Charles Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences 800 B.C to 1950 2003 HarperCollins 0-06-019247-X 2003 ] [ July 2011 ] [ Examples of research ] Since historiometry deals with subjective personal traits as creativity, charisma or openness most studies deal with the comparison of scientists, artists or politicians. The study ( Human Accomplishment ) by Charles Murray classifies, for example, Einstein and Newton as the most important physicist s and Michelangelo as the top ranking western artist. As another example, several studies have compared charisma and even the IQ of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States of America. [ Deluga, R.J. 1997 Relationship among American presidential charismatic leadership, narcissism, and rated performance Leadership Quarterly 8 49–65 10.1016/S1048-9843(97)90030-8 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/10489843/1997/00000008/00000001/art90030%3Bjsessionid%3Dbffe3p0grojse.alice 2006-09-13 ] [ Dean Keith Simonton 2006 August Presidential IQ, Openness, Intellectual Brilliance, and Leadership: Estimates and Correlations for 42 U.S. Chief Executives Political Psychology 27 511–526 10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00524.x http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00524.x 2006-09-11 4 ] The latter study classifies John Quincy Adams as the cleverest US president, with an estimated IQ between 165 to 175. [ Critique ] Since historiometry is based on indirect information like historic documents and relies heavily on statistics, the results of these studies are questioned by some researchers, mainly because of concerns about over-interpretation of the estimated results.

Historiometric inquiries Med Hist. 30 109–110 1 1139602 ] The previously mentioned study of the intellectual capacity of US presidents, a study by Dean Keith Simonton, attracted a lot of media attention and critique mainly because it classified the former US president, George W. Bush, as second to last of all US presidents since 1900.

Bush was estimated as between 111.1 and 138.5, with an average of 125, exceeding only that of president Warren Harding, who is regarded as a failed president, with an average IQ of 124. Although controversial and imprecise (due to gaps in available data), the approach used by Simonton to generate his results was regarded &quot; reasonable &quot; by fellow researchers.

Bush had the lowest IQ of all US presidents.
