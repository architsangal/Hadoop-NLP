[ Voting Record ] In 1979 Murphy was a fierce opponent of Devolution. Murphy recently said &quot; I have been trying to work out whether or not I am a devo-sceptic and I have come to the conclusion that I am not. In 1978, I was a devo-opponent, and in 1997 I voted for devolution. My constituents agreed with me in 1978, but they did not agree with me in 1997, because they voted against a Welsh Assembly on both occasions. However, I would rather describe myself as a devo-realist, in the sense that what is here is here. I am not all that keen on a coalition in Cardiff, but we are where we are, and we have to work in the current political climate for the benefit of the people whom we represent, whether we are Members of Parliament, Assembly Members or members of local authorities &quot;. In a free parliamentary vote on 20 May 2008, Paul Murphy voted for cutting the upper limit for abortions from 24 to 12 weeks, along with two other Catholic cabinet ministers Ruth Kelly and Des Browne. { &apos;&apos;BBC News: MPs back 24-week abortion limit&apos;&apos; } [ Parliamentary Expenses ] Murphy was subject to criticism over his expenses claims, revealed by the Daily Telegraph during the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal. Most notable of these was his £3,419.25 claim to have a new boiler installed in his Westminster house, stating that the previous one was a hazard as &quot; The hot water was far too hot &quot;. { Paul Murphy&apos;s plumbing bill because water was too hot: MPs&apos; expenses Daily Telegraph, 8th May 2009 } Other claims submitted by Paul Murphy relate to purchases of a Toilet Roll holder, new carpeting and a television, as well as mortgage payments and stamp duty. Although, his expenses were not accurately reflected by newspapers, his total expense claim per year, was much lower than the majority of MPs. This was further proved by the fact he had to pay no money back after further analysis of his claims. He was, and still is, highly regarded as an MP across the parties and was approached to stand for speaker, although he refused to carry this forward. { MPs&apos; Expenses: What PM And Cabinet Claimed Sky News, 8th May 2009 } Murphy has now been ordered to repay some of the money he &quot; claimed &quot; back. He has to pay back £2,237.72 in cleaning costs, mortgage payments and a wardrobe that exceeded the guideline price.
