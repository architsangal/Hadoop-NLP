Meatwad does not have a nose or ears, but he does have retractable arm s that only appear when needed. Meatwad also has retractable legs as well, but he almost always rolls around and rarely ever uses them. Just like Master Shake and Frylock, Meatwad occasionally wears clothing but does not typically wear them on a normal basis. Unlike Frylock and Master Shake, Meatwad&apos;s appearance does not differ significantly from his original appearance in &quot; Baffler Meal &quot;, where his shape is more rough-cut, he does not have yellow-ish spots or hair, and he has a full set of teeth instead of one prominent tooth. In &quot; Baffler Meal, &quot; Meatwad is pinkish-red, whereas he is brown today, and he appeared depressed, even saying, &quot; Please, God, kill me. &quot; Unlike Frylock and Master Shake, Meatwad was not portrayed by a live action actor in &quot; Last Last One Forever and Ever &quot;. A red-ish brown exercise ball was put in Meatwad&apos;s place, with Dave Willis&apos;s voice (as Meatwad) heard off-screen. He also likes to listen to music on his boom-box, known as his &quot; jam-box &quot;. [ Description ] From 2000 until 2010, Meatwad, along with Master Shake and Frylock have lived in a suburban neighborhood in New Jersey, next door to Carl Brutananadilewski. They have since moved to an identical neighborhood in Seattle, Washington.

Meatwad spends most of his time playing with his home-made dolls or watching television. Meatwad can also play guitar at a master&apos;s level. Meatwad is often bullied by Master Shake, but is often protected by Frylock. Meatwad is often intimidatable, when convinced to do something bad, usually by Master Shake, Ignignokt, Err, or MC Pee Pants, he often attempts to do so, but is usually stopped by Frylock before doing so. Meatwad&apos;s favorite television program is apparently &quot; The Jeffersons &quot;, as evidenced by his enthusiasm for the show in &quot; Frat Aliens &quot; and &quot; Dirtfoot &quot;. Like Master Shake and Frylock, Meatwad was a detective for the first three episodes, but inexplicably quit by &quot; Mayhem of the Mooninites &quot;. Meatwad is unemployed. In &quot; Robositter &quot;, Shake asked why Meatwad does not have to work, to which Meatwad responded, &quot; That&apos;d be a violation of child labor laws &quot;. Frylock then added that there are also sanitation issues. Meatwad is arguably the youngest of the Aqua Teens, though his true age is thrown into question at times. [ vertical 160 Meatwad as igloo.png Meatwad as hot dog.png Meatwad as an igloo (top) and as a hot dog (bottom) ] Meatwad has the power to pull items out of his body. In &quot; Robositter &quot;, Meatwad is frozen, shatters on the floor, and instantly reassembles. In &quot; Multiple Meat &quot; it is revealed that Meatwad can multiply, by being cut in half. Just like Frylock&apos;s &quot; Frydar &quot; and Master Shake&apos;s &quot; Shake Power &quot;, Meatwad has the power to be able to turn his meat body into a variety of shapes. Most times Meatwad assumes the shape of an igloo, or a hot dog, and sometimes a samurai Abraham Lincoln, which he identifies as Wayne Gretzky and Dick Nixon in &quot; Dickesode &quot;. Meatwad can take the shape of many other things such as a hammer, &quot; The Meat monster &quot;, a large office building, a net, a bridge, a hand giving people the finger, a working gun, a flower. In &quot; Rabbot Redux &quot;, while playing rock-paper-scissors with Shake, Meatwad turned into a large piece of notebook paper and a tornado, the latter actually causing a storm in Meatwad&apos;s room. Presumably he can also take the shape of scissors, as he was playing &quot; rock paper scissors &quot; when he became the Paper, Meatwad takes the shape of a dog in &quot; One Hundred &quot;, which is a parody of Scooby-Doo, from the television series, Scooby-Doo. Also Meatwad appears as a giant number 5, on the volume five DVD cover, and a Christmas tree on the cover of Have Yourself a Meaty Little Christmas. Like Master Shake and Frylock, Meatwad does not have an official gender but he is strongly depicted as a male. Meatwad is not or has ever been married. Meatwad does not appear to have a family, but in The Movie it is claimed that he, along with Master Shake and Frylock, are creations of Dr. Weird. The movie also claims their father is a watermelon, and their mother is a nine-layer bean burrito. In 2010 during the &quot; Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live &quot; tour, series creator Dave Willis confirmed that Dr. Weird is indeed the creator of Master Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and Chicken Bittle, making them all brothers. { Aqua Teen Hunger Force Q &amp; A at Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live in 2010 } In the season seven episode &quot; Rabbot Redux &quot; Meatwad states that he is 38 years old, [ 2010 2 7 ] { 7 } { 2 } although in the episode &quot; Robositter &quot;, Frylock says that Meatwad cannot work a job due to child-labor laws, in &quot; Super Trivia &quot; Frylock tells him he is not old enough to drink alcohol, and in &quot; Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary &quot; he claims that he is 55 years old. Meatwad is not typically depicted as being religious, but in the episode &quot; A PE Christmas &quot; Meatwad is seen in church, but was dragged there against his will. Whether or not Meatwad belongs to a religion has not officially determined, although he converts to Judaism in &quot; Der Inflatable Fuhrer &quot; and &quot; The Cloning. &quot; [ Mental health ] Although Meatwad is 38, he still appears to have child-like intelligence. In &quot; Super Bowl &quot; Meatwad states he is &quot; messed up in the head &quot;. In the season four episode, &quot; Ezekial &quot;, it is confirmed that Meatwad suffers from mental retardation, when Meatwad states &quot; Nobody can beat chess dragon, not even me, and I&apos;m retarded &quot;.

Meatwad was also featured in the popular internet series The Angry Video Game Nerd.When The Nerd did a bonus review of &quot; Boo!
