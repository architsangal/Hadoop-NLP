Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating viral infection s. [ http://gsbs.utmb.edu/microbook/ch052.htm Medmicro Chapter 52 2009-02-21 http://web.archive.org/web/20000818075852/http%3A//gsbs.utmb.edu/microbook/ch052.htm 18 August 2000 ] Like antibiotic s for bacteria, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses. Unlike most antibiotics, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen; instead they inhibit their development. Antiviral drugs are one class of antimicrobial s, a larger group which also includes antibiotic, antifungal and antiparasitic drugs. They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to treat infection s. They should be distinguished from viricide s, which are not medication but deactivate or destroy virus particles, either inside or outside the body. Many common plants such as St John&apos;s wort are also widely believed in naturopathic circles to be viricides, but evidence to support this is far from sufficient in scientific circles. [ 12741619 2003 Martin KW Ernst E Antiviral agents from plants and herbs: A systematic review 8 2 77–90 Antiviral therapy ] Antivirals also can be found in essential oils of some herbs, such as eucalyptus oil and its constituents. [ 11338678 2001 Schnitzler P Schön K Reichling J Antiviral activity of Australian tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil against herpes simplex virus in cell culture 56 4 343–7 Die Pharmazie ] Most of the antiviral drugs now available are designed to help deal with HIV, herpes viruses (best known for causing cold sore s and genital herpes, but actually the cause of a wide range of other diseases, such as chicken pox ), the hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer, and influenza A and B viruses. Researchers are working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens. Designing safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult, because viruses use the host&apos;s cells to replicate. This makes it difficult to find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism&apos;s cells. Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and anti-viral drugs is due to viral variation. The emergence of antivirals is the product of a greatly expanded knowledge of the genetic and molecular function of organisms, allowing biomedical researchers to understand the structure and function of viruses, major advances in the techniques for finding new drugs, and the intense pressure placed on the medical profession to deal with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of the deadly acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) pandemic. [ History ] Through the mid- to late-20th century, medical science and practice included an array of effective tools, ranging from antiseptic s to vaccine s and antibiotic s, but no drugs to treat viral infections. While vaccines proved effective in preventing many viral diseases, they could not help once a viral infection set in. Prior to the development of antivirals, when someone contracted a virus, there was little that could be done other than treating the symptoms and waiting for the disease to run its course. The first experimental antivirals were developed in the 1960s, mostly to deal with herpes viruses, and were found using traditional trial-and-error drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity, and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals that seemed to have an effect were selected for closer study. This was a very time-consuming, hit-or-miss procedure, and in the absence of a good knowledge of how the target virus worked, it was not efficient in discovering effective antivirals which had few side effect s. Only in the 1980s, when the full genetic sequence s of viruses began to be unraveled, researchers began to learn how viruses worked in detail, and exactly what chemicals were needed to thwart their reproductive cycle. [ 2011 ] dozens of antiviral treatments are available, and medical research is rapidly exploiting new knowledge [ June 2011 ] and technology to develop more. [ Research ] On 10-August-2011 researchers at MIT announced the publication [ 10.1371/journal.pone.0022572 Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Therapeutics 2011 Sambhara Suryaprakash Rider Todd H. Zook Christina E. Boettcher Tara L. Wick Scott T. Pancoast Jennifer S. Zusman Benjamin D. PLoS ONE 6 7 e22572 21818340 3144912 ] of a new method of inhibiting NA, the process selectively affected infected cells. The team named the process &quot; Double-stranded RNA Activated Capase Oligomerizer &quot; ( DRACO ). According to the lead researcher &quot; In theory, [DRACO] should work against all viruses. &quot; [ http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/antiviral-0810.html New drug could cure nearly any viral infection 2011-08-11 ] [ Virus life cycle ] Virus es consist of a genome and sometimes a few enzyme s stored in a capsule made of protein (called a capsid ), and sometimes covered with a lipid layer (sometimes called an &apos;envelope&apos;). Viruses cannot reproduce on their own, and instead propagate by subjugating a host cell to produce copies of themselves, thus producing the next generation. Researchers working on such &quot; rational drug design &quot; strategies for developing antivirals have tried to attack viruses at every stage of their life cycles. Some species of mushrooms have been found to contain multiple antiviral chemicals with similar synergistic effects. [ 10.1093/ecam/neh107 The Pharmacological Potential of Mushrooms 2005 Lindequist Ulrike Niedermeyer Timo H. J. Jülich Wolf-Dieter Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2 3 285–99 16136207 1193547 ] Viral life cycles vary in their precise details depending on the species of virus, but they all share a general pattern: Attachment to a host cell. Release of viral genes and possibly enzymes into the host cell. Replication of viral components using host-cell machinery. Assembly of viral components into complete viral particles. Release of viral particles to infect new host cells. [ Limitations of vaccines ] Vaccine s bolster the body&apos;s immune system to better attack viruses in the &quot; complete particle &quot; stage, outside of the organism&apos;s cells. They traditionally consist of an attenuated (weakened or killed) version of the virus. These vaccines can, in rare cases, harm the host by inadvertently infecting the host with a full-blown viral occupancy. Recently &quot; subunit &quot; vaccines have been devised that consist strictly of protein targets from the pathogen. They stimulate the immune system without doing serious harm to the host. In either case, when the real pathogen attacks the subject, the immune system responds to it quickly and blocks it. Vaccines are very effective on stable viruses, but are of limited use in treating a patient who has already been infected. They are also difficult to successfully deploy against rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza (the vaccine for which is updated every year) and HIV. Antiviral drugs are particularly useful in these cases. [ Anti-viral targeting ] The general idea behind modern antiviral drug design is to identify viral proteins, or parts of proteins, that can be disabled. These &quot; targets &quot; should generally be as unlike any proteins or parts of proteins in humans as possible, to reduce the likelihood of side effects. The targets should also be common across many strains of a virus, or even among different species of virus in the same family, so a single drug will have broad effectiveness. For example, a researcher might target a critical enzyme synthesized by the virus, but not the patient, that is common across strains, and see what can be done to interfere with its operation. Once targets are identified, candidate drugs can be selected, either from drugs already known to have appropriate effects, or by actually designing the candidate at the molecular level with a computer-aided design program. The target proteins can be manufactured in the lab for testing with candidate treatments by inserting the gene that synthesizes the target protein into bacteria or other kinds of cells. The cells are then cultured for mass production of the protein, which can then be exposed to various treatment candidates and evaluated with &quot; rapid screening &quot; technologies. [ Approaches by life cycle stage ] [ Before cell entry ] One anti-viral strategy is to interfere with the ability of a virus to infiltrate a target cell. The virus must go through a sequence of steps to do this, beginning with binding to a specific &quot; receptor &quot; molecule on the surface of the host cell and ending with the virus &quot; uncoating &quot; inside the cell and releasing its contents. Viruses that have a lipid envelope must also fuse their envelope with the target cell, or with a vesicle that transports them into the cell, before they can uncoat. This stage of viral replication can be inhibited in two ways: [ March 2008 ] 1. Using agents which mimic the virus-associated protein (VAP) and bind to the cellular receptors. This may include VAP anti-idiotypic antibodies, natural ligand s of the receptor and anti-receptor antibodies. 2. Using agents which mimic the cellular receptor and bind to the VAP. This includes anti-VAP antibodies, receptor anti-idiotypic antibodies, extraneous receptor and synthetic receptor mimics. This strategy of designing drugs can be very expensive, and since the process of generating anti-idiotypic antibodies is partly trial and error, it can be a relatively slow process until an adequate molecule is produced. [ Entry inhibitor ] A very early stage of viral infection is viral entry, when the virus attaches to and enters the host cell. A number of &quot; entry-inhibiting &quot; or &quot; entry-blocking &quot; drugs are being developed to fight HIV. HIV most heavily targets the immune system&apos;s white blood cells known as &quot; helper T cells &quot;, and identifies these target cells through T-cell surface receptors designated &quot; CD4 &quot; and &quot; CCR5 &quot;. Attempts to interfere with the binding of HIV with the CD4 receptor have failed to stop HIV from infecting helper T cells, but research continues on trying to interfere with the binding of HIV to the CCR5 receptor in hopes that it will be more effective. [ Uncoating inhibitor ] Inhibitors of uncoating have also been investigated. [ Bishop NE Examination of potential inhibitors of hepatitis A virus uncoating Intervirology 41 6 261–71 1998 10325536 10.1159/000024948 ] [ Almela MJ, González ME, Carrasco L Inhibitors of poliovirus uncoating efficiently block the early membrane permeabilization induced by virus particles J. Virol. 65 5 2572–7 1991 May 1850030 240614 ] Amantadine and rimantadine, have been introduced to combat influenza. These agents act on penetration/uncoating. [ Beringer, Paul; Troy, David A.; Remington, Joseph P. Remington, the science and practice of pharmacy Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Hagerstwon, MD 2006 1419 0-7817-4673-6 ] Pleconaril works against rhinovirus es, which cause the common cold, by blocking a pocket on the surface of the virus that controls the uncoating process. This pocket is similar in most strains of rhinoviruses and enterovirus es, which can cause diarrhea, meningitis, conjunctivitis, and encephalitis. [ During viral synthesis ] A second approach is to target the processes that synthesize virus components after a virus invades a cell. [ Reverse transcription ] One way of doing this is to develop nucleotide or nucleoside analogues that look like the building blocks of RNA or DNA, but deactivate the enzymes that synthesize the RNA or DNA once the analogue is incorporated. This approach is more commonly associated with the inhibition of reverse transcriptase (RNA to DNA) than with &quot; normal &quot; transcriptase (DNA to RNA). The first successful antiviral, acyclovir, is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, zidovudine (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue. An improved knowledge of the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, lamivudine, has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase as part of its replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase. Another target being considered for HIV antivirals include RNase H – which is a component of reverse transcriptase that splits the synthesized DNA from the original viral RNA. [ Integrase ] Another target is integrase, which splices the synthesized DNA into the host cell genome. [ Transcription ] Once a virus genome becomes operational in a host cell, it then generates messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Production of mRNA is initiated by proteins known as transcription factor s. Several antivirals are now being designed to block attachment of transcription factors to viral DNA. [ Translation/antisense ] Genomics has not only helped find targets for many antivirals, it has provided the basis for an entirely new type of drug, based on &quot; antisense &quot; molecules. These are segments of DNA or RNA that are designed as complementary molecule to critical sections of viral genomes, and the binding of these antisense segments to these target sections blocks the operation of those genomes. A phosphorothioate antisense drug named fomivirsen has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by cytomegalovirus, and other antisense antivirals are in development. An antisense structural type that has proven especially valuable in research is morpholino antisense. Morpholino oligos have been used to experimentally suppress many viral types: [ Stein DA, Skilling DE, Iversen PL, Smith AW Inhibition of Vesivirus infections in mammalian tissue culture with antisense morpholino oligomers Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 11 5 317–25 2001 11763348 10.1089/108729001753231696 ] calicivirus es [ Inhibition of Flavivirus Infections by Antisense Oligomers Specifically Suppressing Viral Translation and RNA Replication J.

J. ] coronavirus es [ Translation/ribozymes ] Yet another antiviral technique inspired by genomics is a set of drugs based on ribozyme s, which are enzymes that will cut apart viral RNA or DNA at selected sites. In their natural course, ribozymes are used as part of the viral manufacturing sequence, but these synthetic ribozymes are designed to cut RNA and DNA at sites that will disable them. A ribozyme antiviral to deal with hepatitis C has been suggested, [ Ryu KJ, Lee SW Identification of the most accessible sites to ribozymes on the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 36 6 538–44 2003 14659071 10.5483/BMBRep.2003.36.6.538 ] and ribozyme antivirals are being developed to deal with HIV. [ Bai J, Rossi J, Akkina R Multivalent anti-CCR ribozymes for stem cell-based HIV type 1 gene therapy AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 17 5 385–99 2001 March 11282007 10.1089/088922201750102427 ] An interesting variation of this idea is the use of genetically modified cells that can produce custom-tailored ribozymes. This is part of a broader effort to create genetically modified cells that can be injected into a host to attack pathogens by generating specialized proteins that block viral replication at various phases of the viral life cycle. [ Protease inhibitors ] Some viruses include an enzyme known as a protease that cuts viral protein chains apart so they can be assembled into their final configuration. HIV includes a protease, and so considerable research has been performed to find &quot; protease inhibitors &quot; to attack HIV at that phase of its life cycle. [ Anderson J, Schiffer C, Lee SK, Swanstrom R Viral protease inhibitors Handb Exp Pharmacol 189 189 85–110 2009 19048198 10.1007/978-3-540-79086-0_4 Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 978-3-540-79085-3 ] Protease inhibitors became available in the 1990s and have proven effective, though they can have unusual side effects, for example causing fat to build up in unusual places. [ The Role of Protease Inhibitors in the Pathogenesis of HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy: Cellular Mechanisms and Clinical Implications Toxicol Pathol 37 1 65–77 2009 19171928 10.1177/0192623308327119 3170409 Flint O. P. Noor M. A. Hruz P. W. Hylemon P. B. Yarasheski K. Kotler D. P. Parker R. A. Bellamine A. ] Improved protease inhibitors are now in development. Protease inhibitors have also been seen in nature. A protease inhibitor was isolated from the Shiitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes). [ Odani S, Tominaga K, Kondou S The inhibitory properties and primary structure of a novel serine proteinase inhibitor from the fruiting body of the basidiomycete, Lentinus edodes European Journal of Biochemistry 262 3 915–23 1999 10411656 10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00463.x ] The presence of this may explain the Shiitake mushrooms noted antiviral activity in vitro.

Virol. 68 2 1103–14 1994 8289340 236549 ] [ Release phase ] The final stage in the life cycle of a virus is the release of completed viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains. [ Immune system stimulation ] A second category of tactics for fighting viruses involves encouraging the body&apos;s immune system to attack them, rather than attacking them directly. Some antivirals of this sort do not focus on a specific pathogen, instead stimulating the immune system to attack a range of pathogens. One of the best-known of this class of drugs are interferons, which inhibit viral synthesis in infected cells. [ Samuel CE Antiviral Actions of Interferons Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 14 4 778–809 2001 October 11585785 89003 10.1128/CMR.14.4.778-809.2001 ] One form of human interferon named &quot; interferon alpha &quot; is well-established as part of the standard treatment for hepatitis B and C, [ Burra P Hepatitis C Semin. Liver Dis. 29 1 53–65 2009 19235659 10.1055/s-0029-1192055 ] and other interferons are also being investigated as treatments for various diseases. A more specific approach is to synthesize antibodies, protein molecules that can bind to a pathogen and mark it for attack by other elements of the immune system. Once researchers identify a particular target on the pathogen, they can synthesize quantities of identical &quot; monoclonal &quot; antibodies to link up that target. A monoclonal drug is now being sold to help fight respiratory syncytial virus in babies, [ Nokes JD, Cane PA New strategies for control of respiratory syncytial virus infection Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 21 6 639–43 2008 December 18978532 10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283184245 ] and antibodies purified from infected individuals are also used as a treatment for hepatitis B. [ Akay S, Karasu Z Hepatitis B immune globulin and HBV-related liver transplantation Expert Opin Biol Ther 8 11 1815–22 2008 November 18847315 10.1517/14712598.8.11.1815 ] [ Acquired resistance ] Almost all anti-microbials, including anti-virals, are subject to drug resistance as the pathogen s mutate over time, becoming less susceptible to the treatment. For instance, a recent study published in Nature Biotechnology emphasized the urgent need for augmentation of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) stockpiles with additional antiviral drugs including zanamivir (Relenza) based on an evaluation of the performance of these drugs in the scenario that the 2009 H1N1 &apos;Swine Flu&apos; neuraminidase (NA) were to acquire the tamiflu-resistance (His274Tyr) mutation which is currently widespread in seasonal H1N1 strains.
