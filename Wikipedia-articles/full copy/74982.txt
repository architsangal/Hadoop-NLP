Shipman witnessed his mother&apos;s pain subside in light of her terminal condition, up until her death on 21 June 1963. { The Early Life of Harold Shipman } Shipman received a scholarship to medical school, and graduated from Leeds School of Medicine in 1970. He started work at Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 took his first position as a general practitioner (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. In 1975 he was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine for his own use. He was fined £600, and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in York. After a brief period as medical officer for Hatfield College, Durham, [ April 2012 ] and temporary work for the National Coal Board, he became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in 1977.

In 1983, he was interviewed on the Granada television documentary World in Action on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community. [ June 2010 ] [ Detection ] In March 1998, Dr Linda Reynolds of the Brooke Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Son&apos;s funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman&apos;s patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; The Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman&apos;s eventual arrest, he killed three more people.

Shipman was the last person to see her alive, and later signed her death certificate, recording &quot; old age &quot; as cause of death. Grundy&apos;s daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, and went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy&apos;s body was exhume d, and when examined found to contain traces of diamorphine ( heroin ), often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman was arrested on 7  September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the type used to make the forged will.

They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal overdose s of diamorphine, signing patients&apos; death certificates, and then forging medical records indicating they had been in poor health. [ UK Doctor &apos;forged victim&apos;s medical history&apos; 8 November 1999 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/510002.stm BBC News 27 September 2008 ] Prescription For Murder, a book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, reports two theories on why Shipman forged the will. One is that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control; the other reason, that he planned to retire at fifty-five and leave the country. [ Trial and imprisonment ] Shipman&apos;s trial, presided over by Mr Justice Forbes, began on 5  October 1999. Shipman was charged with the murders of Marie West, Irene Turner, Lizzie Adams, Jean Lilley, Ivy Lomas, Muriel Grimshaw, Marie Quinn, Kathleen Wagstaff, Bianka Pomfret, Norah Nuttall, Pamela Hillier, Maureen Ward, Winifred Mellor, Joan Melia and Kathleen Grundy, all of whom had died between 1995 and 1998. On 31  January 2000, after six days of deliberation, the jury found Shipman guilty of killing 15  patients by lethal injections of diamorphine, and forging the will of Kathleen Grundy. The trial judge sentenced him to 15  consecutive life sentences and recommended that he never be released. Shipman also received four years for forging the will. Two years later, Home Secretary David Blunkett confirmed the judge&apos;s whole life tariff, just months before British government ministers lost their power to set minimum terms for prisoners. On 11 February 2000, ten days after his conviction, the General Medical Council formally struck Shipman off its register.

He never made any statements about his actions. His defence tried, but failed, to have the count of murder of Mrs Grundy, where a clear motive was alleged, tried separately from the others, where no obvious motive was apparent. His wife, Primrose, apparently was in denial about his crimes as well.

Dame Janet Smith, the judge who submitted the report, admitted that many more suspicious deaths could not be definitively ascribed to him. Most of his victims were elderly women in good health. In her sixth and final report, issued on 24  January 2005, Smith reported that she believed that Shipman had killed three patients, and she had serious suspicions about four further deaths, including that of a four-year-old girl, during the early stage of his medical career at Pontefract General Hospital, West Riding, Yorkshire. Smith concluded the probable number of Shipman&apos;s victims between 1971 and 1998 was 250. In total, 459 people died while under his care, but it is uncertain how many of those were Shipman&apos;s victims, as he was often the only doctor to certify a death.
