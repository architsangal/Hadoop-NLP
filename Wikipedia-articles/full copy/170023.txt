Upon returning, he quickly joined the Church in Auxerre in Gaul and studied to be a priest. [ April 2010 ] In 432, he again said that he was called back to Ireland, though as a bishop, to Christianise the Irish from their native polytheism. Irish folklore tells that one of his teaching methods included using the shamrock to explain the Christian doctrine of the Trinity to the Irish people. After nearly thirty years of evangelism, he died on 17  March 461, and according to tradition, was buried at Downpatrick. Although there were other more successful missions to Ireland from Rome, Patrick endured as the principal champion of Irish Christianity and is held in esteem in the Irish church.

Saint Patrick&apos;s Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints&apos; feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint&apos;s day to a time outside those periods. Saint Patrick&apos;s Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick&apos;s Day was observed on 3 April in order to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 14 March (15 March being used for St. Joseph, which had to be moved from 19 March), although the secular celebration still took place on 17 March.

[ Montserrat ] The tiny island of Montserrat, known as &quot; Emerald Island of the Caribbean &quot; because of its founding by Irish refugees from Saint Kitts and Nevis, is the only place in the world apart from Ireland and the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador where St Patrick&apos;s Day is a public holiday. The holiday also commemorates a failed slave uprising that occurred on 17  March 1768.

The Irish made a large impact on the social, political and education systems, of both countries. This is due to the large numbers of Irish people that emigrated to, or where brought over as convicts during the 19th century. As such, Saint Patrick&apos;s Day is seen as a day to celebrate individual links to Ireland and Irish heritage.
