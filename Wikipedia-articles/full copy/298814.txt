{ Jump start } Jump starting a vehicle { Crocodile clip s, also called automotive clips, on a set of } { jumper cables } A jump start, also called a boost, is a method of starting an automobile or other vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine when the vehicle&apos;s battery has been discharged. A second battery (often in another vehicle) is temporarily connected to provide starting power to the disabled vehicle. Once the disabled vehicle&apos;s engine is running, its alternator or generator should recharge the dead battery, so the second battery can be disconnected. Most motor vehicles use a battery that provides power to a starting electric motor for the engine. When the engine is running, electrical power from its alternator restores the charge to the battery in preparation for the next start. When a battery is discharged, as for example by headlight s left on while the engine is off, the car&apos;s engine will not &quot; turn over &quot; when the ignition key is turned and the vehicle will not start. [ Jumper cables (Jump Leads) ] [ Jumper cable (disambiguation) ] Jumper cable connected to positive post Many motorists carry jumper cables (known in the UK as jump leads) which consist of a pair of heavy gauge, insulate d wires with alligator clip s at each end. Jumper cables are available in various lengths. The size of copper conductors varies from about #10 AWG for light duty sets, to #1 AWG. The alligator clips generally have color-coded, vinyl-coated (PVC) insulation to prevent electrical short circuits. Most clips fit both top- and side-mounted battery terminals. Top-quality clips are made of solid copper; lesser-quality are made of material such as copper-plated steel. Jumper cables are marked by black (-) and red (+) handles, representing the two polarities of the automobile&apos;s direct current system. Interchanging the polarities will cause damage to one or both automobiles, possibly including blown electrical fuse s and circuit board s, and could cause a battery explosion. Car manuals recommend connecting the negative (black) cable last and disconnecting it first, since charging may produce hydrogen gas, which could explode if there is a spark; if this ruptured the battery casing, it would then spray Sulfuric acid, possibly over the person performing the jump start (see acid burn for consequences). Connecting the positive (red) cable while the negative cable is connected may also cause a spark and battery explosion. [ Haynes Repair Manual, Toyota Corolla 1984 thru 1992 1-56392-064-6 5–2 ] [ Limitations ] Operation of a lead-acid battery may, in case of overcharge, produce flammable hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water inside the battery. Jump start procedures are usually found in the vehicle owner&apos;s manual. [ 2004 Owner&apos;s Manual,`Toyota Camry Solara, Toyota Publication No. OM33596U, for an example of an owner&apos;s manual ] { http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1986/1986_240/86240_03b.htm On-line version of a 1986 Volvo 240 owner&apos;s manual, page 64, shows jump start procedure } The recommended sequence [ Horst Bauer Bosch Automotive Handbook 4th Edition Robert Bosch GmbH Stuttgart 1996 0-8376-0333-1 806–807 ] of connections is intended to reduce the chance of accidentally shorting the good battery or igniting hydrogen gas. Owner&apos;s manuals will show the preferred locations for connection of jumper cables; for example, some vehicles have the battery mounted under a seat, or may have a jumper terminal in the engine compartment. Motorists can be severely injured by a battery explosion. In the United States in 1994, a research note by the National Highway Traffic Safety Association estimated that about 442 persons were injured by exploding batteries while attempting a jump-start. [ Injuries Associated with Hazards Involving Motor Vehicle Batteries Road Management and Engineering Journaland TranSafety http://www.usroads.com/journals/rmej/9808/rm980801.htm August 2, 2007 ] { Organizations such as Prevent Blindness America recommend use of splash-resistant safety goggles to protect the eyes while connecting cables. } [ http://www.preventblindness.org/safety/battery.html Prevent Blindness Prevent Blindness August 10, 2007 ] Current from the boosting vehicle will charge the dead battery if it is still capable of being charged. After several minutes enough energy is transferred to allow cranking of the engine. If the connections are good and the cables are large, the boosting vehicle battery may also supply part of the cranking current. In an extreme case, it is possible to crank and start a vehicle with no battery in it (or where the battery is not capable of holding a charge) if the cables are heavy-duty. Cranking current drawn through light-gauge cables in this way will damage them by overheating; electrical resistance of a smaller wire is higher than that of a larger wire, and resistance dissipates electrical energy into heat. If the discharged battery case is cracked, or the battery has a low electrolyte level, or is frozen, a jump start will not restore normal operation. A jump start is only effective for a discharged battery and cannot resolve other faults including a lack of fuel, a failed battery, or other mechanical problems. Even after a successful jump start a vehicle may not be able to resume normal operation if the reason for the dead battery is a failed charging system. Loss of voltage from the vehicle battery may have wide-ranging effects—from a trivial loss of radio receiver preset stations to a significant loss of security codes or engine control parameters. [ Motorcycles ] Many very old motorcycles (and cars) have 6-volt systems and cannot be jump started safely with a modern car, [ Schultz Mort What you may not know about jump starting http://books.google.com/books?id%3DdM8DAAAAMBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA42 Popular Mechanics December 1979 152 6 0032-4558 ] but newer designs with 12-volt systems may be jump started with a 12-volt car or truck. Car batteries can generally jump start a motorcycle easily without any help from the car&apos;s alternator. [ Duglin Kennedy 2005 The Savvy Guide to Motorcycles Shirley Indy Tech Publishing 0-7906-1316-6, 9780790613161 33 http://books.google.com/?id%3DkEX7Ncd3hO4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA33 ] An alternative is to push start the motorcycle.

While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, the amount of current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking. The engine cranking motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, { For example, http://www.vat19.com/dvds/auto-jumper-jumpstarts-car-without-cables.cfm, one maker of a cigarette lighter booster, says it won&apos;t work if the car switches off its cigarette lighter with the engine off. } making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery. [ Battery booster and jump starter ] A hand-portable battery, equipped with attached cables and charger, can be used similarly to another vehicle&apos;s battery. Portable boosters may automatically sense the battery&apos;s polarity prior to sending power to the vehicle, eliminating the damage that can result from reversing the connection. [ Battery charger ] Motorists and service garages often have portable battery charger s operated from AC power. Very small &quot; trickle &quot; chargers are intended only to maintain a charge on a parked or stored vehicle, but larger chargers can put enough charge into a battery to allow a start within a few minutes. Battery chargers may be strictly manual, or may include controls for time and charging voltage. Some chargers are equipped with &quot; boost &quot; settings that supply a large current to assist in cranking the engine. Battery chargers that apply high voltage (for example, more than 14.4 volts on a 12 volt nominal system) will result in emission of hydrogen gas from the battery, which may damage it or create an explosion risk. A battery may be recharged without removal from the vehicle, although in a typical roadside situation no convenient source of power may be nearby. [ Push starting ] [ Push start ] A vehicle with a manual transmission may be push started. This requires caution while pushing the vehicle and may require the assistance of several persons or another vehicle. If the vehicle battery cannot provide power to the ignition system, push starting will be ineffective. Most vehicles with automatic transmission s cannot be started this way because the hydraulic torque converter in the transmission will not allow the engine to be driven by the wheels. [ Voltage problem ] Formerly, especially in cold climates, some jump starts were done with two series-connected batteries to provide 24 volts to a 12 volt starting motor. Heavy vehicles such as large trucks, excavation equipment, or vehicles with diesel engines may use 24-volt electrical systems. They usually have a 24V supply using two 12V automotive batteries in series : it is therefore possible to jump-start a vehicle with a 12V electrical system using only one of the two batteries. [ Tech Article:24 Volt Systems BJ Series Land Cruisers http://cruisers.bitwalla.com/articles/24v.html January 5, 2012 ] Vintage cars may have 6-volt electrical systems, or may connect the positive terminal of the battery to the chassis. The methods intended for boosting 12-volt, negative-ground vehicles cannot be used in such cases. Passenger vehicles with 42-volt electrical system s may not be possible to &quot; boost &quot; from other vehicles; professional assistance would be required to prevent severe damage to the vehicle and possible personal injury (see tow truck ). Hybrid vehicle s may have a very small 12 volt battery system unsuitable for sourcing the large amount of current required to boost a conventional vehicle. [ February 2011 ] However, as the 12-volt system of a hybrid vehicle is only required to start up the control system of the vehicle, a very small portable battery may successfully boost a hybrid that has accidentally discharged its 12-volt system; the main propulsion battery is unlikely to also have been discharged. [ Military vehicles ] { CUCV } Generally referred to as &quot; slave starting &quot; in military parlance, the jump starting procedure has been simplified for military vehicles. Tactical vehicles used by NATO militaries possess 24-volt electrical systems and, in accordance with STANAG 4074, have standard slave receptacles for easy connection. A slave cable is plugged in to the receptacle on each vehicle, and the dead vehicle is started with the live vehicle&apos;s engine running.
