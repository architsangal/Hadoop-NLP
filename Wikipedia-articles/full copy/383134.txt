Edward Bach (pronounced &apos;Batch&apos;, [ icon ˈ b æ tʃ ]; September 24, 1886 – November 27, 1936) was a British physician, { Matthew Wood Vitalism } { Frankie Hutton Rose Lore } homeopath and spiritual writer, best known for developing a range of remedies called the Bach flower remedies, a form of alternative medicine inspired by classical homeopathic traditions. [ Biography ] Bach grew up in Birmingham, studied medicine at the University College Hospital, London and obtained a Diploma of Public Health (DPH) at Cambridge. In 1917 Bach had a malignant tumor removed from his spleen. It was predicted that he had only three months left to live, but instead he recovered. Bach died in his sleep on November 27, 1936, at the age of 50. [ Mechthild Scheffer The Encyclopedia of Bach Flower Therapy Rochester, Vermont Healing Arts Press 2001 13–5 ] [ Bach nosodes ] Starting in 1919, he worked at the London Homeopathic Hospital, where he was influenced by the work of Samuel Hahnemann. [ Wood, Matthew Vitalism: The History of Herbalism, Homeopathy and Flower Essences North Atlantic Books Richmond, Calif 2000 1-55643-340-9 ] p.  186 In this period, he developed seven bacterial nosode s known as the seven Bach nosodes. Their use has been mostly confined to British homeopathy practitioners. These Bowel Nosodes { John Paterson The Bowel Nosodes } were introduced by Bach and the British homeopaths, John Paterson (1890–1954) { John PATERSON (1890-1954) PHOTOTHÈQUE HOMÉOPATHIQUE Homéopathe International } and Charles Edwin Wheeler (1868–1946) { Charles Edwin Wheeler PHOTOTHÈQUE HOMÉOPATHIQUE Homéopathe International } in the 1920s. Their use is based on the variable bowel bacterial flora associated with persons of different homeopathic constitutional types. { Prescribing on the basis of Nosodes &amp; Bowel Nosodes Homoeopathy Clinic website } [ Bach flower remedies ] [ Bach flower remedies ] In 1930, at the age of 43, he decided to search for a new healing technique. He spent the spring and summer discovering and preparing new flower remedies - which include no part of the plant but simply what Bach claimed to be the pattern of energy of the flower. In the winter he treated patients free of charge. Rather than being based on medical research, using the scientific method, Bach&apos;s flower remedies were intuitively derived [ Graham Helen Complementary Therapies in Context: The Psychology of Healing Jessica Kingsley Publishers 1999 254 1-85302-640-9 ] and based on his perceived psychic connections to the plants. p.  185 If he felt a negative emotion, he would hold his hand over different plants, and if one alleviated the emotion, he would ascribe the power to heal that emotional problem to that plant. He believed that early morning sunlight passing through dew-drops on flower petals transferred the healing power of the flower onto the water, [ Larimore, Walt; O&apos;Mathuna, Donal Alternative Medicine: The Christian Handbook, Updated and Expanded (Christian Handbook) Zondervan Grand Rapids, Michigan 2007 293 0-310-26999-7 ] so he would collect the dew drops from the plants and preserve the dew with an equal amount of brandy to produce a mother tincture which would be further diluted before use. [ Robson, Terry An Introduction to Complementary Medicine Allen &amp; Unwin Academic 2004 184–185 1-74114-054-4 ] Later, he found that the amount of dew he could collect was not sufficient, so he would suspend flowers in spring water and allow the sun&apos;s rays to pass through them. Rather than recognizing the role of germ theory of disease, defective organs and/or tissue, and other known and demonstrable sources of disease, Bach thought of illness as the result of a conflict between the purposes of the soul and the personality&apos;s actions and outlooks. This internal war, according to Bach, leads to negative moods and energy blocking, which causes a lack of &quot; harmony, &quot; thus leading to physical diseases.
