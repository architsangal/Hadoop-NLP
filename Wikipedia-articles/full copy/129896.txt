In the late 1770s, this was the largest Lenape village on the Tuscarawas River, with 700 residents. Chief Newcomer (Netawatwes) was the leader of the western Lenape here, and they called the village Gekelmukpechunk. Early European-American traders and settlers named the village Newcomerstown after the chief. Soon after the start of the American Revolutionary War, the Lenape moved west to Coshocton, Ohio. { History of Newcomerstown, Ohio, Ohio History, accessed 19 Mar 2010 } According to some accounts, Newcomerstown was named after an incident that occurred between a Lenape chief and his wife, Mary Harris. The chief, Eagle Feather grew tired of his wife and abducted a younger squaw and attempted to assimilate her into the same wigwam as Harris. Harris allegedly killed Chief Eagle Feather and told the warriors of the village that the young squaw ran away. The warriors hunted her down and killed her. The settlement was thenceforth known as &quot; Newcomerstown &quot;, after the squaw. { Incident Among Indians Gave Community Name } In 1900, 2,659 people lived in Newcomerstown; in 1910, 2,943.
