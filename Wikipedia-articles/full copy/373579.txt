[ Budget 2011 2011 HM Treasury London http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_complete.pdf 30 December 2011 48 ] { Andrew Lansley MP } { Secretary of State for Health } { Simon Burns MP } { Minister of State for Health } { Paul Burstow MP } { Minister of State for Care Services } { Una O&apos;Brien } { Permanent Secretary } { David Nicholson } { Chief Executive of the NHS } The Department of Health (DH) is a department of the United Kingdom government with responsibility for government policy for health and social care matters and for the National Health Service (NHS) in England along with a few elements of the same matters which are not otherwise devolved to the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish governments. It is led by the Secretary of State for Health with two Ministers of State and two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. The role that the department of health plays is allocated is that of developing policies and guidelines to improve the quality of care and to meet patient expectations. The DH carries out some of its work through arm&apos;s length bodies, { Arm&apos;s length bodies of the Department of Health } including non-departmental public bodies and executive agencies such as the Commercial Medicines Unit (CMU) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). [ History ] The Department of Health was formally created in 1988, through The Transfer of Functions (Health and Social Security) Order 1988.Like many others, the department with responsibility for the nation&apos;s health has had different names and included other functions over time. [ http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/21/detail.html Health Departments The National Archives ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk 2006-11-07 ] In the 19th century, several bodies were formed for specific consultative duties and dissolved when they were no longer required. There were two incarnations of the Board of Health (in 1805 and 1831) and a General Board of Health (1854 to 1858) that reported directly into the Privy Council. Responsibility for health issues was also at times, and in part, vested in local health boards and, with the emergence of modern local government, with the Local Government Act Office, part of the Home Office. In the early part of the 20th century, medical assistance was provided through National Health Insurance Commissions. The first body which could be called a department of government was the Ministry of Health, created in 1919 through the Ministry of Health Act, consolidating under a single authority the medical and public health functions of central government. The co-ordination of local medical services was expanded in connection with emergency and wartime services, from 1935 to 1945, and these developments culminated in the establishment of the NHS in 1948. In 1968, the Ministry of Health was dissolved and its functions transferred (along with those of the similarly dissolved Ministry of Social Security) to the newly created Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). Twenty years later, these functions were split back into two government departments, forming the Department of Social Security (DSS) and the current Department of Health. [ Abbreviation ] Upon de-merger from the DHSS the Department of Health was commonly abbreviated in internal Governmental correspondence to &apos;DoH&apos;, which was also used in staff email address endings (@doh.gsi.gov.uk). This was changed to DH, omitting the &apos;o&apos;, circa 2004, unwritten internal sources suggesting that the original abbreviation may be uncomfortably close to Homer Simpson &apos;s expression of disdain &quot; D&apos;oh! &quot;. DH is now the abbreviation used in correspondence, official email addresses and URLs, although a number of health media outlets continue to favour the previous abbreviation. [ Location ] The Department of Health headquarters in Whitehall The official headquarters and ministerial offices are in Richmond House ( Whitehall, London ). Other London locations include Skipton House ( Elephant and Castle ), Wellington House near Waterloo station and New King&apos;s Beam House near Blackfriars Bridge. Alexander Fleming House and Hannibal House were previously used by the department. In addition, staff are based in Quarry House in Leeds, [ Ministers ] The Department of Health Ministers are as follows: { Cabinet Office List of Government Departments and Ministers: Department of Health } Minister Rank Portfolio The Rt Hon Andrew Lansley CBE MP Secretary of State Overall responsibility The Rt Hon Simon Burns MP Minister of State Health services Paul Burstow MP Minister of State Care services, mental health, disabilities Anne Milton MP Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Public health, devolved matters The Earl Howe Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Quality, NHS Constitution, primary care, medicines Key Conservative Liberal Democrat [ Permanent Secretary ] The current Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health is Una O&apos;Brien.

The official government inquiry into MMC recommended that the responsibility for medical training be removed from the DH.

The tendency to introduce each reorganisation before its predecessor has had time to settle down and generate improved performance has attracted censure amongst healthcare professions in the UK and beyond, including reference to the ironic concept of &apos;redisorganization&apos;. { http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16319441 } Andrew Lansley&apos;s promise before the 2010 general election not to impose top-down reorganisation, followed by the instigation from ministerial level of one of the most fundamental NHS reorganisations yet envisaged, has generated especially widespread opprobrium, although some commentators have also suggested that this is to some extenet completing the job started under the Blair administration. [ Information technology ] In recent years the Department of Health { http://www.cio.co.uk/cio100/department-of-health/4156/ } and the NHS have come under considerable scrutiny for its use of IT. { http://www.cio.co.uk/news/3209439/tories-vow-nhs-it-and-management-is-number-one-priority/ } Since being elected to power in 1997 the Labour government has sought to modernise the NHS through the introduction of IT. Although the policy is correct in aim, many claim its execution is lacking. { http://www.cio.co.uk/news/3208648/nhs-study-damns-electronic-patient-records-systems/ } In September 2008 a new leadership team was established, CIO for Health, Christine Connelly, and director of programme and system delivery Martin Bellamy. Previous CIO Richard Granger was believed to have been the most highly paid civil servant in the UK and was a controversial figure. { http://www.cio.co.uk/article/351/granger-the-final-word/?otc=44 } Connelly left the DH for a position in the Cabinet Office in June 2009 and was replaced by Tim Donohoe and Carol Clarke. Connelly&apos;s role is to &quot; deliver the Department&apos;s overall information strategy and integrating leadership across the NHS &quot;, according to the DH&apos;s website. That strategy, known as the National Programme for IT, { http://www.cio.co.uk/news/3208249/chancellor-threatens-future-of-nhs-it-programme/ } is intended to do nothing less than revolutionise NHS information workflow and is costed at about £12.7bn. The success or otherwise of Connelly&apos;s reign will be based on her promise to end delays of electronic medical records. She has said that if there is not clear progress by November 2009, a new plan could be hatched. On the eve of the departure of Fujitsu as an outsourcing partner, Connelly said in April 2009 that she would open up sourcing to competition at &quot; acute &quot; sights in the south of England and offer toolkits by March 2010 to allow more local configuration of systems. { http://www.intellectuk.org/blog/tag/christine-connelly/ } In January 2009, MPs criticised DH for its confidentiality agreement with key supplier CSC and in March the Department was admonished by the Information Commissioner for its records management. In May 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he was considering scrapping the project. { http://www.silicon.com/technology/software/2011/05/13/nhs-patient-records-project-faces-axe-says-cameron-39747397/ } [ 2010-11 Staffing cuts ] In response to Government spending reduction targets following the 2008-9 international financial crisis and subsequent recession, DH in common with several other Government Departments resorted to large-scale staffing reductions. In order to minimise redundancy costs, the predominant impact was upon DH staff not employed through a traditional civil service &apos;headcount&apos; contract, with a resultantly emphasised effect upon more recent or innovative work-streams dependent upon seconded or externally hosted staff. This has attracted criticism from several of the professional and patient communities of interest concerned, for instance as regards the impact upon Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) { http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2011/02/02/116215/civil-service-cuts-put-mental-health-strategy-at-risk.htm } and the withdrawal of the practical assistance available to the NHS and local authorities via the National Support Teams. [ Devolution ] Most health policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved to the department&apos;s counterparts: the Scottish Government Health and Wellbeing Directorate the Welsh Assembly Government the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland Executive A number of health issues are, however, wholly or partly reserved to Westminster: Scotland { Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part II } regulation of the health profession s abortion xenotransplantation embryology, surrogacy and human genetics medicines, medical supplies and poisons Northern Ireland { Northern Ireland Act 1998, Schedule 3 } xenotransplantation surrogacy human fertilisation and embryology human genetics In Northern Ireland, abortion law is a criminal justice matter and is devolved. { House of Commons, Written answers and statements, 13 July 2009 } Wales Under the Welsh devolution settlement, specific policy areas are transferred to the National Assembly for Wales rather than reserved to Westminster. As the distinction between Government and actual health services is seen as less pronounced than in England, the main source of information about current developments is NHS Wales.
