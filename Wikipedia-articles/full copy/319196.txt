The third smallest state of India, it occupies an area of [ 4,051 sqmi km2 on ]. Tripura is surrounded by Bangladesh on the north, south, and west. The Indian states of Assam and Mizoram lie to its east. The state capital is Agartala. A landlocked state, Tripura&apos;s geography is characterized by several north-south laid parallel hill ranges with intervening valleys, and plain in the western part of the state. The area of the modern Tripura was part of an independent Tripuri kingdom that ruled for several centuries, probably millennia.

Ethnic strife between original tribes and largely migrant Bengali population led to tension and scattered violence since 1970s. Establishment of an autonomous tribal zone soothed such tensions to a great extent, and the state remains peaceful, as of 2012. Tripura lies in a geographically disadvantageous location in India, with only one major highway connecting it with the rest of India; this hinders the economic prospects of the state. An agrarian state, most of the residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although service sector contribute the most to the gross state domestic product. Forests cover more than half the area of the state, and provide remarkable biodiversity for a relatively small state and also source of livelihood for many tribes. Scheduled tribes are about 30% of the population, with Kokborok -speaking Tripuri people forming the major tribe; Bengali people form the ethno-linguistic majority of the population. The mainstream Indian cultural elements led by Bengali culture coexists along with tribal traditional practices. [ Etymology ] Scholars postulated several etymological root of the name Tripura. Many scholars agree that Tripura is Sanskritized version of Tipra, the name of the aboriginal people inhabitaing the area. [ 138 ] One popular theory suggests that Tripura is derived from two Kokborok words tui and pra. Tui means water, pra means near. In ancient time the boundaries of Tripura extended up to the Bay of Bengal when its ruler held sway from the Garo Hills to the Arakan.

[ 138 ] The word Tripura may have originated from Tripura Sundari, the presiding deity of the land which is famous as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, pilgrimage centres of Shakti worshippers of Hinduism. [ http://tripura.nic.in/kt3.htm Tripura - A Profile 2011-10-27 National Informatics Centre ] Yet another myth suggests the word Tripura is attributable to the legendary tyrant king of Tripur who reigned in the region.

Tripura was a princely state. The Tripuri Kings (bubagra) held the title of Manikya and ruled Tripura for 3000 years until its merger with the union of India. Udaipur, in South Tripura district, was the capital of the Kingdom. The capital was shifted to Old Agartala by King Krishna Manikya in the eighteenth century, and then to the present Agartala in the 19 th century. The 19 th century marked the beginning of Tripura&apos;s modern era, when King Bir Chandra Manikya Bahadur Debbarma modeled his administration on the pattern of British India and enacted various reforms. The Ganamukti Parishad movement led to the integration of the kingdom with India signed by the Regent Maharani on September 9, 1947 and the administration of the state was actually taken over by the Govt. of India on October 15, 1949 within Assam state.

The partition of India also resulted in major economic and infrastructural setback for the state, as the road transport between the state and other major cities of India became significantly longer and difficult.

Some parts of the state received shelling from Pakistan Army during Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Migration of Bengali people and settlement by Hindu Bengali increased around the Bangladesh Liberation War. Reversal of demographics led to tribes becoming minority. Ethnic strife between the tribes and largely migrant Bengali community led to scattered violence in the state from 1970s, and ebb and flows of insurgency spanning decades.

The state is accessible to the rest of India through the Karimganj district of Assam and Aizawl district of Mizoram in the east. The physiography is characterized by hill ranges, valleys and plains. The state has several hill ranges running from north to south. From east to west, these ranges are— Boromura, Atharamura, Longtharai, Shakhan and Jampui. Valleys such as Khowai, Dhalai, Manu, Deo run almost parallel to and in between these hill ranges in a north to south pattern.

The hills have red laterite soil that is porous. The flood plains and narrow valleys have alluvial soil.
