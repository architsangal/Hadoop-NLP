In 1584, a Reformed (Calvinistic) institution, the Herborn Academy, was founded by John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg, William the Silent &apos;s younger brother, and namesake of today&apos;s Gymnasium Johanneum. In Herborn, as of 1602, the Reformed Church &apos;s first translation of the Bible was made by Johannes Piscator. This work has had a decisive effect in shaping church life among followers of the Reformed movement in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. It was printed in Herborn in the akademische Druckerei von Corvinus, known today as the Corvinsche Druckerei or Paul&apos;s Hof, after the family Paul who own it. In 1626, the town lost 214 houses in a fire started by accident in soldiers&apos; quarters. Not long after this, Herborn and the surrounding area were the scene of a wave of witch trials. Towards the end of the Thirty Years&apos; War, the townsfolk were looking after 50 Swedish soldiers, which brought them protection by the Swedish Army, and thereby also a reputation as a &quot; field hospital town &quot; ( &quot; Lazarettstadt &quot; ) that lasted until the end of the Second World War. After the Congress of Vienna, Herborn ended up in a border area next to Prussia and its economy suffered as a result of import tariffs. Only in 1836 Hesse-Nassau joined the Zollverein (Customs Union), and in 1866 it was completely annexed by Prussia. In the Second World War, Herborn was mostly spared by the bombers, but its Jew ish community was obliterated in 1942, and many of the patients of the psychiatric clinic were deported and murdered. During much of the Cold War there was a small American military garrison in the community, district Seelbach. The town became nationally known for a truck disaster that happened on 7 July 1987. After losing control because of faulty brake s, a tanker truck carrying about 34  000  L of fuel ran into a house containing an ice cream parlour and a pizzeria. The escaping fuel flowed into the sewer s and exploded, setting several houses on fire. All together, six people lost their lives, and 40 were injured.
