[ the historical character Arduin of Ivrea ] [ Grimoire Games November 2010 ] [ 400px The Arduin Trilogycovers David A. Hargrave David A. Hargrave, Grimoire Games, Dragon Tree Press, Emperor&apos;s Choice Games and Miniatures 1977-present Fantasy, Science Fiction, Horror Custom ] Arduin is a fictional universe and fantasy role-playing system created in the mid 1970s by David A. Hargrave. It was the first published &quot; cross-genre &quot; fantasy RPG, with everything from interstellar wars to horror and historical drama, although it was based primarily in the medieval fantasy genre. [ Brief history ] Arduin was one of the earliest challengers to TSR &apos;s Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It began as a personal project Hargrave created to share with friends, but became so popular that he was inspired to publish the material. The original Arduin suite of supplements, dungeon modules, and gaming aids were initially self-published, but were then later produced by Grimoire Games. Dragon Tree Press produced four further Arduin supplements before the Arduin rights and properties were purchased by Emperor&apos;s Choice Games and Miniatures. Although the Arduin books did not explicitly claim to be a Dungeons &amp; Dragons supplement, they were treated as such by most users. [ Elements of Arduin ] The Arduin books attempted to add many interesting and notable features to the fantasy role playing milieu. In addition to new rules, there were many classes, races, spells, and magic items that were new to players of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Classes: Alchemist Runeweaver Runesinger Courtesan Techno Martial Artist Merchant Star Powered Mage Races: Phraint -- amoral, logical grasshopper/mantis humanoids who were noted for their acrobatic, leaping attacks where they would throw a javelin at the apogee of their jump, flip over their opponent, and strike from behind with a two handed sword. Deodanth -- loosely based on Jack Vance&apos;s Deodands, these were interstellar refugee, matriarchal, vampiric catlike elves. Kobbit -- half kobold, half hobbit. They were good with slings, and somehow figured out a way to poison sling bullets. Throon -- four armed giant, loosely based on four armed Green Martians from Edgar Rice Burroughs&apos;s John Carter novels. They were fierce warriors and expert jugglers Spells: Morgorn&apos;s Red Death -- this was a 6th level spell that turned a target inside out. Curse Of Tindalos -- summon the hounds of Tindalos to hunt down your enemy. Blaze Of Glory -- causes the caster to explode with the magical power of all their uncast spells. Monsters: Air Sharks -- flying sharks filled with explosive hydrogen Kill Kittens -- cute kittens with toxic paralyzing claws Magic Items: Ring of Maybe -- a ring that allows its possessor to avoid three possible dooms Golden Drops of Heavenly Essence -- restores someone to full life from even the tiniest of remains [ The Arduin Trilogy ] The first three Arduin tomes are known as The Arduin Trilogy. They are, in order, The Arduin Grimoire, Welcome to Skull Tower, and The Runes Of Doom. The Arduin Trilogy contained unique new spells and character classes, new monsters, new treasures, maps, storylines, extensive demonography, and all sorts of charts and lists which detailed the Arduin &quot; multiverse &quot;. [ Arduin partial bibliography ] [ Books ] The Arduin Grimoire (Arduin Grimoire Vol. I), 1977. At least two different editions of this volume exist.

Hargrave&apos;s method of handling the controversy was to simply use white-out and typing correction tape to mask the disputed references, and then the volumes were reprinted exactly that way. In some versions of the Arduin printings, these so-called &quot; corrections &quot; are clearly visible. [ October 2011 ] [ Reviews ] Upon their publication in 1979, White Dwarf magazine reviewer Don Turnbull gave the Trilogy a 4 out of 10 rating, stating that he was perplexed as to whether the books were supposed to be a supplement to Dungeons &amp; Dragons or a standalone game. [ Turnbull D Livingstone I 1979 April/May Arduin Grimoire I-III White Dwarf Open Box 12 p13 ] In later years, however, RPGnet gave the Trilogy a 6.72 out of 10. { RPGnet RPG Game Index: The Arduin Trilogy Listing } [ Arduin mechanics ] There was also contention in the RPG world that the Arduin system lacked cohesion. It was only with the publication of The Arduin Adventure that a true standalone system began to evolve, where other systems were not needed to adequately run a game. Much criticism was made of Hargrave&apos;s combat mechanics, to the point where many Game Masters simply used either their own versions, or those of TSR [ February 2008 ]. [ Greg Stafford and Chaosium ] While David Hargrave was considered [ August 2010 ] one of the best of the best of Game Masters, he was also known for having a somewhat volatile personality. The original role-playing community at large was split between love and mere tolerance of Hargrave&apos;s passions, and his infamous falling-out with Greg Stafford, which resulted in Hargrave naming an Arduin spell after him as revenge, is one such example. { http://www.acaeum.com/forum/about4109-0-asc-20.html Q &amp; A with Greg Stafford } The spell was called Stafford&apos;s Star Bridge (The Arduin Grimoire, Volume 1, Page 41): [ 5 ft m on ] { wide and } [ 20 ft m on ] { long per level of the caster over the level needed for use. The bridge will carry any weight, and it cannot be hit by non-magical things. The bridge can also be &quot; keyed &quot; to support any single type (or more), letting all others fall through selectively. } Hargrave felt that Stafford had betrayed him over a Chaosium publishing deal, thus &quot; falling through selectively &quot;. According to Stafford, Hargrave was later very upset with himself for having created this spell and for his behavior in the situation. [ One-of-a-kind Arduin items ] Hargrave&apos;s death in 1988 left many Arduin items unpublished and incomplete. A few items he created on a whim for those he especially liked or was close to. Among all these are the following: [ The Book of the Shining Land ] Created December/January, 1980-81. Dedication and signature inside front cover. This is a complete campaign area, designed as a generic adventure campaign suitable for insertion into any RPG, written by David for his friend, writer Paul Mosher. The Book of the Shining Land comprises 118 handwritten pages of 10 1/4 x 7 7/8 quad ruled paper in a composition style notebook. It includes a Master Map of the area (approximately 100 miles square) and 59 &quot; keyed &quot; adventure area maps all cross-referenced off of the Master Map. [ The Book of Dreams of Lost Sardath ] Created October 1981. Similar in size and concept to The Book of the Shining Land, this work comprises 158 handwritten pages of 10 x 7 7/8 quad ruled paper in a composition style notebook. Includes a Master Map of an area approximately 100 miles square. This work was written by David for his friend, writer Paul Mosher. It comprises a &quot; lost &quot; island kingdom containing 136 villages/towns/cities cross referenced on the Master Map as well as 79 adventure area maps, of which 31 are &quot; keyed &quot;. [ Lancer&apos;s Rest ] Created October 1987. One of the last game-related items created by David A. Hargrave before his death in August 1988, Lancer&apos;s Rest was Lance Mazmanian&apos;s personal burial chamber, a very large single-level dungeon adventure which included a Hell Spiral and a [ 3000 ft m on ] pool where Mazmanian&apos;s corpse was entombed. Created by Hargrave as a tongue-in-cheek tribute, the adventure itself was essentially a quest to gain life-prolonging treasure while avoiding Mazmanian&apos;s wandering Avatar, an extremely powerful Lich -like entity who would either attack or help a party on random percentage roll. { David A. Hargrave: Lancer&apos;s Rest } [ Illustrators (partial listing) ] Several illustrators worked on Arduin materials at various times over the years, including the following: [ Erol Otus ] { Erol Otus (from &apos;&apos; } { The Howling Tower &apos;&apos;) } The first printings of The Arduin Grimoire (specifically, The Arduin Trilogy, Vol. 1) contained artwork by Erol Otus, an artist who would later become known for his illustrations appearing on and in TSR &apos;s Dungeons &amp; Dragons publications. { Erol Otus:: Pen &amp; Paper RPG Database } Otus&apos; artwork was later removed from subsequent printings of The Arduin Grimoire. [ Greg Espinoza ] Greg Espinoza contributed many of the Arduin covers and interior illustrations (close to 80 pieces) from approximately 1978 to 1981. He drew many of the monster and artifact cards for several of the standalone dungeon modules, and also painted the box art (with airbrushing by Anthony Delgado) for Grimoire Games&apos; The Arduin Adventure. [ Brad Schenck ] Brad Schenck (also known as Morno) [ October 2011 ] contributed the cover of Welcome to Skull Tower (AG II). His is also the original design for the Arduin &quot; Shield &quot; now featured by Emperor&apos;s Choice Games and Miniatures as their trademark. He also did the cover for The Arduin Adventure rule book. [ Michio Okamura ] Michio Okamura was a regular contributor from the earliest volumes of the Arduin books, his distinct woodcut art style was featured on the cover of Dark Dreams (AG VI). Michio would later find employment at Blizzard North where he worked on Diablo and Diablo II.
