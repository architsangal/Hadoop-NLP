[ September 2009 ] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an Islam ic theocratic monarchy in which Islam is the official religion. Although no law requires citizens or passport holders to be Muslim, almost all citizens are Muslims. Non-Islamic proselytism is illegal, { Rodlofo Estimo Jr., 12 Filipinos arrested for proselytizing out on bail, October 6, 2010, arabnews.com. } and conversion by Muslims to another religion ( apostasy ) carries the death penalty. As of 2010, there had been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy for several years. [ http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Saudi Arabia U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor November 17, 2010 2011-03-02 ] In February 2012, King Abdullah ordered Hamza Kashgari to be arrested after three Twitter messages of his were interpreted as insults to Mohammad. Religious freedom is virtually non-existent. The Government does not provide legal recognition or protection for freedom of religion, and it is severely restricted in practice. As a matter of policy, the Government guarantees and protects the right to private worship for all, including non-Muslims who gather in homes for religious practice; however, this right is not always respected in practice and is not defined in law. { &quot; A Catholic Indian priest had just celebrated mass in a private house, when seven religious policemen (muttawa) broke into the house.... The Saudi religious police are well known for their ruthlessness; they often torture believers of other religions who are arrested. AsiaNews sources said there were around 400,000 Indian Catholics in Saudi Arabia who were denied pastoral care. Catholic foreigners in the country number at least one million: none of them can participate in mass while they are in Saudi Arabia. Catechism for their children – nearly 100,000 – is banned. &quot; AsiaNews, April 10, 2006 (archived from the original on 2008-07-17) } Moreover, the public practice of non-Muslim religions is prohibited. The Saudi Mutaween ( Arabic : مطوعين), or Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (i.e., the religious police) enforces the prohibition on the public practice of non-Muslim religions. Sharia Law applies to all people inside Saudi Arabia, regardless of religion. [ Religious demography ] The country’s total land area is about 2,149,690  km 2 and the population is about 27 million, of whom approximately 19 million are citizens. There is no accurate figure for the number of foreign residents. The foreign population includes approximately 1.8 million Indians, 1.5 million Pakistan is, 1.3 million Filipinos, 1 million Bangladesh is, 1 million Egypt ians, 1 million Yemen is 600,000 Indonesia ns, 400,000 Syria ns, 400,000 Sri Lanka ns, 350,000 Nepal ese, 250,000 Palestinians, 150,000 Lebanese, 100,000 Eritrea ns, and 50,000 Americans. Comprehensive statistics for the denominations of foreigners are not available, but they include Muslims from the various branches and schools of Islam, Christian s, Hindu s, Buddhists, Jew s, Sikhs and others. For example, the Embassy of the Philippines reports that over 90 percent of the Filipino community is Christian. Accurate religious demographics of citizens are difficult to obtain. A majority of Saudi citizens are Salafi Muslims, the strict interpretation of Islam taught by the Salafi or Wahhabi school is the only officially recognized religion. A minority of citizens are Shia Muslims. They form around 15% of the native population. [ http://www.cfr.org/publication/10903/shiite_muslims_in_the_middle_east.html Shia Muslims in the Mideast Lionel Beehner June 16, 2006 Council on Foreign relations 2007-05-08 ] They live mostly in the eastern districts on the Persian Gulf ( Qatif, Al-Hasa, Dammam ), where they constitute approximately three-quarters of the native population, and in western highlands of Arabia (districts of Jazan, Najran, Asir, Medina, Ta&apos;if, and Hijaz ). Conversion by Muslims to another religion (apostasy) is punishable by death under the version of Islamic law adopted by the country, but, [ 2010 on ] there had been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years. [ Status of religious freedom ] Saudi Arabia is an Islamic monarchy and the Government has declared the Qur&apos;an and the Sunnah (tradition) of Muhammad to be the country’s Constitution. Freedom of religion is severely limited. Islam is the official religion. Under the law, children born to Muslim fathers are also Muslim, regardless of the country or the religious tradition in which they have been raised. The Government prohibits the public practice of other religions but private practice is allowed. The Government bases its legitimacy on governance according to the precepts of the rigorously conservative and strict interpretation of the Salafi or Wahhabi school of the Sunni branch of Islam and discriminates against other branches of Islam. Neither the Government nor society in general accepts the concepts of separation of religion and state, and such separation does not exist. The legal system is based on Sharia (Islamic law), with Shari&apos;a courts basing their judgments largely on a code derived from the Qur&apos;an and the Sunnah. The Government permits Shi&apos;a Muslims to use their own legal tradition to adjudicate noncriminal cases within their community. The only national holidays observed in Saudi Arabia are the two Eids, Eid Al-Fitr at the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha at the conclusion of the Hajj and the Saudi national day. Contrary practices, such as celebrating Maulid Al-Nabi (birthday of the Prophet Muhammad) and visits to the tombs of renowned Muslims, are forbidden, although enforcement was more relaxed in some communities than in others, and Shi&apos;a were permitted to observe Ashura publicly in some communities. On January 12, 2009, Rasid.com reported that students and government employees who missed school or work on a Shi&apos;a holiday, the Tenth of Muharram, without an acceptable excuse were &quot; punished. &quot; The nature of the punishment was not specified.

Outside Saudi Arabia, this branch of Islam is often referred to as &quot; Wahhabi, &quot; a term the Saudis do not use. The teachings of Abd al Wahhab are more often referred to by adherents as &quot; Salafi &quot; or &quot; Muwahhidun, &quot; that is, following the earliest generations of Muslims (Salafi), or believers in the divine unity (Muwahhidun). Practices contrary to this interpretation, such as celebration of Muhammad&apos;s birthday and visits to the tombs of renowned Muslims, are discouraged. The spreading of Muslim teachings not in conformance with the officially accepted interpretation of Islam is prohibited. Writers and other individuals who publicly criticize this interpretation, including both those who advocate a stricter interpretation and those who favor a more moderate interpretation than the government&apos;s, reportedly have been imprisoned and faced other reprisals. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs supervises and finances the construction and maintenance of almost all mosque s in the country, although over 30% of all mosques in Saudi Arabia are built and endowed by private persons. The Ministry pays the salaries of imam s (prayer leaders) and others who work in the mosques. A governmental committee defines the qualifications of imams. The Committee to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice (commonly called &quot; religious police &quot; or Mutawwa&apos;in) is a government entity, and its chairman has ministerial status. The Committee sends out armed and unarmed people into the public to ensure that Saudi citizens and expatriates living in the kingdom follow the Islamic mores, at least in public.

Non-Muslim worshipers risk arrest, imprisonment, lashing, deportation, and sometimes torture for engaging in overt religious activity that attracts official attention. [ March 2010 this appears to be from a 2002 source at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm. The equivalent 2010 source is at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm ] The Government has stated publicly, including before the U.N. Committee on Human Rights in Geneva, that its policy is to protect the right of non-Muslims to worship privately. However, non-Muslim organizations have claimed that there are no explicit guidelines for distinguishing between public and private worship, such as the number of persons permitted to attend and the types of locations that are acceptable. Such lack of clarity, as well as instances of arbitrary enforcement by the authorities, obliges most non-Muslims to worship in such a manner as to avoid discovery. Those detained for non-Muslim worship almost always are deported by authorities after sometimes lengthy periods of arrest during investigation. In some cases, they also are sentenced to receive lashes prior to deportation. [ March 2010 this appears to be from a 2002 source at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm. The equivalent 2010 source is at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm ]. The Government does not permit non-Muslim clergy to enter the country for the purpose of conducting religious services, although some come under other auspices and perform religious functions in secret. Such restrictions make it very difficult for most non-Muslims to maintain contact with clergymen and attend services. Catholics and Orthodox Christians, who require a priest on a regular basis to receive the sacraments required by their faith, particularly are affected.

Muslims or non-Muslims wearing religious symbols of any kind in public risk confrontation with the Mutawwa&apos;in. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, approximately 50 &quot; Call and Guidance &quot; centers employing approximately 500 persons work to convert foreigners to Islam. Some non-Muslim foreigners convert to Islam during their stay in the country. According to official reports, 942 foreign workers converted to Islam in the past year [ November 2011 from a 2002 source: http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm ]. The press often carries articles about such conversions, including testimonials. The press as well as government officials publicized the conversion of the Italian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia in late 2001 [ March 2010 this appears to be from a 2002 source at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm. The equivalent 2010 source is at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm ]. The Government requires noncitizen residents to carry a Saudi residence permit (Iqama) for identification in place of their passports. [ http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1012.html Consular Information Sheet – Saudi Arabia U.S. Department of State 2011-11-02 ] Among other information, these contain a religious designation for &quot; Muslim &quot; or &quot; non-Muslim. &quot; Members of the Shi’a minority are the subjects of officially sanctioned political and economic discrimination. The authorities permit the celebration of the Shi’a holiday of Ashura in the eastern province city of Qatif, provided that the celebrants do not undertake large, public marches or engage in self-flagellation (a traditional Shi’a practice). The celebrations are monitored by the police. In 2002 observance of Ashura took place without incident in Qatif. No other Ashura celebrations are permitted in the country, and many Shi’a travel to Qatif or to Bahrain to participate in Ashura celebrations. The Government continued to enforce other restrictions on the Shi’a community, such as banning Shi’a books [ September 2009 this appears to be from a 2002 source at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm. The equivalent 2010 source is at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm ]. Shi’a have declined government offers to build state-supported mosques because they fear the Government would prohibit the incorporation and display of Shi’a motifs in any such mosques. The Government seldom permits private construction of Shi’a mosques. In March 2001, religious police reportedly closed a Shi’a mosque in Hofuf because it had been built without government permission [ September 2009 this appears to be from a 2002 source at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm. The equivalent 2010 source is at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148843.htm ]. Members of the Shi’a minority are discriminated against in government employment, especially with respect to positions that relate to national security, such as in the military or in the Ministry of the Interior. The Government restricts employment of Shi’a in the oil and petrochemical industries. The Government also discriminates against Shi’a in higher education through unofficial restrictions on the number of Shi’a admitted to universities.

Legal sources report that testimony by Shi’a is often ignored in courts of law or is deemed to have less weight than testimony by Sunnis. Sentencing under the legal system is not uniform. Laws and regulations state that defendants should be treated equally; however, under Shari’a as interpreted and applied in the country, crimes against Muslims may result in harsher penalties than those against non-Muslims. Observers believe that the new Criminal Procedure Law, passed in late 2001 and became effective on May 1, 2002, should give fairer treatment to all defendants [ September 2009 this appears to be from a 2002 source at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14012.htm.

He was reportedly held in solitary confinement for long periods during his first months in detention and tortured prior to his first appearance before a judge in July 1988. The judge reportedly asked him to convert from Shi&apos;a Islam to Sunni Wahhabi Islam, and allegedly promised him a lighter sentence if he complied. After he refused to do so, he was taken to al-Mabahith al-&apos;Amma (General Intelligence) Prison in Dammam where he was held until April 1990.

The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curricula, and all religious instructions in media are restricted to the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jews and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, there has not been a single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy. The branch of Imam Mohamed Bin Saud University in Fairfax, Virginia instructs its students that Shia Islam is a Jewish conspiracy. { Congressional Human Rights Caucus (2002). } Amir Taheri quotes a Shi&apos;ite businessman from Dhahran as saying &quot; It is not normal that there are no Shi&apos;ite army officers, ministers, governors, mayors and ambassadors in this kingdom.
