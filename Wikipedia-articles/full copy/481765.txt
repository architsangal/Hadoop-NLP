His mother became involved in the Catholic Charismatic Movement in the early 1970s and sought to introduce her children to the born again experience. In 1972, seeking a way out of Grand Rapids, he &quot; made a deal with God &quot; that he would attend prayer meetings with his mother if he could make All-City Tailback in football and thus receive a scholarship for college. He got the title and the scholarship.

He boasted of being able to bench press 400  lbs and run a 4.5 second 40-yard dash. Woroniecki explains in his Christian testimony that he forgot his deal with God and had a &quot; wild streak &quot;, involving himself in alcohol and partying. Woroniecki states that he was known to his teammates as the &quot; Crazy War &quot; and continues on to say he was arrested the summer of his freshman year for fighting in a bar, just to prove to his peers how tough he was. [ Woroniecki Michael The Victory In Defeat 1994 http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/1/30/2744045/VictoryinDefeat.pdf ] During spring football practice in 1974, Woroniecki suffered a disabling football injury that threatened his athletic aspirations. About the same time, Woroniecki&apos;s mother gave him a Bible, which he began to read. Woroniecki says God used this time of suffering and depression to break him of his pride, preparing him to receive the Gospel. { O&apos;Malley, p.102 } Woroniecki attended the annual Catholic Charismatic Conference at University of Notre Dame the weekend of June 14, 1974 with his family. He was in the stadium when he says he told God that he didn&apos;t know what the saying &quot; born again &quot; meant, but that he wanted everything that the Lord had for him. While sitting alone in the stadium, Woroniecki says that he gave his life to Jesus. At that moment, Woroniecki believes that he &quot; met the living Jesus &quot;. &quot; The grass and goalposts were the same but I was changed &quot; says Woroniecki, adding that he found significance in the recently painted Touchdown Jesus on the library mural right in front of him. After his conversion, Woroniecki put a cross on his CMU football helmet. 1974. Woroniecki returned to college football practice in July that same summer. One day after practice, while in a bar with his teammates, Woroniecki says he ordered water in the place of his usual beer. His friends becoming curious, Woroniecki explained that he had met Jesus. Used to his outrageous life-of-the-party humor, they all mistakenly thought he was joking, and Woroniecki became the focus of ridicule and rejection by his teammates. He writes that he could not understand why people like Roger Staubach, a famous Christian athlete, were respected, yet he was rejected, until he read John 12:24 and 25. He reasoned that if the world hated Jesus without cause; they would also hate and reject him if he followed Him. The same year, Woroniecki and his teammates went on to win the NCAA Division II National Football Championship for the only time in CMU&apos;s history. { O&apos;Malley, p. 103 } Woroniecki graduated from CMU with a B.S. in Behavioral Sciences in 1976. While at CMU, Woroniecki met a cheerleader from Detroit, Michigan, Leslie Jean Ochalek (later renamed &quot; Rachel Rebekah &quot; ). Woroniecki and Ochalek married in 1979. [ Religious training ] Charles and Rose Woroniecki, Michael Woroniecki´s parents, were members of the Basilica of Saint Adalbert, a Roman Catholic church in the Polish westside of Grand Rapids. Michael Woroniecki attended a Catholic grade school adjoining his family&apos;s parish and then advanced to West Catholic High School, another parochial school in Grand Rapids. During his senior year of high school in 1972, Woroniecki began attending Catholic Charismatic prayer meetings, part of his &quot; deal with God. &quot; After graduating from CMU, Woroniecki attended Melodyland School of Theology at Anaheim, California starting in 1976. A month after returning home from seminary that summer, his mother died from colon cancer. Woroniecki applied to the Dominican and Franciscan Orders of the Catholic Church with the intention of helping to bring reform from within the Church. In his final round of interviews with the Dominican seminary near Chicago, Illinois, Woroniecki was refused immediate admission and decided on a different course of action. He then applied to the Franciscan seminary in his own hometown of Grand Rapids. After a semester of study at Aquinas College, Woroniecki was again offered an extended preparatory period. He chose to pursue other means of study. In 1978, Woroniecki was accepted at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, a non-denominational institution. Woroniecki says he was &quot; deeply grieved &quot; by the professionalism and business-like attitude towards the things of God at Fuller. This atmosphere, Woroniecki claims, ultimately compelled him to stand on the campus lawn and preach &quot; the living Jesus &quot; to fellow students and professors when they came out of the chapel. He confronted classmates over the attitudes of scholastic pride and hypocrisy that he thought to contradict the life of Jesus of Nazareth. { O&apos;Malley, p.104 } Woroniecki obtained his Master of Divinity degree from Fuller in 1980. Upon returning to Grand Rapids, Woroniecki briefly attended and occasionally preached at Maranatha Church, a non-denominational charismatic ministry founded by the late Calvin Bergsma, Sr. Shortly thereafter, Woroniecki left to start his own home church and street preaching ministry. { O&apos;Malley, p.105 } [ Ministry ] [ Preaching ] Woroniecki returned to Grand Rapids after graduating from Fuller Seminary in the summer of 1980 where he preached on the streets and at various events with a sign or cross, starting his own ministry called Cornerstone Christian Fellowship. As a result of, according to Woroniecki, “youthful zeal” and a city unsure of how to handle his unconventional evangelistic approach, Woroniecki was arrested numerous times over the next year and a half. { &quot; Evangelist Michael Woroniecki Meets the Press in the &apos;City of Churches,&apos; &quot; Curt Christy, December 1, 1981 } In October 1981, Woroniecki phoned the City Attorney’s office and offered to leave town if the pending charges against him would be dropped. { &quot; Street Preacher Will Leave City to Beat Charges &quot;, Steve Grinczel, The Grand Rapids Press, October 8, 1981 } { Steve Grinczel, &quot; Woman Prefers to See Street Preacher Tried &quot;, Grand Rapids Press, October 12, 1981 } { Assistant City Attorney Michael D.

The family traveled together across Europe and then to Tangier, Africa. In May 1995, they preached in Casablanca, Morocco, where Muslim law makes it a crime to declare Jesus as the Son of God. A riot resulted and the family was arrested. They were interrogated for eight hours by state officials, then ordered to leave the country. { O&apos;Malley, p. 106; Seattle Times News Services, Around the World--Rabat, Morocco, &quot; Oregon Missionary Family Arrested in Casablanca &quot;, The Seattle Times, May 31, 1995; &quot; Casablanca } [ ?

Woroniecki performed, during the summers of 1992 to 1996, in downtown city plazas and centers, visiting: London, Paris, Barcelona, Lisbon, Rome, Berlin, Budapest, Athens, Moscow among others. Woroniecki says he used the music along with dances and biblical skits as a means of communicating the gospel in countries where they did not speak the language. Michael does not consider himself professional but believes “that music is a powerful tool to touch people of all walks of life”. During the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Woroniecki was reported to have performed with his family outside the various venues using the event to reach the international crowds with his message. Beginning in 1997, Woroniecki traveled throughout Mexico and Latin America, playing on the streets.

Certain media outlets alleged that Woroniecki bore some responsibility for influencing Andrea. { O&apos;Malley, p.109 } However, both Michael Woroniecki and Rusty Yates dismissed the allegations. According to the Houston Chronicle, &quot; (Russell)Yates said his relationship with Woroniecki was more like learning from a book.

Both Yates and Woroniecki characterized the connection, between Woroniecki’s teachings and Andrea Yate’s state of mind, as nothing more than media created fiction and sensationalist reporting. Woroniecki “…certainly didn’t cause the delusion,” says Yates. Woroniecki called the defense’s claims “ridiculous”. He stated that he had only met Andrea personally 4 or 5 times over 20 years and that his relationship with her was “one of nothing but love and compassion”.

According to Wellman, Woroniecki’s current message, as expressed on the website and in his literature, is: “Are you willing to look deeper, beyond it all? Please give us a chance to help you. It will be well worth your time. What we offer you is not a new group, “church”, formulas, self exaltation or doctrines.
