[ September 2009 ] { Verrazano-Narrows Bridge across from John Paul Jones Park } Typical street in Bay Ridge Bay Ridge is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, USA. It is bounded by Sunset Park on the north, Seventh Avenue and Dyker Heights on the east, The Narrows Strait, which partially houses the Belt Parkway, on the west and the Verrazano bridge on the south. While Fort Hamilton is often considered a separate neighborhood, it is part of Bay Ridge. Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton both share the zip code of 11209. { NYC Dept. of City Planning, District 10. } Bay Ridge is patrolled by the NYPD&apos;s 68th { NYPD 68th Precinct, } { NYPD. } Precinct. It is served by Engine 241, Engine 242, and Ladder 109 of the New York City Fire Department. [ Life ] Bay Ridge is a largely middle class neighborhood. With its strong family presence, it is not uncommon to see third or fourth generation families living in the region. Until the early 1990&apos;s Bay Ridge was a primarily Irish, Italian, and Norwegian { http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/08/nordic-delicacies-in-bay-ridge-scandinavian-brooklyn-new-york-city-nyc.html } neighborhood. Today, Bay Ridge maintains a sizable Irish, Italian, and Greek population, but like other areas in South/Southwest Brooklyn, late in the 20th century it saw an influx of Russian, Polish, and Arabians, and lesser numbers of Chinese. In recent decades many Syrian / Lebanese Americans have moved to Bay Ridge. Bay Ridge has many international restaurants and bars, especially along 3rd and 5th Avenue, its main commercial strips. Many refer to the community as &quot; Brooklyn&apos;s Gold Coast. &quot; Bay Ridge has a high elderly population. It has been called a NORC or a naturally-occurring retirement community because many of its families have grown up in the neighborhood while their children move away. In 2006 it was reported that 20% of the population of Bay Ridge is 60 or over.

Bay Ridge was chosen as an &quot; Editor&apos;s Pick &quot; in This Old House magazine April 2011, as a good neighborhood to buy an old house. { http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20469145_20917125,00.html } Fort Hamilton, an active military base near the Verrazano Bridge, houses one of the neighborhood&apos;s few cultural attractions, The Harbor Defense Museum. { Harbor Defense Museum of Fort Hamilton } Another popular neighborhood attraction is the 69th Street Pier, at Bay Ridge Ave (aka 69th Street) and Shore Road. It features a sculpture that emits a beam of light as a memorial to those who lost their lives during the terrorist attacks of September 11. This popular pier is a favorite to the local fishermen who fish there daily. Until the middle 20th century a ferry to Staten Island operated from this pier for a nickel fare. Very close to the pier is Owl&apos;s Head Park. This park was once the home of Senator Murphy of the City of Brooklyn and it was also the Bliss Estate. It is a [ 27 acre m2 on ] walking park that has a state of the art skate park, children&apos;s playground and basketball courts. Most of all, the best view of the Narrows off the West Hill. 68th Precinct, NYPD Firehouse on Third Avenue [ Politics ] Bay Ridge is a politically polarized community. Traditionally, Bay Ridge leans Republican and is recognized as politically conservative; Mike Long, Chairman of the Conservative Party of New York, resides there. However, it has been known to elect Democrats to office as well, such as City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile. Bay Ridge is represented in the New York State Senate by Republican Marty Golden, and New York State Assembly by Republican Nicole Malliotakis and Democrat Alec Brook-Krasny. Republican Michael Grimm was elected to represent the community in Congress in 2010. The neighborhood is served by Brooklyn Community Board 10. Development is a passionate issue for Bay Ridge residents, as in recent years they saw many of the decades-old two-family houses being demolished, replaced by condominiums known colloquially as &quot; Fedder Homes, &quot; after the branded air conditioners poking out from the buildings&apos; facades. In 2005, local community leaders and community activists from across the political spectrum united to issue rezoning laws. [ History ] Bay Ridge was originally known as Yellow Hook for the hue of the yellowish soil observed by the original Dutch settlers. { Forgotten New York } This name was changed in 1853 after yellow fever struck the area and residents realized what an ill fit it was, given the circumstances. { Owl&apos;s Head Park - Historical Sign } [ If You&apos;re Thinking of Living In Red Hook; Isolated Brooklyn Area Starts to Awaken Aaron Donovan http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9C0CE3DF1F3FF933A25755C0A9679C8B63 The New York Times June 10, 2001 August 27, 2010 ] The new name was given due to the proximity of the neighborhood to New York Bay, excellent views of which were visible from the ridge that has now become Ridge Boulevard. These views attracted wealthy people, who built extravagant summer homes along Shore Road overlooking the water, many of which are still standing today and worth multiple-millions of dollars. [ If You&apos;re Thinking of Living In Bay Ridge Brenda Fowler http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-of-living-in-bay-ridge.html The New York Times July 26, 1987 August 27, 2010 ] Once the 4th Avenue Subway (now the R line ) was extended in 1915, however, many Manhattan workers looking for quieter surroundings began to flow in, transforming the area into a middle-class neighborhood. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many Norwegian and Danish sailors emigrated to Brooklyn, many specifically to Bay Ridge. Lapskaus Boulevard was the nickname of 8th Avenue, located in an historically Norwegian working class neighborhood of Bay Ridge. Nordic heritage is still apparent in some sections of the neighborhood. For instance, there is an annual Norwegian Constitution Day Parade, also known as the Syttende Mai Parade, featuring hundreds of people in folk dress who parade along Fifth Avenue. The parade ends in Leif Ericson Park where &quot; Miss Norway &quot; is crowned near the statue of Leif Ericson. The statue was donated by Crown Prince Olav, Prince of Norway on behalf of the nation of Norway in 1939. { Leif Ericson Park &amp; Square (New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation) } { 17th of May Parade (Norwegian-American 17th May Committee of Greater New York) } Construction of The Verrazano Bridge, which connects Bay Ridge to Staten Island, was completed in 1964. Though now a totemic structure beloved by many, it was bitterly opposed by residents upon the announcement of its construction, for it would require the demolition of many homes. In a rare loss for local activists, the challenges failed: the bridge was built and the homes destroyed. The area of the neighborhood around Ovington Avenue (aka 70th Street) was once known as &quot; Ovington Village &quot;; it was ultimately swallowed up as Bay Ridge. Also destroyed was Fort Lafayette, part of New York City &apos;s defense system along with Fort Hamilton and Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island, replaced by the base of the bridge&apos;s east tower. { The definitive history of the building of the bridge is Gay Talese&apos;s &apos;&apos;The Bridge&apos;&apos; } The 2007 Brooklyn tornado hit this area, specifically 68th and 69th streets between 3rd and 4th avenues. { Photos and a story of the aftermath of the Bay Ridge tornado } Eleven houses had to be vacated after they suffered significant damage, and many of the trees on the two blocks toppled, landing on cars and stoops. The 4th Avenue Presbyterian Church had its very large stained glass window blown out. { Bay Ridge Tornado: Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church } As the tornado lifted, it peeled the roof of a nearby Nissan dealership and deforested 40% of Leif Ericson Park. The tornado has been rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds between 111 and 135 MPH. [ That Wind That Left Part of Brooklyn Upside Down? It Was a Tornado, All Right Andy Newman http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/09/nyregion/09wind.html The New York Times August 9, 2007 August 27, 2010 ] The Senator Street Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. [ 2009a ] The Houses at 216-264 Ovington Ave. was listed in 2007. [ Transportation ] { From harbor } The area is served by the train of the Fourth Avenue line of the New York City Subway, with stations at Bay Ridge Avenue, 77th Street, 86th Street and 95th Street. Additionally, there is MTA express bus route x27, which mainly serves for the commute to Manhattan, but also runs during off-peak hours on weekdays. Many Bay Ridge commuters opt for the relative comfort and convenience of the express bus. Bay Ridge is readily accessible by car, encircled by the Belt Parkway and Gowanus Expressway. [ Landmarks and points of interest ] Step Streets are streets that are composed entirely of steep steps. As a rule they were placed on hills that were too steep to build a road, yet in a rare concession to pedestrians, it was determined to allow them access to the streets denied to motor transportation &quot;, at 74th and 76th Streets, recalling the Montmartre section of Paris. Step Streets, accessed February 26, 2007 Owl&apos;s Head Park (also known as Bliss Park), in the neighborhood&apos;s northwest corner, was previously the private estate of the Bliss Family, the namesake for nearby Bliss Terrace. Before them, the property was owned by Henry C. Murphy, a United States senator for whom the nearby Senator Street is named. Remnants of their estate were still visible into the 1970s, when they were finally demolished, having fallen into considerable disrepair. The park has a dog run and the first concrete skatepark built in Brooklyn. Project of the Month September 2001; Millennium Skate Park Owl&apos;s Head Park 69th Street Pier 69th Street Pier at 69th St. and Shore Road, is the community&apos;s key seaside recreation spot. Sports fishermen travel across the borough and from the other boroughs to fish the waters of &quot; The Bay Ridge Anchorage &quot; and along the seawall promenade that runs south from the pier to the Verrazano Narrows Bridge and east along Gravesend Bay. Years prior to the construction of the bridge, commuter ferry service was operated between this Bay Ridge pier and the St. George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island. Farrell House, which has been at 125 95th St. since the early twentieth century, is one of many old mansions in Bay Ridge, and it is now an official landmark. An accompanying structure, thought to have been used as a barn, was unable to be saved and was demolished. Legend has it the house was turned so that its &quot; widow&apos;s walk, &quot; a balcony that traditionally faces the sea so women left at home could watch for their husbands&apos; ships, would no longer face The Narrows.
