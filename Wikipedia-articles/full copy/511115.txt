Publication bias is a bias with regard to what is likely to be published, among what is available to be published. Not all bias is inherently problematic, for instance, a bias against publishing lies is a good bias, but one very problematic, and much discussed bias is the tendency of research ers, editors, and pharmaceutical companies to handle the reporting of experimental results that are positive (i.e. showing a significant finding) differently from results that are negative (i.e. supporting the null hypothesis ) or inconclusive, leading to a misleading bias in the overall published literature. Such bias occurs despite the fact that studies with significant results do not appear to be superior to studies with a null result with respect to quality of design. [ Easterbrook P. J. Berlin J. A. Gopalan R. Matthews D. R. Publication bias in clinical research Lancet 1991 337 8746 867–872 10.1016/0140-6736(91)90201-Y 1672966 ] It has been found that statistically significant results are three times more likely to be published than papers affirming a null result. [ Dickersin K. Chan S. Chalmers T. C. et al. Publication bias and clinical trials Controlled Clin Trials 1987 8 4 343–353 10.1016/0197-2456(87)90155-3 ] It also has been found that the most common reason for non-publication is an investigator&apos;s declining to submit results for publication (because of the investigator&apos;s loss of interest in the topic, the investigator&apos;s anticipation that others will not be interested in null results, etc.), underlining researchers&apos; role in publication bias phenomena. In an effort to decrease this problem, some prominent medical journal s require registration of a trial before it commences so that unfavorable results are not withheld from publication. Several such registries exist, but researchers are often unaware of them. In addition, attempts to identify unpublished studies have proved very difficult and often unsatisfactory. Another strategy suggested by a meta-analysis is caution in the use of small and non-randomised clinical trials because of their demonstrated high susceptibility to error and bias. [ Definition ] According to one publication: [ K. Dickersin The existence of publication bias and risk factors for its occurrence JAMA 1990 March 263 10 1385–1359 2406472 10.1001/jama.263.10.1385 ] Positive results bias, a type of publication bias, occurs when authors are more likely to submit, or editors accept, positive than null (negative or inconclusive) results. [ D.L. Sackett Bias in analytic research J Chronic Dis 1979 32 1–2 447779 51–63 10.1016/0021-9681(79)90012-2 ] A related term, &quot; the file drawer problem &quot;, refers to the tendency for negative or inconclusive results to remain unpublished by their authors. [ Robert Rosenthal Robert Rosenthal (psychologist) The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results Psychological Bulletin 1979 May 86 3 638–641 http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/86/3/638 10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638 ] Outcome reporting bias occurs when several outcomes within a trial are measured but are reported selectively depending on the strength and direction of those results. A related term that has been coined is HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). [ N.L. Kerr HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known Personality and Social Psychology Review 1998 2 3 196–217 http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN%3D048343521%26amp%3BETOC%3DRN%26amp%3Bfrom%3Dsearchengine 10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4 15647155 ] [ File drawer effect ] The file drawer effect, or file drawer problem, is that many studies in a given area of research may be conducted but never reported, and those that are not reported may on average report different results from those that are reported. An extreme scenario is that a given null hypothesis of interest is in fact true, i.e. the association being studied does not exist, but the 5% of studies that by chance show a statistically significant result are published, while the remaining 95% where the null hypothesis was not rejected languish in researchers&apos; file drawers. Even a small number of studies lost &quot; in the file drawer &quot; can result in a significant bias. [ Jeffrey D. Scargle Publication Bias: The &quot; File-Drawer Problem &quot; in Scientific Inference http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_14_1_scargle.pdf Journal of Scientific Exploration 14 2 94–106 2000 ] The term was coined by the psychologist Robert Rosenthal in 1979. [ The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results Rosenthal Robert Psychological Bulletin 1979 86 638–641 10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638 3 ] [ Effect on meta-analysis ] The effect of this is that published studies may not be truly representative of all valid studies undertaken, and this bias may distort meta-analyses and systematic review s of large numbers of studies—on which evidence-based medicine, for example, increasingly relies. The problem may be particularly significant when the research is sponsored by entities that may have a financial or ideological interest in achieving favorable results. Those undertaking meta-analyses and systematic reviews need to take account of publication bias in the methods they use for identifying the studies to include in the review. Among other techniques to minimize the effects of publication bias, they may need to perform a thorough search for unpublished studies, and to use such analytical tools as a Begg&apos;s funnel plot or Egger&apos;s plot to quantify the potential presence of publication bias. Tests for publications bias rely on the underlying theory that small studies with small sample size (and large variance) would be more prone to publication bias, while large-scale studies would be less likely to escape public knowledge and more likely to be published regardless of significance of findings. Thus, when overall estimates are plotted against the variance (sample size), a symmetrical funnel is usually formed in the absence of publication bias, while a skewed asymmetrical funnel is observed in presence of potential publication bias. Extending the funnel plot, the &quot; Trim and Fill &quot; method has also been suggested as a method to infer the existence of unpublished hidden studies, as determined from a funnel plot, and subsequently correct the meta-analysis by imputing the presence of missing studies to yield an unbiased pooled estimate. [ Examples ] One study { Zhenglun Pan, Thomas A. Trikalinos, Fotini K. Kavvoura, Joseph Lau, } { John P.A. Ioannidis, &quot; Local literature bias in genetic epidemiology: An empirical evaluation of the Chinese literature &quot;. } { PLoS Medicine, 2(12):e334, 2005 December. } compared Chinese and non-Chinese studies of gene-disease associations and found that &quot; Chinese studies in general reported a stronger gene-disease association and more frequently a statistically significant result &quot;. { Jin Ling Tang, &quot; Selection Bias in Meta-Analyses of Gene-Disease Associations &quot;, } { PLoS Medicine, 2(12):e409, 2005 December. } One possible interpretation of this result is selective publication (publication bias). [ Risks ] According to John Ioannidis, negative papers are most likely to be suppressed: [ Ioannidis J John P. A. Ioannidis Why most published research findings are false PLoS Med 2 8 e124 2005 16060722 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 1182327 ] when the studies conducted in a field are smaller when effect sizes are smaller when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Ioannidis further asserts that &quot; claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias &quot;. [ Remedies ] Ioannidis&apos; remedies include: Low-bias meta-analysis Large studies where they can be expected to give very definitive results or test major, general concepts { Enhanced research standards including } Pre-registration of protocols (as for randomized trials) Registration or networking of data collections within fields (as in fields where researchers are expected to generate hypotheses after collecting data) Adopting from randomized controlled trials the principles of developing and adhering to a protocol. { Considering, before running an experiment, what they believe the chances are that they are testing a true or non-true relationship. } [ Assessing the Probability That a Positive Report is False: An Approach for Molecular Epidemiology Studies http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/96/6/434 March 2004 96 6 434–42 10.1093/jnci/djh075 Wacholder, S.
