[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 0436979 } [ 3 ] Jeffersonville ( [ icon ˈ dʒ ɛ f ər s ən v ɪ l ] ) is a city in Clark County, Indiana, along the Ohio River. Locally, the city is often referred to by the abbreviated name Jeff. It is directly across the Ohio River to the north of Louisville, Kentucky along I-65. The population was 44,953 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of Clark County. [ 6 ] [ History ] [ Old Jeffersonville Historic District ] { Warder Park honoring } { Thomas Jefferson } [ Antebellum ] In 1786 Fort Finney was situated where the Kennedy Bridge is today to protect the area from Indians, and a settlement grew around the fort. The fort was renamed in 1791 to Fort Steuben in honor of Baron von Steuben. In 1793 the fort was abandoned. Precisely when the settlement became known as Jeffersonville is unclear, but it was probably around 1801, the year in which President Thomas Jefferson took office. [ http://www.cityofjeff.net/history/historymain.htm Official History of Jeffersonville Cityofjeff.net 2010-07-28 ] In 1802 local residents used a grid pattern designed by Thomas Jefferson for the formation of a city. On September 13, 1803, a post office was established in the city. In 1808 Indiana&apos;s second federal land sale office was established in Jeffersonville, which initiated a growth in settling in Indiana that was further spurred by the end of the War of 1812. Shortly after formation, Jeffersonville was named to be the county seat of Clark County in 1802, replacing Springville. In 1812 Charlestown was named the county seat, but the county seat returned to Jeffersonville in 1878, where it remains. In 1813 and 1814 Jeffersonville was briefly the de facto capital of the Indiana Territory, as then-governor Thomas Posey disliked then-capital Corydon, and wanting to be closer to his personal physician in Louisville, decided to live in Jeffersonville. However, it is debated by some that Dennis Pennington had some involvement to his location to Jeffersonville. { Life of Walter Quintin Gresham, 1832-1895 By Matilda Gresham (Rand, McNally &amp; company 1919) page 23-23 } The territorial legislature remained in Corydon and communicated with Posey by messenger. [ Civil War ] { The } { American Civil War increased the importance of Jeffersonville. Jeffersonville was one of the principal gateways to the South during the Civil War, due to its being directly across from Louisville. It was served by three railroads from the north and had the waterway of the } { Ohio River. Naturally, this influenced its selection as one of the principal bases for supplies and troops for the } { Union Army. Operating in the South, the } { Louisville and Nashville Railroad furnished the connecting link between Louisville and the rest of the South. } { Camp Joe Holt } [ http://www.indianahistory.org/library/manuscripts/collection_guides/P0300.html Camp Joe Holt Indiana History 2010-07-28 ] { was instrumental in keeping Kentucky within the Union. The third largest } { American Civil War hospital, } { Jefferson General Hospital was located in nearby } { Port Fulton (now within Jeffersonville) from 1864–1866, as it was close to the river and Louisville. The original land was seized by the Government from the Honorable } { Jesse D. Bright, United States Senator, a sympathizer of the } { Confederate cause. During the war it housed 16,120 patients in its 5,200 beds and was under the command of Dr. Middleton Goldsmith. A cemetery was built for fallen soldiers down the hill, but the wooden grave markers by 1927 had rotted away, causing the Jeffersonville city council to build a ball field over the cemetery, and not bothering to move the graves, located on Crestview Avenue. The } { Jeffersonville Quartermaster Intermediate Depot had its first beginning in the early days of the Civil War, near its present location. } [ 1900s ] By 1870 17% of Jeffersonville residents were foreign-born. Most of these were from Germany.During the 1920s, Jeffersonville was a popular gathering place for the Ku Klux Klan, as Louisville and New Albany had strong anti-KKK laws and Jeffersonville didn&apos;t. City Hall in the Quadrangle complex Gambling in the 1930s and 1940s was instrumental in Jeffersonville&apos;s recovery from the Great Depression and the Flood of 1937. Casinos, betting parlors, night clubs, and even a dog track were present, giving the town the nickname &quot; Little Las Vegas &quot;. After a New Albany businessman was gunned down, public sentiment turned against gambling. On January 2, 1948, Indiana State Police raided every casino in the city before the operators could warn each other, and the judge who had devoted the past nine years in eliminating gambling from Jeffersonville, James L. Bottorff, made sure that the equipment was confiscated and the money at the casinos given to charity. This may have played a factor in keeping Jeffersonville residents from voting to approve riverboat gambling in the 1990s. In 2006 riverboat gambling was approved, but for the return of gambling to occur the Indiana State legislature would either have to approve an additional riverboat, or one of the existing riverboats in Indiana would have to relocate to Jeffersonville; presumably, it would be one of the three currently serving the Cincinnati market. During World War II the Quartermaster Depot in conjunction with Fort Knox, Kentucky housed German prisoners of war until 1945. Now the Depot is used as a shopping center.

Jeffboat is the largest inland shipbuilder in the U.S. } In 1819 the first shipbuilding took place in Jeffersonville, and steamboat s would become key to Jeffersonville&apos;s economy. James Howard made his first steamboat in 1834 in Jeffersonville named the Hyperion. He established his ship building company in Jeffersonville in 1834 but later moved his business to Madison, Indiana in 1836 and remained there until 1844. He returned his business to the Jeffersonville area to its final location in Port Fulton, Indiana in 1849. In 1925 the United States Navy assumed control of the Howard Ship Yards until 1941, after Jeffersonville finally annexed Port Fulton. [ http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/lilly/mss/html/howardsh.html The Howard Ship Yards &amp; Dock Company Indiana.edu 2010-07-28 ] During the Second World War the ship yards built landing vessels like the LST. It was later established as the Jeffersonville Boat &amp; Machine Company, later simply known as Jeffboat, which still supports the local economy. [ http://www.co.clark.in.us/history.html Clark County, Indiana - History Co.clark.in.us 2010-07-28 ] The history of shipbuilding in Jeffersonville is the focus of the Howard Steamboat Museum. There was an annual festival held on the second weekend in September called Steamboat Days, but lack of participation led to its demise. [ Annexation ] On February 5, 2008 the city of Jeffersonville officially annexed four out of six planned annex zones. { Jeff absorbs 4 annexed areas (by Harold J. Adams) } { Courier Journal February 8, 2008 } Two of the zones not being annexed were put off due to law suits. The four areas annexed added about [ 5500 acre km2 ] to the city and about 4,500 citizens raising the population to an estimated 33,100. The total area planned to be annexed is [ 7800 acre km2 ]. The annexed areas receive planning and zoning, building permits and drainage issues services right away with new in-city sewer rates which are lower. Other services are being phased in such as police and fire and will work jointly with the pre-existing non-city services until they&apos;re available. { Parts of Jeffersonville annexation official (by David Mann) } { The Evening News February 8, 2008 } One of the other two areas remaining to be annexed is Oak Park, Indiana an area of about 5,000 more citizens. Just weeks after the February 5 annexation of the four plots the Clark County Courts dismissed the law suits on February 25, 2008 against the city. { Jeffersonville annexation challenge is rejected (Ben Zion Hershberg) } { Courier Journal February 26, 2008 } This dismissal of the court cases brings the remaining Oak Park area into the city. The population of the city is now expected to be nearly 50,000 citizens and is the largest annexation in Jeffersonville&apos;s history.
