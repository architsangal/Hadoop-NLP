[ the British strategy in the American Revolutionary War Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War ] { United States Census Bureau } In American politics, the Southern strategy refers to the Republican Party strategy of winning elections in Southern states by exploiting anti- African American racism and fears of lawlessness among Southern white voters and appealing to fears of growing federal power in social and economic matters (generally lumped under the concept of states&apos; rights ). Though the &quot; Solid South &quot; had been a longtime Democratic Party stronghold due to the Democratic Party&apos;s defense of slavery prior to the American Civil War and segregation for a century thereafter, many white Southern Democrats stopped supporting the party following the civil rights plank of the Democratic campaign in 1948 (triggering the Dixiecrats ), the African-American Civil Rights Movement, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, and desegregation. The strategy was first adopted under future Republican President Richard Nixon and Republican Senator Barry Goldwater [ Black &amp; Black Earl &amp; Merle Rise of the Southern Republicans 2003 Harvard University Press 442 ] in the late 1960s.

It contributed to the electoral realignment of Southern states to the Republican Party, but at the expense of losing more than ninety percent of black voters to the Democratic Party. As the twentieth century came to a close, the Republican Party began trying to appeal again to black voters, though with little success. In 2005, Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman formally apologized for his party&apos;s use of the Southern Strategy in the previous century.

[ Phillips Kevin The Emerging Republican Majority Arlington House New York 1969 2008-08-02 0-87000-058-6 18063 ] In an interview included in a 1970 New York Times article, he touched on its essence: [ Nixon&apos;s Southern strategy: &apos;It&apos;s All in the Charts&apos; Boyd James May 17, 1970 The New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf PDF 2008-08-02 ] From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don&apos;t need any more than that... but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That&apos;s where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats. Nixon campaigning in 1968 While Phillips sought to polarize ethnic voting in general, and not just to win the white South, the South was by far the biggest prize yielded by his approach. Its success began at the presidential level, gradually trickling down to statewide offices, the Senate, and the House, as some legacy segregationist Democrats retired or switched to the GOP. In addition, the Republican Party worked for years to develop grassroots political organizations across the South, supporting candidates for local school boards and offices, as one example. Following the Watergate scandal, there was broad support for the Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election. From 1948 to 1984 the Southern states, traditionally a stronghold for the Democrats, became key swing state s, providing the popular vote margins in the 1960, 1968 and 1976 elections. During this era, several Republican candidates expressed support for states&apos; rights, which some critics claim was a &quot; codeword &quot; of opposition to federal enforcement of civil rights for blacks and intervention on their behalf, including passage of legislation to protect the franchise.

In The End of Southern Exceptionalism, Johnston and Shafer wrote that the Republicans&apos; gains in the South corresponded to the growth of the upper middle class in that region. They suggested that such individuals believed their economic interests were better served by the Republicans than the Democrats. According to Johnston and Shafer, working-class white voters in the South continued to vote for Democrats for national office until the 1990s.

[ http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Dave Leip&apos;s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections Uselectionatlas.org January 22, 2012 ] In recent years, the term &quot; Southern strategy &quot; has been used in a more general sense, referring to the way in which political parties use cultural themes in election campaigns — primarily but not exclusively in the American South. In the past, politicians&apos; highlighting of issues such as busing or states&apos; rights appealed to white angst about integration. More recently, Republican politicians made appeals to &quot; conservative values &quot;, and used cultural issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and religion to mobilize their base. This has also been viewed as the &quot; Southernization &quot; of American politics. [ 19th century disfranchisement and rise of the Solid South ] [ Solid South ] After the American Civil War, southern states gained additional seats in the House of Representatives and representation in the Electoral College because freed slaves were granted full citizenship and suffrage. Southern white resentment stemming from the Civil War and the Republican Party’s policy of Reconstruction kept most southern whites in the Democratic Party, but the Republicans could compete in the South with a coalition of freedmen, Unionists and highland whites. Rising intimidation and violence by white paramilitary groups such as the White League and Red Shirts who supported the Democratic Party during the mid to late-1870s contributed to the turning out Republican officeholders and suppression of the black vote. { George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132 } After the North agreed to withdraw federal troops under the Compromise of 1877, white Democrats used a variety of tactics to reduce voting by African Americans and poor whites. { Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War, New York: Farrar Strauss &amp; Giroux, Paperback, 2007, pp.74-80 } In the 1880s they began to pass legislation making election processes more complicated. Although the Fourteenth Amendment reduced the Congressional representation of states that denied votes to their adult male citizens, this provision was never enforced. { Harper&apos;s Weekly &apos;&apos; criticizing the use of literacy tests. It shows Uncle Sam writing on the wall, &quot; Eddikashun qualifukashun. The Blak man orter be eddikated afore he kin vote with us Wites. Mr. Solid South. &quot; } From 1890 to 1908, the white Democratic legislatures in every Southern state enacted new constitutions or amendments with provisions to disenfranchise most blacks [ Zinn Howard A People&apos;s History of the United States 1999 HarperCollins New York 0-06-052842-7 205–210,449 ] and tens of thousands of poor whites. Provisions required complicated processes for poll taxes, residency, literacy tests, and other requirements which were subjectively applied against blacks. As blacks lost their vote, the Republican Party lost its ability to effectively compete.

Effectively, Southern white Democrats controlled all the votes of the expanded population by which Congressional apportionment was figured. Many of their representatives achieved powerful positions of seniority in Congress, giving them control of chairmanships of Congressional committees. Because African Americans could not be voters, they were prevented from being jurors and serving in local offices. Services and institutions for them in the segregated South were chronically underfunded. { &quot; Beginnings of black education &quot;, The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia. Virginia Historical Society. Retrieved April 12, 2009. } During this period, Republicans held only a few House seats from the South. Between 1880 and 1904, Republican presidential candidates in the South received between 35 and 40 percent of that section&apos;s vote (except in 1892, when the 16 percent for the Populists knocked Republicans down to 25 percent). From 1904 to 1948, Republicans received more than 30 percent of the section&apos;s votes only in the 1920 (35.2 percent, carrying Tennessee) and 1928 elections (47.7 percent, carrying five states). The only important political role of the South in presidential elections came in the 1912 election, when it provided the delegates to select Taft over Theodore Roosevelt in that year&apos;s Republican convention. During this period, Republicans regularly supported anti- lynching bills, which were filibustered by Southern Democrats in the Senate, and appointed a few blacks to office. In the 1928 election, the Republican candidate Herbert Hoover rode the issues of prohibition and anti-Catholicism [ Dobbs Ricky Floyd Continuities in American anti-Catholicism: the Texas Baptist Standard and the coming of the 1960 election. http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Continuities%2Bin%2BAmerican%2Banti-Catholicism%3A%2Bthe%2BTexas%2BBaptist%2BStandard...-a0162618834 Baptist History and Heritage January 1, 2007 http://www.webcitation.org/64t913Kud January 22, 2012 no ] to carry five former Confederate states, with 62 of the 126 electoral votes of the section. After his victory, Hoover attempted to build up the Republican Party of the South, transferring patronage away from blacks and toward the same kind of white Protestant businessmen who made up the core of the Northern Republican Party. With the onset of the Great Depression, which severely impacted the South, Hoover soon became extremely unpopular. The gains of the Republican Party in the South were lost. In the 1932 election, Hoover received only 18.1 percent of the Southern vote for re-election. [ WWII and population changes ] In the 1948 election, after Harry Truman had desegregated the Army, a group of Southern Democrats known as Dixiecrats split from the Democratic Party in reaction to the inclusion of a civil rights plank in the party&apos;s platform. This followed a floor fight led by Minneapolis mayor (and soon-to-be senator ) Hubert Humphrey. The disaffected Democrats formed the States&apos; Rights Democratic, or Dixiecrat Party, and nominated Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for president. Thurmond carried four southern states in the general election: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. The main plank of the States&apos; Rights Democratic Party was maintaining segregation and Jim Crow in the South. The Dixiecrats, failing to deny the Democrats the presidency in 1948, soon dissolved, but the split lingered. In 1964, Thurmond was one of the first conservative southern Democrats to switch to the Republican Party. [ May 2011 ] In addition to the splits in the Democratic Party, the population movements associated with World War II had a significant effect on the makeup of the South. More than 5 million African Americans migrated from the South to the North and West in the second Great Migration lasting from 1940-1970. Starting before WWII, many took jobs in the defense industry in California and major industrial cities of the Midwest. [ May 2011 ] Changes in industry, growth in universities and the military establishment in turn attracted Northern transplants to the South, and bolstered the base of the Republican Party. In the post-war Presidential campaigns, Republicans did best in the fastest-growing states of the South with the most Northern settlers. In the 1952, 1956 and 1960 elections, Virginia, Tennessee and Florida went Republican all three times, while Louisiana went Republican in 1956, and Texas twice voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower and once for John F. Kennedy. In 1956, Eisenhower received 48.9 percent of the Southern vote, becoming only the second Republican in history (after Ulysses S. Grant ) to get a plurality of Southern votes. [ May 2011 ] The states of the Deep South remained loyal to the Democratic Party, which had not officially repudiated segregation. Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and North Carolina actually lost Congressional seats from the 1950s to the 1970s, while South Carolina, Louisiana and Georgia remained static. [ May 2011 ] The &quot; Year of Birmingham &quot; in 1963 highlighted racial issues in Alabama. Through the spring, there were marches and demonstrations to end legal segregation. The Movement&apos;s achievements in settlement with the local business class were overshadowed by bombings and murders by the Ku Klux Klan, most notoriously in the deaths of four girls in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. [ McWhorter Diane Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution Simon &amp; Schuster New York 2001 2008-08-02 0-684-80747-5 45376386 ] After the Democrat George Wallace was elected as Governor of Alabama, he helped link the concept of states&apos; rights and segregation, both in speeches and by creating crises to provoke Federal intervention. He opposed integration at the University of Alabama, and collaborated with the Ku Klux Klan in disrupting court-ordered integration of public schools in Birmingham in 1963. { Barry Goldwater won his home state of Arizona and five states in the } { Deep South, depicted in red.

Goldwater was notably more conservative than previous Republican nominees, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower. Goldwater&apos;s principal opponent in the primary election, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, was widely seen as representing the more moderate (and pro-Civil Rights) Northern wing of the party (see Rockefeller Republican, Goldwater republican ). In the 1964 presidential campaign, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign which broadly opposed strong action by the federal government. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [ http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21 Finduslaw.com January 22, 2012 ] His stance was based on his view that the act was an intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of states and, second, that the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do business, or not, with whomever they chose. All this appealed to white Southern Democrats, and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of the Deep South states (Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina) since Reconstruction. However, Goldwater&apos;s vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (other than the South, Goldwater only won in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964. A Lyndon B. Johnson ad called &quot; Confessions of a Republican, &quot; which ran in the North, associated Goldwater with the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Johnson’s campaign in the Deep South publicized Goldwater’s full history on civil rights. In the end, Johnson swept the election. Goldwater’s position was at odds with most of the prominent members of the Republican Party, dominated by so-called Eastern Establishment and Midwestern Progressives. A higher percentage of the Republican Party supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did the Democratic Party, as they had on all previous Civil Rights legislation. The Southern Democrats mostly opposed their Northern Party mates — and their presidents (Kennedy and Johnson) on civil rights issues. In some Republican circles, the election after the 1964 Civil Rights act was termed, &quot; The Great Betrayal &quot;. Even though some Republicans paid a price with white voters — in some cases losing seats — black voters did not return to the Republican fold. Indeed, in some cases, notably the re-election of Senator Al Gore Sr., a majority of black voters cast their votes for a man who voted against the Civil Rights Act. [ Roots of the Southern strategy ] Lyndon Johnson was concerned that his endorsement of Civil Rights legislation would endanger his party in the South. { Risen, Clay (March 5, 2006). &quot; How the South was won &quot;. The Boston Globe. Retrieved 2007-02-11 } In the 1968 election, Richard Nixon saw the cracks in the Solid South as an opportunity to tap into a group of voters who had long been beyond the reach of the Republican Party. Republican Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts replaced King as the most prominent black leadership. By this point, King had won the Nobel Peace Prize and founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. His death was followed by rioting by African Americans in inner-city areas in major cities throughout the country. King’s policy of non-violence had already been challenged by other African-American leaders such as John Lewis and Stokely Carmichael of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The notion of Black Power advocated by SNCC leaders was quite effective in altering the mood of African-Americans. This attitude did much to raise the expectations of African Americans and also raised racial tensions. { Zinn, Howard (1999) A People&apos;s History of the United States New York:HarperCollins, 457-461 } Journalists reporting about the demonstrations against the Vietnam War often featured young people engaging in violence or burning draft cards and American flags. { Zinn, Howard (1999) A People&apos;s History of the United States New York:HarperCollins, 491 } There were also many young adults engaged in the drug culture and &quot; free love &quot; (sexual promiscuity ), in what was called the &quot; hippie &quot; counter-culture. These actions scandalized many Americans and created a concern about law and order. Alabama Governor George Wallace With the aid of Harry Dent and South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, who had switched parties in 1964, Richard Nixon ran his 1968 campaign on states&apos; rights and &quot; law and order. &quot; Many liberals accused Nixon of pandering to Southern whites, especially with regard to his &quot; states&apos; rights &quot; and &quot; law and order &quot; stands.

Nixon picked up Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, while Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey &apos;s only southern state was Texas. Writer Jeffrey Hart who worked on the Nixon campaign as a speechwriter says that Nixon did not have a &quot; Southern Strategy &quot; but &quot; Border State Strategy &quot; as the campaign ceded the Deep South to George Wallace and that the press merely call it a &quot; Southern Strategy &quot; as they are &quot; very lazy &quot;.

He won over 65 percent of the votes in the other states of the former Confederacy. Nixon won 36% of the black vote nationwide. Despite his appeal to Southern whites, Nixon parlayed a wide perception as a moderate into wins in other states. He took a solid majority in the electoral college. He was able to appear moderate to most Americans because the Southern strategy referred to integration obliquely through references to states&apos; rights and busing. This tactic was later described by liberals in the media as &quot; dog-whistle politics. &quot; [ Greenberg David Dog-Whistling Dixie: When Reagan said &quot; states&apos; rights, &quot; he was talking about race. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html Slate November 20, 2007 http://www.webcitation.org/64tCNJh08 January 22, 2012 no ] [ Evolution ] As civil rights grew more accepted throughout the nation, basing a general election strategy on appeals to &quot; states&apos; rights &quot; that some would believe to be a play against civil rights laws would have resulted in a national backlash.

Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong. &quot; [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html RNC Chief to Say It Was &apos;Wrong&apos; to Exploit Racial Conflict for Votes Allen Mike July 14, 2005 Washington Post 2008-08-02 http://www.webcitation.org/64tEumSuH January 22, 2012 no ] [ Benedetto Richard GOP: &apos;We were wrong&apos; to play racial politics http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-14-GOP-racial-politics_x.htm January 22, 2012 USA Today July 14, 2005 ] [ Recent comments on Southernization and Southern strategy ] Some commentators considered the decisive victory of Democratic Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election to represent the decline of Southernization in national politics: &quot; The region’s absence from Mr. Obama’s winning formula means it&apos;s becoming distinctly less important,&apos; said Wayne Parent, a political scientist at Louisiana State University. &quot; “I think that [Southernization]’s absolutely over,” said Thomas Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who argued prophetically that the Democrats could win national elections without the South. He noted that the Republicans had become &quot; a Southernized party. &quot; Merle Black, an expert on the region’s politics at Emory University in Atlanta, said the Republican Party went too far in appealing to the South, alienating voters elsewhere. &quot; [ See also ] Solid South Bible Belt Conservative Coalition Politics of the Southern United States Racism in the United States [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Further reading ] Joseph A.
