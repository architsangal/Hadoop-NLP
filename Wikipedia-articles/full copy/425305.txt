[ 1655007 Santa Monica Mountains 2009-05-03 ] [ Geography ] The range extends approximately 40  mi (64  km) east-west from the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles to Point Mugu in Ventura County. The southern mountains form a barrier between the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin, separating &quot; the Valley &quot; on the north and west-central Los Angeles on the south; and the northern mountains separate the Conejo Valley from Malibu. The Santa Monica Mountains are parallel to Santa Susana Mountains, which are located directly north of the mountains across the San Fernando Valley. [ Los Angeles River ] [ Los Angeles River ] The southwestern branch of the headwaters of the Los Angeles River are in the Santa Monica Mountains. Beginning at the western end of the San Fernando Valley the river runs to the north of the mountains. After passing between the range and the Verdugo Mountains it flows south around Elysian Park defining the easternmost extent of the mountains. [ Geology ] Geologists consider the northern Channel Islands to be a westward extension of the Santa Monicas into the Pacific Ocean. The range was created by repeated episodes of uplifting and submergence by the Raymond Fault that created complex layers of sedimentary rock. Volcanic instrusions have been exposed, including the poorly named, andesitic, { http://www.nps.gov/samo/naturescience/volcanoes.htm } &quot; Sandstone Peak &quot; the highest in the range at 948 meters (3,111  ft.). Malibu Creek, which eroded its own channel while the mountains were slowly uplifted, bisects the mountain range. [ Climate ] The Santa Monica Mountains have dry, warm to humid summers and wet, mild to cool winters. In the summer, the climate is quite dry, which makes the range prone to wildfire s. Snow is unusual in the Santa Monica Mountains, since they are not as high as the nearby San Gabriel Mountains. On January 17, 2007, an unusually cold storm brought snow in the Santa Monica Mountains. Malibu picked up three inches (eight centimeters) of snow - the first measurable snow in five decades (50 years). Snow was reported on Boney Peak, in the winter of 2005; and in March 2006, snow also fell on the summit of the mountain. Snow also fell on the peak of Boney Mountain in late December 2008. [ Archeology ] The Santa Monica Mountains have more than 1,000 archeology sites of significance, primarily from the Californian Native American cultures of the Tongva and Chumash people. The mountains were part of their regional homelands for over eight thousand years before (and after) the arrival of the Spanish invaders, known as the Spanish colonizers. { USA Today article. access date: 5/20/2010 } They mostly became extinct after USA annexation of the area. [ Parks ] Much of the mountains are located within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Preservation of lands within the region are managed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the National Park Service, the California State Parks, and County and Municipal agencies. Today, the Santa Monica Mountains face pressure from local populations as a desirable residential area, and in the parks as a recreational retreat and wild place that&apos;s increasingly rare in urban Los Angeles. [ Regional parks ] Over twenty individual state and municipal parks are in the Santa Monica Mountains, including: Topanga State Park, Leo Carrillo State Park, Malibu Creek State Park, Point Mugu State Park, Will Rogers State Historic Park, Point Dume State Beach, Griffith Park, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park, Charmlee Wilderness Park, Franklin Canyon Park, Runyon Canyon Park, King Gillette Ranch Park, and Paramount Ranch Park. [ Griffith Park ] [ Griffith Park Elysian Park ] At the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains are Griffith Park and lastly Elysian Park. Griffith Park is separated from the rest of the Santa Monica Mountains to the west by the Cahuenga Pass, over which the 101 Freeway passes from the San Fernando Valley into Hollywood. Elysian Park is in the easternmost part of the mountains and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east and Downtown Los Angeles nearby to the south. [ Flora and fauna ] [ Fauna ] [ :Category:Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands ] The range is host to an immense variety of wildlife, from mountain lion s to the endangered steelhead. The Mountain lion population within the Santa Monica Mountains (which includes the Simi Hills &amp; Santa Susana Pass) is severely depleted with only 7 known living adult individuals. The primary cause of the decline is due to a combination of traffic related mortality (3 from the area were killed within a matter of months,) anti-coagulants ingested from human poisoned prey (2 individuals within the Simi Hills) and attacks by other, more dominant mountain lions (an elder male, known as P1, killed both his son and his mate, this is thought to be due to a reduction in available habitat.) Snakes are common but only occasionally seen- the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake (the only venomous species), Mountain Kingsnake, California Kingsnake, Gopher snake, and Garter snake. The mountains are also home to the Western fence lizard. [ Flora ] [ Flora of the Santa Monica Mountains ] See also: Flora of California chaparral and woodlands and California native plants The Santa Monica Mountains are in the California chaparral and woodlands Ecoregion, and includes the California oak woodland and Southern coastal sage scrub plant community, and are covered by hundreds of local plant species, some of which are very rare or endemic, and others which are widespread and have become popular horticultural ornamentals. The California Black Walnut (Juglans californica), endemic to California, grows on the northern side of the mountains in the Valley and Griffith Park. [ Invasive species ] See also: Invasive species Many invasive weeds have colonized the mountain habitats, such as annual Mediterranean grasses, Spanish Broom (Genista juncea), and Yellow Starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). In creekside riparian habitats are found plants such as Giant Cane (Arundo donax), German Ivy (Delairea odorata), Blue Periwinkle (Vinca major), and Ivy (Hedera spp.). The New Zealand mud snail has infested watersheds in the Santa Monica Mountains, posing serious threats to native species and complicating efforts to improve stream-water quality for the endangered steelhead trout. Within a period of four years, the snails have expanded from their first known population in Medea Creek in Agoura Hills to nearly 30 other stream sites. Researchers at the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission believe that the snails&apos; expansion may have been expedited after the mollusks traveled from stream to stream on the gear of contractors and volunteers. { Hard-to-kill snails infest Santa Monica Mountain watersheds Even Formula 409 has proven ineffective at destroying the New Zealand mudsnail, an asexually reproducing invasive species that poses a threat to steelhead restoration efforts and native creatures. } [ Roads and access ] Cahuenga Pass, present-day site of U.S. Route 101, is the easiest pass through the range connecting the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley. In the 1800s, two battles were fought there, and the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed nearby. In the heyday of Hollywood movie studios clustered on both sides of it. Sepulveda Pass is the main north-south pass to the west, connecting the Westside to Sherman Oaks via the San Diego Freeway ( I-405 ). Further west are Topanga Canyon Boulevard ( SR 27 ), Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Malibu Canyon Road, and Kanan Dume Road. Mulholland Drive runs much of the length of the Santa Monica Mountains, from Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills while the Mulholland Highway runs from Woodland Hills to Sequit Point at the Pacific Ocean. The eastern end of the range, located in the City of Los Angeles, is more intensively developed than the western end of the range. The city of Malibu runs between the coast and the leading mountain ridge, from Topanga Canyon in the east to Leo Carrillo State Park in the west. The term Malibu Ozarks is sometimes used derogatorily (or ironically) for the unincorporated part of Malibu beyond the leading mountain ridge and lacking an ocean view; the term is often used synonymously with &quot; 818 Malibu &quot; (referring to the less desirable San Fernando Valley telephone area code prefix). [ Santa Monica Mountains-area communities ] Communities along the north slope of the mountains include (from east to west): Studio City Sherman Oaks Encino Tarzana Woodland Hills West Hills { Calabasas } { Bell Canyon } { Agoura Hills } { Westlake Village } { Thousand Oaks } Communities along the south slope of the mountains include (from east to west): Los Feliz Hollywood Hills Bel-Air Benedict Canyon Brentwood Pacific Palisades { Beverly Hills } { the unincorporated community of } { Topanga } { Malibu } [ Rim of the Valley Trail ] The Rim of the Valley Trail is a plan in progress for accessing and connecting the parkland and recreational areas of the mountains surrounding the Conejo, San Fernando, Simi, and Crescenta Valley s. With trailheads in the mountains and valleys, it would link them via existing and new: walking, hiking, equestrian, and mountain biking trails; parklands; and conservation easement s. The Rim of the Valley project also has the goal to protect flora-fauna habitat s and wildlife corridor s between the Santa Monica Mountains and the inland ranges. { http://smmc.ca.gov/ROV%20Master%20Plan.pdf rimofthevalleytrail-master plan 6/1/2010 } { http://www.lamountains.com/PressRelease/Press%20Release%20Rim%20of%20the%20Valley.pdf www.lamountains } { Rim of the Valley Trail-update 6/6/2010 } [ Named peaks ] Sandstone Peak [ 249012 Sandstone Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 239555 Boney Mountain 2009-05-03 ] [ 240350 Castro Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 256074 Saddle Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 256035 Calabasas Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 248973 San Vicente Mountain 2009-05-03 ] [ 240673 Clarks Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 256066 Mesa Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 239988 Cahuenga Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 256033 Brents Mountain 2009-05-03 ] [ 1660901 Mount Lee 2009-05-03 ] [ 243554 Mount Hollywood 2009-05-03 ] [ 255531 La Jolla Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 244511 Laguna Peak 2009-05-03 ] [ 246337 Mugu Peak 2009-05-03 ] Named peaks in the Santa Monica Mountains Peak Height Notes US SI Sandstone Peak 3111  ft 948 m also known as Mount Allen, rising nearly a kilometer high Tri-Peaks 3010  ft 917 m Exchange Peak 2950  ft 899 m Boney Peak 2825  ft 861 m Castro Peak 2824  ft 861 m highest peak in the eastern end of the range Saddle Peak 2805  ft 855 m Calabasas Peak 2165  ft 660 m Temescal Peak 2126  ft 648 m San Vicente Mountain 1965  ft 599 m former site of a Nike missile base, now a Cold War park Clarks Peak 1965  ft 599 m Mesa Peak 1844  ft 562 m Cahuenga Peak 1820  ft 555 m Brents Mountain 1713  ft 522 m Mount Lee 1640  ft 500 m the Hollywood Sign is on the southern slope, at exactly half a kilometer high Mount Hollywood 1625  ft 495 m Mount Chapel 1622  ft 494 m Mount Bell 1587  ft 484 m La Jolla Peak 1567  ft 478 m Laguna Peak 1457  ft 444 m Mugu Peak 1266  ft 386 m the westernmost peak in the range, rising directly from the beach [ Adjacent ranges ] Chalk Hills (in Woodland Hills) Simi Hills Santa Susana Mountains Verdugo Mountains San Gabriel Mountains [ See also ] Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Parks in the Santa Monica Mountains Index: Natural history of the Santa Monica Mountains Chumash people Malibu fire (disambiguation) Mulholland Highway [ References ] [ 30em ] [ External links ] [ Santa Monica Mountains ] Official &apos;&apos;&apos;Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area&apos;&apos;&apos; (SMMNRA) website Wildflowers of the Santa Monica Mountains Outdoor LA Hiking Trails Trails and trailheads with maps and directions.
