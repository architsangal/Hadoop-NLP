BBC. Retrieved on 2011-04-09. } [ United Kingdom ] In Northern England, corned beef hash is a traditional cheap and quick dish dating back many years. Corned beef (beef treated with saltpetre ) is nearly always from a tin – and almost always imported from South America. Tinned corned beef was available more plentifully during war years when fresh meat was heavily rationed – and a staple food in the armed forces. The meal is made with tinned corned beef, stirred with browned onions, before having liquid added (either gravy or stock, or tinned tomatoes) then having lightly boiled sliced potatoes layered over the top before being browned under a hot grill. Alternatively cubed boiled potatoes are stirred in. Some recipes would add pea s or carrots. [ May 2012 ] In Scotland, the dish of &quot; stovies &quot; is very similar to hash. There are many variations on the dish, but all consist of a base of mashed or coarsely chopped potato, with onions and leftover meat, usually minced or roast beef although there are many variations including corned beef.

[ Other countries ] In Denmark, hash is known in Danish as &quot; biksemad &quot; (roughly translated, &quot; tossed together food &quot; ), and it is a traditional leftover dish usually served with a fried egg, worcestershire sauce, pickled red beet slices and ketchup or Bearnaise sauce. The meat is usually pork, and the mixture is not mashed together into a paste, but rather the ingredients are coarsely diced and readily discernible in its cooked form.

It is similar to the Danish version, but usually served with HP Sauce instead of ketchup, and sometimes with a raw egg yolk. The Swedish variety Pytt Bellman calls for adding cream to the hash and is named after Sweden&apos;s 18th century national bard Carl Michael Bellman. In Austria and perhaps more specifically Tyrol, there exists a similar dish called &quot; Gröstl &quot;, usually consisting of chopped leftover meats (often being pork sausage ), potato and onions fried with herbs (typically marjoram and parsley ) and then served topped with a fried egg. In Malaysia, a similar dish is called &quot; bergedil &quot;. It is usually made with minced meat, potatoes, and onions, fried until brown.
