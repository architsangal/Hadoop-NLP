Arm punches are notably weaker than punches in which the whole body is used. Arm punches are initially intended to hit the same side of the face by which the arm is thrown from - for example, if a left punch is thrown, the fist will make direct contact on the left side of the opponent&apos;s face. This is commonly misconstrued for a hook, which, in this case, if you strike with the left fist, you will hit the right side of your opponent&apos;s face. Backfist A backfist is performed by forming a fist and striking with the tops of the two largest knuckles. A spinning backfist is performed when the attacker swivels 360 degrees before landing the punch, adding extra momentum to the attack. The fighter will lunge and begin spinning toward the side of the opponent of which fist he or she will attack with. Simpler terms, go to the left, spin to the left and connect with the left fist and vice versa. Chambered Punch A strike commonly performed in karate, kung fu, and tae kwon do, originating from a &quot; chambered &quot; position. Cross Straight A direct straight punch similar to the jab, except delivered with the rear hand. Power is generated through the rotation of the hips.

Long Fist By tucking the fingertips against the bottom knuckle of each finger, a long fist is formed. They offer decreased strength but increased reach. The striking surface is also narrower, which allows the fist to dig between ribs and other soft target areas. Hammer Fist A compacted fist is brought down upon the target, usually using the side of the hand or wrist. Haymaker A punch in which the arm is whipped sideways from the shoulder joint with minimal elbow bend. The name is derived from the motion, which mimics the action of manually cutting hay by swinging a scythe. The most frequent and effective cause of a one-punch knockout or kill. Since a haymaker&apos;s power is derived from weight transfer and momentum instead of muscle contraction, a long windup is required to generate sufficient force. Haymakers are frequently used from a mounted position in mixed martial arts as part of the &quot; ground and pound &quot; method, as the legs cannot be used to generate power. These punches pack power, but leave the person vulnerable to a counter punch during the wind up or if the haymaker misses generally when both combatants are standing. Hook A punch involving the use of turning to aim toward the side of the head or body. Physical-Arts.com &quot; Hook Punch Technique &quot; Retrieved on June 29, 2007 Overhand A semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually when the opponent is bobbing or slipping. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power. Shovel Hook A close range punch that is halfway between a hook and an uppercut. Shovel hooks are most commonly used to strike the body at a 45 degree angle. For example, a liver shot can be done using a shovel hook. Uppercut The fist is raised vertically towards the target, usually the head or upper body. Since most guards are held with the arms in a vertical position, the uppercut can be used to avoid the opponent&apos;s attempts at blocking. Upset Punch Starts with the fist in the chambered position, with the palm facing downwards, delivered to the abdomen or solar plexus. Casting Punch This is a punch used in Sambo and MMA that starts with a forward motion of the shoulders, which causes the bent arm to whip forward to the opponent. This punch can often cause the opponent to be put in a clinch if it misses at close range. Superman punch A superman punch or diving punch is a technique used in Muay Thai, full contact karate and mixed martial arts fighting. The striker will lunge toward the opponent pushing off with the back foot punching with the opposite arm of the leg used to push off with although there may be variations depending on the fighter. The pose should resemble that of Superman, hence the name.colspan=2 (Falcon Punch) A punch where the arm is drawn all the way back to your ability, and the arm is sprung forward as fast as possible.
