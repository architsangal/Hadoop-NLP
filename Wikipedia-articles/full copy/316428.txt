The Anti-Lebanon range extends for approximately [ 150 km mi on ] in a northeast-southwest direction, running parallel to the Lebanon range on the west. The Hermon range covers an area of about 1000 square km, of which about 70  km² are under Israeli control. Most of the portion of Mount Hermon within the Golan Heights constitutes the Hermon nature reserve. The mountain forms one of the greatest geographic resources of the area. Because of its height it captures a great deal of precipitation in a very dry area of the world. The Jurassic limestone is broken by faults and solution channels to form a karst topography. Mount Hermon has seasonal winter and spring snow falls which cover all three of its peaks for most of the year. Melt water from the snow-covered mountain&apos;s western and southern bases seeps into the rock channels and pores, feeding springs at the base of the mountain, which form stream s and river s. These merge to become the Jordan River. Additionally, the runoff facilitates fertile plant life below the snow line, where vineyard s and pine, oak, and poplar tree s are abundant. The springs, and the mountain itself, are much contested by the nations of the area for the use of the water. Mount Hermon is also called the &quot; snowy mountain, &quot; the &quot; gray-haired mountain, &quot; and the &quot; mountain of snow. &quot; It is also called &quot; the eyes of the nation &quot; in Israel because its elevation makes it Israel&apos;s primary strategic early warning system.

Mount Hermon hosts the only ski resort in territory held by Israel, including a wide range of ski trails at novice, intermediate, and expert levels. It also offers additional winter family activities such as sled ding and Nordic skiing. Those who operate the Hermon Ski area live in the nearby Israeli settlement of Neve Ativ and the Druze town of Majdal Shams. The ski resort has a ski school, ski patrol, and several restaurants located at either the bottom or peak of the area. The Syrian government has plans to develop a multi-billion dollar ski resort on the slopes of the mountain. { Middle East Online } [ See also ] Hermon nature reserve Mountains in the Golan Heights First Battle of Mount Hermon Second Battle of Mount Hermon [ References ] [ External links ] Photos of Mount Hermon ski resort (in a snowless season) Map of the ski resort Home page of the ski resort Hermon, English Home page of the ski resort Hermon, Hebrew 360 degree view of Mount Hermon (Lebanese side) Category:Golan Heights Category:Great Rift Valley Category:Hebrew Bible mountains Category:Mountains of Israeli-occupied territories Category:Mountains of Lebanon Category:Mountains of Syria Category:Nature reserves in Israeli-occupied territories Category:Ski areas and resorts in Israeli-occupied territories Category:Lebanon–Syria border Category:International mountains of Asia ar:جبل الشيخ bg:Ермон ca:Hermon cs:Hermon cy:Mynydd Hermon da:Hermonbjerget de:Hermon et:Hermoni mägi es:Monte Hermón eo:Monto Hermono eu:Hermon fr:Mont Hermon hr:Planina Hermon id:Gunung Hermon it:Monte Hermon he:הר חרמון ka:ჰერმონი lad:Monte Hermon lt:Hermono kalnas nl:Hermonberg ja:ヘルモン山 no:Hermonfjellet pnb:ماؤنٹ ہرمن pl:Hermon pt:Monte Hérmon ru:Хермон fi:Hermonvuori sv:Hermon tr:Hermon Dağı uk:Хермон yi:הר חרמון zh:黑门山
