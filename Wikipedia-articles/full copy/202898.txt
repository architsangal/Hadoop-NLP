The silvery-blue } { noctilucent cloud s extend far above the Earth&apos;s troposphere. } The atmosphere of Earth is a layer of gases surrounding the planet Earth that is retained by Earth&apos;s gravity. The atmosphere protects life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention ( greenhouse effect ), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation ). Atmospheric stratification describes the structure of the atmosphere, dividing it into distinct layers, each with specific characteristics such as temperature or composition. The atmosphere has a mass of about 5 [ 18 ] kg, three quarters of which is within about [ 11 km mi ft on ] of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. An altitude of [ 120 km mi on ] is where atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft. The Kármán line, at [ 100 km mi on ], also is often regarded as the boundary between atmosphere and outer space. Air is the name given to atmosphere used in breathing and photosynthesis. Dry air contains roughly (by volume) 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.039% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1%. While air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, air suitable for the survival of terrestrial plant s and terrestrial animal s is currently only known to be found in Earth&apos;s troposphere and artificial atmospheres.

Values normalized for illustration. The numbers are from a variety of years (mainly 1987, with CO 2 and methane from 2009) and do not represent any single source. Mean atmospheric water vapor Air is mainly composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, which together constitute the major gases of the atmosphere. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, [ http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html Trace Gases Ace.mmu.ac.uk 2010-10-16 ] among which are the greenhouse gas es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compound s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including dust, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutant s also may be present, such as chlorine (elementary or in compounds), fluorine compounds, elemental mercury, and sulfur compounds such as sulfur dioxide [SO 2 ].

However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude. Because the general pattern of this profile is constant and recognizable through means such as balloon soundings, temperature provides a useful metric to distinguish between atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth&apos;s atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. From highest to lowest, these layers are: [ Exosphere ] [ Exosphere ] The outermost layer of Earth&apos;s atmosphere extends from the exobase upward. It is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. The particles are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Since the particles rarely collide, the atmosphere no longer behaves like a fluid. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate into and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind. [ Thermosphere ] [ Thermosphere ] Temperature increases with height in the thermosphere from the mesopause up to the thermopause, then is constant with height. Unlike in the stratosphere, where the inversion is caused by absorption of radiation by ozone, in the thermosphere the inversion is a result of the extremely low density of molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise to [ 1500 C on 2 ], though the gas molecules are so far apart that temperature in the usual sense is not well defined. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometer between collisions with other molecules. { Ahrens, C. Donald. Essentials of Meteorology. Published by Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005. } The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between [ 320 and 380 km mi on 2 ]. Because of the relative infrequency of molecular collisions, air above the mesopause is poorly mixed compared to air below. While the composition from the troposphere to the mesosphere is fairly constant, above a certain point, air is poorly mixed and becomes compositionally stratified. The point dividing these two regions is known as the turbopause. The region below is the homosphere, and the region above is the heterosphere. The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the exobase. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about [ 350 - 800 km mi ft on 2 ]. [ December 2011 ] [ Mesosphere ] [ Mesosphere ] The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to [ 80 - 85 km mi ft on 2 ]. It is the layer where most meteor s burn up upon entering the atmosphere. Temperature decreases with height in the mesosphere. The mesopause, the temperature minimum that marks the top of the mesosphere, is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around [ -85 C F K on on 2 ]. [ States Robert J. Gardner Chester S. Thermal Structure of the Mesopause Region (80–105 km) at 40°N Latitude. Part I: Seasonal Variations Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences 2000 57 66–77 2000 January 10.1175/1520-0469(2000)057 &lt; 0066:TSOTMR &gt; 2.0.CO;2 ] At the mesopause, temperatures may drop to [ -100 C F K on 2 ]. [ Joe Buchdahl http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Mesosphere.html Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme Ace.mmu.ac.uk 2012-04-18 ] Due to the cold temperature of the mesosphere, water vapor is frozen, forming ice clouds (or Noctilucent cloud s ). A type of lightning referred to as either sprites or ELVES, form many miles above thunderclouds in the troposphere. [ Stratosphere ] [ Stratosphere ] The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about [ 51 km mi ft on ]. Temperature increases with height due to increased absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. While the temperature may be [ -60 C F K on 2 ] at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near freezing [ January 2011 ]. The stratopause, which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at [ 50 to 55 km mi ft on ]. The pressure here is 1/1000 sea level. [ Troposphere ] [ Troposphere ] The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between [ 9 km ft on ] at the poles and [ 17 km ft on ] at the equator, [ http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap01/tropo.html The height of the tropopause Das.uwyo.edu 2012-04-18 ] with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word &quot; τροπή &quot;, trope, meaning turn or overturn). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of the atmosphere. { McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology. (1984). Troposhere. &quot; It contains about four-fifths of the mass of the whole atmosphere. &quot; } The tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. [ Other layers ] Within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties: [ 15 - 35 km mi ft on ] [ 50 to 1000 km mi ft on ] [ http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id%3Dhomosphere1 &apos; &amp; #39;homosphere&apos; &amp; #39;—AMS Glossary Amsglossary.allenpress.com 2010-10-16 ] [ 100 km mi ft on ] The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer ozone concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere. The ionosphere, the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on the Earth. It is responsible for aurora s. The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. In the homosphere the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Above the turbopause at about (essentially corresponding to the mesopause), the composition varies with altitude. This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones such as oxygen and nitrogen present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element. The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth&apos;s surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, while at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about 100 m on clear, calm nights to 3000 m or more during the afternoon in dry regions. The average temperature of the atmosphere at the surface of Earth is [ 14 C F K on ] [ http://www.bambooweb.com/articles/e/a/Earth%27s_atmosphere.html Earth&apos;s Atmosphere ] or [ 15 C F K on ], [ http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html NASA  — Earth Fact Sheet Nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov 2010-10-16 ] depending on the reference.

Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×10 18 kg (1.135×10 19 lb), [ http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request%3Dget-abstract%26amp%3Bdoi%3D10.1175%2FJCLI-3299.1 The Mass of the Atmosphere: A Constraint on Global Analyses Ams.allenpress.com 1970-01-01 2010-10-16 ] about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and the Earth&apos;s area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by the Earth&apos;s mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather. If the atmosphere had a uniform density, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of [ 8.50 km ft on ]. It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every [ 5.6 km ft on ] or by a factor of 1/ e every [ 7.64 km ft on ], the average scale height of the atmosphere below [ 70 km mi ft on ]. However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account. In summary, the mass of the earth&apos;s atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows: { Lutgens, Frederick K. and Edward J. Tarbuck (1995) The Atmosphere, Prentice Hall, 6th ed., pp14-17, ISBN 0-13-350612-6 } [ 5.6 km ft on ] [ 16 km ft on ] [ 100 km mi ft on ] 50% is below. 90% is below. 99.99997% is below, the Kármán line. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronaut s. By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at [ 8848 m ft on ];commercial airliners typically cruise between [ 10 km ft on ] and [ 13 km ft on ] where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach [ 30.4 km ft on ] and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached [ 108.0 km ft on ]. Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply.The various layers of the earth&apos;s ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100  km and extend beyond 500  km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350–400  km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months.Depending on solar activity, satellites can still experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800  km. [ Density and mass ] { NRLMSISE-00 } { standard atmosphere model (the eight dotted lines in each &quot; decade &quot; are at the eight cubes 8, 27, 64,..., 729) } [ Density of air ] The density of air at sea level is about 1.2  kg/m 3 (1.2 g/L). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law ). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites. The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5 [ 15 ] ) tonne s or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, &quot; The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480 [ 18 ] kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5 [ 15 ] kg depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27 [ 16 ] kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003 [ 18 ] kg. &quot; [ Optical properties ] [ Sunlight ] Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy the Earth receives from the Sun. The Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. [ Scattering ] [ Scattering ] When light passes through our atmosphere, photon s interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunset s are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun&apos;s rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset. [ Absorption ] [ Absorption (electromagnetic radiation) ] Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O 2 and O 3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometer s. Water (H 2 O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700  nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. We can think of this as heating the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below. { transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including } { visible light. } The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave &quot; windows &quot; of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300  nm ( ultraviolet -C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light ), at roughly 400–700  nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100  nm. There are also infrared and radio window s that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves. [ Emission ] [ Emission (electromagnetic radiation) ] Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their &quot; black body &quot; emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately [ 6000 K on ], its radiation peaks near 500  nm, and is visible to the human eye. The Earth is approximately [ 290 K on ], so its radiation peaks near 10,000  nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans. Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights the Earth&apos;s surface cools down faster than on cloud y nights. This is because clouds (H 2 O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations. The atmosphere acts as a &quot; blanket &quot; to limit the amount of radiation the Earth loses into space. The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission (or &quot; blanket &quot; ) effect. Some chemicals in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these chemicals are CO 2 and H 2 O. If there are too much of these greenhouse gases, sunlight heats the Earth&apos;s surface, but the gases block the infrared radiation from exiting back to space. This imbalance causes the Earth to warm, and thus climate change. [ Refractive index ] The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of the Earth&apos;s surface. The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage. [ Scintillation (astronomy) ] [ Circulation ] [ Atmospheric circulation ] An idealised view of three large circulation cells. Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation ) by which heat is distributed around the Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant as it is determined by the Earth&apos;s rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles. [ Evolution of Earth&apos;s atmosphere ] [ History of Earth Paleoclimatology ] [ Earliest atmosphere ] The outgassings of the Earth were stripped away by solar winds early in the history of the planet until a steady state was established, the first atmosphere. Based on today&apos;s volcanic evidence, this atmosphere would have contained 60% hydrogen, 20% oxygen (mostly in the form of water vapor), { 10% carbon dioxide, 5 to 7% hydrogen sulfide, and smaller amounts of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, free hydrogen, methane and inert gases. } [ January 2010 ] A major rainfall led to the buildup of a vast ocean, enriching the other agents, first carbon dioxide and later nitrogen and inert gases. A major part of carbon dioxide exhalations were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments. [ Second atmosphere ] Water-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. { B. Windley: The Evolving Continents. Wiley Press, New York 1984 } About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable &quot; second atmosphere &quot;. An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, since hints of early life forms are to be found as early as 3.5 billion years ago. { J. Schopf: Earth&apos;s Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1983 } The fact that this is not perfectly in line with the 30% lower solar radiance (compared to today) of the early Sun has been described as the &quot; faint young Sun paradox &quot;. The geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of the Earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archaean eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently from photosynthesizing algae which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) is very much in line with what is found today, { Celestial climate driver: a perspective from 4 billion years of the carbon cycle Geoscience Canada, March, 2005 by Jan Veizer } suggesting that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle were established as early as 4 billion years ago. [ Third atmosphere ] { Oxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years. This diagram in more detail } The accretion of continents about 3.5 billion years ago { Veizer in B. F. Windley (ed.), The Early History of the Earth, John Wiley and Sons, London, p. 569., 1976 } added plate tectonics, constantly rearranging the continents and also shaping long-term climate evolution by allowing the transfer of carbon dioxide to large land-based carbonate storages. Free oxygen did not exist until about 1.7 billion years ago and this can be seen with the development of the red beds and the end of the banded iron formations. The Earth had a lot of iron in the beginning, and higher amounts of oxygen was not available in the atmosphere until all the iron had ben oxidized. This signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidising atmosphere. O 2 showed major ups and downs until reaching a steady state of more than 15%. { Christopher R. Scotese, Back to Earth History : Summary Chart for the Precambrian, Paleomar Project } The following time span was the Phanerozoic eon, during which oxygen-breathing metazoan life forms began to appear. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has gone up and down during the last 600 million years. There was a peak 280 million years ago, when the amount of oxygen was about 30 %, much higher than today. The cause of changes in the atmosphere is two main processes: Plants converts carbon dioxide into the bodies of the plants, which emits oxygen into the atmosphere, and break down of pyrite rocks cause sulphur to be added to the oceans. Volcanos cause this sulphur to be oxidized, reducing the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. But volcanos also emit carbon dioxide, so that plants can convert this to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are believed to cause rapid development of animals. Even if the atmosphere today has only 21 percent oxygen, today is still regarded as a period with rapid development of animals because of a high amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. { Peter Ward: Out of Thin Air]: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth&apos;s Ancient Atmosphere } Currently, anthropogenic greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this increase is the main cause of global warming.
