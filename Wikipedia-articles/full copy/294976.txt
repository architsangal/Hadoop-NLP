The first commercial airmail flight in the United States passed through this airfield on April 26, 1926, carried by Varney Airlines. Varney Airlines began operating out of Boise in 1933, later merging with National Air Transport to become United Airlines. With United Airlines able to trace its roots to Varney, United is recognized as the airline that has operated the longest out of Boise, 83 years as of 2009. This airfield also played host to Charles Lindbergh &apos;s Spirit of St. Louis on September 4, 1927. The current airport has its origins in 1936 when Boise began buying and leasing land for the airport. By 1938, Boise had the longest runway in the United States at that time, 8,800 feet (2,680  m). The steel hangar for Varney Airlines was moved to the present field in 1939. As the size of aircraft grew, the hangar was no longer able to hold aircraft and was converted into a passenger terminal. It was part of the modern terminal facility until the completion of a new terminal in 2004. During World War II, the Army Air Corps, later Army Air Forces, leased the field for use a training base for B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bomber crews. More than 6,000 men were stationed there during the war. The field was named Gowen Field on July 23, 1941 after 1st Lt Paul R. Gowen (1909–1938), who was born and raised in Caldwell, attended the University of Idaho, and graduated ninth in his class at West Point in 1933. Gowen was killed instantly in a crash in Panama in July 1938 while piloting a twin-engine B-10 bomber for the Army Air Corps. The right engine failed shortly after take-off from Albrook Field, near Panama City. The other two crew members, navigator and radio operator, survived and crawled from the wreckage with burns.

Gowen Research Foundation Electronic Newsletter 1 7 http://bz.llano.net/gowen/electronic_newsletter/el199807.htm 2006-08-31 ] After the war, the portion of the field used by the Army Air Forces was returned to the city. The Idaho Air National Guard began leasing the airfield after the war and continues to lease it currently. Between 2003 and 2005, the Boise Airport was remodeled. The airport now features a brand new terminal and an elevated roadway for departures. There were two different phases that were done when doing the new passenger terminal. Phase 1 considered things like baggage claim, lobby, and food and beverage concession Phase 2 was more about security checkpoints and a brand new concourse (Concourse C. The Boise Airport Passenger Terminal. The Boise Airport Passenger Terminal designed by CSHQA is a three-story, steel-framed [ 378000 sqft m2 on ] state-of-the-art aviation facility.

As of today the tower is complete and stands [ 295 ft m ] tall, being Idaho &apos;s tallest structure (except for the numerous dams on Idaho rivers that are taller such as the 717 foot tall Dworshak Dam), and the Pacific Northwest &apos;s tallest control tower. It has also been relocated to the south side of the airport in order to control an existing Guard assault strip and a possible new runway south of Gowen Field. The tower was planned and constructed when it was believed that the radar functions would be moved to Salt Lake City. After it was decided to leave the radar positions in Boise, the facility at the base of the tower had to be redesigned and partially remodeled to house the Terminal Radar Approach Control ( TRACON ). The tower and TRACON will not be operational until 2012 or 2013, as the FAA makes the changes and adds new equipment to the facility. [ Gowen Field Air National Guard Base ] C-130s previously operated by the Idaho ANG parked on the ramp at Gowen Field. Gowen Field Air National Guard Base primarily refers to the military facilities on the south side of the runways, which includes Air National Guard, Army National Guard, and reserve units of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The field is home to the 124th Fighter Wing (124 FW), Idaho Air National Guard, which consists of one flying squadron operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC) and 12 additional support units. The aircraft based at Gowen Field ANGB is the A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support attack aircraft of the 190th Fighter Squadron (190 FS). The 124 FW was previously designated as the 124th Wing (124 WG) until 2009 and as a composite unit also operated C-130 Hercules transport aircraft in the 189th Airlift Squadron (189 AS), which was operationally-gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC). BRAC 2005 directed that the Idaho Air National Guard divest itself of the C-130 mission by 2009, transferring its C-130s to the Wyoming Air National Guard, while retaining its A-10 fighter mission. The 124 FW is composed of over 1000 military personnel, ranging from full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) to traditional part-time air national guardsmen. { http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/124wg.htm } [ Airlines and destinations ] A number of scheduled airline flights pass through Boise.
