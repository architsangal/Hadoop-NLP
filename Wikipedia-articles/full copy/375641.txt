It was released as the band&apos;s second single and was featured on their only album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&apos;s the Sex Pistols. The song was released during Queen Elizabeth II &apos;s Silver Jubilee in 1977. The record&apos;s lyrics, as well as the cover, were controversial at the time, and both the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority refused to play the song. The song reached number one on the NME charts in the United Kingdom, but only made it to #2 on the official UK Singles Chart as used by the BBC. This led to accusations by some that the charts had been &quot; fixed &quot; to prevent the song from reaching number one. { &quot; Bragg attacks Pistols&apos; royal views &quot;, BBC News, 27 May 2002 } In March 2001, the BBC wrote that the single &quot; reached number one in the UK in 1977 despite being banned by the BBC &quot;. { Sex Pistols cover tops chart } [ Overview ] The single was released on 27 May 1977, and was regarded by much of the general public to be an assault on Queen Elizabeth II and the monarchy. The title is taken directly from &quot; God Save the Queen &quot;, the national anthem of the United Kingdom. At the time it was highly controversial, firstly for its equation of the Queen with a &quot; fascist regime &quot;, and secondly for its claim that England had &quot; no future &quot;. Although many believe it was created because of the Jubilee, the band denies it, Paul Cook saying that, &quot; It wasn&apos;t written specifically for the Queen&apos;s Jubilee. We weren&apos;t aware of it at the time. It wasn&apos;t a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone. &quot; [ Lydon John 1995 Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs Picador http://books.google.com/books?id%3DI82LM4-CwRkC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA234 0-312-11883-X 234 ] Johnny Rotten has explained the lyrics as follows: &quot; You don&apos;t write a song like &apos;God Save The Queen&apos; because you hate the English race. You write a song like that because you love them, and you&apos;re fed up of seeing them mistreated. &quot; [ John Lydon 2007 Sex Pistols Vinyl Reissues 2007: God Save The Queen johnlydon.com http://www.johnlydon.com/press/pistols.html 29 January 2008 ] His intentions were apparently to evoke sympathy for the English working class, and a general resentment for the monarchy. On 7 June 1977—the Jubilee holiday itself—the band attempted to play the song from a boat named The Queen Elizabeth on the River Thames, outside the Palace of Westminster. After a scuffle involving attendee Jah Wobble and a cameraman, eleven people, including several members of the band&apos;s entourage, were arrested when the boat docked.

On at least one singles chart for the period, (TOP 20 POPS) the song&apos;s No. 2 slot is represented with a blank line. It did hit number 1 on the unofficial NME singles chart. It was banned by the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority which regulated Independent Local Radio, effectively denying it any media exposure. It was also not stocked by some shops. [ April 2010 ] Since the official singles chart at the time was compiled using sales returns from a number of outlets amongst a wider participating roster, it is in theory possible that the single&apos;s number 2 position was not the result of disregarding sales figures as such, but of the selection for that week&apos;s chart source data of a number of stores which were not selling the record. In 2001 in a unrelated article about the best record covers of all time, the BBC website published the following &quot; God Save The Queen reached number one in the UK in 1977 despite being banned by the BBC and marked a defining moment in the punk revolution &quot;. There has been no official statement from the BBC (before or after this article was written) regarding this admission and thus the issue as to whether the song did make it to the top of the British charts still remains unresolved. { Sex Pistols cover tops chart } The phrase &quot; no future &quot;, the song&apos;s closing refrain, became emblematic of the punk rock movement. The lyric provided the title of Jon Savage &apos;s award-winning 1991 history of the Sex Pistols and punk rock, England&apos;s Dreaming. Before the group signed to Virgin, a small number of copies of &quot; God Save the Queen &quot; had been pressed on the A &amp; M label. These are now among the most valuable records ever pressed in the UK, with a resale value as of 2006 of between £500 to £13,000 a copy, depending on condition of the disc.

[ http://www.facebook.com/royalweddingboredom ] Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: &quot; I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push &apos;God Save The Queen&apos; for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. This is not my campaign.
