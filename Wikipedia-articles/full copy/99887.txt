Daphne is also known as the “Jubilee City.” A Jubilee in Mobile Bay occurs when crab, shrimp, and other sea life from the waters of Mobile Bay are suddenly found washed ashore along the coastline. Biologists believe the phenomenon is due to a possible decrease in water oxygen levels which force the fish to the surface. [ http://www.daphneal.com/ The City of Daphne, Alabama 10 30 2008 ] [ Native American history ] Early settlers to the region were hunter-gather tribes similar to those in North Alabama. Small clans worked together to acquire food and to provide for their families. Initially, these groups enjoyed an economy based upon hunting and scavenging but as time passed production of weapons and pottery became more advanced. During the late Woodland stage Native Americans began to practice more elaborate ritual services. Although no burial grounds are known in Daphne, they are scattered throughout nearby Baldwin County. By 1500, the zenith of Native American culture in South Alabama, it is estimated that a community of about 5,000 lived within 50 miles of the seacoast. These peoples were among the first who met Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540. From this meeting forward, the original settlers faced a disaster from which they did not recover. [ European exploration and settlement ] The first European settlers to the area of Daphne came in 1540 during the period of Spanish Exploration. Prior to that time the region was populated by a variety of Native American tribes. In 1763, the community of Daphne was established and was known simply as “the Village.” The town of Daphne was officially established, although unincorporated, in April 1874 when the Post Office for Daphne was opened. The town was named the county seat of Baldwin County, Alabama, in 1868 after the previous county seat, Blakely, was destroyed in the Civil War. [ Modern History ] Daphne remained the county seat until a legislative act of 1900, when the county seat was moved to Bay Minette. Daphne residents resisted the change and would not allow the county records to be removed. Those records were stolen in a late night raid and moved to Bay Minette.
