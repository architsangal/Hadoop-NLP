He is a four-time World Champion and four-time Canadian national champion. [ Career ] Browning was both Canadian figure skating champion and World Champion four times. He represented Canada in three Winter Olympics, 1988 (finishing 8th overall), 1992 (6th) and 1994 (5th), and earned the privilege of carrying the Canadian flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1994 games in Lillehammer, Norway. Browning&apos;s other achievements include three Canadian Professional Championships, three World Professional Championships, a Lou Marsh Trophy for top Canadian Athlete (in 1990), Lionel Conacher Award winner (1990 and 1991), Order of Canada recipient (in 1990), an American Skating World Professional Skater of the Year Award (in 1998), and a Gustav Lussi Award from the Professional Skaters&apos; Association (in 2001). On March 25, 1988, at the 1988 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Browning landed the first ratified quadruple jump (a toe loop ) in competition. This accomplishment is listed in the Guinness Book of Records. Josef Sabovcik had previously landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later. Browning later said, &quot; I remember that there were a few people landing the jump (in practice) long before I did, and by watching them I was inspired to try it myself. After landing it, I certainly expected more skaters to start doing it in competition. I was surprised in the next few years when that really did not happen. &quot; Browning is also known for his footwork. He was inducted into Canada&apos;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and Canada&apos;s Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2000. He was honoured with a star on Canada&apos;s Walk of Fame in 2001. He also appeared in the 2006 Fox television program Skating with Celebrities. Starting in 2009, he is the co-host of Battle of the Blades. As a professional skater, Browning has had a long rivalry with Brian Boitano. At the 2006 Ice Wars competition, Browning narrowly defeated Boitano. As a commentator, Browning has made frequent appearances since turning professional in 1994. He has been a regular colour commentator for the CBC at major skating events since 2006. [ Personal life ] Browning was born in Rocky Mountain House, Alberta and raised in Caroline, Alberta. He married Sonia Rodriguez, a principal dancer with the National Ballet of Canada, on June 30, 1996. Their first son, Gabriel, was born on July 12, 2003 and their second son, Dillon, was born on August 14, 2007. Browning&apos;s home in the Forest Hill area of Toronto suffered a fire on August 18, 2010.
