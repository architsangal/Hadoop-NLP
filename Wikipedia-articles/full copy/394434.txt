LGBT slang, LGBT speak or gay slang is a set of slang used predominantly among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people. It has been used in various languages, including English and Japanese since the early 1900s as a means by members of the LGBT community as a group to self-advertise as a way for an individual to identify with the whole, and as a way to speak in code to brevity and speed to other members to other LGBTs.

Duke University Press, 1996. } Because of sodomy law s and threat of prosecution due to the criminalization of homosexuality, LGBT slang also serves as an argot, a secret language and a way for the LGBT community to communicate with each other publicly without revealing their sexual orientation to others.

For example, the word drag was popularized by Hubert Selby, Jr. in his book Last Exit to Brooklyn. &quot; Drag &quot; has been traced back by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) to the late 19th Century. Conversely, words such as banjee, while well-established in a subset of gay society, have never made the transition to popular use. [ English ] Slang is ephemeral. Terms used in one generation may pass out of usage in another. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s the terms &quot; cottage &quot; (UK) and &quot; tearoom &quot; (US) were used to denote public toilets used for sex. By 1999 these had fallen out of use to the point of being unrecognizable by members of the LGBT community. { Leap, William, ed.: Public Sex/Gay Space, Columbia University Press, 1999. p. 61. } [ United Kingdom ] During the first seven decades of the 20th century, a specific form of Polari was developed by gay men and lesbians in urban centers with established LGBT communities.

This is in reference to the Japanese equivalent to &quot; faggot, &quot; okama (御釜, お釜, or 御竈; pot). Although there was a popular Japanese film titled Okoge (1992) the term remains little-known beyond Japan.
