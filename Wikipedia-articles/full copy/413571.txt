The combined roadway provides a toll road for commuting and a free road for Dulles Airport access. The three sections are operated and maintained by separate agencies: the Dulles Toll Road and the Dulles Access Road by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and the Dulles Greenway by an Australian company, Macquarie Atlas Roads. [ Dulles Access Road ] The Dulles Access Road is a four-lane, 13.65-mile (21.97  km) highway that runs &quot; inside &quot; the Dulles Toll Road along its median. There are no general-access exits from the west-bound lanes, and no general-access entrances to the east-bound lanes, with the exception of gated slip ramps to and from the toll road that buses and emergency vehicles can use. The Access Road was built from the Beltway as part of the construction of Dulles Airport, and opened with the airport in 1962. It was extended to I-66 on December 22, 1982.

A hefty ticket awaits you if you try to use it as a way to circumvent the VA 267 toll road. ] The Dulles Airport Access Road can be used only for travel to and from Dulles Airport and other businesses (such as air freight, hotels, and gas stations) on the airport grounds. Although it is illegal to use the Access Road without conducting such &quot; airport business &quot;, some commuters evade the toll and the traffic on the Toll Road by taking the Access Road to the airport, then &quot; backtracking &quot; to their exit. For a couple of years prior to the opening of the Dulles Toll Road, VDOT issued special stickers allowing commuters (for a fee) to backtrack legally along the access highway, but these were discontinued when the toll road opened. [ Paul Hodge http://loudounextra.washingtonpost.com/news/1983/dec/06/i-66-link-opens-motorist-confusion/ I-66 Link Opens to Motorist Confusion Loudon Extra Washington Post December 6, 1983 April 13, 2009 Yesterday morning illegal commuters – those lacking special bumper stickers – were backtracking to Dulles and getting on the eastbound access highway at the rate of four or five a minute. But more than 75 percent of the backtracking commuter cars displayed the $2 FAA decals that mark them as legal commuters on the access road (but not on I-66). ] Since the opening of the Dulles Toll Road, the only major modification to the Access Road was the construction of a flyover exit ramp from the eastbound Access Road to State Route 7. This ramp bypasses congestion associated with the main toll plaza, when traffic from Dulles Airport attempts to exit at Route 7. [ Dulles Toll Road ] right right right The Dulles Toll Road is an eight-lane, 16.15-mile (25.99  km) toll road. [ History ] In response to the development along the Dulles Access Road and the number of motorists who &quot; backtracked &quot; through the airport to commute to outer suburbs, the Virginia Department of Transportation determined a need for a limited access highway to serve points along the Access Road without subjecting airport traffic to congestion. It was built in 1984 by the Virginia Department of Transportation as a toll highway, because conventional funding was not available. It begins just inside the Capital Beltway near Falls Church at a connector to Interstate 66 to Washington, D.C., travels westward through Fairfax County past Dulles Airport, and terminates at the entrance to the Dulles Greenway, a privately owned toll road. Officially, the road is named the Omer L. Hirst – Adelard L. Brault Expressway, in honor of two Virginia state legislators. However, the road is rarely referred to by that name. [ Adam Bernstein http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/13/AR2007021301208.html Adelard L. &apos;Abe&apos; Brault, 97; Influential N.Va. Senator Washington Post February 14, 2007 March 27, 2011 In 1991, state legislators renamed the Dulles Toll Road the Omer L. Hirst-Adelard L. Brault Expressway, which, having met the fate of many other such renamings of roads, bridges and buildings, has not readily been adopted by commuters. ] The speed limit is [ 55 mph km/h 1 ]. The original construction had two lanes in each direction. A third lane was built to serve HOV traffic in 1992. For a short period between the end of construction and the start of HOV limits, single passenger vehicles used the lane and contacted government officials opposing the HOV policy. In response, Congress (which did not have direct control over the highway) passed special legislation prohibiting the imposition of HOV restrictions on the route.

Eastbound traffic is routed differently; Dulles-originating traffic can choose destinations between Herndon exits (putting them on the mainline Toll Road) or further on (starting them on the Access Road), and transfer exits are provided from the Access Road to the Toll Road before the Herndon exits, Reston exits, and the Beltway. Access Road traffic to State Route 7 gets a separate exit ramp from those of the Toll Road, and then the two eastbound segments merge before the junction with Interstate 66. [ 2012 1 1 US ], a main toll plaza west of the Beltway interchange collects a $1.50 toll in both directions for two-axle vehicles. Toll booth s located on westbound exit ramps and eastbound entrance ramps collect tolls of 75 cents, except at the Route 7 interchange, where tolls are only collected from Route 267 east to Route 7 east.

Motorcycles and &quot; clean fuel &quot; vehicles (hybrid and compressed natural gas) are exempt from HOV restrictions in Virginia, allowing single-passenger vehicles of those types to use the lanes as well.

The Greenway proposal prompted the enactment of the Virginia Highway Corporation Act of 1988 { Virginia Code § 56-535. } that authorizes the construction of new toll roads without the use of eminent domain { Virginia Code § 56-541. } under rates set by the Virginia Corporation Commission. The law requires the facility to be turned over to the state after a stated time period. { Virginia Code § 56-551. } The road was completed and opened in 1995, but the original owners defaulted on its loan due to lower than projected use. It receives no public funds, was built with no subsidies, and is policed at its own expense, competing as a wholly private enterprise with the state-built and -maintained roads. [ Dulles Greenway http://dullesgreenway.com/facts-myths.html Dulles Greenway Facts &amp; Myths June 4, 2009 ] Tolls are computed to assure that the owner will recover the original investment plus a return on that investment. The losses incurred during the early years of the project are rolled forward to justify higher tolls in later years. Subsequent improvements, which were constructed in exchange for an extension of the toll road to 2056, include adding a third lane in each direction, resurfacing the entire road in 2009, and the construction of an improved eastbound exit ramp to Dulles Airport in 2009.
