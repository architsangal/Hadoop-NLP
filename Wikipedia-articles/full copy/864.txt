His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes controversial artist. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives. It is the largest museum in the United States of America dedicated to a single artist. [ Overview ] Andy Warhol&apos;s artwork ranged in many forms of media that include hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film, and music. He was a pioneer in computer-generated art using Amiga computers that were introduced in 1985, just before his death in 1987. He founded Interview Magazine and was the author of numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. Andy Warhol is also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement. His studio, The Factory, was a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons. Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. He coined the widely used expression &quot; 15 minutes of fame &quot;. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$100  million for a 1963 canvas titled Eight Elvises. The private transaction was reported in a 2009 article in The Economist, which described Warhol as the &quot; bellwether of the art market &quot;.

Warhol&apos;s father immigrated to the US in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol&apos;s grandparents. Warhol&apos;s father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. [ Victor Bockris Victor Bockris The life and death of Andy Warhol Bantam Books New York City 1989 4–5 0-553-05708-1 19631216 ] The family was Byzantine Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Andy Warhol had two older brothers – Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born in Slovakia; Ján was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol&apos;s son, James Warhola, became a successful children&apos;s book illustrator. About 1939, he starts collecting autographed cards of film stars. In third grade, Warhol had chorea, the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of scarlet fever and causes skin pigmentation blotchiness. { Colacello, Bob (1991), p.16 } He became a hypochondriac, developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother.

Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident. [ http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html The Prince of Pop Art Arthistoryarchive.com August 14, 2010 ] As a teenager, Warhol graduated from Schenley High School in the year 1945. Though not medically diagnosed, Andy had dyslexia, which contributed to broadening his imagination for art. He perceived the world differently from other artists, who did not have this disorder, which was somewhat of a underlying gift. After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study art education at the University of Pittsburgh in hopes of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed to enrolling in the Carnegie Institute of Technology to pursue an art career as a commercial illustrator. In 1949, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design. [ Phases of his artwork by decade ] [ 1950s ] Former studio in New York Warhol showed early artistic talent and studied commercial art at the School of Fine Arts at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, (now Carnegie Mellon University ). { Colacello, Bob (1990), p.19 } In 1949, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising. During the 1950s, he gained fame for his whimsical ink drawings of shoe advertisements. These were done in a loose, blotted-ink style, and figured in some of his earliest showings at the Bodley Gallery in New York. With the concurrent rapid expansion of the record industry and the introduction of the vinyl record, Hi-Fi, and stereophonic recordings, RCA Records hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials. [ Andrew Oldham Andrew Loog Oldham Simon Spence and Christine Ohlman 2Stoned Secker and Warburg London 2002 137 0-436-28015-9 50215773 ] Warhol was an early adopter of the silk screen printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. His earliest silkscreening in painting involved hand-drawn images though this soon progressed to the use of photographically derived silkscreening in paintings. Prior to entering the field of fine art, Warhol&apos;s commercial art background also involved innovative techniques for image making that were somewhat related to printmaking techniques. When rendering commercial objects for advertising Warhol devised a technique that resulted in a characteristic image. His imagery used in advertising was often executed by means of applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet. This was a process akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. { &apos;&apos; &quot; The blotted line, a primitive type of printing—literally a &quot; press &quot; —was, when he devised it, a way for Andy… &quot;; Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol By Tony Scherman, David Dalton &apos;&apos; } Warhol&apos;s work both as a commercial artist and later a fine artist displays a casual approach to image making, in which chance plays a role and mistakes and unintentional marks are tolerated. The resulting imagery in both Warhol&apos;s commercial art and later in his fine art endeavors is often replete with imperfection—smudges and smears can often be found.

The exhibit included the works Marilyn Diptych, 100 Soup Cans, 100 Coke Bottles and 100 Dollar Bills. At the Stable Gallery exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet John Giorno who would star in Warhol&apos;s first film, Sleep, in 1963. [ http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html www.warholstars.org John Giorno ] It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American products such as Campbell&apos;s Soup Cans and Coca-Cola bottles, as well as paintings of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Troy Donahue, Muhammad Ali and Elizabeth Taylor. He founded &quot; The Factory &quot;, his studio during these years, and gathered around himself a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. He began producing prints using the silkscreen method. { The silkscreen method is a stencil method of printmaking in which a design is imposed on a screen of silk or other fine mesh, with blank areas coated with an impermeable substance, and ink is forced through the mesh onto the printing surface. } His work became popular and controversial. Among the imagery tackled by Warhol were dollar bills, celebrities and brand name products, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of mushroom cloud s, electric chair s, and police dogs attacking civil rights protesters. Warhol also used Coca Cola bottles as subject matter for paintings. He had this to say about Coca Cola: [ Andy Warhol The philosophy of Andy Warhol: from A to B and back again Harcourt Brace Jovanovich San Diego 1975 0-15-189050-1 1121125 ] [ August 2010 ] New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists like Warhol were attacked for &quot; capitulating &quot; to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol&apos;s open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol&apos;s reception. Throughout the decade it became more and more clear that there had been a profound change in the culture of the art world, and that Warhol was at the center of that shift. [ January 2009 ] { Tennessee Williams (right) talking on the } { SS &apos;&apos;France&apos;&apos;, 1967; in the background: } { Paul Morrissey. } A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit The American Supermarket, a show held in Paul Bianchini&apos;s Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it – from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc. – was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) Billy Apple, Mary Inman, and Robert Watts. Warhol&apos;s painting of a can of Campbell&apos;s soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is (or of what is art and what is not). [ January 2009 ] &apos;&apos;Campbell&apos;s Soup I&apos;&apos; (1968) As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; in the 1960s, however, this was particularly true. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with producing silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at &quot; The Factory, &quot; Warhol&apos;s aluminum foil -and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol&apos;s Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations). { Colacello, Bob (1990), p.67 } During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of bohemian eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation &quot; Superstars &quot;, including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some – like Berlin – remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol&apos;s connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. [ Attempted murder (1968) ] On June 3, 1968, Valerie Solanas shot Warhol as well as art critic and curator Mario Amaya at Warhol&apos;s studio.

Solanas appears in the 1968 Warhol film I, a Man. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script, apparently, had been misplaced. { Jobey, Liz, &quot; Solanas and Son, &quot; The Guardian (Manchester, England) August 24, 1996: page T10 and following. } Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol, however, was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and massaged his heart to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life. The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol&apos;s life and art.

By way of explanation, she said that Warhol &quot; had too much control over my life. &quot; She was eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the Department of Corrections. After the shooting, the Factory scene became much more tightly controlled, and for many the &quot; Factory 60s &quot; ended. The shooting was mostly overshadowed in the media due to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy two days later. Warhol had this to say about the attack: &quot; Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there  – I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it&apos;s the way things happen in life that&apos;s unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it&apos;s like watching television  – you don&apos;t feel anything.

His detailed and elegant drawings for I. Miller shoes were particularly popular. They consisted mainly of &quot; blotted ink &quot; drawings (or monoprint s ), a technique which he applied in much of his early art. Although many artists of this period worked in commercial art, most did so discreetly. Warhol was so successful, however, that his profile as an illustrator seemed to undermine his efforts to be taken seriously as an artist. Pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the &quot; Pope of Pop &quot;, turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist&apos;s palette. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as Willem de Kooning ). Warhol&apos;s first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller&apos;s window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Robert Rauschenberg had also once graced. { Smith, Patrick S (1986). Andy Warhol&apos;s Art and Films. UMI Research Press. p.98. ISBN 0-8357-1733-X. } Eventually, Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itself – to brand names, celebrities, dollar signs – and removed all traces of the artist&apos;s &quot; hand &quot; in the production of his paintings. To him, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter. Cartoons were already being used by Lichtenstein, typography by Jasper Johns, and so on; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject. His friends suggested he should paint the things he loved the most. It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol&apos;s dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961 Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, Pop, The Genius of Warhol, was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter. [ http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html The Soup Cans – Andy Warhol Warholstars.org August 14, 2010 ] For his first major exhibition Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell&apos;s Soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. The work sold for $10,000 at an auction on November 17, 1971, at Sotheby&apos;s New York – a minimal amount for the artist whose paintings sell for over $6  million more recently.

From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the hand-made from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screen ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations. { Colacello, Bob (1990), p.28 } In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 4 race version of the then elite supercar BMW M1 for the fourth installment in the BMW Art Car Project. Unlike the three artists before him, Warhol declined the use of a small scale practice model, instead opting to immediately paint directly onto the full scale automobile. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.

Warhol used the same techniques– silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors – whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 Death and Disaster series. The Death and Disaster paintings included Red Car Crash, Purple Jumping Man, and Orange Disaster. The unifying element in Warhol&apos;s work is his deadpan Keatonesque style – artistically and personally affectless. This was mirrored by Warhol&apos;s own demeanor, as he often played &quot; dumb &quot; to the media, and refused to explain his work. The artist was famous for having said that all you need to know about him and his works is already there, &quot; Just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There&apos;s nothing behind it. &quot; [ http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker%3D1625 Andy Warhol (Getty Museum) Getty.edu August 14, 2010 ] Autograph and sketch by Warhol His Rorschach inkblots are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be.

In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films, [ http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/ Andy Warhol Filmography The Internet Movie Database September 29, 2009 ] plus some 500 short black-and-white &quot; screen test &quot; portraits of Factory visitors. { Schaffner (1999), p.73 } One of his most famous films, Sleep, monitors poet John Giorno sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film Blow Job is one continuous shot of the face of DeVeren Bookwalter supposedly receiving oral sex from filmmaker Willard Maas, although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, &apos;&apos;Empire&apos;&apos; (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the Empire State Building in New York City at dusk. The film Eat consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by LaMonte Young called Trio for Strings and subsequently created his famous series of static films including Kiss, Eat, and Sleep (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol&apos;s static films were directly inspired by the performance. [ Uwe Husslein Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground Wuppertal 1990 165575494 ] [ August 2010 ] Batman Dracula is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of DC Comics. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol&apos;s movie was an &quot; homage &quot; to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly campy Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis. Warhol&apos;s 1965 film Vinyl is an adaptation of Anthony Burgess &apos; popular dystopia n novel A Clockwork Orange. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as Brigid Berlin, Viva, Edie Sedgwick, Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn, Ondine, Nico, and Jackie Curtis. Legendary underground artist Jack Smith appears in the film Camp. His most popular and critically successful film was Chelsea Girls (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16 mm -films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot; story &quot; while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol&apos;s seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s. Other important films include Bike Boy, My Hustler, and Lonesome Cowboys, a raunchy pseudo- western. These and other titles document gay underground and camp culture, and continue to feature prominently in scholarship about sexuality and art.

The film was at the time scandalous for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. For many years Viva refused to allow it to be screened. It was publicly screened in New York in 2005 for the first time in over thirty years. After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, Paul Morrissey, took over the film-making chores for the Factory collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie exploitation fare with Flesh, Trash, and Heat. All of these films, including the later Andy Warhol&apos;s Dracula and Andy Warhol&apos;s Frankenstein, were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot; Warhol &quot; films starred Joe Dallesandro – more of a Morrissey star than a true Warhol superstar. In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol&apos;s death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

Warhol, with Paul Morrissey, acted as the band&apos;s manager, introducing them to Nico (who would perform with the band at Warhol&apos;s request). In 1966 he &quot; produced &quot; their first album The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico, as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album&apos;s production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band&apos;s first album, Warhol and band leader Lou Reed started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended. [ January 2009 ] In 1989, after Warhol&apos;s death, Reed and John Cale re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album Songs for Drella, a tribute to Warhol. Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of John Wallowitch &apos;s debut album, This Is John Wallowitch!!! (1964). He designed the cover art for the Rolling Stones albums Sticky Fingers (1971) and Love You Live (1977), and the John Cale albums The Academy in Peril (1972) and Honi Soit in 1981. In 1975, Warhol was commissioned to do several portraits of Mick Jagger, and in 1982 he designed the album cover for the Diana Ross album Silk Electric. [ January 2009 ] One of his last works was a portrait of Aretha Franklin for the cover of her 1986 gold album Aretha, which was done in the style of the Reigning Queens series he had completed the year before.

Bowie recorded a song called &quot; Andy Warhol &quot; for his 1971 album Hunky Dory. Lou Reed wrote the song &quot; Andy&apos;s Chest &quot;, about Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the VU album in 1985. [ Books and print ] Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work. The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy, printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin&apos;s ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends.

The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B &amp; Back Again) (1975, ISBN 0-15-671720-4)– according to Pat Hackett&apos;s introduction to The Andy Warhol Diaries, Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with Brigid Berlin (also known as Brigid Polk) and former Interview magazine editor Bob Colacello. Popism: The Warhol 1960s (1980, ISBN 0-15-672960-1), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art. The Andy Warhol Diaries (1989, ISBN 0-446-39138-7), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations. Colacello, Bob (1990), p.183 Warhol created the fashion magazine Interview that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces. { Colacello, Bob (1990), pp.22–23 } [ Other media ] Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.

Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as Yum, Yum, Yum (about food), Ho, Ho, Ho (about Christmas) and (of course) Shoes, Shoes, Shoes. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably A Gold Book, compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. A Gold Book is so named because of the gold leaf that decorates its pages. In April 2012 a sketch of 1930s singer Rudy Vallee thought to be drawn by Andy Warhol was found at a Las Vegas garage sale. The image is believed to have been drawn when Andy was 9 or 10. Sculpture: Warhol&apos;s most famous sculpture is probably his Brillo Boxes, silkscreened ink on wood replicas of Brillo soap pad boxes (designed by James Harvey ), part of a series of &quot; grocery carton &quot; sculptures that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell&apos;s tomato juice cases. Other famous works include the Silver Clouds– helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped balloon s. A Silver Cloud was included in the traveling exhibition Air Art (1968–69) curated by Willoughby Sharp. Clouds was also adapted by Warhol for avant-garde choreographer Merce Cunningham&apos;s dance piece RainForest (1968). Audio: At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot; wife &quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol&apos;s was his &quot; Invisible Sculpture &quot;, a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol&apos;s cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer. Time Capsules: In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life– correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food– which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated &quot; capsules &quot;. The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum. Television: Andy Warhol dreamed of a television show that he wanted to call The Nothing Special, a special about his favorite subject: Nothing. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, Andy Warhol&apos;s TV in 1982 and Andy Warhol&apos;s Fifteen Minutes (based on his famous &quot; fifteen minutes of fame &quot; quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including The Love Boat wherein a Midwestern wife ( Marion Ross ) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ( Tom Bosley, who starred alongside Ross in sitcom Happy Days ) her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for Schrafft&apos;s Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the &quot; Underground Sundae &quot;. Fashion: Warhol is quoted for having said: &quot; I&apos;d rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn&apos;t you? &quot; One of his most well-known Superstars, Edie Sedgwick, aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend Halston was a famous one. Warhol&apos;s work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject. Performance Art: Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an S &amp; M outfit cracking a whip. The Exploding Plastic Inevitable in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work. Theater: Andy Warhol&apos;s Pork opened on May 5, 1971 at LaMama theater in New York for a two-week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. Pork was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigin Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured Jayne County as &quot; Vulva &quot; and Cherry Vanilla as &quot; Amanda Pork &quot;. In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical Man On The Moon, which was written by John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas. Photography: To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of Polaroid camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous amount of photographs of Factory visitors, friends. Computer: Warhol used Amiga computers to generate digital art, which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with Debbie Harry as a model. ( video ) [ Producer and product ] Warhol had assistance in producing his paintings. This is also true of his film-making and commercial enterprises. [ January 2009 ] He founded the gossip magazine Interview, a stage for celebrities he &quot; endorsed &quot; and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the band The Velvet Underground, presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian &quot; Superstar &quot; and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from Love Boat to Saturday Night Live and the Richard Pryor movie, Dynamite Chicken). [ January 2009 ] In this respect Warhol was a fan of &quot; Art Business &quot; and &quot; Business Art &quot; – he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again.

Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor, and films like Blow Job, My Hustler and Lonesome Cowboys ) draw from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters. { Thomas Waugh, Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall, Columbia University Press, New York, N.Y. 1996 } The first works that he submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.

Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like &quot; Um, no &quot; and &quot; Um, yes &quot;, and often allowing others to speak for him) – and even the evolution of his pop style – can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.

In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate. During his life, Warhol regularly attended Mass, and the priest at Warhol&apos;s church, Saint Vincent Ferrer, said that the artist went there almost daily, although he was not observed taking communion or going to confession and sat or knelt in the pews at the back &quot;. The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a Latin Rite church crossing himself &quot; in the Orthodox way &quot; (right to left instead of the reverse). His art is noticeably influenced by the eastern Christian iconographic tradition which was so evident in his places of worship. Warhol&apos;s brother has described the artist as &quot; really religious, but he didn&apos;t want people to know about that because [it was] private &quot;. Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol&apos;s eulogy John Richardson depicted it as devout: &quot; To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion.
