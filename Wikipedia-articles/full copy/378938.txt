Magnesium is an essential element in biological systems. Magnesium occurs typically as the Mg 2+ ion. It is an essential mineral nutrient for life [ Leroy J. 1926 Necessite du magnesium pour la croissance de la souris Comptes Rendus de Seances de la Societe de Biologie 94 431–433 ] [ Lusk J.E. Williams, R.J.P., and Kennedy, E.P. 1968 Magnesium and the growth of Escherichia coli Journal of Biological Chemistry 243 2618–2624 4968384 10 ] [ Marschner H. 1995 Mineral Nutrition in Higher Plants San Diego Academic Press 0-12-473542-8 ] and is present in every cell type in every organism. For example, ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must be bound to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP. { &quot; Magnesium &quot; Centre for Cancer Education, University of Newcastle upon Tyne. http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?magnesium } Similarly, magnesium plays a role in the stability of all polyphosphate compounds in the cells, including those associated with DNA - and RNA synthesis. Over 300 enzyme s require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including all enzymes utilizing or synthesizing ATP, or those that use other nucleotide s to synthesize DNA and RNA. In plants, magnesium is necessary for synthesis of chlorophyll and photosynthesis. [ Function ] A balance of magnesium is vital to the well being of all organisms. Magnesium is a relatively abundant ion in the lithosphere and is highly bioavailable in the hydrosphere. This availability, in combination with a useful and very unusual chemistry, may have led to its usefulness in evolution as an ion for signaling, enzyme activation and catalysis. However, the unusual nature of ionic magnesium has also led to a major challenge in the use of the ion in biological systems. Biological membranes are impermeable to magnesium (and other ions) so transport proteins must facilitate the flow of magnesium, both into and out of cells and intracellular compartments. [ Biological range, distribution, and regulation ] In animal s it has been shown that different cell types maintain different concentrations of magnesium. [ Valberg L.S. Holt, J.M., Paulson, E., and Szivek, J. 1965 Spectrochemical Analysis of Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Copper, and Zinc in Normal Human Erythrocytes Journal of Clinical Investigation 44 379–389 10.1172/JCI105151 14271298 292488 3 ] [ Seiler R.H. Ramirez, O., Brest, A.N., and Moyer, J.H. 1966 Serum and erythrocytic magnesium levels in congestive heart failure: effect of hydrochlorothiazide American Journal of Cardiology 17 786–791 10.1016/0002-9149(66)90372-9 6 ] [ Walser M. 1967 Magnesium metabolism Ergebnisse der Physiologie Biologischen Chemie und Experimentellen Pharmakologie 59 185–296 10.1007/BF02269144 ] [ Iyengar G.V. Kollmer, W.E., and Bowen, H.J.M. 1978 The Elemental Composition of Human Tissues and Body Fluids Weinheim, New York Verlag Chemie 0-89573-003-0 ] It seems likely that the same is true for plants. [ Stelzer R. Lehmann, H., Krammer, D., and Luttge, U. 1990 X-Ray microprobe analysis of vacuoles of spruce needle mesophyll, endodermis and transfusion parenchyma cells at different seasons of the year Botanica Acta 103 415–423 ] [ Shaul O.

Interstitial and systemic concentrations of free magnesium must be delicately maintained by the combined processes of buffering (binding of ions to proteins and other molecules) and muffling (the transport of ions to storage or extracellular spaces [ Thomas R.C. Coles, J.A., and Deitmer, J.W. 1991 Homeostatic muffling Nature 350 564 10.1038/350564b0 2017256 6319 ] ). In plants, and more recently in animals, magnesium has been recognized as an important signaling ion, both activating and mediating many biochemical reactions. The best example of this is perhaps the regulation of carbon fixation in chloroplast s in the Calvin cycle. [ Berkowitz G.A. Wu, W. 1993 Magnesium, potassium flux and photosynthesis Magnesium Research 6 257–265 8292500 3 ] [ Shaul O. 2002 Magnesium transport and function in plants: the tip of the iceberg BioMetals 15 309–323 10.1023/A:1016091118585 12206396 3 ] The importance of magnesium to proper cellular function cannot be overstated. Deficiency of the nutrient results in disease in the affected organism. In single-celled organisms such as bacteria and yeast, low levels of magnesium manifests in greatly reduced growth rates. In magnesium transport knockout strains of bacteria, healthy rates are maintained only with exposure to very high external concentrations of the ion. [ Hmiel S.P. Snavely, M.D., Florer, J.B., Maguire, M.E., and Miller, C.G. 1989 Magnesium transport in Salmonella typhimurium: genetic characterization and cloning of three magnesium transport loci Journal of Bacteriology 171 4742–4751 2548998 9 210275 ] [ MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner, R.C. 1998 Overexpression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae magnesium transport system confers resistance to aluminum ion J. Biol. Chem. 273 1727–1732 10.1074/jbc.273.3.1727 9430719 3 ] In yeast, mitochondria l magnesium deficiency also leads to disease. [ Wiesenberger G. Waldherr, M., and Schweyen, R.J. 1992 The nuclear gene MRS2 is essential for the excision of group II introns from yeast mitochondrial transcripts in vivo J. Biol. Chem. 267 6963–6969 1551905 10 ] Plants deficient in magnesium show stress responses. The first observable signs of both magnesium starvation and overexposure in plants is a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. This is due to the central position of the Mg ++ ion in the chlorophyll molecule. The later effects of magnesium deficiency on plants are a significant reduction in growth and reproductive viability. Magnesium can also be toxic to plants, although this is typically seen only in drought conditions. [ Kaiser W.M. 1987 Effects of water deficit on photosynthetic capacity Physiologia Plantarum 71 142–149 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1987.tb04631.x ] [ Rao I.M.

In ruminant animals, particularly vulnerable to magnesium availability in pasture grasses, the condition is known as ‘grass tetany’. Hypomagnesemia is identified by a loss of balance due to muscle weakness. [ Grunes D.L. Stout, P.R., and Brownwell, J.R. 1970 Grass tetany of ruminants Advances in Agronomy 22 332–374 10.1016/S0065-2113(08)60272-2 Advances in Agronomy 978-0-12-000722-6 ] A number of genetically attributable hypomagnesemia disorders have also been identified in humans. [ Paunier L. Radde, I.C., Kooh, S.W., Conen, P.E., and Fraser, D. 1968 Primary hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia in an infant Pediatrics 41 385–402 5637791 2 ] [ Weber S.

Waldegger, S., Mederos y Schnitzler, M., Vitzthum, H., Sassen, M.C., Seyberth, H.W., Konrad, M., and Gudermann, T. 2004 Disruption of TRPM6/TRPM7 complex formation by a mutation in the TRPM6 gene causes hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101 2894–2899 10.1073/pnas.0305252101 14976260 9 365716 ] Overexposure to magnesium may be toxic to individual cells, though these effects have been difficult to show experimentally. In humans the condition is termed hypermagnesemia, and is well documented, though it is usually caused by loss of kidney function. In healthy individuals, excess magnesium is rapidly excreted in the urine (Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, Online Edition). [ Human health ] [ Magnesium deficiency (medicine) ] The adult human daily nutritional requirement, which is affected by various factors including gender, weight and size, is 300-400 mg /day. Inadequate magnesium intake frequently causes muscle spasm s, and has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety disorders, migraine s, osteoporosis and cerebral infarction. [ Larsson SC, Virtanen MJ, Mars M, et al. Magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium intakes and risk of stroke in male smokers Arch. Intern. Med. 168 5 459–65 2008 March 18332289 10.1001/archinte.168.5.459 ] Acute deficiency (see hypomagnesemia ) is rare, and is more common as a drug side effect (such as chronic alcohol or diuretic use) than from low food intake per se, but it can also occur within people fed intravenously for extended periods of time. The incidence of chronic deficiency resulting in less than optimal health is debated. The DRI upper tolerated limit for supplemental magnesium is 350  mg/day (calculated as milligrams (mg) of elemental magnesium in the salt). (Supplements based on amino acid chelates, such as glycinate, lysinate etc., are much better tolerated by the digestive system and do not have the side effects of the older compounds used, while sustained release supplements prevent the occurrence of diarrhea.) [ November 2007 ] The most common symptom of excess oral magnesium intake is diarrhea. Since the kidneys of adult humans excrete excess magnesium efficiently, oral magnesium poisoning in adults with normal renal function is very rare. Infants, which have less ability to excrete excess magnesium even when healthy, should not be given magnesium supplements, except under a physician&apos;s care. Pharmaceutical preparations with magnesium are used to treat conditions including magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia, as well as eclampsia [ 10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.527788 ]. Such preparations are usually in the form of magnesium sulfate or chloride when given parenterally. Magnesium is absorbed with reasonable efficiency (30% to 40%) by the body from any soluble magnesium salt, such as the chloride or citrate. Magnesium is similarly absorbed from Epsom salts, although the sulfate in these salts adds to their laxative effect at higher doses. Magnesium absorption from the insoluble oxide and hydroxide salts ( milk of magnesia ) is erratic and of poorer efficiency, since it depends on the neutralization and solution of the salt by the acid of the stomach, which may not be (and usually is not) complete. Magnesium orotate may be used as adjuvant therapy in patients on optimal treatment for severe congestive heart failure, increasing survival rate and improving clinical symptoms and patient&apos;s quality of life. [ Stepura OB, Martynow AI Magnesium orotate in severe congestive heart failure (MACH) Int. J. Cardiol. 131 2 293–5 2008 February 18281113 10.1016/j.ijcard.2007.11.022 ] [ Nerve conduction ] Magnesium can affect muscle relaxation through direct action on cell membranes. Mg ++ ions close certain types of calcium channels, which conduct a positively charged calcium ion into neuron s. With an excess of magnesium, more channels will be blocked and nerve cells will have less activity. [ April 2008 ] [ Hypertension ] Magnesium-containing Epsom salts are especially used in treating the hypertension of eclampsia. Even if the case is not eclampsia, there may be antihypertensive effects of having a substantial portion of the intake of sodium chloride (NaCl) exchanged for e.g. magnesium chloride; NaCl is an osmolite and increases arginine vasopressin (AVP) release, which increases extracellular volume and thus results in increased blood pressure. However, not all osmolites have this effect on AVP release, [ Walter F., PhD. Boron Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch Elsevier/Saunders 2005 1-4160-2328-3 ] { Page 871 } so with magnesium chloride, the increase in osmolarity may not cause such a hypertensive response. [ antihypertensive would go with lowered blood pressure April 2012 ] [ Food sources ] Some good sources of magnesium. Green vegetable s such as spinach provide magnesium because of the abundance of chlorophyll molecules which contain the ion. Nut s (especially cashew s and almond s ), seed s, dark chocolate, roasted soybeans, bran, and some whole grain s are also good sources of magnesium. {, List of High Magnesium Foods } Although many foods contain magnesium, it is usually found in low levels. As with most nutrients, daily needs for magnesium are unlikely to be met by one serving of any single food. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains will help ensure adequate intake of magnesium. Because magnesium readily dissolves in water, refined foods, which are often processed or cooked in water and dried, are generally poor sources of the nutrient. For example, whole wheat bread has twice as much magnesium as white bread because the magnesium-rich germ and bran are removed when white flour is processed. The table of food sources of magnesium suggests many dietary sources of magnesium. &quot; Hard &quot; water can also provide magnesium, but &quot; soft &quot; water does not contain the ion. Dietary surveys do not assess magnesium intake from water, which may lead to underestimating total magnesium intake and its variability. Too much magnesium may make it difficult for the body to absorb calcium [ August 2011 ]. Not enough magnesium can lead to hypomagnesemia as described above, with irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure (a sign in humans but not some experimental animals such as rodents), insomnia and muscle spasms ( fasciculation ) [ March 2012 ]. However, as noted, symptoms of low magnesium from pure dietary deficiency are thought to be rarely encountered. Following are some foods and the amount of magnesium in them [ March 2012 ] : Black-eyed peas (1/2 cup) = 45  mg Buckwheat flour (100g (4  oz)) = 250  mg Halibut (100g (4  oz)) = 107  mg Milk : low fat (1 cup) = 40  mg Oats (100g (4  oz)) = 235  mg Peanut butter (2 tablespoons) = 50  mg Spinach (1/2 cup) = 80  mg Wholemeal bread (1 Slice) = 25  mg [ Biological chemistry ] Mg 2+ is the fourth most abundant metal ion in cells (in moles) and the most abundant free divalent cation — as a result it is deeply and intrinsically woven into cellular metabolism. Indeed, Mg 2+ -dependent enzymes appear in virtually every metabolic pathway: specific binding of Mg 2+ to biological membranes is frequently observed, Mg 2+ is also used as a signalling molecule, and much of nucleic acid biochemistry requires Mg 2+, including all reactions which require release of energy from ATP. [ Cowan J.A. 1995 Introduction to the biological chemistry of magnesium The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium J.A. Cowan New York VCH ] [ Romani A.M.P. Maguire, M.E. 2002 Hormonal regulation of Mg 2+ transport and homeostasis in eukaryotic cells BioMetals 15 271–283 10.1023/A:1016082900838 12206393 3 ] In nucleotides, the triple phosphate moiety of the compound is invariably stabilized by association with Mg 2+ in all enzymic processes. [ Chlorophyll ] In photosynthetic organisms Mg 2+ has the additional vital role of being the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. This role was discovered by R. M. Willstätter, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1915 for the purification and structure of chlorophyll. [ Enzymes ] The chemistry of the Mg 2+ ion, as applied to enzymes, uses the full range of this ion’s unusual reaction chemistry to fulfill a range of functions. [ Black C.B. Cowan, J.A. 1995 Magnesium-dependent enzymes in nucleic acid biochemistry The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium J.A. Cowan New York VCH ] [ Black C.B. Cowan, J.A. 1995 Magnesium-dependent enzymes in general metabolism The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium J.A. Cowan New York VCH ] [ Cowan J.A. 2002 Structural and catalytic chemistry of magnesium-dependent enzymes BioMetals 15 225–235 10.1023/A:1016022730880 12206389 3 ] Mg 2+ interacts with substrates, enzymes and occasionally both (Mg 2+ may form part of the active site). Mg 2+ generally interacts with substrates through inner sphere coordination, stabilising anions or reactive intermediates, also including binding to ATP and activating the molecule to nucleophilic attack. When interacting with enzymes and other proteins Mg 2+ may bind using inner or outer sphere coordination, to either alter the conformation of the enzyme or take part in the chemistry of the catalytic reaction. In either case, because Mg 2+ is only rarely fully dehydrated during ligand binding, it may be a water molecule associated with the Mg 2+ that is important rather than the ion itself. The Lewis acidity of Mg 2+ ( p&apos;&apos;K&apos;&apos; a 11.4) is used to allow both hydrolysis and condensation reactions (most commonly phosphate ester hydrolysis and phosphoryl transfer) that would otherwise require pH values greatly removed from physiological values. [ Essential role in the biological activity of ATP ] ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must be bound to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP. [ Nucleic acids ] Nucleic acid s have an important range of interactions with Mg 2+. The binding of Mg 2+ to DNA and RNA stabilises structure; this can be observed in the increased melting temperature (T m ) of double-stranded DNA in the presence of Mg 2+. Additionally, ribosome s contain large amounts of Mg 2+ and the stabilisation provided is essential to the complexation of this ribo-protein. [ Sperazza J.M. Spremulli, L.L. 1983 Quantitation of cation binding to wheat germ ribosomes: influences on subunit association equilibria and ribosome activity Nucleic Acids Research 11 2665–2679 10.1093/nar/11.9.2665 6856472 9 325916 ] A large number of enzymes involved in the biochemistry of nucleic acids bind Mg 2+ for activity, using the ion for both activation and catalysis. Finally, the autocatalysis of many ribozymes (enzymes containing only RNA) is Mg 2+ dependent (e.g. the yeast mitochondrial group II self splicing introns [ Smith R.L. Thompson, L.J., and Maguire, M.E. 1995 Cloning and characterization of MgtE, a putative new class of Mg2+ transporter from Bacillus firmus OF4 Journal of Bacteriology 177 1233–1238 7868596 5 176728 ] ). Magnesium ions can be critical in maintaining the positional integrity of closely clustered phosphate groups. These clusters appear in numerous and distinct parts of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. For instance hexahydrated Mg 2+ ions bind in the deep major groove and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid duplex es. { Hexahydrated magnesium ions bind in the deep major groove and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid duplexes - Robinson et al. 28 (8): 1760 - Nucleic Acids Research } [ Cell membranes and walls ] Biological cell membrane s and cell wall s are polyanionic surfaces. This has important implications for the transport of ions, particularly because it has been shown that different membranes preferentially bind different ions. Both Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ regularly stabilise membranes by the cross-linking of carboxylated and phosphorylated head groups of lipids. However, the envelope membrane of E. coli has also been shown to bind Na +, K +, Mn 2+ and Fe 3+. The transport of ions is dependent on both the concentration gradient of the ion and the electric potential (ΔΨ) across the membrane, which will be affected by the charge on the membrane surface. For example, the specific binding of Mg 2+ to the chloroplast envelope has been implicated in a loss of photosynthetic efficiency by the blockage of K + uptake and the subsequent acidification of the chloroplast stroma. [ Proteins ] The Mg 2+ ion tends to bind only weakly to protein s ( &apos;&apos;K&apos;&apos; a ≤ 10 5 ) and this can be exploited by the cell to switch enzymatic activity on and off by changes in the local concentration of Mg 2+. Although the concentration of free cytoplasmic Mg 2+ is on the order of 1  mmol/L, the total Mg 2+ content of animal cells is 30  mmol/L [ Ebel H. Gunther, T. 1980 Magnesium metabolism: a review Journal of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Biochemistry 18 257–270 ] and in plants the content of leaf endodermal cells has been measured at values as high as 100  mmol/L (Stelzer et al., 1990), much of which is buffered in storage compartments. The cytoplasmic concentration of free Mg 2+ is buffered by binding to chelators (e.g. ATP), but also more importantly by storage of Mg 2+ in intracellular compartments. The transport of Mg 2+ between intracellular compartments may be a major part of regulating enzyme activity. The interaction of Mg 2+ with proteins must also be considered for the transport of the ion across biological membranes. [ Manganese ] In biological systems, only manganese (Mn 2+ ) is readily capable of replacing Mg 2+, but only in a limited set of circumstances. Mn 2+ is very similar to Mg 2+ in terms of its chemical properties, including inner and outer shell complexation. Mn 2+ effectively binds ATP and allows hydrolysis of the energy molecule by most ATPases. Mn 2+ can also replace Mg 2+ as the activating ion for a number of Mg 2+ -dependent enzymes, although some enzyme activity is usually lost. Sometimes such enzyme metal preferences vary among closely related species: for example, the reverse transcriptase enzyme of lentivirus es like HIV, SIV and FIV is typically dependent on Mg 2+, whereas the analogous enzyme for other retrovirus es prefers Mn 2+. [ Importance in drug binding ] An article { 2. } investigating the structural basis of interactions between clinically relevant antibiotics and the 50S ribosome appeared in Nature in October 2001. High resolution x-ray crystallography established that these antibiotics only associate with the 23S rRNA of a ribosomal subunit, and no interactions are formed with a subunit&apos;s protein portion. The article stresses that the results show &quot; the importance of putative Mg 2+ ions for the binding of some drugs &quot;. [ Measuring magnesium in biological samples ] [ By radioactive isotopes ] The use of radioactive tracer elements in ion uptake assays allows the calculation of km, Ki and Vmax and determines the initial change in the ion content of the cells. 28 Mg decays by the emission of a high energy beta or gamma particle, which can be measured using a scintillation counter. However, the radioactive half-life of 28 Mg, the most stable of the radioactive magnesium isotopes, is only 21 hours. This severely restricts the experiments involving the nuclide. Additionally, since 1990 no facility has routinely produced 28 Mg and the price per mCi is now predicted to be approximately US$30,000. [ Maguire M.E. Cowan, J.A. 2002 Magnesium chemistry and biochemistry BioMetals 15 203–210 10.1023/A:1016058229972 12206387 3 ] The chemical nature of Mg 2+ is such that it is closely approximated by few other cations. [ Tevelev A. Cowan, J.A. 1995 Metal substitution as a probe of the biological chemistry of magnesium ion The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium J.A. Cowan New York VCH ] However, Co 2+, Mn 2+ and Ni 2+ have been used successfully to mimic the properties of Mg 2+ in some enzyme reactions, and radioactive forms of these elements have been employed successfully in cation transport studies. The difficulty of using metal ion replacement in the study of enzyme function is that the relationship between the enzyme activities with the replacement ion compared to the original is very difficult to ascertain. [ By fluorescent indicators ] A number of chelators of divalent cations have different fluorescence spectra in the bound and unbound states. [ Drakenberg T. 1995 Physical methods for studying the biological chemistry of magnesium The Biological Chenistry of Magnesium J.A. Cowan New York VCH ] Chelators for Ca 2+ are well established, have high affinity for the cation, and low interference from other ions. Mg 2+ chelators lag behind and the major fluorescence dye for Mg 2+ (mag-fura 2 [ Raju B. Murphy, E., Levy, L.A., Hall, R.D., and London, R.E. 1989 A fluorescent indicator for measuring cytosolic free magnesium Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 256 C540–548 ] ) actually has a higher affinity for Ca 2+. [ Grubbs R.D. 2002 Intracellular magnesium and magnesium buffering BioMetals 15 251–259 10.1023/A:1016026831789 12206391 3 ] This limits the application of this dye to cell types where the resting level of Ca 2+ is &lt; 1 μM and does not vary with the experimental conditions under which Mg 2+ is to be measured. Recently, Otten et al. (2001) have described work into a new class of compounds that may prove more useful, having significantly better binding affinities for Mg 2+. [ Otten P.A. London, R.E., and Levy, L.A. 2001 4-Oxo-4H-quinolizine-3-carboxylic acids as Mg 2+ selective, fluorescent indicators Bioconjugate Chemistry 12 203–212 10.1021/bc000087d 11312681 2 ] The use of the fluorescent dyes is limited to measuring the free Mg 2+. If the ion concentration is buffered by the cell by chelation or removal to subcellular compartments, the measured rate of uptake will only give minimum values of km and Vmax. [ By electrophysiology ] First, ion-specific microelectrodes can be used to measure the internal free ion concentration of cells and organelles. The major advantages are that readings can be made from cells over relatively long periods of time, and that unlike dyes very little extra ion buffering capacity is added to the cells. [ Gunzel D. Schlue, W.-R. 2002 Determination of [Mg 2+ ]i - an update on the use of Mg 2+ -selective electrodes BioMetals 15 237–249 10.1023/A:1016074714951 12206390 3 ] Second, the technique of two-electrode voltage-clamp allows the direct measurement of the ion flux across the membrane of a cell. [ Hille B. 1992 Ionic channels of excitable membranes Sunderland Sinauer Associates Inc. 2 0-87893-322-0 ] The membrane is held at an electric potential and the responding current is measured. All ions passing across the membrane contribute to the measured current. Third, the technique of patch-clamp which uses isolated sections of natural or artificial membrane in much the same manner as voltage-clamp but without the secondary effects of a cellular system. Under ideal conditions the conductance of individual channels can be quantified. This methodology gives the most direct measurement of the action of ion channels. [ By absorption spectroscopy ] Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) determines the total magnesium content of a biological sample. This method is destructive; biological samples must be broken down in concentrated acids to avoid clogging the fine nebulising apparatus. Beyond this the only limitation is that samples need to be in a volume of approximately 2 mL and at a concentration range of 0.1 – 0.4 µmol/L for optimum accuracy. As this technique cannot distinguish between Mg 2+ already present in the cell and that taken up during the experiment only content not uptake can be quantified. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) using either the mass spectrometry (MS) or atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) modifications also allows the determination of the total ion content of biological samples. { See Chapters 5 and 6 in } [ Dean J.R. 1997 Atomic Absorption and Plasma Spectroscopy Chichester John Wiley &amp; Sons 0-471-97255-X ] { for descriptions of the methodology as applied to analytical chemistry. } These techniques are more sensitive than flame AAS and are capable of measuring the quantities of multiple ions simultaneously. However, they are also significantly more expensive. [ Magnesium transport ] [ Magnesium transport ] The chemical and biochemical properties of Mg 2+ present the cellular system with a significant challenge when transporting the ion across biological membranes. The dogma of ion transport states that the transporter recognises the ion then progressively removes the water of hydration, removing most or all of the water at a selective pore before releasing the ion on the far side of the membrane. { Hille, 1992. Chapter 11 } Due to the properties of Mg 2+, large volume change from hydrated to bare ion, high energy of hydration and very low rate of ligand exchange in the inner coordination sphere, these steps are probably more difficult than for most other ions. To date, only the ZntA protein of Paramecium has been shown to be a Mg 2+ channel. [ Haynes W.J. Kung, C., Saimi, Y., and Preston, R.R. 2002 An exchanger-like protein underlies the large Mg2+ current in Paramecium PNAS 99 15717–15722 10.1073/pnas.242603999 12422021 24 137782 ] The mechanisms of Mg 2+ transport by the remaining proteins are beginning to be uncovered with the first three dimensional structure of a Mg 2+ transport complex being solved in 2004. [ Warren M.A. Kucharski, L.M., Veenstra, A., Shi, L., Grulich, P.F., and Maguire, M.E. 2004 The CorA Mg2+ Transporter Is a Homotetramer Journal of Bacteriology 186 4605–4612 10.1128/JB.186.14.4605-4612.2004 15231793 14 438605 ] The hydration shell of the Mg 2+ ion has a very tightly bound inner shell of six water molecules and a relatively tightly bound second shell containing 12 – 14 water molecules (Markham et al., 2002). Thus recognition of the Mg 2+ ion probably requires some mechanism to interact initially with the hydration shell of Mg 2+, followed by a direct recognition/binding of the ion to the protein. Due to the strength of the inner sphere complexation between Mg 2+ and any ligand, multiple simultaneous interactions with the transport protein at this level might significantly retard the ion in the transport pore. Hence, it is possible that much of the hydration water is retained during transport, allowing the weaker (but still specific) outer sphere coordination. In spite of the mechanistic difficulty, Mg 2+ must be transported across membranes, and a large number of Mg 2+ fluxes across membranes from a variety of systems have been described. [ Gardner R.C. 2003 Genes for magnesium transport Current Opinion in Plant Biology 6 263–267 10.1016/S1369-5266(03)00032-3 12753976 3 ] However, only a small selection of Mg 2+ transporters have been characterised at the molecular level. [ Ligand ion channel blockade ] Magnesium ion s (Mg 2+ ) in cellular biology are usually in almost all senses opposite to Ca 2+ ions, because they are bivalent too, but have greater electronegativity and thus hold on to water molecules stronger, preventing passage through the channel (even though magnesium is smaller). Thus Mg 2+ ions block Ca 2+ channels ( NMDA channel s ) for example, etc. [ Plant physiology of magnesium ] The previous sections have dealt in detail with the chemical and biochemical aspects of Mg 2+ and its transport across cellular membranes. This section will apply this knowledge to aspects of whole plant physiology, in an attempt to show how these processes interact with the larger and more complex environment of the multicellular organism. [ Nutritional requirements and interactions ] Mg 2+ is essential for plant growth and is present in higher plants in amounts on the order of 80 μmol g −1 dry weight. The amounts of Mg 2+ vary in different parts of the plant and are dependent upon nutritional status. In times of plenty, excess Mg 2+ may be stored in vascular cells (Stelzer et al., 1990; and in times of starvation Mg 2+ is redistributed, in many plants, from older to newer leaves. [ Laing W. Greer, D., Sun, O., Beets, P., Lowe, A., and Payn, T. 2000 Physiological impacts of Mg deficiency in Pinus radiata: growth and photosynthesis New Phytol 146 47–57 10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00616.x ] Mg 2+ is taken up into plants via the roots. Interactions with other cations in the rhizosphere can have a significant effect on the uptake of the ion.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980; [ Heenan D.P. Campbell, L.C. 1981 Influence of potassium and manganese on growth and uptake of magnesium by soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv Bragg Plant Soil 61 447–456 10.1007/BF02182025 3 ] The structure of root cell walls is highly permeable to water and ions, and hence ion uptake into root cells, can occur anywhere from the root hairs to cells located almost in the centre of the root (limited only by the Casparian strip ). Plant cell walls and membranes carry a great number of negative charges and the interactions of cations with these charges is key to the uptake of cations by root cells allowing a local concentrating effect. [ Hope A.B. Stevens, P.G. 1952 Electrical potential differences in bean roots on their relation to salt uptake Australian Journal of Scientific Research, Series B 5 335–343 ] Mg 2+ binds relatively weakly to these charges, and can be displaced by other cations, impeding uptake and causing deficiency in the plant. Within individual plant cells the Mg 2+ requirements are largely the same as for all cellular life; Mg 2+ is used to stabilise membranes, is vital to the utilisation of ATP, is extensively involved in the nucleic acid biochemistry, and is a cofactor for many enzymes (including the ribosome). Also, Mg 2+ is the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. It is the intracellular compartmentalisation of Mg 2+ in plant cells that leads to additional complexity. Four compartments within the plant cell have reported interactions with Mg 2+. Initially Mg 2+ will enter the cell into the cytoplasm (by an as yet unidentified system), but free Mg 2+ concentrations in this compartment are tightly regulated at relatively low levels (≈2  mmol/L) and so any excess Mg 2+ is either quickly exported or stored in the second intracellular compartment, the vacuole. { Section 8.5.2 in Marschner, 1995 } The requirement for Mg 2+ in mitochondria has been demonstrated in yeast [ Bui D.M. Gregan, J., Jarosch, E., Ragnini, A., and Schweyen, R.J. 1999 The bacterial magnesium transporter CorA can functionally substitute for its putative homologue Mrs2p in the yeast inner mitochondrial membrane Journal of Biological Chemistry 274 20438–20443 10.1074/jbc.274.29.20438 10400670 29 ] and it seems highly likely that the same will apply in plants. The chloroplasts also require significant amounts of internal Mg 2+, and low concentrations of cytoplasmic Mg 2+. [ Demmig B. Gimmler, H. 1979 Effect of divalent cations on cation fluxes across the chloroplast envelope and on photosynthesis of intact chloroplasts Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung 24C 233–241 ] [ Huber S.C. Maury, W.J. 1980 Effects of Magnesium on Intact Chloroplasts: I. EVIDENCE FOR ACTIVATION OF (SODIUM) POTASSIUM/PROTON EXCHANGE ACROSS THE CHLOROPLAST ENVELOPE Plant Physiology 65 350–354 16661188 2 440325 10.1104/pp.65.2.350 ] In addition, it seems likely that the other subcellular organelles (e.g. Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.) also require Mg 2+. [ Distributing magnesium ions within the plant ] Once in the cytoplasmic space of root cells Mg 2+, along with the other cations, is probably transported radially into the stele and the vascular tissue. { Section 2.7 in Marschner, 1995 } From the cells surrounding the xylem the ions are released or pumped into the xylem and carried up through the plant. In the case of Mg 2+, which is highly mobile in both the xylem and phloem, { Section 3.3 in Marschner, 1995 } the ions will be transported to the top of the plant and back down again in a continuous cycle of replenishment. Hence, uptake and release from vascular cells is probably a key part of whole plant Mg 2+ homeostasis. Figure 1 shows how few processes have been connected to their molecular mechanisms (only vacuolar uptake has been associated with a transport protein, AtMHX). The diagram shows a schematic of a plant and the putative processes of Mg 2+ transport at the root and leaf where Mg 2+ is loaded and unloaded from the vascular tissues. Mg 2+ is taken up into the root cell wall space (1) and interacts with the negative charges associated with the cell walls and membranes. Mg 2+ may be taken up into cells immediately (symplastic pathway) or may travel as far as the Casparian band (4) before being absorbed into cells (apoplastic pathway; 2). The concentration of Mg 2+ in the root cells is probably buffered by storage in root cell vacuoles (3). Note that cells in the root tip do not contain vacuoles. Once in the root cell cytoplasm Mg 2+ travels towards the centre of the root by plasmodesmata, where it is loaded into the xylem (5) for transport to the upper parts of the plant. When the Mg 2+ reaches the leaves it is unloaded from the xylem into cells (6) and again is buffered in vacuoles (7). Whether cycling of Mg 2+ into the phloem occurs via general cells in the leaf (8) or directly from xylem to phloem via transfer cells (9) is unknown. Mg 2+ may return to the roots in the phloem sap. Figure 1: Magnesium in the whole plant When a Mg 2+ ion has been absorbed by a cell requiring it for metabolic processes, it is generally assumed that the ion stays in that cell for as long as the cell is active. In vascular cells this is not always the case; in times of plenty Mg 2+ is stored in the vacuole, takes no part in the day-to-day metabolic processes of the cell (Stelzer et al., 1990), and is released at need. But for most cells it is death by senescence or injury that releases Mg 2+ and many of the other ionic constituents, recycling them into healthy parts of the plant. Additionally, when Mg 2+ in the environment is limiting some species are able to mobilise Mg 2+ from older tissues. These processes involve the release of Mg 2+ from its bound and stored states and its transport back into the vascular tissue, where it can be distributed to the rest of the plant. In times of growth and development Mg 2+ is also remobilised within the plant as source and sink relationships change. The homeostasis of Mg 2+ within single plant cells is maintained by processes occurring at the plasma membrane and at the vacuole membrane (see Figure 2). The major driving force for the translocation of ions in plant cells is ΔpH. { Section 2.4 in Marschner, 1995 } H + -ATPases pump H + ions against their concentration gradient to maintain the pH differential that can be used for the transport of other ions and molecules. H + ions are pumped out of the cytoplasm into the extracellular space or into the vacuole. The entry of Mg 2+ into cells may occur through one of two pathways, via channels using the ΔΨ (negative inside) across this membrane or by symport with H + ions. To transport the Mg 2+ ion into the vacuole requires a Mg 2+ /H + antiport transporter (such as AtMHX). It is interesting to note that the H + -ATPases are dependent on Mg 2+ (bound to ATP) for activity, so that Mg 2+ is required to maintain its own homeostasis. A schematic of a plant cell is shown including the four major compartments currently recognised as interacting with Mg 2+. H + -ATPases maintain a constant ΔpH across the plasma membrane and the vacuole membrane. Mg 2+ is transported into the vacuole using the energy of ΔpH (in A. thaliana by AtMHX). Transport of Mg 2+ into cells may use either the negative ΔΨ or the ΔpH. The transport of Mg 2+ into mitochondria probably uses ΔΨ as in the mitochondria of yeast, and it is likely that chloroplasts take Mg 2+ by a similar system. The mechanism and the molecular basis for the release of Mg 2+ from vacuoles and from the cell is not known. Likewise the light-regulated Mg 2+ concentration changes in chloroplasts are not fully understood, but do require the transport of H + ions across the thylakoid membrane. Figure 2: Magnesium in the plant cell [ Magnesium, chloroplasts and photosynthesis ] Mg 2+ is the coordinating metal ion in the chlorophyll molecule, and in plants where the ion is in high supply about 6% of the total Mg 2+ is bound to chlorophyll. [ Scott B.J.

[ Fork D.C. 1986 The control by state transitions of the distribution of excitation energy in photosynthesis Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology 37 335–361 10.1146/annurev.arplant.37.1.335 ] Mg 2+ is probably taken up into chloroplasts to the greatest extent during the light induced development from proplastid to chloroplast or etioplast to chloroplast. At these times the synthesis of chlorophyll and the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane stacks absolutely require the divalent cation. [ Gregory R.P.F. 1989 Structure and function of the photosynthesising cell Biochemistry of Photosnythesis New York John Wiley and Sons ] [ Lu Y.-K. Chen, Y.-R., Yang, C.-M., and Ifuku, K. 1995 Influence of Fe- and Mg-deficiency on the thylakoid membranes of a chlorophyll-deficient ch5 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana Botanical Bulletin of Academia Sinica 36 ] Whether Mg 2+ is able to move into and out of chloroplasts after this initial developmental phase has been the subject of several conflicting reports. Deshaies et al. (1984) found that Mg 2+ did move in and out of isolated chloroplasts from young pea plants, [ Deshaies R.J. Fish, L.E., and Jagendorf, A.T. 1984 Permeability of Chloroplast Envelopes to Mg2+: Effects on Protein Synthesis Plant Physiology 74 956–961 16663541 4 1066800 10.1104/pp.74.4.956 ] but Gupta and Berkowitz (1989) were unable to reproduce the result using older spinach chloroplasts. [ Gupta A.S. Berkowitz, G.A. 1989 Development and Use of Chlorotetracycline Fluorescence as a Measurement Assay of Chloroplast Envelope-Bound Mg2+ Plant Physiology 89 753–761 10.1104/pp.89.3.753 16666617 3 1055918 ] Deshaies et al. had stated in their paper that older pea chloroplasts showed less significant changes in Mg 2+ content than those used to form their conclusions. Perhaps the relative proportion of immature chloroplasts present in the preparations might explain these observations. The metabolic state of the chloroplast changes considerably between night and day. During the day the chloroplast is actively harvesting the energy of light and converting it into chemical energy. The activation of the metabolic pathways involved comes from the changes in the chemical nature of the stroma on the addition of light. H + is pumped out of the stroma (into both the cytoplasm and the lumen) leading to an alkaline pH. [ Heldt H.W. Werdan, K., Milovancev, M., and Geller, G. 1973 Alkalization of the chloroplast stroma caused by light-dependent proton flux into the thylakoid space Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 314 224–241 10.1016/0005-2728(73)90137-0 4747067 2 ] [ Hind G.

[ Sharkey T.D. 1998 Photosynthetic carbon reduction Photosynthesis: A Comprehensive Treatise A. Raghavendra Cambridge Cambridge University Press 111–122 ] Examples of enzymes activated in response to these changes are fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose bisphosphatase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. During the dark period, if these enzymes were active a wasteful cycling of products and substrates would occur. Two major classes of the enzymes that interact with Mg 2+ in the stroma during the light phase can be identified. Firstly, enzymes in the glycolytic pathway most often interact with two atoms of Mg 2+. The first atom is as an allosteric modulator of the enzymes’ activity, while the second forms part of the active site and is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. The second class of enzymes include those where the Mg 2+ is complexed to nucleotide di- and tri-phosphates (ADP and ATP) and the chemical change involves phosphoryl transfer. Mg 2+ may also serve in a structural maintenance role in these enzymes (e.g. enolase). [ Magnesium stress ] [ magnesium deficiency (agriculture) ] Plant stress responses can be observed in plants that are under or over supplied with Mg 2+. The first observable signs of Mg 2+ stress in plants for both starvation and toxicity is a depression of the rate of photosynthesis, presumably because of the strong relationships between Mg 2+ and chloroplasts/chlorophyll. In pine trees, even before the visible appearance of yellowing and necrotic spots, the photosynthetic efficiency of the needles drops markedly. In Mg 2+ deficiency, reported secondary effects include carbohydrate immobility, loss of RNA transcription and loss of protein synthesis. { Section 8.5.6 of Marschner, 1995 } However, due to the mobility of Mg 2+ within the plant, the deficiency phenotype may be present only in the older parts of the plant. For example, in Pinus radiata starved of Mg 2+ one of the earliest identifying signs is the chlorosis in the needles on the lower branches of the tree. This is because Mg 2+ has been recovered from these tissues and moved to growing (green) needles higher in the tree. A Mg 2+ deficit can be caused by the lack of the ion in the media (soil), but more commonly comes from inhibition of its uptake. Mg 2+ binds quite weakly to the negatively charged groups in the root cell walls, so that excesses of other cations such as K +, NH 4+, Ca 2+ and Mn 2+ can all impede uptake.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980; In acid soils Al 3+ is a particularly strong inhibitor of Mg 2+ uptake. [ Rengel Z. Robinson, D.L. 1989 Competitive Al3+ Inhibition of Net Mg2+ Uptake by Intact Lolium multiflorum Roots : I. Kinetics Plant Physiology 91 1407–1413 10.1104/pp.91.4.1407 16667193 4 1062198 ] [ Marschner H. 1991 Root-induced changes in the availability of micronutrients in the rhizosphere Plant Roots: The Hidden Half Y. Waisel, A. Eshel, and U. Kafikfai New York Marcel Dekker ] The inhibition by Al 3+ and Mn 2+ is more severe than can be explained by simple displacement, hence it is possible that these ions bind to the Mg 2+ uptake system directly. In bacteria and yeast, such binding by Mn 2+ has already been observed. Stress responses in the plant develop as cellular processes halt due to a lack of Mg 2+ (e.g. maintenance of ΔpH across the plasma and vacuole membranes). Interestingly, in Mg 2+ -starved plants under low light conditions the percentage of Mg 2+ bound to chlorophyll has been recorded at 50%. [ Dorenstouter H. Pieters, G.A., and Findenegg, G.R. 1985 Distribution of magnesium between chloroplhyll and other photosynthetic functions in magnesium deficient &apos;sun&apos; and &apos;shade&apos; leaves of poplar Journal of Plant Nutrition 8 1088–1101 10.1080/01904168509363409 12 ] Presumably, this imbalance has detrimental effects on other cellular processes. Mg 2+ toxicity stress is more difficult to develop. When Mg 2+ is plentiful the plants generally take up the ion and store it (Stelzer et al., 1990). However, if this is followed by drought then ionic concentrations within the cell can increase dramatically. High cytoplasmic Mg 2+ concentrations block a K + channel in the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast, in turn inhibiting the removal of H + ions from the chloroplast stroma. This leads to an acidification of the stroma that inactivates key enzymes in carbon fixation, which all leads to the production of oxygen free radicals in the chloroplast that then cause oxidative damage.
