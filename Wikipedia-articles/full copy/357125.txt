[ Imaginary friend (disambiguation) ] Imaginary friends and imaginary companions are a psychological and social phenomenon where a friendship or other interpersonal relationship takes place in the imagination rather than external physical reality. Imaginary friends are fictional character s created for improvisation al role-playing. They often have elaborate personalities and behaviors. They may seem real to their creators, though they are ultimately unreal, as shown by studies. { Taylor, M. (1999) Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them. New York: Oxford University Press. } The first studies focusing on imaginary friends are believed to have been conducted during the 1890s. { A166239640 } Imaginary friends are made often in childhood, sometimes in adolescence, and rarely in adult hood. They often function as tutelaries when played with by a child. They reveal, according to several theories of psychology, a child&apos;s anxieties, fear s, goal s and perception s of the world through that child&apos;s conversation s. They are, according to some children, physically indistinguishable from real people, while others say they see their imaginary friends only in their heads. There&apos;s even a third category of imaginary friend recognition: when the child doesn&apos;t see the imaginary friend at all, but can only feel his/her presence. Imaginary friends are more often seen as abnormal in adults, whereas quite common in children. [ Purposes ] It has been theorized that children with imaginary companions may develop language skills and retain knowledge faster than children without them, which may be because these children get more linguistic practice while carrying out &quot; conversations &quot; with their imaginary friends than their peers get.

They provide comfort in times of stress, companionship when they&apos;re lonely, someone to boss around when they feel powerless, and someone to blame for the broken lamp in the living room. Most important, an imaginary companion is a tool young children use to help them make sense of the adult world. { Kutner, Lawrence (n.d.). Insights for Parents: Midnight Monsters and Imaginary Companions. Source: (accessed: Monday May 18, 2009) } Taylor, Carlson &amp; Gerow (c2001: p.  190) hold that:...despite some results suggesting that children with imaginary companions might be superior in intelligence, it is not true that all intelligent children create them. { Taylor, Marjorie; Carlson, Stephanie M.; Gerow, Lynn (c. 2001). &apos;Imaginary Companions: Characteristics and Correlatres&apos; in Reifel, Robert Stuart (2001). Theory in Context and Out. Greenwood Publishing Group. Edition: illustrated. ISBN 1-56750-486-8. Source: (accessed: Monday May 18, 2009) } A long-time popular misconception is that most children dismiss or forget the imaginary friend once they begin school and acquire real friends. According to one study, by the age of seven, sixty-five percent of children report that they have had an imaginary companion at some point in their lives.

Still, some children report creating or maintaining imaginary friends as pre-teens or teenagers. Few adults report having imaginary friends. Dr. Benjamin Spock believed that imaginary friends past age four indicated that something was &quot; lacking &quot; in the child or his environment. Some child development professionals still believe that the presence of imaginary friends past early childhood signals a serious psychiatric disorder. { News in Science – Imaginary friends open up fantastic world – 15 May 2006 } [ November 2011 ] [ http://specialchildren.about.com/od/booksonmentalhealth/gr/imaginaryfriend.htm Book Review: Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them Mauro Terry About.com 9 November 2011 ] Others disagree, saying that imaginary friends are common among school-age children and are part of normal social-cognitive development.
