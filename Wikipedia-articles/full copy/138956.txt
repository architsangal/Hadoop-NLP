The population was 1,112 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated communities of Brussels and Kolberg are located in the town. The unincorporated community of Rosiere is also located partially in the town. [ History ] Brussels, a civil town in Door County was created on November 12, 1858. The largest Belgian-American settlement in the United States [ June 2009 ] is located in portions of Brown, Kewaunee, and Door counties in Wisconsin, adjacent to the waters of Green Bay. Walloons settled the region in the 1850s and their descendants still constitute a high proportion of the population. A variety of elements attests to the Belgian-American presence: place names (Brussels, Namur, Rosiere, Luxemburg ), the Walloon language, [ July 2009 ] surnames, foods (booyah, trippe, and jutt), the Kerrniss harvest festival, and especially architecture. Many of the original wooden structures of the Belgian Americans were destroyed in a firestorm that swept across southern Door County in October 1871. A few stone houses made of local dolomite survived. More common are 1880s red brick houses, distinguished by modest size and gable-end, bull&apos;s-eye windows. Some houses have detached summer kitchens with bake ovens appended to the rear. And the Belgians, many of them devout Catholics, also erected small roadside votive chapels like those in their homeland.
