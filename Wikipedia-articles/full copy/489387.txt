The songwriting duo of Stephan Jenkins and Kevin Cadogan signed the band&apos;s first major label recording contract with Elektra records in 1996 resulting in two multi platinum albums. The band&apos;s lineup changed in 2000 ending the songwriting partnership of Kevin Cadogan and Stephan Jenkins. The band&apos;s current line-up is Stephan Jenkins ( vocals, guitar ), and Brad Hargreaves ( drums, percussion ). Guitarist Kryz Reid and bassist Abe Millett have replaced the departed Tony Fredianelli and Arion Salazar respectively. After the success of their eponymous debut album in 1997, the band released one more album, 1999&apos;s Blue, before guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released under controversial circumstances. { Julian Guthrie. He can see clearly now } In 2003, the band released Out of the Vein. In 2008, the band released the digital EP Red Star. After a six-year hiatus from releasing a full-length album, Ursa Major was released on August 17, 2009. A fifth album is also being worked on, without a tentative release date. The band is best known for the singles &quot; Semi-Charmed Life &quot;, &quot; How&apos;s It Going to Be &quot;, &quot; Graduate &quot;, &quot; Jumper &quot;, &quot; Never Let You Go &quot; and &quot; Deep Inside of You &quot;. Third Eye Blind has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. [ History ] [ Beginnings (1993–1996) ] Third Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. [ September 2011 ] In 1994, the band recorded its 2nd demo with band members: Kevin Cadogan on guitar, Steve Bowman on drums, Arion Salazar on bass, and Stephan Jenkins on vocals. [ September 2011 ] From late 1995 through early 1996, the band recorded its third demo with funds from RCA records to record with producer engineer Eric Valentine, which resulted in the band&apos;s gaining major label attention, including that of Clive Davis, who invited the band to perform a showcase for Arista Records in New York City. { Whiting, Sam. Third Eye Blind Spots a Big Gig. } { San Francisco Chronicle, April 13, 1996. Retrieved 2008-03-29. } During Third Eye Blind concerts at the time, it was customary for the band to have a piñata release candy above their mosh pits, yet at the showcase for the record executives, lead singer Stephan Jenkins released live cricket s from the piñata instead. With regard to the name of the band, Jenkins indicated during a radio interview that the name came from the metaphysical idea of a mind&apos;s eye, the topic of a book he had read. The other group members liked it and chose it as the official name. In April 1996, after Jenkins had challenged Epic Records executive Dave Massey in a meeting, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. In an unlikely scenario for an opening act, the band was invited back for an encore after playing their initial set { Ganahl, Jane. Blind Faith. } { San Francisco Examiner, November 9, 1997.

Rappers The Braids Get A Big Break. San Francisco Chronicle, October 27, 1996. Retrieved 2008-03-29. } Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, and after a showcase in Los Angeles, Kevin Cadogan and Stephan Jenkins signed as artists professionally known as Third Eye Blind with Sylvia Rhone of Elektra Records because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. [ Success (1997–2000) ] Third Eye Blind&apos;s first album, Third Eye Blind was released in 1997. The album had 5 singles: &quot; Semi-Charmed Life &quot;, &quot; Graduate &quot;, &quot; How&apos;s It Going to Be &quot;, &quot; Losing a Whole Year &quot;, and &quot; Jumper &quot;. &quot; Semi-Charmed Life &quot; peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for 8 weeks. The band also performed &quot; How&apos;s It Going to Be &quot; on Saturday Night Live. To date their eponymous debut has been the group&apos;s most successful album, selling 7 million copies in the U.S. alone.

Although not received as well as Third Eye Blind, the album sold 75,000 copies the first week of release and by 2003 had sold 1.25 million in the U.S. { Hasty, Katey. &quot; Marilyn Manson Posts &apos;Grotesque&apos; At No. 1 &quot;. } { billboard.com.

In early 2000, shortly after the release of the album, Kevin Cadogan was released from the band. Cadogan filed suit, alleging wrongful termination, adding that his production, recording, and songwriter royalties were withheld since being kicked out of the band. { Martens, Todd. &quot; Ex-Third Eye Blind Guitarist&apos;s Suit Heads to Trial &quot;. } { billboard.com.

Two singles were released from the album; &quot; Blinded &quot;, and &quot; Crystal Baller &quot;. Out of the Vein did not sell as well as its predecessors, with numbers estimated around 500,000 copies as of March 2007. { Uhelszki, Jaan. &quot; Third Eye Blind&apos;s Second Coming &quot;.

May 14, 2004. } and the only music video created from the album was for the single &quot; Blinded &quot;. Due to the merger, the band found themselves without label support, as Jenkins said, &quot; Our record company ceased to exist. The month the record was released, Elektra Records imploded. &quot; In May 2004, Warner Music cut Third Eye Blind, along with over 80 other acts, from its roster. While no specific reason was given for Third Eye Blind being cut, Atlantic co-chairman Craig Kallman said the cuts were made to get Atlantic&apos;s roster down to an appropriate size where &quot; we can give each of our acts top priority. &quot; It would be over six years after the release of Out of the Vein until the band would release another full-length album. In the meantime, the band did release &quot; A Collection &quot;, in 2006. This album was a collection of songs from the first three albums. Jude Gold, associate editor of Guitar Player Magazine, recognized that the liner notes falsely credited guitarist Tony Fredianelli with the creative work of former guitarist Kevin Cadogan, who was completely omitted from the bands biography included in the liner notes, which state: &quot; As always, the band profited from the musical interplay between Tony Fredianelli, Stephan Jenkins, Arion Salazar and Brad Hargreaves &quot;. In regards to this, Gold stated &quot; Its like saying Gun&apos;s N Roses music always profited from the interplay between Axl Rose and guitarist Bucket Head &quot;. { Gold, Jude Third Eye Blind; A collection album review, Guitar Player Magazine, Aug, 2006 } [ Red Star and Ursa Major (2007–2009) ] For the 10th anniversary of the release of Third Eye Blind&apos;s debut album, the band performed at the Fillmore on March 13 and 14, 2007.
