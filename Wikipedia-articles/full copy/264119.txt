[ http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0823/labour.html Rabbitte resigns as Labour leader RTÉ News 23 August 2007 ] [ Early life ] Patrick Rabbitte was born in 1949 near Claremorris and brought up in Woodstock, Ballindine, County Mayo. He was educated locally at St Colman&apos;s College, Claremorris before emigrating to Britain to find employment. He returned shortly afterwards to attend University College Galway where he studied Arts and Law. While at university Rabbitte became involved in several college movements before serving as President of the NUI, Galway Students&apos; Union in 1970–1971. Between 1972 and 1974 he achieved national attention when he served as President of the national Union of Students in Ireland (USI). Following the completion of his presidency in 1974 he became an official in the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (ITGWU), becoming National Secretary for the union in 1980. Rabbitte became involved in electoral politics for the first time in 1985 when he was elected to Dublin County Council. At the 1989 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Workers&apos; Party TD for Dublin South–West. He has retained his seat at every election since as a Workers&apos; Party, then Democratic Left and now a Labour Party TD.

He and some others who had come from the USI via the trade union movement were seen as wanting to bring the party more to the centre. { For this and other affirmations, listen to In Conversations with Eamon Dunphy, RTÉ Radio 1, 8 September 2007. } This led Rabbitte, Eamon Gilmore and others to earn the nickname &quot; The Student Princes &quot;. In 1992 Rabbitte played a prominent role with Proinsias De Rossa in an attempt to jettison some of its more hard left positions. This eventually split the party. { See &quot; Patterns of Betrayal, The flight from Socialism, Repsol, Dublin 1992. } [ In government ] In 1994 a new Rainbow Coalition government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left came to power. Rabbitte was a member of the junior ministerial team, serving as Minister of State to the Government, as well as Minister for State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology. During his tenure as a junior minister Rabbitte was instrumental in establishing an anti-drugs strategy as well as enacting legislation which gave the Credit union movement more authority. Rabbitte also decided to locate the proposed new state backed Technology Campus for West Dublin, based on high speed telecommunication links, at CityWest Business Campus beside the N7 motorway, near Clondalkin. [ Labour Party leader and aftermath ] Following the 1997 general election the Rainbow Coalition lost power. The following year saw a merger between the Labour Party and Democratic Left, with Rabbitte participating in the negotiations. In October 2002 Rabbitte succeeded Ruairi Quinn as the new leader of the Labour Party. Under his leadership the party has made some gains in the local elections of 2004. Rabbitte has been described as an extremely good performer in the Dáil, often outshining his Fine Gael counterpart Enda Kenny. He is also noted for his anti- Fianna Fáil rhetoric. Under Rabbitte the Labour Party agreed to enter a pre-election pact with Fine Gael in an attempt to offer the electorate an alternative coalition government at the 2007 general election, which took place in May 2007. This was commonly known as &apos;The Mullingar Accord&apos; and the proposed alternative government was called &apos;The Alliance for change&apos;. The Green Party were also anticipated to be likely members of the coalition government on the basis of agreed points of view on many issues covered by the Mullingar Accord. This move is rumoured to have caused some tension in the parliamentary party, as some members would prefer not to be aligned with any party in advance of an election. The election result did not return a sufficient number of seats for the Alliance for Change to occupy government, even with the support of the Green Party. Rabbitte himself commented on the election result: &quot; This leaves Mr. Ahern in the driving seat &quot;. Negotiations between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party resulted in a government being formed on 13 June 2007. Following the disappointing result in the election for Labour, Rabbitte announced he was stepping down as leader on the 23 August 2007. He said in his resignation statement.

He was succeeded as party leader by Eamon Gilmore. Rabbitte gained strong public attention on 18 November 2010 when he angrily criticised the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Pat Carey, when they appeared together on the Prime Time television programme.

His running mate Eamonn Maloney was also elected. On 9 March 2011, he was appointed as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. [ Ministerial career ] Rabbitte was appointed Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources after the 2011 general election. The columnist Fintan O&apos;Toole, writing in The Irish Times in August 2011, criticised the lack of royalties system for gas and oil in Ireland. He claimed that &quot; The State is about to sign away almost all our resources on terms by far the worst in the developed world &quot;.
