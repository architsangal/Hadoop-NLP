Most inline-triples employ a crank angle of 120°, and are thus rotationally balanced, however, since the three cylinders are offset from each other, the firing of the end cylinders induces a rocking motion from end to end, since there is no opposing cylinder moving in the opposite direction as in a rotationally balanced straight-six engine. The use of a balance shaft in an antiphase to that vibration produces a smoothly running engine. [ Inline 3-cylinder engines http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/smooth1.htm#Inline%203-cylinder%20engines Mark Wan - AutoZine Technical School AutoZine.org 3 January 2010 ] An exception to the 120° crankshaft can be found in some of the inline-three engines made by motorcycle manufacturer Laverda. In these engines (sometimes referred to as 180° triples), the outer pistons rise and fall together like a 360° straight-two engine. The inner cylinder is offset 180° from the outer cylinders. In these engines, cylinder #1 fires, then 180° later cylinder #2 fires, and then 180° later cylinder #3 fires. There is no power stroke on the final 180° of rotation. [ Automobile use ] A tuned version of a Saab inline-three-cylinder two-stroke engine { Suzuki K10B } The smallest inline-three, four-stroke automobile engine was the [ 543 cc 1 on ] Suzuki F5A, which was first used in the 1979 Suzuki Alto / Fronte. Smart currently produces a diminutive [ 799 cc 1 ] inline-three diesel engine, the smallest automotive diesel engine yet. [ November 2009 ] Most inline-three engines fall below 1.2   litre s, with a [ 1198 cc 1 ] Volkswagen Group unit seen as the largest petrol engine. A [ 1779 cc 1 ] diesel engine was produced by VM Motori to the 1984 Alfa Romeo 33 1.8  TD, the largest inline-three produced for automotive use. Basic versions of the Suzuki Swift/Forsa and related Chevy Sprint/Geo Metro/Chevy Metro/Pontiac Firefly used an inline-three. Some Daihatsu cars use inline-triple engines. The Charade and the Mira/Cuore used (or are still fitted with) this engine type. Three-cylinder 1.0  litre diesel and turbo diesel engines were also offered in Daihatsu Charades. Korean cars Daewoo Tico, based on the 1988 Suzuki Alto, and later base versions of Daewoo Matiz also used inline-three [ 796 cc 1 ] [ 41 hp kW PS 0 in ] S-TEC petrol engine. The Volkswagen Group is known for using three-cylinder petrol and diesel engines; in the Audi A2, Volkswagen Polo, Volkswagen Fox, SEAT Ibiza and Škoda Fabia. The engines in these cars range from 1.2  litre petrol [ New VW Fox in depth http://www.worldcarfans.com/10504049256/6 Volkswagen AG WorldCarFans.com 2005-04-04 2009-08-18 ] with four valves per cylinder that deliver [ 47 to 65 kW PS bhp 0 on ], to 1.4 TDI diesels= [ New Audi A2 1.4 TDI with 90 bhp engine http://www.worldcarfans.com/103111011117/new-audi-a2-14-tdi-with-90-bhp-engine 2003-11-10 AUDI AG WorldCarFans.com 2009-08-22 ] that deliver [ 51 to 66 kW PS bhp 0 on ] and have turbos with variable vane geometry and deliver outstanding economy, this particular engine is used in small cars of all marques of the Volkswagen Group. The most innovative three-cylinder engine the Volkswagen Group released was the 1.2 TDI diesel, [ Audi A2 1.2 TDI: the three-litre car from Audi http://www.audiworld.com/news/99/a2_2/content.shtml 1999-11-28 AUDI AG - press release AudiWorld.com 2009-08-22 ] it was one of the first all-aluminium diesel engines, and at the time of release it was the lightest and most economic engine in production. It was used in the &quot; 3L &quot; versions (from its diminutive fuel consumption of only [ 3 l/100 km 1 or ] ) of the Audi A2 and the Volkswagen Lupo. Subaru also used an inline-triple in the Subaru Justy and the export version of the Subaru Sambar, called the Subaru Sumo, using their Subaru EF engine. Mitsubishi has also made extensive use of three-cylinder engines. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Saab 93, Saab 95, Saab 96, and certain Dampf-Kraft-Wagen (DKW) automobiles were powered by inline-three-cylinder, two-stroke engine s. Also, the Wartburg automobiles manufactured in Eastern Germany, and FSO Syrena manufactured in Poland, used this kind of engine. The first-generation Honda Insight (2000 –2006) used a 1.0  litre inline-three engine in conjunction with an electric motor in its hybrid system. TPCA are using a common inline-three-cylinder engine in models of Aygo, 107 and C1 respectively, but derived from Daihatsu. Ford started offering their new 1.0 Ecoboost unit in the Focus from 2012. This new engine features several innovations, including the use of an unbalanced flywheel to remove the need to use balancer shafts. [ Motorcycle use ] { Triumph Rocket III has a 2.3  L straight-three engine } { alt=Closeup picture of a motorcycle engine with three heavily chromed exhaust pipes coming out of the side } [ Four-stroke ] A four-stroke inline-triple has been used by Aprilia, Laverda, Triumph, Yamaha, BMW, Benelli, Petronas, MV Agusta and BSA. The Triumph Rocket III has a [ 2294 cc 1 on ] inline-triple engine. The company produces a number of triples. { Popular Mechanics Mar 1998 } [ Two-stroke ] Between 1972 and 1977, Suzuki made three two-stroke examples; the water-cooled GT750, and the air-cooled GT550 and GT380, and between 1969 and 1978, Kawasaki triple motorcycles produced air-cooled engines with capacities of 250  cc, 350  cc, 400  cc, 500  cc, and 750  cc. { 365 Motorcycles You Must Ride.

The may also be used in general industrial applications. An example is the Fairbanks-Morse 32E14 slow-speed diesel engine which is shown coupled to a water pump.
