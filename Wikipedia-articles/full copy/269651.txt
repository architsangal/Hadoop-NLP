It is the largest commercial airport in the state, handling 5,888,811 passengers in 2009. [ http://www.cabq.gov/airport/sunport-information/facts-figures Sunport Facts &amp; Figures February 12, 2009 City of Albuquerque ] [ October 2010 H3llBot ] The airport serves Albuquerque and Santa Fe (also served by Santa Fe Municipal Airport ). [ History ] Albuquerque in the 1930s was served by two private airports, West Mesa Airport and Oxnard Field. Around 1935 it was suggested that the city build a new public airport using WPA money. Having secured $520,500 USD in funding, Governor Clyde Tingley broke ground for the project on February 28, 1937. Albuquerque Municipal Airport opened in 1939 with two paved runways, a Pueblo Style terminal building designed by Ernest Blumenthal, and a massive hangar designed to accommodate the new Boeing 307. { Biebel, Charles D. (1986). Making the Most of It: Public Works in Albuquerque during the Great Depression 1929–1942. Albuquerque: The Albuquerque Museum, pp. 66–67. } The April 1957 OAG shows 31 weekday departures: 13 on Continental, 12 TWA and 6 Frontier. The present terminal was constructed in 1965 on a site just east of the original terminal. It has since been expanded twice, first in the late 1980s and most recently in 1996. The old terminal has been restored and currently houses offices of the Transportation Security Administration. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. [ Military faciliities and operations ] The Sunport took on a new role in 1940 when it was designated Albuquerque Army Air Base, the precursor to today&apos;s Kirtland Air Force Base. The airport continues to share its runways with Kirtland AFB, which also handles rescue and firefighting operations. An Air Force Material Command (AFMC) installation, the host unit is the 377th Air Base Wing (377 ABW). Flying units at Kirtland AFB consist of the 58th Special Operations Wing (58 SOW) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the 150th Fighter Wing (150 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the New Mexico Air National Guard. [ Future developments ] The Airport Master Plan drafted in 2002 lays out intermediate- and long-term projects at the Sunport, including the removal of Runway 17/35 and the construction of a second terminal. The second terminal will be built by demand of increasing traffic. The runway closure recommendation is based on a number of factors, including safety, noise abatement, and the cost of continued upkeep. Because 17/35 intersects all three of the other runways, it has the highest risk of runway incursion s; therefore air traffic control prefers not to use the runway unless absolutely necessary. The prevailing winds are from the west, and even during strong winds, the other runways can cover departure and landing. Currently, most of the runway&apos;s use is general aviation. In the longer term, the plan calls for a new terminal to be built to the northeast of the existing terminal. A people mover system will connect the terminal with parking facilities and the existing terminal.

More recent data from the FAA shows the annual operations for the five year period from 2005–2009 are: 2005: 196,699; 2006: 192,241; 2007: 190,780; 2008: 180,553; 2009: 158,529 { Air Traffic Activity System http://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/opsnet-server-x.asp } The airport&apos;s freight center moved 67,000  tons of cargo in 2008. { sister cities } [ Airlines and destinations ] Albuquerque International Sunport has a single terminal with 25 gates in three concourses, including a concourse for commuter airline gates. Concourse A has 13 gates: A1 – A12, A14. Concourse B has 9 gates: B1, B3-B10 (Gate B2 was removed during the security hall and low B gate bathroom expansion). Concourse E has 2 gates: E1 &amp; E2. Concourse C consisted of three gates (C1, C2, &amp; C3). It was mostly used by Trans World Airlines. It was closed in the early 2000s and has mostly been converted to office space. Concourse D was a ground-level commuter aircraft concourse that was used by Great Plains Airlines and Rio Grande Air. It was closed in 2004 after Great Plains Airlines liquidated due to insolvency.
