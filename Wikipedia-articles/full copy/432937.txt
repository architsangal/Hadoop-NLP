[ Roman baths Roman Baths (disambiguation) ] [ buildings used for Roman recreation and cleaning the activity in general Ancient Roman bathing ] { Roman public baths in } { Bath, England. The entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is a later reconstruction. } { laser scan technology } In ancient Rome, thermae (from Greek thermos, &quot; hot &quot; ) and balnea (Greek βαλανείον, balaneion) were facilities for bathing. Thermae usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes, while balneae were smaller-scale facilities, public or private, that existed in great numbers throughout Rome. { Harry B. Evans, Water Distribution in Ancient Rome (University of Michigan Press, 1994, 1997), pp. 9–10 online. } Most Roman cities had at least one, if not many, such buildings, which were centers not only for bathing, but socializing. Roman bath-houses were also provided for private villa s, town houses, and forts. They were supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream, or more normally, by an aqueduct. The water could be heated from a log fire before being channeled into the hot bathing rooms. The design of baths is discussed by Vitruvius in De Architectura. [ Terminology ] { Sabratha, } { Libya, showing bathing sandals, three strigils, and the slogan &apos;&apos;SALVOM LAVISSE&apos;&apos;, &quot; A bath is good for you &quot; More literally, &quot; It is a healthful thing to have bathed. &quot; } Thermae, balneae, balineae, balneum and balineum are all commonly translated as &quot; bath &quot; or &quot; baths &quot;. Later usage of the terms loses the distinctions made by earlier authors. Balneum or balineum, derived from the Greek βαλανείον { Varro, De Ling. Lat. ix. 68, ed. Müller (cited by Rich, 183) } signifies, in its primary sense, a bath or bathing-vessel, such as most persons of any consequence amongst the Romans possessed in their own houses, { Cicero, Ad Atticum ii. 3. } and hence the chamber which contained the bath, { Cicero, Ad Fam. xiv. 20 (cited by Rich, 183). } which is also the proper translation of the word balnearium. The diminutive balneolum is adopted by Seneca { Ep. 86 (cited by Rich, 183) } to designate the bathroom of Scipio, in the villa at Liternum, and is expressly used to characterise the modesty of republican manners as compared with the luxury of his own times. But when the baths of private individuals became more sumptuous, and comprised many rooms, instead of the one small chamber described by Seneca, the plural balnea or balinea was adopted, which still, in correct language, had reference only to the baths of private persons. Thus Cicero terms the baths at the villa of his brother Quintus { Ad Q. Frat. iii. 1. § 1 (cited by Rich, 183) } balnearia. Balneae and balineae, which according to Varro { De Ling. Lat. viii. 25, ix. 41, ed. Müller (cited by Rich, 183) } have no singular number, were the public baths. But this accuracy of diction is neglected by many of the subsequent writers, and particularly by the poets, amongst whom balnea is not uncommonly used in the plural number to signify the public baths, since the word balneae could not be introduced in an hexameter verse. Pliny also, in the same sentence, makes use of the neuter plural balnea for public, and of balneum for a private bath. { Ep. ii. 17. (cited by Rich, 184) } Thermae (which comes from the Greek adjective thermos, hot) meant properly warm springs, or baths of warm water; but came to be applied to those magnificent edifices which grew up under the empire, in place of the simple balneae of the republic, and which comprised within their range of buildings all the appurtenances belonging to the Greek gymnasia, as well as a regular establishment appropriated for bathing. { Juv. Sat. vii. 233 (cited by Rich, 184) } Writers, however, use these terms without distinction. Thus the baths erected by Claudius Etruscus, the freedman of the Emperor Claudius, are styled by Statius { Sylv. i. 5. 13 (cited by Rich, 184) } balnea, and by Martial { vi. 42 (cited by Rich, 184) } Etrusci thermulae. In an epigram by Martial { ix. 76 (cited by Rich, 184) } —subice balneum thermis—the terms are not applied to the whole building, but to two different chambers in the same edifice. [ Building layout ] Plan of the Old Baths at Pompeii (click to enlarge) A public bath was built around three principal rooms: the caldarium (hot bath), the tepidarium (warm bath) and the frigidarium (cold bath). Some thermae also featured steam baths: the sudatorium, a moist steam bath, and the laconicum, a dry steam bath much like a modern sauna. By way of illustration, this article will describe the layout of Pompeii &apos;s Old Baths adjoining the forum, which are among some of the best-preserved Roman baths. The references are to the floor plan pictured to the right. { The following is adapted from the 1898 } { Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities entry edited by } { Harry Thurston Peck. } The whole building comprises a double set of baths, one for men and the other for women. It has six different entrances from the street, one of which (b) gives admission to the smaller women&apos;s set only. Five other entrances lead to the men&apos;s department, of which two (c and c2), communicate directly with the furnaces, and the other three (a3, a2, a) with the bathing apartments. [ Atrium ] Passing through the principal entrance, a, which is removed from the street by a narrow footway surrounding the building and after descending three steps, the bather finds a small chamber on his left (x) which contained a water closet ( latrina ), and proceeds into a covered portico (g, g), which ran round three sides of an open court ( atrium, A). These together formed the vestibule of the baths (vestibulum balnearum { Pro Cael. 26 (cited by Peck) } ), in which the servants waited. [ Use of the atrium ] This atrium was the exercise ground for the young men, or perhaps served as a promenade for visitors to the baths. Within this court the keeper of the baths (balneator), who exacted the quadrans paid by each visitor, was also stationed. The room f, which runs back from the portico, might have been appropriated to him; but most probably it was an oecus or exedra, for the convenience of the better classes while awaiting the return of their acquaintances from the interior. In this court, advertisements for the theatre, or other announcements of general interest, were posted up, one of which, announcing a gladiator ial show, still remains. At the sides of the entrance were seats (scholae). [ Apodyterium and frigidarium ] { apodyterium &apos;&apos; } { frigidarium &apos;&apos; } A passage (e) leads into the apodyterium (B), a room for undressing in which all visitors must have met before entering the baths proper. Here, the bathers removed their clothing, which was taken in charge by slaves known as capsarii, notorious in ancient times for their dishonesty. { Dig. xlvii. 17 (cited by Peck) } The apodyterium was a spacious chamber, with stone seats along two sides of the wall (h, h). Holes are still visible on the walls, and probably mark the places where the pegs for the bathers&apos; clothes were set. The chamber was lighted by a glass window, and had six doors. One of these led to the tepidarium (D) and another to the frigidarium (C), with its cold plunge-bath (referred to as loutron, natatio, natatorium, piscina, baptisterium or puteus; the terms &quot; natatio &quot; and &quot; natatorium &quot; suggest that some of those baths were also swimming pool s ). The bath in this chamber is of white marble, approached by two marble steps. [ Tepidarium ] { tepidarium &apos;&apos; } From the frigidarium the bather who wished to go through the warm bath and sweating process entered the tepidarium (D). It did not contain water either at Pompeii or at the baths of Hippias, but was merely heated with warm air of an agreeable temperature, in order to prepare the body for the great heat of the vapour and warm baths, and, upon returning, to prevent a too-sudden transition to the open air. In the baths at Pompeii this chamber also served as an apodyterium for those who took the warm bath. The walls feature a number of separate compartments or recesses for receiving the garments when taken off. The compartments are divided from each other by figures of the kind called Atlantes or Telamones, which project from the walls and support a rich cornice above them. Three bronze benches were also found in the room, which was heated as well by its contignity to the hypocaust of the adjoining chamber, as by a brazier of bronze ( foculus ), in which the charcoal ashes were still remaining when the excavation was made. Sitting and perspiring beside such a brazier was called ad flammam sudare. { Suet. Aug. 82 (cited by Peck) } [ Use of the tepidarium ] The tepidarium is generally the most highly ornamented room in baths. It was merely a room to sit in and be anointed in. In the Old Baths at Pompeii the floor is mosaic, the arched ceiling adorned with stucco and painting on a coloured ground, the walls red. Anointing was performed by slaves called unctores and aliptae. It sometimes took place before going to the hot bath, and sometimes after the cold bath, before putting on the clothes, in order to check the perspiration. { Galen. x. 49 (cited by Peck) } Some baths had a special room ( destrictarium or unctorium ) for this purpose. [ Caldarium ] [ Caldarium ] { caldarium &apos;&apos;, as it is in the Old Baths } From the tepidarium a door opened into the caldarium (E), whose mosaic floor was directly above the furnace or hypocaust. Its walls also were hollow, forming a great flue filled with heated air. At one end was a round basin (labrum), and at the other a quadrangular bathingplace (puelos, alveus, solium, calida piscina), approached from the platform ( schola ) by steps. The labrum held cold water, for pouring upon the bather&apos;s head before he left the room. These basins are of marble in the Old Baths, but we hear of alvei of solid silver. { Plin. H. N.xxxiii. 152 (cited by Peck) } Because of the great heat of the room, the caldarium was but slightly ornamented. [ Laconicum ] The Old Baths have no laconicum, which was a chamber still hotter than the caldarium, and used simply as a sweating-room, having no bath. It was said to have been introduced at Rome by Agrippa { Dio Cass. liii. 27 (cited by Peck) } and was also called sudatorium and assa. [ Service areas ] A three-tiered water boiler (&apos;&apos;miliarium&apos;&apos;) The apodyterium has a passage (q) communicating with the mouth of the furnace (r), called praefurnium or propigneum; and, passing down that passage, we reach the chamber M, into which the praefurnium projects, and which is entered from the street at c. It was assigned to the fornacatores, or persons in charge of the fires. Of its two staircases, one leads to the roof of the baths, and one to the boiler s containing the water. There were three boilers, one of which (caldarium vas) held the hot water; a second, the tepid (tepidarium); and the third, the cold (frigidarium). The warm water was turned into the warm bath by a pipe through the wall, marked on the plan. Underneath the hot chamber was set the circular furnace d, of more than 7  ft. in diameter, which heated the water and poured hot air into the hollow cells of the hypocaustum. It passed from the furnace under the first and last of the caldrons by two flues, which are marked on the plan. The boiler containing hot water was placed immediately over the furnace; and, as the water was drawn out from there, it was supplied from the next, the tepidarium, which was raised a little higher and stood a little way off from the furnace. It was already considerably heated from its contiguity to the furnace and the hypocaust below it, so that it supplied the deficiency of the former without materially diminishing its temperature; and the vacuum in this last was again filled up from the farthest removed, which contained the cold water received directly from the square reservoir seen behind them. The boilers themselves no longer remain, but the impressions which they have left in the mortar in which they were imbedded are clearly visible, and enable us to determine their respective positions and dimensions. Such coppers or boilers appear to have been called miliaria, from their similarity of shape to a milestone. { Pallad. i. 40; v. 8 (cited by Peck) } Behind the boilers, another corridor leads into the court or atrium (K) appropriated to the servants of the bath. [ Women&apos;s bath ] The women&apos;s bath The adjoining, smaller set of baths were assigned to the women. The entrance is by the door b, which conducts into a small vestibule (m) and from there into the apodyterium (H), which, like the one in the men&apos;s bath, has a seat (pulvinus, gradus) on either side built up against the wall. This opens upon a cold bath (J), answering to the natatio of the men&apos;s set, but of much smaller dimensions. There are four steps on the inside to descend into it. Opposite to the door of entrance into the apodyterium is another doorway which leads to the tepidarium (G), which also communicates with the thermal chamber (F), on one side of which is a warm bath in a square recess, and at the farther extremity the labrum. The floor of this chamber is suspended, and its walls perforated for flues, like the corresponding one in the men&apos;s baths. The tepidarium in the women&apos;s baths had no brazier, but it had a hanging or suspended floor. [ Purpose ] The baths often included, aside from the three main rooms listed above, a palaestra, or outdoor gymnasium where men would engage in various ball games and exercises. There, among other things, weights were lifted and the discus thrown. Men would oil themselves (as soap was still a luxury good and thus not widely available), shower, [ March 2007 ] and remove the excess with a strigil (cf. the well known Apoxyomenus of Lysippus from the Vatican Museum ). Often wealthy bathers would bring a capsarius, a slave that carried his master&apos;s towels, oils, and strigils to the baths and then watched over them once in the baths, as thieves and pickpockets were known to frequent the baths. The changing room was known as the apodyterium (Greek apodyterion, apo + duo &quot; to take off &quot; here of clothing). [ Cultural significance ] In many ways, baths were the ancient Roman equivalent of community centers. Because the bathing process took so long, conversation was necessary. Many Romans would use the baths as a place to invite their friends to dinner parties, and many politicians would go to the baths to convince fellow Romans to join their causes. The thermae had many attributes in addition to the baths. There were libraries, rooms for poetry readings, and places to buy and eat food. The modern equivalent would be a combination of a library, art gallery, mall, restaurant, gym, and spa. { http://books.google.com/books?id=R6tz_TzSVkAC &amp; lpg=PP1 &amp; ots=cGyel76oug &amp; dq=roman%20thermae &amp; lr &amp; pg=PR9#v=onepage &amp; q=roman%20thermae &amp; f=false } The Romans believed that good health came from bathing, eating, massages, and exercise. The baths, therefore, had all of these things in abundance. Since some citizens would be bathing multiple times a week, Roman society was surprisingly clean. { Andrews, Cath. “Ancient Roman Baths: Cleanliness and Godliness under one roof.” Explore Italian Culture. Web. 4/22/12. } When asked by a foreigner why he bathed once a day, a Roman emperor is said to have replied &quot; Because I do not have the time to bathe twice a day. &quot; { http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostempires/roman/day.html } Emperors often built baths to gain favor for themselves and to create a lasting monument of their generosity. If a rich Roman wished to gain the favor of the people, he might arrange for a free admission day in his name. For example, a senator hoping to become a Tribune might pay all admission fees at a particular bath on his birthday to become well known to the people of the area. [ Location ] Baths sprung up all over the empire. Where natural hot spring s existed (as in Bath, England, Băile Herculane, Romania or Serdica, Bulgaria ) thermae were built around them. Alternatively, a system of hypocaust a (Greek hypocauston &lt; hypo &quot; below &quot; + kaio &quot; to burn &quot; ) were utilized to heat the piped water from a furnace (praefurnium). [ Remains of Roman public baths ] [ List of remains of Roman public baths ] A number of Roman public baths survive, either as ruins or in varying degrees of conservation. Among the more notable are the Roman baths of Bath in England as well as the Baths of Caracalla, of Diocletian, of Titus, of Trajan in Rome and the baths of Varna. { http://www.ancient-bulgaria.com/2008/05/09/the-roman-thermae-in-varna/ } [ Other thermae attractions ] Visitors to the bath house could also play on the playing grounds, look at books from the libraries, visit the exhibition halls, and admire the covered walkways with fountains and landscaped gardens. They could go to the barber for a trim, the beautician for a relaxing afternoon, the gym for a quick workout, or get a snack. { Usborne Timetours: A Visitor&apos;s Guide to Ancient Rome, pp.13 } [ See also ] [ Ancient Roman thermae ] Aqueducts Roman culture Roman aqueducts Roman architecture Roman engineering Roman technology Spa town Hygiene Diocletian window (thermal window) Sauna Turkish Bath Onsen History of sanitation [ References ] [ Anthony Rich Balneae 183 et seq ] [ Balneae ] [ Aaland Mikkel May 15, 1998 http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/massbathing.htm Mass Bathing: The Roman BaInea and Thermae Cyber-Bohemia August 2, 2006 ] [ Footnotes ] [ External links ] William Smith Roman Baths (Balneae) from &quot; A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities &quot;, pub.
