And in fact, it is sat on the strategic position of a limestone base overlooking the valley of Ardèche.Due to the long distance from a water source, the city was known informally as the city without water until the 19th century, when on 28 June 1863, under the leadership of the then Mayor John Mathon, water was pumped from an external source which fed 50 fountains across the city.At the foot of the promontory pass route of Montélimar to Le Puy-en-Velay, lies the oldest axis of movement between the Rhone valley and the mountains of Auvergne. The privileged location between l&apos;Ardèche méridionale (Southern Ardèche) and l&apos;Ardèche verte (Green Ardèche) allowed for a crossroads between different types of agriculture and business. [ The Middle Ages ] The hill on which the city is built is mentioned during the 5th century AD. It tells of a conflict between the bishops of the hill and the bishops of Viviers, which is a local commune in the same modern day department; for the construction of a fortress. By 1084, the bishop of the hill won the lengthy conflict. The area became the possession of the Baron, Montlaur; all the way from the Ardèche mountains to what is now the western border of the current day department of Ardèche.The Baron&apos;s family reigned 1084 to 1441 and built the tower, the wall and two large, round towers of the castle which is surrounded by a moat that is why in French Aubenas is called &quot; La cité des Montlaur &quot;. The lords who were not only at the origin of the economic growth of the city, but also the social and material development of its residents. Their motto was: &quot; Montlaur, au plus haut! &quot;. [ Renaissance ] During the Renaissance, the city became Protestant, and after the third war of religion, the residents refused to allow royal troops within the city walls.
