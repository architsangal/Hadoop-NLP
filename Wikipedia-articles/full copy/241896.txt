Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers, and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast Domain Name System ( mDNS ) service records. The software comes built-in with Apple&apos;s Mac OS X operating system and iOS for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Bonjour can be installed onto computers running Microsoft Windows operating systems. Bonjour components may also be included within other software such as iTunes and Safari. Bonjour is released under a terms-of-limited-use license by Apple. It is freeware for clients, though developers and software companies who wish to redistribute it as part of a software package or use the Bonjour logo may need a licensing agreement.The source code for mDNSResponder is available under the Apache License.

The software is widely used throughout Mac OS X, and allows users to set up a network without any configuration. [ 2010 ] it is used to find printers and file-sharing servers. iTunes uses Bonjour to find shared music, iPhoto to find shared photos, iChat, Adobe Systems Creative Suite 3, Proteus, Adium, Fire, Pidgin, Skype, Vine Server, and Elgato EyeTV to share local recordings with multiple clients, the Gizmo5 to find other users on the local network, TiVo Desktop to find digital video recorders and shared-media libraries, SubEthaEdit and e to find document collaborators, Contactizer to find and share contacts, tasks, and events information, and Things &amp; OmniFocus to synchronize projects and tasks across the Mac desktop and the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. It is used by Safari to find local web servers and configuration pages for local devices, and by Asterisk to advertise telephone services along with configuration parameters to VoIP phones and dialers. Software such as Bonjour Browser or iStumbler, both for Mac OS X, or Zeroconf Neighborhood Explorer for Windows, can be used to view all services declared by these applications. Apple&apos;s &quot; Remote &quot; application for iPhone and iPod Touch also uses Bonjour to establish connection to iTunes libraries via Wi-Fi. [ http://dacp.jsharkey.org/ Android DACP Remote Control 2009-02-23 Android DACP Remote Control Jeffrey Sharkey ] Bonjour only works within a single broadcast domain, which is usually a small area, without special DNS configuration. Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows and AirPort Base Stations may be configured to use Wide Area Bonjour which allows for wide area service discovery via an appropriately configured DNS server. Applications generally implement Bonjour services using standard TCP/IP calls, rather than in the operating system. Although Mac OS X provides various Bonjour services, Bonjour also works on other operating systems. Apple has made the source code of the Bonjour multicast DNS responder, the core component of service discovery, available as a Darwin open source project. The project provides source code to build the responder daemon for a wide range of platforms, including Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, Linux, * BSD, Solaris, VxWorks, and Windows. Apple also provides a user-installable set of services called Bonjour for Windows and Java libraries. A number of Windows programs use Zeroconf, including Adobe Systems Creative Suite 3, iTunes, Cerulean Studios&apos; Trillian Pro 3, Ruckus Music Player from Ruckus Network, and the text editor e. [ Microsoft Windows implementation ] Bonjour version 2.0, released on February 24, 2010, works with Windows 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, and Windows 7. [ http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/download/ Bonjour Downloads 2010-03-08 Apple Inc. 2010-03-08 ] Systems use it primarily to facilitate the installation, configuration, and use of network printers, and thus it runs from startup. When Bonjour is fully implemented on MS Windows, some features such as iChat allow for communication between the Mac OS and MS Windows. Bonjour for Windows also adds Zeroconf capabilities to Internet Explorer, and provides a Zeroconf implementation to Java VM s.

Installers on Windows systems normally place Bonjour files in a folder called &quot; Bonjour &quot; within the &quot; Program Files &quot; folder. It modifies Windows system-registry entries related to internal network configuration and operation. Bonjour runs as mDNSResponder.exe. Communications across the network take place over UDP port 5353, which may require reconfiguring some personal or corporate firewalls that block Bonjour packets. A full installation of Bonjour for Windows will include a plug-in for Internet Explorer, a printer wizard, and the network communication services. Not all components are included when installed as part of a third-party application or as a component of other Apple software such as iTunes. Some VPN clients are configured so that local network services are unavailable to a computer when VPN software is active and connected. In such a case no local Zeroconf services are available to Bonjour or any other Zeroconf implementation. The open-source IM clients Pidgin and Kopete support the Bonjour IM protocol, as does the non-GPL Trillian client. In September 2008, two security vulnerabilities were found in Bonjour for Windows.

The program was originally called &quot; Rendezvous Browser &quot;, but changed its name in version 1.5.4 after Apple changed the protocol&apos;s name to Bonjour. For certain protocols, double clicking a list item will launch the associated helper. 1.5.6 is the first universal binary version. Future versions will allow users to completely define a service, instead of relying on the author to do so. Bonjour Browser was recommended for service discovery in MacAddict #123. [ JBonjourBrowser ] A student research project at Columbia University produced a Java-based system to match the functionality of Bonjour Browser, called JBonjourBrowser. JBonjourBrowser is open-source and available under the GPL. JBonjourBrowser was built to emulate the functionality of Bonjour Browser, and at the same time work on multiple platforms.
