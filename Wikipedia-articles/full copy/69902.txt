Extreme weather includes weather phenomena that are at the extremes of the historical distribution, especially severe or unseasonal weather. { Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2.7 Has Climate Variability, or have Climate Extremes, Changed? Retrieved on 13 April 2007. } The most commonly used definition of extreme weather is based on an event&apos;s climatological distribution. Extreme weather occurs only 5% or less of the time. According to climate scientists and meteorological researchers, extreme weather events are rare. { EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND THEIR PROBABILISTIC PREDICTION BY THE NCEP ENSEMBLE FORECAST SYSTEM } The international reinsurance company Munich Re says that increasingly large numbers of weather-related natural catastrophes are due to climate change, with global warming playing a significant role in the rising number of extreme events such as windstorms and floods which have tripled since 1980, a trend that is expected to persist. { Munich Re (August 5, 2010) &quot; Extreme weather events - Signs of climate change? &quot; } { Munich Re (January 3, 2011) &quot; Overall picture of natural catastrophes in 2010 - several earthquakes and many severe weather events &quot; } According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were a record twelve weather disasters in the US costing more than $1 billion in 2011. The previous record was nine in 2008. { Peralta, E. (December 7, 2011) &quot; 2011 Breaks Record For Most Billion-Dollar Weather Disasters &quot; National Public Radio } A 2012 study indicated an increasing threat from extreme weather. { Study Indicates a Greater Threat of Extreme Weather April 26, 2012 } [ List of extreme weather events ] [ Costs ] According to IPCC (2011) estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few billion to above 200 billion USD (in 2010 dollars), with the highest value for 2005 (the year of Hurricane Katrina ). The global weather- and climate-related disaster losses reported over the last few decades reflect mainly monetized direct damages to assets, and are unequally distributed. Loss estimates are lower bound estimates because many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize, and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses. { Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX), Summary IPCC } [ Extreme temperatures ] [ Heat waves ] [ Heat waves ] Heat waves can often have severe effects upon the landscape, causing famine, destruction of vegetation, and possible deaths to livestock and wildlife. { Heat waves are long periods of abnormally high temperatures.

Heat cramps, heat expansion, heat stroke, and dehydration can result in human populations.

Outbreaks of wildfires can increase in frequency as dry vegetation has increased likeliness of igniting. The evaporation of bodies of water can be devastating to marine populations, decreasing the size of the habitats available as well as the amount of nutrition presented within the waters. Livestock and other animal populations may decline as well. Power outages can also occur within areas experiencing heatwaves due to the increased demand for electricity [ May 2010 ]. The urban heat island effect can increase temperatures even more, particularly overnight. [ T. R. Oke 1982 The energetic basis of the urban heat island Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 108 1–24 1982QJRMS.108....1O 10.1002/qj.49710845502 455 ] [ Cold waves ] [ Cold wave ] { A cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the } { U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24 hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year. } [ http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id%3Dcold-wave1 Cold Wave American Meteorological Society Glossary of Meteorology 2009-08-18 2009 ] { Cold waves generally are capable of occurring any geological location and are formed by large cool air masses that accumulate over certain regions, caused by movements of air streams. } A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach necessary food and water, and die of hypothermia or starvation. Cold waves often necessitate the purchase of fodder for livestock at considerable cost to farmers. Human populations can be inflicted with frostbite s when exposed for extended periods of time to cold and may result in the loss of limbs or damage to internal organs. Extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipes to freeze. Even some poorly-protected indoor plumbing may rupture as frozen water expands within them, causing property damage. Fires, paradoxically, become more hazardous during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making firefighting more difficult. Cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth. This results in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvest ed economically. Such cold waves have caused famine s. Cold waves can also cause soil particles to harden and freeze, making it harder for plants and vegetation to grow within these areas. One extreme was the so-called Year Without a Summer of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruption s reduced incoming sunlight. [ Related to significant tropical cyclones ] There has been long ongoing debate about a possible increase of tropical cyclones as an effect of global warming. However, as of March 2012, the latest IPCC report on extreme events SREX states that &quot; there is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. &quot; { IPCC Special Report on Climate Extremes. &quot; IPCC Special Report on Climate Extremes &quot; Retrieved on 01 April 2012. } Increases in population densities increase the number of people affected and damage caused by an event of given severity.

Retrieved on 13 April 2007. } and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency { U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Global Warming.

(2006), writing that the increasing number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes is directly linked to increasing temperatures. { Carlos D. Hoyos, Paula A. Agudelo, Peter J. Webster, Judith A. Curry. Deconvolution of the Factors Contributing to the Increase in Global Hurricane Intensity. Retrieved on 13 April 2007. } Similarly, Kerry Emanuel in Nature writes that hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with temperature, reflecting global warming. { Emanuel, K.A.(2005): &quot; Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years &quot;. Nature } Hurricane modeling has produced similar results, finding that hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high CO 2 conditions, are more intense than under present-day conditions. Thomas Knutson and Robert E. Tuleya of the NOAA stated in 2004 that warming induced by greenhouse gas may lead to increasing occurrence of highly destructive category-5 storms. { Thomas R. Knutson, et al., } { Journal of Climate, &apos;&apos;Impact of CO &lt; sub &gt; 2 &lt; /sub &gt; -Induced Warming on Simulated Hurricane Intensity and Precipitation: Sensitivity to the Choice of Climate Model and Convective Parameterization&apos;&apos;, 15 Sept. 2004. Retrieved March 4, 2007. } Vecchi and Soden find that wind shear, the increase of which acts to inhibit tropical cyclones, also changes in model-projections of global warming. There are projected increases of wind shear in the tropical Atlantic and East Pacific associated with the deceleration of the Walker circulation, as well as decreases of wind shear in the western and central Pacific. { http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~gav/ipcc_shears.html IPCC Projections and Hurricanes } The study does not make claims about the net effect on Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes of the warming and moistening atmospheres, and the model-projected increases in Atlantic wind shear.
