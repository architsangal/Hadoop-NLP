July 19, 2010 eMusic 2010-07-23 ] The impetus for the band&apos;s name comes from Marilyn Monroe &apos;s last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a &quot; social misfit. &quot; The Misfits combined Danzig&apos;s harmonic vocals with camp-horror imagery and lyrics. The Misfits sound was a faster, heavier derivation of Ramones style punk with rockabilly influences. Glenn Danzig&apos;s Misfits songs dealt almost exclusively with themes derived from B-grade horror and science fiction movies (e.g. &quot; Night of the Living Dead &quot; ) as well as comic books (e.g. &quot; Wasp Women &quot;, &quot; I Turned Into A Martian &quot; ). Unlike the later incarnation of the Misfits, Danzig also dealt with Atomic Era scandals in songs like &quot; Bullet &quot; (about the Kennedy assassination ), &quot; Who Killed Marilyn &quot; (which alluded to alternate theories about Marilyn Monroe &apos;s suicide), and Hollywood Babylon (inspired by the Kenneth Anger book on scandals associated with the early, formative years of Hollywood). In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: “It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren&apos;t prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn&apos;t seem to have the same outlook. So it was time for me to move on.” [ Dome Malcolm 2011 The Story Behind...Danzig Metal Hammer May 2011 70–72 Future plc 2011-06-02 ] After the Misfits, he began work on a new band project: Samhain. The origins of Samhain began when Danzig started rehearsing with Eerie Von, formerly of Rosemary&apos;s Babies. [ http://www.live4metal.com/eerievon2008.htm Interview with Eerie Von June 2008 Live4Metal 2010-08-27 ] Danzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year, which influenced the evolution of the modern Halloween. Initially Samhain was conceived as a punk rock &quot; super group &quot;. The band briefly featured members of Minor Threat and Reagan Youth, who contributed to Samhain&apos;s 1984 debut, Initium. The band then settled with a lineup consisting of Eerie Von on bass, Damien on guitar, and Steve Zing on drums (later replaced by London May ). In 1985 the Unholy Passion EP was released, followed by November-Coming-Fire in 1986. Samhain&apos;s musical and lyrical style was much darker in tone than Misfits material, fusing an experimental combination of horror punk, gothic – deathrock, and heavy metal. Samhain eventually began to attract the interest of major labels including Epic and Elektra. [ http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t%3Ddarticle%26amp%3Bf%3Dbside.89 Danzig Dark Arts Yates Amy Beth April/May 1989 B Side 2009-10-23 ] Rick Rubin, music producer and head of the Def American label, would see the band perform at the 1986 New Music Seminar, on the advice of then-Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. [ http://www.misfitscentral.com/display.php?t%3Ddarticle%26amp%3Bf%3Drstone.94 The Devil Inside Wild David March 24, 1994 Rolling Stone 2010-08-06 ] Danzig has credited both Burton and Metallica frontman James Hetfield with helping to raise awareness about his music: “I first met them at a Black Flag gig, and then we became kinda friends. We&apos;d often bump into each other on the road...James and Cliff helped to spread the word about me, and I was very grateful to them.” [ Danzig ] [ &quot; Classic &quot; era (1987–1994) ] In 1987, after two albums and an EP, Samhain was signed to a major label by Rubin and the name of the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes. Danzig discussed the reasoning behind the name change: “Rick [Rubin] convinced me it was the way to go, and would also provide me with a lot more artistic freedom. After all, I was now in charge of where we were going musically, so if I didn&apos;t want to do something, it was a lot easier to say so.” Danzig&apos;s intention at the time was for each album he recorded to consist of a different recording line-up, allowing him to keep working with different musicians. [ http://www.ocweekly.com/2007-05-24/music/danzig-s-lost-and-found/ Danzig&apos;s Lost and Found: Underground Auteur Unearths Hits from Hell Ferris D.X. May 24, 2007 OC Weekly 2010-11-11 ] The original band consisted of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and former Circle Jerks – D.O.A. – Black Flag drummer Chuck Biscuits. In 1987, Danzig, owing to his association with Rubin, was asked to write a song for Roy Orbison. The result was &quot; Life Fades Away &quot;, featured in the 1987 movie Less than Zero. Danzig also contributed to the film&apos;s soundtrack with &quot; You and Me (Less than Zero) &quot;. Danzig had originally been asked to write the song for a female vocalist, but when Rubin could not find a suitable singer Danzig recorded the vocals himself. The song is credited to &quot; Glenn Danzig and the Power and Fury Orchestra &quot;, which featured the same membership as the initial lineup of Danzig, with the exception of Eerie Von. Since Von did not like the way producer Rubin wanted the bass played on the song, George Drakoulias played the bass instead. In 1988, the newly formed band Danzig released their eponymous debut. Its sound showed a progression from the gothic–deathrock sound of Samhain, to a slower, heavier, more blues -based heavy metal sound. Glenn Danzig&apos;s lyrics, which had already evolved from those of the Misfits to the more serious style of Samhain, progressed even further with the band Danzig to become &quot; frighteningly intense images of doom &quot; which &quot; convey their bleak messages with an eerie grace and intelligence &quot;. In 1990, the band&apos;s sophomore effort Danzig II: Lucifuge marked an immediate change in musical direction. The album&apos;s overall bluesier tone and somewhat milder approach were departures from Danzig, featuring a 50s-style ballad ( &quot; Blood &amp; Tears &quot; ) and a full-on acoustic blues ( &quot; I&apos;m the One &quot;.) Other projects in 1990 included the final Samhain album Final Descent. The album was started under the title Samhain Grim several years prior. The album contained previously unreleased studio recordings, at least some of which had been intended for the Samhain Grim album before it was aborted. In 1992, Danzig once again changed musical direction, releasing the darker Danzig III: How the Gods Kill. Several songs would feature a more textured, slower sound in between fast, dominant guitar riffs. Also in 1992, Danzig tried his hand at composing classical music with Black Aria. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard classical music chart.

Danzig broke into the mainstream when the live video of &quot; Mother &apos;93 &quot; became a hit on MTV and earned Buzz Bin rotation, [ http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C301185%2C00.html On the Same Track February 18, 1994 Entertainment Weekly 2010-08-02 ] six years after the original song was recorded. During this time the band reached its commercial peak, with both the debut album and Thrall: Demonsweatlive being certified gold, and &quot; Mother &quot; becoming the band&apos;s highest charting single. In 1994, the release of Danzig 4 saw the band going further into a darker and more experimental sound. The album also saw further development of his vocal style and range; most notable in songs like &quot; Let It Be Captured &quot; and a more blues based approach on songs like &quot; Going Down to Die &quot;. Also in 1994, Danzig wrote the song &quot; Thirteen &quot; for Johnny Cash, which appeared on the album American Recordings. [ Later years (1995–2004) ] Glenn Danzig at a record signing in 1996. In 1996, the band underwent a complete overhaul. The original lineup had fallen apart, as had Glenn Danzig&apos;s relationship with their record label, American Recordings, with label owner Rick Rubin&apos;s involvement as producer diminishing with each album. Danzig would later engage in a legal battle with Rubin over unpaid royalties and the rights to the band&apos;s unreleased songs. Danzig enlisted new band mates, most notably Joey Castillo who would continue to be the band&apos;s drummer until 2002. Once again, he explored a new musical direction and recorded Blackacidevil; this time infusing heavy metal with industrial rock. Danzig went on to sign a deal with Hollywood Records, which led to several religious groups boycotting its parent company Disney for signing a controversial &quot; satanic &quot; band.

Danzig&apos;s subsequent three albums, 6:66 Satan&apos;s Child (1999), I Luciferi (2002) and Circle of Snakes (2004), all musically and lyrically evolved to a more stripped down, heavier gothic metal sound. The Danzig lineup continued to change with each album, while Danzig&apos;s voice started to show change after years of touring. In 1999, during the U.S. touring for the album 6:66 Satan&apos;s Child Danzig reunited Samhain along with drummers Steve Zing and London May. Then-Danzig guitarist Todd Youth was invited by Glenn Danzig to fill in the guitar position for the Samhain reunion tour, replacing Samhain&apos;s original guitarist, Pete &quot; Damien &quot; Marshall, who had opted out in order to tour with Iggy Pop. Eerie Von was not invited to rejoin Samhain due to personal issues within the band. Both Zing and May handled bass duties, switching from drums to bass in between the &quot; Blood Show &quot;. In 2003, Danzig founded the Blackest of the Black tour to provide a platform for dark and extreme bands of his choosing from around the world.
