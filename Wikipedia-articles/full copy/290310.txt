Harvey W. Kushner.

The organization has not engaged in militant activity since then. { Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). GlobalSecurity.org } The group&apos;s mottos were &quot; The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia &quot; and &quot; Viva the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people! &quot;. { G. Yazchian, Thirty years ago this day was born ASALA, Azg daily, Yerevan, January 20, 2005 } [ Origins ] Over 60 years had passed since the Ottoman Empire had embarked on the campaign to exterminate its Armenian population, which was largely concentrated in its eastern provinces and referred to at the time as Western Armenia. The survivors of the massacres and deprivations commonly seen in the death marches found refuge in countries in the Middle East and in Western Europe and the USA. While the key ringleaders of the genocide were executed in the 1920s by Armenians (see Operation Nemesis ), the Ottoman Empire&apos;s successor, the Republic of Turkey, effectively took a hold of all the possessions Armenians left behind and for decades vociferously insisted that a genocide had not taken place. It actively campaigned against any and all attempts to publicise the events and bring forward recognition in the West. It, in fact, blamed Armenians for instigating the violence and alleged that Armenians had massacred thousands of Turks, prompting the commencement of their deportations. In 1965, Armenians around the world publicly marked the 50th anniversary and began to campaign for world recognition. As peaceful marches and demonstrations failed to move an intransigent Turkey, the younger generation of Armenians, resentful at the denial by Turkey and the failure by their parents&apos; generation to effect change, sought new approaches to bringing about recognition and reparations. In 1973 two Turkish diplomats were assassinated in Los Angeles by Gourgen Yanikian, an elderly man who survived the Armenian Genocide. Behind this act of revenge lay a national reawakening among the scattered Armenians in the world, which had begun in the end of the 1960s and early 1970s. This event might have been progressively forgotten, had it not initiated a chain of events which turned it, and its perpetrator, into a symbol representing the end of the conspiracy of silence which since 1915 had surrounded the Armenian Genocide.

Turkey Today: A European Nation? p. 169. } The apex of group&apos;s structure was the General Command of the People of Armenia (VAN). { The Middle East Annual: Issues &amp; Events, 1984, edited by David H. Partington, p. 155 } The group&apos;s activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe, in the United States and the Middle East. Their first acknowledged killing was the assassination of the Turkish diplomat, Daniş Tunalıgil, in Vienna on October 22, 1975. A failed attack in Geneva on October 3, 1980, in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group, the 3 October Organization. The ASALA&apos;s eight point manifesto was published in 1981. ASALA, trained in the Beirut camps of Palestine Liberation Organization, is the best known of the guerrilla groups responsible for assassinations of at least 36 Turkish diplomats.

These notable acts, while practically carried out by a small group, were successful in conveying the Armenian Genocide and its silence to the forefront of international awareness.

Two days later, Turkish Ambassador in France, Ismail Erez and his chauffeur were killed. Both ASALA and JCAG claimed responsibility. The first two ASALA militants, arrested on October 3, 1980, were Alex Yenikomshian and Suzy Mahserejian, who were wounded after the accidental explosion of a bomb in a hotel in Geneva. { Le Combat armenien: entre terrorisme et utopie : Lausanne, 1923-1983, by Armand Gaspard, L&apos;AGE D&apos;HOMME, 1984, p. 72 } During the 1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris (Van operation) ASALA militants held 56 hostages for fifteen hours, it became the first operation of its kind. Militants demanded to release political prisoner s in Turkey including two Armenian clergymen, 5 Turks and 5 Kurds. { Guerilla threat to kill 40 in Paris siege, } { The Sydney Morning Herald, Sep. 25, 1981, p. 3 } Coverage of takeover received one of the highest television ratings in France in 1981. { Children of Armenia, by M. Bobelian, Simon and Schuster, 2009, p. 159 } Among those who supported the militants during the trial were Henri Verneuil, { Le procés des Arméniens, Paris, traduit du français par Grigor Djanikian, editions VMV-Print, Erevan, 2010, p. 200 } Mélinée Manouchian, the widow of the French resistance hero, Missak Manouchian, and singer Liz Sarian. One of the most known attacks of ASALA was Esenboga airport attack on August 7, 1982 in Ankara, when its members targeted non-diplomat civilians for the first time. Two militants opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting room. One of the shooters took more than 20 hostages while the second was apprehended by police. Altogether, nine people died and 82 were injured. The arrested militant Levon Ekmekjian condemned the attack in its aftermath and appealed to other members of ASALA to stop the violence. On August 10, 1982, Artin Penik a Turk of Armenian descent, set himself on fire in protest of this attack.

[ http://www.hetq.am/eng/society/7332/ 2008-09-02 He Was a Man Deeply Connected to the Natural World Hetq Online 2007-11-26 Edik Baghdasaryan ] The split resulted in emergence of two groups, the ASALA-Militant led by Hagopian and the &apos;Revolutionary Movement&apos; (ASALA-Mouvement Révolutionnaire) led by Monte Melkonian. { Harvey W. Kushner. Encyclopedia of terrorism. SAGE, 2002. ISBN 0-7619-2408-6, ISBN 978-0-7619-2408-1, стр 47 } While Melkonian&apos;s faction insisted on attacks strictly against Turkish officials and the Turkish government, Hagopian&apos;s group disregarded the losses of unintended victims and regularly executed dissenting members. Afterwards, French forces promptly arrested those involved. { &quot; French Hold Armenians In Orly Airport Bombing &quot;, } { Associated Press, } { New York Times, October 9, 1983. } Moreover, this attack eliminated the suspected secret agreement that the French socialist government made with ASALA, in which the government would allow ASALA to use France as a base of operations in exchange for refraining from launching attacks on French soil. Belief in this suspected agreement was further bolstered after &quot; Interior Minister Gaston Defferre called [ASALA&apos;s] cause &quot; just &quot;, and four Armenians arrested for taking hostages at the Turkish Embassy in September 1981 were given light sentences. &quot; { Echikson, William. &quot; Armenian bombing at Orly ends pact between Socialists and terrorists &quot;, } { Christian Science Monitor, July 19, 1983. } [ Reactions ] ASALA is blamed by international society especially after the Esenboga airport attack which ASALA militants attacked the passengers waiting at the restaurant of the airport and killed 9 passengers. Continuous attacks prompted Turkey to accuse Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding the ASALA. Although they publicly distanced themselves from the ASALA, Turkey&apos;s Armenian community came under attack by Turkish nationalists in reaction to the group&apos;s actions. This became apparent after the assassination of Ahmet Benler on October 12, 1979 by Armenian militants in the Hague. The reaction to the attack led to the bombing of the church of the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate in Istanbul on October 19 in retaliation. { Tessa, Hofmann. Armenians in Turkey today } In 1980, the Turkish government arrested Armenian priest Fr. Manuel Yergatian at the Istanbul airport for the alleged possession of maps that indicated Armenian territory within modern day Turkey and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possible ties with ASALA. Amnesty International adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, concluding that the evidence against him was baseless. According to Tessa Hofmann, Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with the ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups. { Tessa, Hofmann. Armenians in Turkey today } In April, 2000 the opening ceremony of &quot; In Memory of killed ASALA commandos &quot; monument took place at Armenian military pantheon with participation of Greek anti-fascist resistance leader Manolis Glezos and other special guests. { Arax Monthly, #4, 2000, Tehran, p. 4 } [ Counteroffensive ] After the ASALA attack against the Esenboğa International Airport in August 1982 the then President of Turkey Kenan Evren issued a decree for the elimination of ASALA. The task was given to the National Intelligence Organization &apos;s Foreign Operations Department.

Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however he was in a French prison (again, on narcotics charges) at the time of the attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks.

Feeling ill at ease by the raid, the French and U.S. Armenians who used to support ASALA monetarily stopped the aid and the issue was closed. I know this through French authorities that were involved. The ones that were instrumental in the stopping of the aid were MİT and the Foreign Ministry. Otherwise, ASALA did not yield because it was afraid of the Turkish bullies. They were stopped because they had gone too far with their murders. ] [ In Culture ] { Yerablur military cemetery, } { Yerevan. } Armenian poetess Silva Kaputikyan wrote a poem It&apos;s raining my sonny dedicated to the memory of Levon Ekmekjian, an ASALA member, one of two organizers of the Esenboğa International Airport attack in 1983.
