This article is about the demographic features of the population of the Czech Republic, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. [ Population ] { FAO, year 2009; Number of inhabitants in millions. } With an estimated population of 10,542,080 at 30 June 2011, compared to 9.3 million at the beginning of the twentieth century, the population growth of the Czech Republic was limited and characterized by low fertility rates and loss of population in and around WW I and WW II. Population loss during WW I was approximately 350,000. At the beginning of WW II population the Czech Republic reached its maximum (11.2 million). Due to the expulsion of the German residents after WW II the Czech Republic lost about 3 million inhabitants and in 1947 the population was only 8.8 million. Population growth resumed until 1994 when the population was 10.3 million. From 1994-2005 natural growth was negative and the population decreased to 10.2 million. Since 2006, natural growth has been positive, but the most important factor for the recent population of the Czech Republic has been immigration, approximately 300,000 during the last decade.

[ Life expectancy at birth ] male:74.2 years female:80.1 years (2009) [ Ethnic groups ] The majority of the 10.5 million inhabitants of the Czech Republic are ethnically and linguistically Czech (95%). Other ethnic group s include Germans, Roma, Poles and Hungarians. Historical minorities like those of Germans and Poles are declining due to assimilation. The Roma community is growing, while there is also a growing Vietnamese community. Other ethnic communities like Greeks, Turks, Italians and Yugoslavs are found in its capital city, Prague. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Slovaks staying in the Czech Republic have comprised roughly 3% of the population. There are different groups of national and ethnic minorities in the Czech Republic. The so called old minorities usually live mostly in particular areas (e.g. Poles in the Zaolzie region, Germans in the Hultschiner region ) while the new minorities are scattered among the majority population (generally in the larger towns). While some of the minorities have the whole social structure of the Czech society ( Poles, Slovaks, Greeks ), other represent only some of the social groups (i.e. Russian newcomers of middle class, or Ukrainians and Romanis who generally represent the underclass).

The legal position of the minorities is defined foremost in the Act No. 273/2001 Coll. (The Rights of the Minorities Act) which implements the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms, Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and Recommendation of the Council of Europe No. 1201. There is a number of other enactments which to lesser extent deal with the minorities. Special situation is in the case of Moravians and Silesians, who are frequently allocated within the group of Czechs when it comes to the statistical data. Roma [ Officially recognized minorities ] [ Bulgarians in Czechoslovakia Croats in the Czech Republic Germans in the Czech Republic Greeks in the Czech Republic Polish minority in the Czech Republic Roma in the Czech Republic Ukrainians in the Czech Republic ] Minorities, which &quot; traditionally and on long term basis live within the territorry of the Czech Republic &quot; enjoy some privileges. As of 2010 there are 12 such officially recognized minorities, which are (alphabetically): Bulgarians, Croatians, Hungarians, Germans, Greeks, Poles, Romanis, Russians, Rusyns, Serbians, Slovaks and Ukrainians. { See Government Council for National Minorities } Belorusian and Vietnamese minority may obtain this status in near future. [ http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vietnamstina-ve-skolach-a-na-uradech-nebude-komunita-tady-zije-prilis-kratce-1vi-/domaci.asp?c%3DA101128_124225_domaci_jj Čeští Vietnamci chtějí status menšiny, pomoci jim může sčítání lidu 2010-12-01 ] Among the privileges of the officially recognized minorities are the right to have signs within the municipalities also in their language, right to have the information about elections in their language (both if the minority comprises at least 10% of the municipality&apos;s population), right to education in their language, cultural rights including state support for preservation of traditions. Citizens belonging to the officially recognized minorities enjoy the right to use their language in communication with authorities and in front of the courts of law. The article 25 of the Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms ensures right of the national and ethnic minorities for education and communication with authorities in their own language. Act No. 500/2004 Coll. (The Administrative Rule) in its paragraph 16 (4) (Procedural Language) ensures, that a citizen of the Czech republic, who belongs to a national or an ethnic minority, which traditionally and on long-term basis lives within the territory of the Czech Republic, have right to address an administrative agency and proceed before it in the language of the minority. In case that the administrative agency doesn&apos;t have an employee with knowledge of the language, the agency is bound to obtain a translator at the agency&apos;s own expense. According to Act No. 273/2001 (About The Rights of Members of Minorities) paragraph 9 (The right to use language of a national minority in dealing with authorities and in front of the courts of law) the same applies for the members of national minorities also in front of the courts of law. [ Bulgarians ] [ Bulgarians in Czechoslovakia ] In 1990s the economic immigration of Bulgarians to the Czech Republic started. 4 363 citizens claimed to have Bulgarian nationality in the 2001 census. They mostly live in the large cities and towns, such as Prague, Brno and Ostrava, Karlovy Vary, Kladno, Ústí nad Labem, Děčín, Havířov etc. Nowadays the newcomers from Bulgaria aim especially for these areas, in which they can hold on the established community. Many of these economical immigrants have dual citizenship of both the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. However most of the recent immigrants still have only Bulgarian citizenship. The Bulgarian Cultural Organisation publishes magazine Roden Glas, while a folklore organisation Kytka promotes traditional Bulgarian dances. Among other organisations are Pirin, Zaedno, Vazraždane or Hyshove. [ http://www.vlada.cz/scripts/detail.php?id%3D16103 Bulharská národnostní menšina 2010-11-30 vlada.cz ] As an officially recognized minority the Bulgarian citizens of the Czech Republic enjoy right to use their language in communications with authorities and in front of the courts of law. They also enjoy a number of other rights connected to the status of recognized minority, i.e. the right for education in the own language (the first Bulgarian school in the nowadays Czech Republic was established in 1946 in Prague). [ Germans ] [ Germans in the Czech Republic ] { ethnic German majority (&apos;&apos;in black&apos;&apos;) inside the current } { Czech Republic &apos;s territories. } The German minority of the Czech Republic, historically the largest minority of the country, was almost entirely removed when 3 million were forcibly expelled in 1945–6. The constitution guarantees rights for minority languages, however there are 13 municipalities with German minority constituting 10% of population, which qualifies for such provisions. { Peter Josika: Mehrsprachig: Ein Faktor der Versöhnung at } { Prager Zeitung, 21 August 2007. } There is no bilingual education system in Western and Northern Bohemia, where the German minority is mostly concentrated. However, this is in large part due to the absence of German-speaking youth, a heritage of the post-war policy of the Communist government. According to the 2001 census there remain 13 municipalities and settlements in the Czech Republic with more than 10% Germans. Many representatives of expellees&apos; organizations support the erection of bilingual signs in all formerly German speaking territory as a visible sign of the bilingual linguistic and cultural heritage of the region, yet their efforts are not supported by some of the current inhabitants, as the vast majority of the current population is not of German descent. The German-Czech Declaration of 21 January 1997 covered the two most critical issues — the role of the Sudeten Germans in the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and their expulsion after WWII. [ Wolff Stefan German minorities in Europe: ethnic identity and cultural belonging 2000 Berghahn Books 978-1-57181-504-0 200 ] [ Greeks ] [ Greeks in the Czech Republic ] Another influential minority are Greeks (including Macedonians or &quot; Slavonic Greeks &quot; ). Large numbers of Greeks arrived in Czechoslovakia during the end of the Greek Civil War. The first transports of Greek children arrived in 1948 and 1949. Later, more transports, also including adults, arrived. { Anthula Botu: Řekové v českých zemích 1948-2000 } They were partly leftists, communists and guerillas with their relatives, hence the willingness of Czechoslovak government to allow the immigration. This was viewed rather as a temporary solution. After the defeat of DSE and other left-wing guerillas, the Greeks stayed in Czechoslovakia. In total more than 12,000 Greeks immigrated to Czechoslovakia between 1948 and 1950. { Marián Sloboda: „Až bude v Řecku mír, vrátíme se domů“. Řecká národnostní skupina v České republice, 25.3.2003 } Today, there are about 7000 Greeks in the country (3219 according to 2001 census data), mostly in the 3 biggest towns – Prague, Brno, Ostrava – and also in Bohumín, Havířov, Jeseník, Karviná, Krnov, Šumperk, Třinec, Vrbno pod Pradědem and Žamberk (apart from the last one these towns are in Silesia ). { Vangelis Liolios: Podkladové materiály pro Radu vlády pro národnostní menšiny o situaci řecké menšiny v České republice } [ Poles ] [ Polish minority in the Czech Republic ] The most concentrated linguistic minority in the Czech Republic are ethnic Poles, historically the plurality, today constituting about 10% of the Karviná and Frýdek-Místek districts population. Poles have the right to use their language in official dealings, the public media (the Czech TV and the Czech Radio ) regularly broadcast in Polish, and there are many Polish primary and secondary schools in the area. The Polish minority has been decreasing substantially since World War II as education in Polish was difficult to obtain, while Czech authorities did not permit bilingual signs to maintain Polish awareness among the population. The erection of bilingual sign s has technically been permitted since 2001, if a minority constitutes 10% of the population of a municipality. The requirement that a petition be signed by the members of minority was cancelled, thus simplifying whole process. { Kongres Polaków w RC, 29.10.2006 } Still, only a couple of villages with large Polish minorities have bilingual signs ( Vendryně/Wędrynia for instance). [ Romanis ] [ Relations between ethnic Czechs and Roma Roma in the Czech Republic ] Another minority is the Roma, who nonetheless have very little influence on Czech policy. Around 90% of the Roma that lived in the Czech Republic prior to World War II were exterminated by the Nazi Porajmos. The Roma there now are 80% post-war immigrants from Slovakia or Hungary, or the descendants thereof. In total, the Roma in the CR now number around 200,000. { http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/languages/langmin/euromosaic/cz3_en.html } There is Romani press in the CR, written in both Czech and Romani, but Romani radio is broadcast in Czech and there is no Romani television. Romani is also absent from legislative, judiciary, and other political texts but it has recently entered some university and elementary school courses. Life expectancy, literacy, median wage, school enrolment, and other socio-economic markers remain low while, according to Říčan (1998), Roma compose the majority of prison and habitual offender populations despite accounting for only a fraction of a percent of Czech population. [ Immigration ] thumb [ Black Africans in the Czech Republic Chinese people in the Czech Republic Koreans in the Czech Republic Mongolians in the Czech Republic Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic ] According to the 2011 census there were 543,000 permanent(i.e. legal) foreign residents in the Czech Republic (5% of the total population). Residents from the Ukraine are the largest group (118,000), followed by residents of Slovakia (84,000). There are also Asian minorities in the Czech Republic. The largest is the Vietnamese one (83,000 in 2011). During the communist era the governments of Czechoslovakia and Vietnam had a deal concerning the education of Vietnamese people in Czechoslovakia. Vietnamese people came to Czechoslovakia for the first time in 1956 and then the number of new migrants grew until the fall of communism. First generation Vietnamese work mostly as small-scale businessmen in markets. Still, many Vietnamese are without Czech citizenship. One of the towns with the largest Vietnamese communities is Cheb.There are also many people from Russia (36,000), Germany (21,000) and Poland (18,000). Additionally, due to recent changes in immigration laws making it harder for non-EU migrants to obtain work permit, Czech republic is estimated to have another 400,000 illegal migrants on its territory. [ Languages ] { The most commonly known foreign languages in the Czech Republic in 2005. According to Eurostat } Czech language (divided into three dialects in Bohemia proper, four dialects in Moravia, and two dialects in Czech Silesia ) is the official language of the state. There is also the transitional Cieszyn Silesian dialect as well as Polish language in Cieszyn Silesia, both spoken in Czech Silesia. Various Sudeten German dialects are currently practically extinct; present Czech Germans speak mainly Czech or Standard German. For other languages spoken in the Czech Republic, see the above part about minorities.
