The club was founded in 1903. It was immediately elected into Division Two of the Football League despite not having played a previous game. Promotion to the top tier followed in 1908 and the club won the FA Cup in 1911, its only major honour. After relegation in 1922 from Division One, the club spent 77 years outside the top flight until promotion to the Premier League in 1999. City stayed up, with a then record low of 36 points, in the first season in the Premier League. Relegation followed the following season. Since then a series of financial crises have pushed the club to the brink of closure. The financial pressures have resulted in two more relegations to its current position in League Two. They are the lowest-ranked of all former Premier League clubs. The club&apos;s colours are claret and amber and they play their home games at Valley Parade. The ground was the site of a fire on 11 May 1985, which took the lives of 56 supporters. Bradford City have had more than 40 managers, all of whom have been from Great Britain or Ireland. The current manager is Phil Parkinson, who was appointed on 28 August 2011.

[ Frost Terry Bradford City A Complete Record 1903–1988 Breedon Books Sport 1988 11 0-907969-38-0 ] The Football League saw the invitation as a chance to promote association football in the rugby league-dominated county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It duly elected the new club into Division Two of the league, in place of Doncaster Rovers. Four days later, at the 23rd annual meeting of Manningham FC, the committee decided to change code from rugby league to association football. Bradford City Association Football Club were formed without having played a game, taking over Manningham&apos;s colours of claret and amber, and their Valley Parade ground.

[ Frost Bradford City A Complete Record 1903–1988 34–35 ] O&apos;Rourke left for a second time after one more season, and although City spent a total of eight seasons back in Division Two, they rarely looked like earning promotion back to the top flight.

McFarland won promotion in his first season, but was poached by his former club Derby County just six months later. City won compensation from Derby and installed another England international Trevor Cherry as McFarland&apos;s replacement. [ Frost Bradford City A Complete Record 1903–1988 81 ] Cherry, with former teammate Terry Yorath as his assistant manager, failed to win for two months, but eventually the pair guided City to safety from relegation.

City struggled but so did Campbell, and when he returned, the club went on a record run of ten successive victories. Although they missed out on promotion, City won the league the following season to return to the second tier of The Football League. However, City&apos;s triumph was overshadowed by the fire disaster, which killed 56  people when Valley Parade caught fire in the final game of the season. [ Frost Bradford City A Complete Record 1903–1988 28 ] City played games away from Valley Parade for 19  months.

The club colours were inherited from Manningham FC, when the club converted to football upon Bradford City&apos;s foundation in 1903. However, whereas Manningham played in hoops, the new football club adopted claret and amber stripes. [ Dewhirst John City Memories – An Illustrated Record of Bradford City A.F.C. ch.  1 pages 1-900463-57-1 ] Manningham RFC adopted the colours in 1884 before the move to Valley Parade in 1886. Having originally worn black shirts with white shorts, the club’s first game in claret and amber was against Hull on 20 September 1884, at Carlisle Road. The reason Manningham chose claret and amber is not documented but it was the same colours of the West Yorkshire Regiment, which was based at Belle Vue Barracks on nearby Manningham Lane. Both Manningham, from 1886, and Bradford City, from 1903–08, used the barracks as changing and club rooms. Bradford City has worn claret and amber, with either white or black, since it was founded. Since the fire in 1985, the club has used black on the kit as a memory to the 56 supporters who died.

They include Scottish club Motherwell, who originally wore blue until they wore claret and amber for the first time on 23 August 1913, against Celtic. Motherwell chose the colours because they were the racing colours of Lord Hamilton. [ http://www.motherwellfc.org/history.htm A brief history of Motherwell FC 30 December 2007 Motherwell FC.org ] The club’s crest combines a series of logos from over the years. In 1974, City adopted a contemporary style crest incorporating the club’s initials, with a B-C logo. At the time, the new logo maintained the previous nickname of the Paraders. By December 1981, the club relaunched the Bantams as the official identity with a bantam on the new crest. The crest maintains the club colours and also includes the words The Bantams. [ Nickname ] Bradford City have had a number of nicknames during the history. In their early years, they were referred to as the Robins or Wasps, taking over the nickname of Manningham FC, as a result of Manningham&apos;s claret and amber hoops. Other nicknames have been the Citizens or Paraders, but the club is better known as the Bantams.

[ Rivalry ] [ Bradford derby West Yorkshire derby ] Although their original neighbours Bradford (Park Avenue) are now a non-league club, they still engage in a very fierce competition with local rivals Leeds United : they are considered to be the club&apos;s most hated rivals in modern times, although it could be said that this is a one-way rivalry: Leeds fans are unlikely to raise the same level of emotion talking about Bradford City that a City fan would in talking of Leeds. This rivalry is to some extent due to the two cities&apos; proximity to one another, which has exacerbated in later years because there has been some football fans within Bradford choosing to travel the short distance to support Leeds rather than the home town&apos;s City. However, it&apos;s thought the main reason for this rivalry is the setting alight of a chip van by Leeds fans during a game between the two sides at Odsal in 1986, perceived by many Bradford City fans as a mockery of the Bradford City stadium fire. One of the less serious manifestations of this rivalry was the City Gent fanzines publication of a &apos;tribute to Leeds United AFC&apos;, the booklet having only blank pages { http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/miscellaneous/1058/bradford_fans_p.html }. Leeds United&apos;s relegation to League One in 2007 may have reignited this rivalry, although Bradford&apos;s relegation to League Two removed the possibility that the three major West Yorkshire football teams (Leeds, Bradford and Huddersfield) might be in the same division for the first time since the 1980s in the 2007–08 season. Also, Huddersfield Town have had roughly the same league status as City for the last couple of decades and so it could be argued that they are City&apos;s closest rivals. Matches against these sides have produced both amazing spectacles and some terrible moments—the 1996–97 season providing examples of both. On 1 February 1997, Huddersfield Town defender Kevin Gray broke the leg of Bradford City striker Gordon Watson in two places with a horrific sliding tackle. Watson was, at that time, the most expensive player in Bradford City&apos;s history having cost them £575,000, and was playing in only his third match for the club. He required a six-inch plate and seven screws in his leg. It took Gordon almost two years of recovery and five further operations before he was able to return to football, after which he made just a handful of appearances for City before leaving the club. At Leeds High Court in October 1998 he succeeded in becoming only the second player in the history of football to prove negligence by another player and was later awarded in excess of £900,000 in damages, [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3514673.stm Holmes awarded £250,000 30 December 2007 23 February 2004 BBC Sport ] [ http://www.le.ac.uk/crss/sf-review/98-99/98article5.html Singer &amp; Friedlander Football Review 1998–99 season 30 December 2007 7 December 2001 University of Leicester http://web.archive.org/web/20071120050041/http%3A//www.le.ac.uk/crss/sf-review/98-99/98article5.html 20 November 2007 ] making it &quot; the most expensive tackle in British football and legal history &quot;. The return fixture that season was a happier affair. It provided a spectacular display of goals in which City took a 3–0 lead, including one famous goal scored directly from a corner by ex- England star Chris Waddle, before the game swung in Huddersfield&apos;s favour as they fought back to the final score of 3–3. The most recent derby with Huddersfield Town at Galpharm Stadium on 4 October 2011 in the Football League Trophy second round ended in a 2–2 draw, with Bradford City winning 4–3 on penalties. There are also lesser rivalries with Barnsley, Burnley, Hull City, Oldham Athletic, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday and York City.Since relegation to League Two in 2007, Rotherham United have generally been the nearest divisional neighbours to Bradford, which has led to a minor rivalry developing between the two sides. As of May 2012, the geographically nearest club to Bradford is York City, who returned to the Football League and now occupy the same league as Bradford for the first time since the 1996-97 season. The club is linked with American amateur side Palmetto FC Bantams‎.
