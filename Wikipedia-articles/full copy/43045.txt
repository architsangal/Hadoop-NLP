The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) is a non-profit organization based in Oakland, California affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It is the United States &apos; leading anti-creationist organization, { The Panda&apos;s Black Box, Nathaniel C. Comfort, Daniel J. Kevles, p6 } and defends the teaching of evolutionary biology and opposes the teaching of religious views in science classes in America &apos;s public schools. It also is coordinating Project Steve. [ History ] In 1980 Stanley L. Weinberg, a veteran high-school teacher in Iowa, began to organize statewide Committees of Correspondence &quot; committed to the defense of education in evolutionary theory, &quot; modelled upon the committees of correspondence in pre-Revolutionary America. Their purpose was to keep interested parties informed about creationist endeavours and to share ideas for responses, allowing a political response at a local level. This grew into volunteer networks in most states, with the Creation/Evolution Newsletter interconnecting them, { Numbers(2006) p353 } which was incorporated as the NCSE in 1983. { History of NCSE, National Center for Science Education } In 1987, author and lecturer Eugenie Scott, who holds a PhD in Physical Anthropology, became its executive director. { Tom McIver in } { Isis, quoted in Eugenie C. Scott&apos;s &apos;&apos;Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction&apos;&apos;, National Center for Science Education } The Board of Directors and official supporters, as explained by NCSE, &quot; reflects our scientific roots. &quot; [ March 2011 ] In the 1990s, based upon its monitoring of creationist efforts, it issued warnings of high levels of official anti-evolutionism and a &quot; sharp surge upwards &quot; in creationist attacks on evolution, including attempts to downgrade evolution from &quot; fact &quot; to &quot; theory &quot; (see evolution as theory and fact‎ ) or present the &quot; evidence against evolution &quot; (see objections to evolution ). { Numbers(2006) p2 } The organization&apos;s supporters include Bruce Alberts, former President of the National Academy of Sciences; Donald Johanson, discoverer of the &quot; Lucy &quot; fossil; and evolutionary biologist Francisco J. Ayala. Also the late paleontologist and writer Stephen Jay Gould was a long-time supporter. As of 2008, the group has over 4000 members who are &quot; scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious affiliations. &quot; [ http://www.ncse.com/about About the National Center for Science Education National Center for Science Education 2008 2008-05-17 ] [ Activities and programs ] The NCSE acts as a central information and resource clearinghouse, and helps to coordinate the activities of people fighting creationist s. It maintains up-to-date listings of current events and information regarding creationist endeavours and evolution education. { Evolution and Creationism, Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent, 2007 } Historian of science Michael Shermer describes its website as being one of &quot; the two best resources on the Internet on the evolution/creation topic &quot; (the other being TalkOrigins Archive ). { Science Friction: Where the Known Meets the Unknown, } { Michael Shermer, 2004 } Consequently, the NCSE also opposes intelligent design and other &quot; alternatives &quot; to evolution because they are misleading euphemisms for creationism. [ http://ncse.com/taking-action/facing-challenges-to-evolution-education Facing Challenges to Evolution Education National Center for Science Education 2008 2008-11-04 ] NCSE &quot; is religiously neutral, though it cooperates nationally and locally with religious organizations, as well as scientific and educational organizations like the National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association. &quot; Its willingness to engage positively with, and avoid taking sides against, religiously minded supporters of evolution has been noted by prominent historian of creationism Ronald L. Numbers and prominent atheist Richard Dawkins. { Numbers(2006) p354 } { The God Delusion, } { Richard Dawkins, pp66-67 } The NCSE offers a variety of lecturers, including biologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and theologians, for topics relating to evolution, science, and education.

[ http://ncse.com/ncse-events NCSE Events National Center for Science Education 2008 2008-11-04 ] It publishes Reports of the National Center for Science Education bimonthly, containing book reviews and news. [ http://www.ncse.com/media/rncse Reports of the National Center for Science Education National Center for Science Education 2008 2008-11-04 ] Additionally, it publishes books, such as a compilation of scientific analyses of creationist books. [ http://ncse.com/store/ncse-books NCSE Books National Center for Science Education 2008 2008-11-04 ] In 2003, the NCSE gained international attention with Project Steve. { Project Steve, National Center for Science Education, Last updated October 25, 2008, retrieved November 4, 2008. } In 2005 the NCSE assisted the plaintiffs in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District‎, the most prominent case testing the constitutionality of intelligent design in public school science classes, and put their extensive library of creationist materials at the plaintiffs&apos; disposal. Nick Matzke, the NCSE&apos;s Public Information Project Director at the time, served as liaison to the legal team, and was responsible for uncovering the substitution of &quot; intelligent design &quot; for &quot; creationism &quot; within drafts of Of Pandas and People, which became a devastating part of the testimony of Barbara Forrest (also an NCSE Director), { Deception by Design, Lenny Flank, Lenny Flank, Jr., 2007 } and was cited extensively in Judge John E. Jones III &apos;s decision. { Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, p32 } In April 2008, the NCSE launched &quot; Expelled Exposed, &quot; a website critical of the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed‎ starring Ben Stein. [ http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/expelled-flunks-test-002310 Expelled flunks the test National Center for Science Education April 15, 2008 2007-05-17 ] The website received press attention and a large amount of traffic. [ http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/expelled-exposed-002306 Expelled exposed National Center for Science Education April 18, 2008 2007-05-17 ] In 2012, The NCSE announced they would be engaged in efforts to keep climate change education, and global warming issues, safe from threats from special interests. [ Media ] Scott appeared on Uncommon Knowledge, as NCSE spokesperson, twice in 2001 debating intelligent design creationist William A. Dembski. [ http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3004521.html Darwin Under The Microscope: Questioning Darwinism Uncommon Knowledge December 7, 2001 2008-07-17 ] [ http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3004591.html In Whose Image? Evolution and Spirituality Uncommon Knowledge December 7, 2001 2008-07-17 ] Then in 2004, NCSE was represented by Scott on Penn and Teller &apos;s Showtime television show Bullshit! on the episode &quot; Creationism &quot;. [ http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/previous_episodes.do?episodeid%3Ds1%2Fc Creationism Bullshit! 2004 2008-05-17 http://web.archive.org/web/20080618023601/http%3A//www.sho.com/site/ptbs/previous_episodes.do?episodeid%3Ds1%2Fc 2008-06-18 ] Scott offered scientific views about the creationist and intelligent design movements. She noted, &quot; it would be unfair to tell students that there is a serious dispute going on among scientists whether evolution took place. There&apos;s not. &quot; She further noted that &quot; a lot of the time the creationists... they&apos;ll search through scientific journals and try to pull out something they think demonstrates evolution doesn&apos;t work and there is a kind of interesting rationale behind it. Their theology is such that if one thing is wrong with the Bible you have to throw it all out so that&apos;s why Genesis has to be interpreted literally. They look at science the same way. If one little piece of the evolutionary puzzle doesn&apos;t fit the whole thing has to go. &quot; Scott then explained &quot; that&apos;s not the way science is done. &quot; In November 2007 Scott discussed the NCSE&apos;s exploration of intelligent design on the NOVA documentary Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial, which documented Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.
