[ Roman Catholic priest the Australian politician Brendan Smyth (politician) ] Fr. Brendan Smyth, c. 1965 Brendan Smyth (8 June 1927 – 22 August 1997) was a Roman Catholic priest who became notorious as a child molester, using his position in the Roman Catholic Church to obtain access to his victims. During a period of over 40 years, Smyth sexually abused and indecently assaulted over 100 { Profile of Father Brendan Smyth } [ Irish Independent Cardinal will only step down if told to do so by Pope http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cardinal-will-only-step-down-if-told-to-do-so-by-pope-2099642.html 15 March 2010 ] children in parish es in Belfast, Dublin and the United States. His actions were frequently hidden from police and the public by Roman Catholic officials. Controversy surrounding his case brought about the downfall of the government of Ireland in December 1994. { Coalition in power 2 years when Smyth row erupted } [ Early life and ordination ] Born John Gerard Smyth, { Evil spirit of a ruined church, } { The Irish Times, Weekend Review, p5, 20 March 2010 } in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Smyth, upon joining the Norbertine Roman Catholic religious order in 1945, changed his name to Brendan. The Norbertines, also known as the &quot; Premonstratensians, &quot; were aware of Smyth&apos;s crimes as early as the late 1940s, yet they did not report him to either the Garda Síochána or the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Smyth was moved from parish to parish and between diocese s and countries whenever allegations were made. In some cases, the order did not inform the diocesan bishop that Smyth had a history of sexual abuse and should be kept away from children. He abused children in parishes in Rhode Island and North Dakota in the US and was suspected of similar actions while on pastoral work in Wales and Italy. Norbertine Father Bruno Mulvihill made several attempts to alert church authorities about the abuse committed by Smyth. { Priest who blew whistle on Smyth estranged from order, Grainne Cunningham, } { Irish Independent, 17 March 2010 } [ 1994 arrest ] Smyth&apos;s first conviction followed the reporting to police of his abuse of four siblings in Belfast &apos;s Falls Road. After his arrest in 1991, he fled to the Republic of Ireland, where he spent the next three years on the run, staying mostly at Kilnacrott Abbey. This led to the collapse of the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government when the poor handling of an extradition request from the RUC by the Irish Attorney General &apos;s office led to a further delay of Smyth&apos;s trial. An award-winning UTV Counterpoint programme on the scandal by journalist Chris Moore, followed by a book, accused the head of the Norbertines and the Archbishop of Armagh of mishandling the case, and the Norbertines of negligence and a failure to tell others of Smyth&apos;s crimes, enabling Smyth to sexually abuse large numbers of children for 40 years.

Survivors groups saw this as evidence of collusion, but Brady said he &quot; did not have the authority &quot; to turn Smyth in. { Caldwell, Simon, &amp; Pisa, Nick (2010-03-15).
