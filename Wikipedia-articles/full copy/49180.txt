Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic or probabilistic logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. In contrast with traditional logic theory, where binary sets have two-valued logic : true or false, fuzzy logic variables may have a truth value that ranges in degree between 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. { Novák, V., Perfilieva, I. and Močkoř, J. (1999) Mathematical principles of fuzzy logic Dodrecht: Kluwer Academic. } { ISBN 0-7923-8595-0 } Furthermore, when linguist ic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions. Fuzzy logic began with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy set theory by Lotfi Zadeh. [ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-fuzzy/ Fuzzy Logic 2008-09-29 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Stanford University 2006-07-23 ] { Zadeh, L.A. (1965). &quot; Fuzzy sets &quot;, Information and Control 8 (3): 338–353. } Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from control theory to artificial intelligence. [ Overview ] The reasoning in fuzzy logic is similar to human reasoning. It allows for approximate values and inferences as well as incomplete or ambiguous data (fuzzy data) as opposed to only relying on crisp data (binary yes/no choices). Fuzzy logic is able to process incomplete data and provide approximate solutions to problems other methods find difficult to solve. [ April 2012 ] [ Degrees of truth ] Fuzzy logic and probabilistic logic are mathematically similar – both have truth value s ranging between 0 and 1 – but conceptually distinct, due to different interpretations—see interpretations of probability theory. Fuzzy logic corresponds to &quot; degrees of truth &quot;, while probabilistic logic corresponds to &quot; probability, likelihood &quot;; as these differ, fuzzy logic and probabilistic logic yield different models of the same real-world situations. Both degrees of truth and probabilities range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem similar at first. For example, let a 100   ml glass contain 30 ml of water. Then we may consider two concepts: Empty and Full. The meaning of each of them can be represented by a certain fuzzy set. Then one might define the glass as being 0.7 empty and 0.3 full. Note that the concept of emptiness would be subjective and thus would depend on the observer or designer. Another designer might equally well design a set membership function where the glass would be considered full for all values down to 50 ml. It is essential to realize that fuzzy logic uses truth degrees as a mathematical model of the vagueness phenomenon while probability is a mathematical model of ignorance. [ Applying truth values ] A basic application might characterize subranges of a continuous variable. For instance, a temperature measurement for anti-lock brakes might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range. These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled. Fuzzy logic temperature In this image, the meanings of the expressions cold, warm, and hot are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three &quot; truth values &quot; —one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as &quot; not hot &quot;. The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as &quot; slightly warm &quot; and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) &quot; fairly cold &quot;. [ Linguistic variables ] While variables in mathematics usually take numerical values, in fuzzy logic applications, the non-numeric linguistic variables are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts. { Zadeh, L. A. et al. 1996 Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Systems, World Scientific Press, ISBN 981-02-2421-4 } A linguistic variable such as age may have a value such as young or its antonym old. However, the great utility of linguistic variables is that they can be modified via linguistic hedges applied to primary terms. The linguistic hedges can be associated with certain functions. [ Example ] Fuzzy set theory defines fuzzy operators on fuzzy sets. The problem in applying this is that the appropriate fuzzy operator may not be known. For this reason, fuzzy logic usually uses IF-THEN rules, or constructs that are equivalent, such as fuzzy associative matrices. Rules are usually expressed in the form: IF variable IS property THEN action For example, a simple temperature regulator that uses a fan might look like this: IF temperature IS very cold THEN stop fanIF temperature IS cold THEN turn down fanIF temperature IS normal THEN maintain levelIF temperature IS hot THEN speed up fan There is no &quot; ELSE &quot; – all of the rules are evaluated, because the temperature might be &quot; cold &quot; and &quot; normal &quot; at the same time to different degrees. The AND, OR, and NOT operators of boolean logic exist in fuzzy logic, usually defined as the minimum, maximum, and complement; when they are defined this way, they are called the Zadeh operators. So for the fuzzy variables x and y: NOT x = (1 - truth(x))x AND y = minimum(truth(x), truth(y))x OR y = maximum(truth(x), truth(y)) There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called hedges that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as &quot; very &quot;, or &quot; somewhat &quot;, which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula. [ Logical analysis ] In mathematical logic, there are several formal system s of &quot; fuzzy logic &quot;; most of them belong among so-called t-norm fuzzy logics. [ Propositional fuzzy logics ] The most important propositional fuzzy logics are: Monoidal t-norm-based propositional fuzzy logic MTL is an axiomatization of logic where conjunction is defined by a left continuous t-norm, and implication is defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its model s correspond to MTL-algebras that are prelinear commutative bounded integral residuated lattice s. Basic propositional fuzzy logic BL is an extension of MTL logic where conjunction is defined by a continuous t-norm, and implication is also defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to BL-algebras. Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where standard conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic fuzzy logic plus an axiom of double negation, and its models correspond to MV-algebras. Gödel fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is Gödel t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus an axiom of idempotence of conjunction, and its models are called G-algebras. Product fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is product t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus another axiom for cancellativity of conjunction, and its models are called product algebras. Fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax (sometimes also called Pavelka&apos;s logic), denoted by EVŁ, is a further generalization of mathematical fuzzy logic. While the above kinds of fuzzy logic have traditional syntax and many-valued semantics, in EVŁ is evaluated also syntax. This means that each formula has an evaluation. Axiomatization of EVŁ stems from Łukasziewicz fuzzy logic. A generalization of classical Gödel completeness theorem is provable in EVŁ. [ Predicate fuzzy logics ] These extend the above-mentioned fuzzy logics by adding universal and existential quantifier s in a manner similar to the way that predicate logic is created from propositional logic. The semantics of the universal (resp. existential) quantifier in t-norm fuzzy logics is the infimum (resp. supremum ) of the truth degrees of the instances of the quantified subformula. [ Decidability issues for fuzzy logic ] The notions of a &quot; decidable subset &quot; and &quot; recursively enumerable subset &quot; are basic ones for classical mathematics and classical logic. Then, the question of a suitable extension of these concepts to fuzzy set theory arises. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of fuzzy Turing machine, Markov normal fuzzy algorithm and fuzzy program (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable and therefore they proposed the following ones. Denote by Ü the set of rational numbers in [0,1]. Then a fuzzy subset s : S \rightarrow [0,1] of a set S is recursively enumerable if a recursive map h : S×N \rightarrow Ü exists such that, for every x in S, the function h(x,n) is increasing with respect to n and s(x) = lim h(x,n).We say that s is decidable if both s and its complement –s are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property). Theorem. Any axiomatizable fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the fuzzy set of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable. It is an open question to give supports for a Church thesis for fuzzy mathematics the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. To this aim, an extension of the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy Turing machine should be necessary (see for example Wiedermann&apos;s paper). Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of Gödel ’s theorems to fuzzy logic. [ Fuzzy databases ] Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy relational database s. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in Maria Zemankova&apos;s dissertation. Later, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. Medina, M.A. Vila et al. In the context of fuzzy databases, some fuzzy querying languages have been defined, highlighting the SQLf by P. Bosc et al. and the FSQL by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels and so on. [ Comparison to probability ] Fuzzy logic and probability are different ways of expressing uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can be used to represent subjective belief, fuzzy set theory uses the concept of fuzzy set membership (i.e., how much a variable is in a set), and probability theory uses the concept of subjective probability (i.e., how probable do I think that a variable is in a set). While this distinction is mostly philosophical, the fuzzy-logic-derived possibility measure is inherently different from the probability measure, hence they are not directly equivalent. However, many statisticians are persuaded by the work of Bruno de Finetti that only one kind of mathematical uncertainty is needed and thus fuzzy logic is unnecessary. On the other hand, Bart Kosko argues [ December 2011 ] that probability is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as probability only handles one kind of uncertainty. He also claims [ December 2011 ] to have proven a derivation of Bayes&apos; theorem from the concept of fuzzy subsethood. Lotfi Zadeh argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to fuzzy probability and also generalized it to what is called possibility theory. (cf. { Novák, V. &quot; Are fuzzy sets a reasonable tool for modeling vague phenomena? &quot;, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 156 (2005) 341—348. } ) More generally, fuzzy logic is one of many different proposed extensions to classical logic, known as probabilistic logic s, intended to deal with issues of uncertainty in classical logic, the inapplicability of probability theory in many domains, and the paradoxes of Dempster-Shafer theory.
