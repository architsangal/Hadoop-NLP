{ Bourges (France) } Weather vane with dial Admiralty boardroom, 1808; a wind indicator can be seen on the end wall. { wind vane in } { Jerez, } { Guinness world record of the largest wind vane that works } { Yukon Transportation Museum located beside the Whitehorse International Airport. } A &quot; jin pole &quot; being used to install a weather vane atop the 200 foot steeple of a church in Kingston, New York. A weather vane (or weathercock) is an instrument for showing the direction of the wind. They are typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building. Although partly functional, weather vanes are generally decorative, often featuring the traditional cockerel design with letters indicating the points of the compass. Other common motifs include ships, arrows and horses. Not all weather vanes have pointers. The word &apos;vane&apos; comes from the Anglo-Saxon word &apos;fane&apos; meaning &apos;flag&apos;. [ Operation ] The design of a wind vane is such that the weight is evenly distributed on each side of the surface, but the surface area is unequally divided, so that the pointer can move freely on its axis. The side with the larger surface area is blown away from the wind direction, so that the smaller side, with the pointer, is pivoted to face the wind direction. Most wind vanes have directional markers beneath the arrow, aligned with the geographic directions. Wind vanes, especially those with fanciful shapes, do not always show the real direction of a very gentle wind. This is because the figures do not achieve the necessary design balance: an unequal surface area but balanced in weight. To obtain an accurate reading, the wind vane must be located well above the ground and away from buildings, trees, and other objects which interfere with the true wind direction. Changing wind direction can be meaningful when coordinated with other apparent sky conditions, enabling the user to make simple short range forecasts.From the street level the size of many weathercocks is deceptive. { Eric R. Delderfield: &quot; Ancient Churches for Beginners &quot; Exmouth, Devon, The Raleigh Press,pp 42 } [ History ] The Tower of the Winds on the ancient Roman agora in Athens once bore on its roof a wind vane in the form of a bronze Triton holding a rod in his outstretched hand, rotating as the wind changed direction. Below, the frieze was adorned with the eight wind deities. The eight metre high structure also featured sundial s, and a water clock inside dates from around 50 BC. { Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. devictorlla Price: The Water Clock in the Tower of the Winds, } { American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (1968), pp. 345-355 (353) } Pope Gregory I said [ May 2012 ] that the cock ( rooster ) &quot; was the most suitable emblem of Christianity &quot;, being &quot; the emblem of St Peter &quot;. { John G. R. Forlong, &apos;&apos;Encyclopedia of Religions&apos;&apos;: A-d - Page 471 } { The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by Edward Walford, John Charles Cox, George Latimer Apperson - page 202 } Some say that it was as a result of this that the cock began gradually to be used as a weather vane on church steeples, and some add that in the 9th century Pope Nicholas I { How the Chicken Conquered the World - By Jerry Adler and Andrew Lawler - Smithsonian magazine, June 2012 } ordered the figure to be placed on every church steeple. { The Philadelphia Museum bulletin, Volumes 1-5 - By Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art - p 14 - 1906 } and it is known that Pope Leo IV did have it placed on the Old St. Peter&apos;s Basilica or old Constantinian basilica { ST PETER&apos;S BASILICA.ORG - Providing information on St. Peter&apos;s Basilicaand Square in the Vatican City - The Treasury Museum } even before Nicholas I was Pope. Alternative theories about the origin of weathercocks on church steeples are that it was an emblem of the vigilance of the clergy calling the people to prayer, { Thomas Ignatius M. Forster, &apos;&apos;Circle of the Seasons&apos;&apos;, p. 18 } that it was derived from the Goths { William Shepard Walsh, &apos;&apos;A Handy Book of Curious Information&apos;&apos; } and is only possibly a Christian symbol, { William White, &apos;&apos;Notes and Queries&apos;&apos; } and that it is an emblem of the sun. { Hargrave Jennings, &apos;&apos;Phallicism&apos;&apos;, p. 72 } As it were, Pope Nicholas I { How the Chicken Conquered the World - By Jerry Adler and Andrew Lawler - Smithsonian magazine, June 2012 } did in fact decree in the 9th century that all churches must show the symbol of a cock on its dome or steeple, as a symbol of Jesus &apos; prophecy of Peter&apos;s betrayal ( Luke 22:34 ), that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the morning following the Last Supper. Many churches started [ May 2012 ] using this symbol on its weathervanes. Other sources cited above say the custom had begun more than two centuries earlier. The Bayeux Tapestry of 1070s depicts a scene, with a man installing a weather vane with a cock on Westminster Abbey, while the dead King Edward is carried inside. Early weather vanes had very ornamental pointers, but modern wind vanes are usually simple arrows that dispense with the directionals because the instrument is connected to a remote reading station. An early example of this was installed in the Royal Navy&apos;s Admiralty building in London - the vane on the roof was mechanically linked to a large dial in the boardroom so senior officers were always aware of the wind direction when they met. Modern aerovanes combine the directional vane with an anemometer (a device for measuring wind speed). Co-locating both instruments allows them to use the same axis (a vertical rod) and provides a coordinated readout. Another wind direction device is the windsock used at airports to show wind direction and strength. The wind fills the sock and makes it blow away from the prevailing wind. Strong winds make the sock point almost horizontally, while light airs allow the sock to hang limply. Because of its size, the windsock can often be seen from the air as well as the ground. Even the most technologically-advanced airports still use windsocks. [ World&apos;s largest weather vane ] According to the Guinness World Records, the world&apos;s largest weather vane is a Tío Pepe sherry advertisement located in Jerez, Spain. The city of Montague, Michigan also claims to have the largest standard-design weather vane, being a ship and arrow which measures 48 feet tall, with an arrow 26 feet long. [ http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?p%3DG4884 The World&apos;s Largest Weather Vane - Ella Ellenwood 2010-06-01 ] A challenger for the title of world&apos;s largest weather vane is located in Whitehorse, Yukon. The weather vane is a retired Douglas DC-3 CF-CPY atop a swiveling support. Located at the Yukon Transportation Museum { goytm.ca } beside Whitehorse International Airport, the weather vane is used by pilots to determine wind direction, used as a landmark by tourists and enjoyed by locals. The weather vane only requires a 5 knot wind to rotate.
