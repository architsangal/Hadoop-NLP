[ February 2011 ] [ 1515 11 22 y ] { Bar-le-Duc, } { Lorraine, } { France } [ 1560 6 11 1515 11 22 y ] { ( } { dropsy ) } { Edinburgh Castle, } { Scotland } { Saint Pierre de } { Reims, } { France } Mary of Guise ( [ Marie de Guise ] ) (22 November 1515 – 11 June 1560) was a queen consort of Scotland as the second spouse of King James V. She was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, and served as regent of Scotland in her daughter&apos;s name from 1554 to 1560. A native of Lorraine, she was a member of the powerful House of Guise, which played a prominent role in 16th-century French politics. [ Duchess of Longueville ] Mary was born at Bar-le-Duc, Lorraine, the eldest daughter of Claude of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, head of the House of Guise, and his wife Antoinette de Bourbon, herself the daughter of Francis, Count of Vendome, and Marie de Luxembourg. Among her 11 siblings were Francis, Duke of Guise, Claude, Duke of Aumale, Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, and Louis I, Cardinal of Guise. Mary was tall and her mother mentioned in a letter that she suffered from bad colds and had greasy hair. { Wood, Marguerite, ed., Balcarres Papers: The French Correspondence of Marie de Lorraine, vol. 1, Scottish History Society (1923), p. 228, c. 1542. } Coat of arms of Mary as Duchess of Longueville On 4 August 1534, at the age of 18, she became Duchess of Longueville by marrying Louis II, Duke of Longueville (born 1510), at the Louvre. Their union turned out to be happy, but brief. On 30 October 1535, Mary gave birth to her first son, Francis, but on 9 June 1537, Louis died at Rouen and left her a widow at the age of 21. For the rest of her life, Mary kept the last letter from her bon mari et ami (her good husband and friend Louis), which mentioned his illness and explained his absence at Rouen. It can still be seen at the National Library of Scotland. { Marshall, R. K., Mary of Guise, Collins, (1977), 36–39: Wood, Marguerite, ed., Balcarres Papers, vol. 1, SHS (1923), 1. } On 4 August, Mary gave birth to their second son, who was named Louis after his deceased father. Louis died very young, but Francis wrote letters to his mother in Scotland; on 22 March 1545 he sent a piece of string to show how tall he was, and on 2 July 1546 he sent her his portrait. { Wood, Marguerite, ed., Balcarres Papers, vol. 1, SHS (1923), 110 from Joinville, 145 from Fontainebleau. } [ Scottish marriage ] Later in 1537, Mary became the focus of marriage negotiations with James V of Scotland, who had lost his first wife, Madeleine of Valois, due to tuberculosis, and wanted a second French bride to further the interests of the Franco-Scottish alliance against England. According to a 17th-century writer, James V had noticed the attractions of Mary when he went to France to meet Madeleine and Mary of Bourbon, and she was next in his affections. { Strickland, Agnes, &apos;&apos;Lives of the Queens of Scotland&apos;&apos;, vol. 1, Edinburgh (1850), 337–339, quoting William Drummond of Hawthornden, &apos;&apos;Works&apos;&apos;, (1711) 104. } It is known that Mary attended the wedding of James and Madeleine. { Seward, Denis, Prince of the Renaissance, (1973), 193–6; cited Marshall (1977), 38, Rosalind Marshall does not repeat Hawthornden&apos;s story. } The recently-widowed Henry VIII of England, in attempts to prevent this union, also asked for Mary&apos;s hand. Given Henry&apos;s marital history – banishing his first wife and beheading the second – Mary refused the offer. In December 1537, Henry VIII told Castillon, the French ambassador in London, that he was big in person and had need of a big wife. { &apos;&apos;Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII&apos;&apos;, vol. 12, part 2 (1891) no. 1285, (Louis de Perreau, Sieur de Castillon to François Ier) } Biographer Antonia Fraser writing in 1968 said Mary replied, &quot; I may be a big woman, but I have a very little neck. &quot; { Fraser, Antonia, Mary Queen of Scots, Weidenfield &amp; Nicholson, (1969), 7. } This was apparently a tribute to the famously macabre jest made by Henry&apos;s French-educated second wife, Anne Boleyn, who had joked before her death that the executioner would find killing her easy because she had &quot; a little neck. &quot; King Francis I of France accepted James&apos;s proposal over Henry&apos;s and conveyed his wishes to Mary&apos;s father. Francis had a marriage contract prepared that offered James a dowry as large as if Mary were a princess. { Teulet, Alexandre, &apos;&apos;Relations Politiques de la France et de l&apos;Espagne avec l&apos;Ecosse&apos;&apos;, vol. 1, Paris (1862) 115, (the surviving draft calls Mary, &apos;Marguerite&apos;). } Mary&apos;s mother found the contract &quot; marvellously strange &quot;, because the king had included Mary&apos;s son&apos;s inheritance in the dowry. { Wood, Marguerite, Balcarres Papers, vol. 1, SHS (1923), ix, 3 &amp; fn., &quot; mervyleusement estrange. &quot; } Mary received the news with shock and alarm, as she did not wish to leave family and country, especially as she had just lost her first husband and her younger son. It has been said that her father tried to delay matters apparently until James, perhaps sensing her reluctance, wrote to her, appealing for her advice and support. { Marshall (1977), 51–3, but see fn. 15. } However the authenticity of this letter, which was first produced in 1935, has been questioned. { Marshall (1977), 268–269 (fn. 15), the letter first appeared in Stefan Zweig, Mary Queen of Scots, London (1935), 1–2. } David Beaton travelled to France for the marriage negotiations. He wrote to James V from Lyon on 22 October 1537 that Mary was &quot; stark (strong), well-complexioned, and fit to travel. &quot; Beaton wrote that the Duke of Guise was &quot; marvellous desirous of the expedition and hasty end of the matter, &quot; and had already consulted with his brother, the Duke of Lorraine, and Mary herself, who was with her mother in Champagne waiting on the resolution of the negotiations. { &apos;&apos;Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII&apos;&apos;, vol. 12, part 2 (1891) no. 962: Lang, Andrew, &apos;Letters of Cardinal Beaton, SHR (1909), 156: Marshall (1977), 45, (which suggests he thought the couple had not met) } Coat of arms of Mary as Queen consort of Scots The marriage contract was finalized in January 1538 with a dowry including that of her first marriage. As was customary, if the King died first, the Dowager of Scotland would have for her lifetime her jointure houses of Falkland Palace, Stirling Castle, Dingwall Castle, and Threave, with the rentals of the corresponding Earldoms and Lordships. { Hay, Denys, ed., The Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 340-341. The same offer was made to } { Madeleine of Valois and } { Mary of Bourbon. See also; Bapst, E., Les Mariages de Jacques V, 324; Teulet, Alexandre, &apos;&apos;Relations Politiques de la France et de l&apos;Espagne avec l&apos;Ecosse&apos;&apos;, vol. 1, Paris (1862), 115-118. } Finally, Mary accepted the offer and hurried plans for departure. On 18 May 1538, at Notre-Dame de Paris, James V and Mary of Guise were married with Lord Maxwell acting as proxy. Accompanied by a fleet of ships sent by James, Mary left France in June, forced to leave her little son behind. She landed in Fife on 10 June and was formally received by James. They were married in person a few days later at St Andrews. James&apos;s mother Margaret Tudor wrote to Henry VIII in July, &quot; I trust she will prove a wise Princess. I have been much in her company, and she bears herself very honourably to me, with very good entertaining. &quot; { State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 4. (1836), 135, Margaret to Henry, 31 July 1538. } The Duke of Guise sent her masons and miners, an armourer, and she had a French painter to decorate her palaces, Pierre Quesnel. { Thomas, Andrea, Princelie Majestie,(2006): Wood, Marguerite, Balcarres Papers, vol. 1 (1923). } She was crowned as Queen Consort at Holyrood Abbey on 22 February 1540. Preparations for her coronation began in October 1539 when the jeweller John Mosman made a new crown and her silver sceptre was gilded. Payments made for the ceremony include hanging tapestries; carrying church furnishings from the Palace chapel into the Abbey; eleven chaplains; boards for stages in the Abbey; and messengers sent to summon the ladies of the kingdom. { Edington, Carol, Court and Culture in Renaissance Scotland, Tuckwell, (1994), 111, citing ALTS vol. 7. } A salute of 30 guns was fired from David&apos;s Tower on Edinburgh Castle, and there were fireworks devised by James and made by his royal gunners. { Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 347 (gun-chambers), 357 (fireworks). } James and Mary had two sons. James Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, was born 22 May 1540 at St Andrews. Robert was born and baptised on 12 April 1541, but both died on 21 April 1541, when James was nearly one year old and Robert was eight days old. Mary&apos;s mother Antoinette de Bourbon wrote that the couple was still young and should hope for more children. She thought a change of wet-nurse and over-feeding may not have helped. { Wood, Marguerite, Balcarres Papers, vol. 1, STS (1923), 60–61. } The third and last child of the union was a daughter Mary, who was born on 8 December 1542. King James died six days later, making the infant Mary queen regnant of Scotland. Mary of Guise and her second husband, King James V of Scotland [ Arran&apos;s Regency ] The government of Scotland was first entrusted to James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, as Regent. Henry VIII of England wished Mary to marry his son, Prince Edward. This led to internal conflicts in Scotland between those who preferred alliance with France and led to an English invasion, the so-called Rough Wooing. Guise told an English diplomat Ralph Sadler that Regent Arran was a &quot; simple man &quot; and she could easily find out his &quot; whole intent. &quot; In April 1543, Arran heard a rumour that Henry VIII now wished to make Mary of Guise his sixth wife. He confronted Mary with this and she prevaricated, learning from him (as she had already guessed) that he told everything to Sadler. Then she sent her confidante Lord Fleming to Sadler to report the conversation. In turn, Sadler relayed to Henry VIII his account of &quot; every man&apos;s tale whereby your grace may perceive the perplexed state of affairs in Scotland. &quot; { Strickland, Agnes, Lives of the Queens of Scotland, vol. 2 (1851), 39-41: Clifford, Arthur, ed., Sadler State Papers, vol.1, (1809), 134-5, Sadler to Henry VIII, 9 April 1543; p.86 } At first Guise stayed unwillingly at Linlithgow Palace, then in July 1543 she moved with the infant queen to Stirling Castle. When Ralph Sadler spoke to her again in August, Guise assured him the English marriage would go ahead when Mary was ten years old. In the meantime Mary was safe at Stirling, and Guise said she was glad to be at Stirling and, &quot; much she praised there about the house. &quot; { Clifford, Arthur ed., Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (1809), 249–253, Sadler to Henry VIII, 10 August 1543. } It soon became clear to Henry VIII that Mary and Edward would not be married, despite Scottish promises and the Treaty of Greenwich, and at the end of 1543 he launched the war now called the Rough Wooing, hoping to turn the situation around. After a Scottish defeat at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in September 1547, French military aid weakened English resolve and increased the power base of Mary of Guise, who remained in Scotland. Equipped with a newly painted spear for her royal standard, { Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (1911), 195. } Mary came to view the progress of the siege of Haddington in July 1548. Her party came in range of the English guns and sixteen of her entourage were killed around her. { Calendar of State Papers Spain, vol. 9 (1912), 569: Teulet, A., ed., &apos;&apos;Relations politiques de la France et de l&apos;Espagne avec l&apos;Écosse au XVIe siècle&apos;&apos;, vol. 1 (1862), 220-221 } Following this terrifying incident, Mary gave one of her gunners at Haddington, Andro Straitoun, a reward of a month&apos;s wages, £4. { Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (1911), 226. } By the resolution of the Scottish Parliament at Haddington, { &apos;&apos;Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707&apos;&apos; Haddington Abbey, 7 July 1548 } Mary Stewart was sent to France in August 1548 to be raised with her husband-to-be, the dauphin, son of Henry II of France. Guise first planned to sail with her daughter from Dumbarton as far as Whithorn where she would make pilgrimage, { Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 155, Ruthven to Grey. } but returned instead for a council meeting in Edinburgh. { Marshall, Rosalind K., Mary of Guise, Collins (1977), 175. } At this time, the dedication of the Scottish book, The Complaynt of Scotland, recalled Mary of Guise&apos;s descent from Godfrey de Bouillon and claimed her courage and virtue exceeded those of the ancient heroines Tomyris, Semiramis and Penthesilea. { Murray, James AH. ed.,The Complaynt of Scotland, 1549, EETS (1872), 2. } After negotiating on Christmas Day 1549 at Stirling Castle for more French guns for the siege of Broughty Castle, she showed more prudence in February 1550 by watching the successful assault from across the Tay. { Michaud &amp; Poujoulat, &apos;&apos;Nouvelle Collection des memoirs pour server a l’histoire de France&apos;&apos;, vol. 6 (1839) 6–7. } The English troops abandoned their occupation of Haddington in September 1549 and Paul de Thermes and Arran walked in. Mary of Guise was triumphant, writing that &quot; the English had left nothing behind but the plague. &quot; { Marcus, Merriman, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2002), 337–339, 344–345, &quot; ny ont laisse que la peste derriere eulx. &quot; } The peace process began and Scotland was included in the Treaty of Boulogne of 24 March 1550. { Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings, Tuckwell (2000), 346. } As part of the treaty, Mary&apos;s brother Claude, Marquis de Mayenne, was one of six French hostages sent to England. { Jordan, W.K., Chronicle of Edward VI, London (1966), 22, 24, 26, 27, 29. } After their father died on 12 April 1550, Claude was allowed to come to Scotland with a passport from Edward VI dated 11 May. { Lodge, Edmund, Illustrations of British History, vol. 1 (1791), 137, Lambeth Palace Talbot Mss. vol. B, f.205, Lodge assumes it was Francis, not Claude. } Claude wrote from Edinburgh on 18 May that he would survey the fortifications of the realm. { Michaud &amp; Poujoulat, Nouvelle Collection des Memoires pour servir a l&apos;histoire de France, vol. 6, (1839), 39. } After the Treaty was signed, Mary was able to travel to France to see her family. [ Travels in France and England ] Mary left Scotland on 6 September 1550 and arrived at Dieppe in time to participate in a festival with the French court at Rouen with her daughter on 1 October 1550. { British Library festival books website } [ http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pagemax.aspx?strFest%3D0020%26amp%3BstrPage%3D8 C&apos;est la Deduction du Sumpteaux Spectacles,... Rouen (1551) ] {, 8. } At Rouen, Mary and the Queen of Scots rode in procession behind soldiers carrying banners depicting Scottish fortresses recently defended and recovered by the French. She brought with her a large retinue of Scottish gentlemen, including the Earls of Huntly, Cassillis, Sutherland, Marischal, and Wigtown, plus Lords Home and Maxwell, and the Bishops of Caithness and Galloway. { Tytler, Patrick Fraser, England under Edward &amp; Mary, vol. 1 (1839), 329. } Historians have analysed the Scottish retinue as a team-building exercise for Mary. { Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, Tuckwell (2002), 69–71, 81–5, 250–255. } Over the winter she stayed with the French court at Blois, then spent the summer with Henry II visiting Tours, Angers and Nantes. At Amboise in April, Mary was sickened by news of a plot to poison the young queen of Scots. { &apos;&apos;Calendar State Papers Foreign Edward&apos;&apos;, (1861) 97, no. 332, } { John Mason to PC, 29 April 1551. } A Scottish would-be poisoner, Robert Stewart, discovered in London was delivered to the French in May. { Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 10 (1914): Jordan, WK ed., Chronicle of Edward VI, (1966), 62. } Throughout her time in France, Mary was anxious to gain the best settlement for her daughter&apos;s marriage to the dauphin and financial support for herself in Scotland. At Tours in May, a cynical English observer, John Mason, who scanned the Scottish retinue for signs of dissent, reported, &quot; the Dowager of Scotland maketh all this court weary of her, such an importunate beggar is she for herself. The king would fain be rid of her. The trucking is about money matters. &quot; { Calendar State Papers Foreign Edward, (1861), 103. } While accompanying her to Dieppe on her return, her son Francis died at Amiens. { Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, Tuckwell, (2002), 66, 86–90 } In October 1551 she met Edward VI in England. Mary landed at Portsmouth and stayed her first night at Southwick Priory. On her way to London she stopped at Warblington, Cowdray, Hampton Court and Fulham Palace. { Calendar State Papers Foreign Edward, London (1861), 190–1, (PRO SP68/9/85) } At his meeting with Mary at Whitehall Palace, Edward gave her a diamond ring. { Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol.2 part 2, Oxford (1822), 255 &amp; vol. 2 part 1, 501, citing treasury warrant April 1553. } The ring, &quot; sett with a fayer table diamount &quot;, had belonged to Catherine Parr. { Starkey, David, The Inventory of Henry VIII, Society of Antiquaries, (1998), no. 3504, p94, notes Edward&apos;s warrant 24 March 1553. } Princess Mary declined to attend her visit. { Calendar State Papers Spanish, vol. 10 (1914), 391. } Princess Elizabeth was present, and according to John Aylmer, unlike the other women at Edward&apos;s court she did not try to emulate the novel French &quot; frounsed, curled and double-curled &quot; hairstyles of Guise&apos;s Scottish retinue. { Aylmer, John, An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subjectes agaynst the Late Blowne Blaste, concerninge the Government of Wemen, Strasborg (1559): quoted by Strickland, Agnes, Lives of the Queens of England, vol.6 (1844), p.59. } On her way north to Scotland Ralph Sadler conveyed her through Hertfordshire, and she stopped at Robert Chester&apos;s house at Royston Priory and the house of the Dowager Duchess of Suffolk at Grimsthorpe Castle near Stamford. { Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 2 part 1, Oxford (1822), 502–3. } Arran summoned some of the barons of East Lothian to meet her at Berwick, and the gentlemen of Selkirk, Jedburgh and Duns, Peebles and Lauder, Haddington, Dunbar and North Berwick were summoned to meet her at Our Lady Kirk of Steill on 24 November 1551. Six cart loads of breech-loading cannon chambers were brought from the armoury at Leith up to Edinburgh Castle to fire salutes on her return. { Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10, (1913), xvi, 32–34. } [ Regent of Scotland ] { Mary, Queen of Scots, Mary of Guise&apos;s daughter, for whom she acted as regent from 1554 to 1560 } In December 1552, Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary, sister of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, pointed out to Mary that her diplomatic complaints had no force and must come from Arran. Furthermore, she was dissatisfied by Mary&apos;s evident friendship with France. { Calendar State Papers Spanish, vol. 10 (1914), 608–609, Queen Dowager to Mary of Guise 23 December 1552. } Mary&apos;s power was increasing: in May 1553, the imperial ambassador in London, Jean Scheyfve, heard she had challenged Arran&apos;s regency and proposed James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, her illegitimate step-son, as a replacement. { Calendar State Papers Spanish, vol. 11, (1916), 41–42. } Mary herself became regent on 12 April 1554. { Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, (2002), 94. } The eleven year old Queen Mary I sent her congratulations to &quot; la Royne, ma mere &quot; from the Château de Meudon at Easter, where she was staying with her grandmother and her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine. { Reports on various collections: Manuscripts of Robert Mordaunt Hay at Duns Castle, vol.5, HMC (1909), p.90-1. } In many affairs, Mary of Guise consulted her brothers in France – the Cardinal of Lorraine, and Francis, Duke of Guise, both of whom held government positions – so that Scotland and France worked as allies in dealing with other nations. { Michaud &amp; Poujoulat, Nouvelles collection, vol. 6, (1839), letters from Mary of Guise to her brothers: Wood, Marguerite, (1923), letters to Mary of Guise } Henry II&apos;s representative in Scotland from 1546 to 1560 was an ambassador resident, Henri Cleutin, who had been effectively in charge of Scotland during her trip to France. { Ritchie, Pamela, (2002), 127–128 } During her regency (1554–60), Frenchmen were put in charge of the treasury, the Great Seal, and the French ambassador sometimes attended the Privy Council. Yves du Rubie was Master of Requests and Keeper of the Seals { CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), p.203 no.426, 21 January 1558. } and Bartholmew de Villemore was Comptroller and Receiver-General of Revenue. Although Cleutin seems to have been universally popular, the resentment of the Scottish nobility at these appointments fuelled the coming crisis. Mary quickly began to deal effectively with Scottish affairs. In July 1554, she travelled to Jedburgh to hold a Justice Ayre for a fortnight, hoping to quell the longstanding feud between the Scott and Kerr border clans. She was escorted by armed horsemen commanded by Cleutin. In the Autumn she paid for a ship, troops and a cannon to help the Earl of Sutherland arrest Iye du Mackay, Lord Reay, who had caused mischief in Sutherland. With much less success the Earls of Huntly and Argyll were despatched to pass with fire and sword to Moidart and Lewis. Huntly&apos;s failure led to his imprisonment. During another progress in 1556 she visited Inverness, Ross, Elgin, Banff and Aberdeen. These domestic efforts were hampered by the outbreak of international conflict in January 1557. An apparent set-back occurred in October, when Guise went south to Hume Castle and sent an army towards England. Instructed to cross the border and attack Wark Castle, the Scottish lords held their own council at Eckford and returned home. { Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, Tuckwell (2002), pp.126-9; 153–155; 163–7; 182–187, citing Lambeth Talbot Ms. 3195. } [ Conflict with Protestants ] [ Scottish Reformation ] Mary&apos;s regency was threatened, however, by the growing influence of the Scottish Protestant s. To an extent, Mary of Guise had tolerated the growing number of Protestant preachers. She needed to win support for her pro-French policies, and they could expect no alternative support from England, when Mary Tudor ruled. The marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the dauphin of France on 24 April 1558 was quickly followed by Mary Tudor&apos;s death and the succession to the throne of England by Elizabeth on 17 November 1558. Mary Stuart&apos;s claim and rights of succession to the English throne depended in part on the Papal view of Elizabeth&apos;s legitimacy. If Henry II of France was to pursue Mary&apos;s claim with the Pope, as part of an ambitious plan that Scotland and England would succumb to French domination, he needed Scotland to be a secure Catholic country. Some modern historians such as Pamela E. Ritchie believe that the change to Guise&apos;s policy was not dramatic, but both Catholic and Protestant would perceive and react to the tense political situation. { Ritchie, Pamela, Mary of Guise, Tuckwell (2002), 205–207. } As the Scottish Reformation crisis was developing, Henry II died on 10 July 1559, and Mary Stuart became Queen Consort of France. In France, Mary and Francis II began to publicly display the arms of England in their blazon. This too was a motivation for English intervention in Scottish affairs. In 1557, a group of Scottish lords who became known as the &quot; Lords of the Congregation &quot;, drew up a covenant to &quot; maintain, set forth, and establish the most blessed Word of God and his Congregation &quot;. This was followed by outbreaks of iconoclasm in 1558/59. At the same time, plans were being drawn up for a Reformed programme of parish worship and preaching, as local communities sought out Protestant ministers. In 1558, the Regent summoned the Protestant preachers to answer for their teaching, but backed down when lairds from the west country threatened to revolt. Mary&apos;s original coat of arms of 1560 in South Leith Parish Church. Scotland impaled with Lorraine. The accession of the Protestant Elizabeth in England in 1558 stirred the hopes and fears of Scottish Protestants. Elizabeth came to secretly support the Lords of the Congregation. In January 1559, the anonymous Beggars&apos; Summons threatened friars with eviction in favour of beggars. This was calculated to appeal to the passions of the populace of towns who appeared to have particular complaints against friars. Fearing disorder and now determined by circumsɿtance to show less tolerance, the Regent summoned the reformed preachers to appear before her at Stirling on 10 May. Insurrection followed. The men of Angus assembled in Dundee to accompany the preachers to Stirling, and on 4 May they were joined by John Knox, who had recently arrived from France. Stirred by Knox&apos;s sermons in Perth and Dundee, the mob sacked religious houses (including the tomb of James I in Perth). In response, the Regent marched on Perth, but was forced to withdraw and negotiate when another reformed contingent arrived from the west. Among the Regent&apos;s ambassadors were the Earl of Argyll and Lord James Stewart, Earl of Moray, both professed Protestants. When the Regent stationed French mercenaries in Perth, both abandoned her and joined the Lords of the Congregation at St Andrews, where they were also joined by John Knox. Even Edinburgh soon fell to them in July, as Mary retreated to Dunbar. The Congregation Lords made a truce with Guise and signed the Articles of Leith at Leith Links on 25 July 1559 which promised religious tolerance, then withdrew to Stirling. { CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (1898); p.221, Croft to Cecil, 3 July 1559; 212–3, 215, Croft to English council, 19 &amp; 22 May &amp; 5 June 1559; no. 500, &apos;Articles of Leith&apos; } In September, Châtelherault, with the safe return of his son, the Earl of Arran, accepted the leadership of the Lords of the Congregation and established a provisional government. However, Mary of Guise was reinforced by professional French troops. Some of these troops established themselves at Kinghorn in Fife, and after they destroyed the house of William Kirkcaldy of Grange, according to Knox, Mary declared, &quot; Where is now John Knox&apos;s God? My God is now stronger than his, yea, even in Fife. &quot; { Knox, John, History of the Reformation, book 3, various editions. } In November the rebels were driven back to Stirling. { CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 266–7, Randolph to Sadler &amp; Croft, 11 November 1559. } Fighting continued in Fife. All seemed lost for the Protestant side until an English fleet arrived in the Firth of Forth in January 1560, which caused the French to retreat to Leith. Negotiations with England then began, from which Knox was excluded; in particular his earlier tract The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, although it had been aimed at Mary Tudor, rendered him unacceptable to the female English monarch. The resulting Treaty of Berwick in February was an agreement between Châtelherault and the English to act jointly to expel the French. As a result, an English land army joined their Scottish allies in besieging the French at Leith. [ Death ] After an English assault on Leith was repulsed with heavy losses, some of the leaders of the Lords of the Congregation came to Edinburgh Castle on 12 May 1560 and had dinner with Mary and the keeper of the castle, Lord Erskine. They discussed a plan made before the troubles, that Mary would have travelled to France and met Elizabeth in England, and her brother made Viceroy in Scotland, and the Lords again complained of Frenchmen appointed to Scottish government posts. Negotiations to end the siege of Leith and demolish new fortifications at Dunbar Castle were continued. The next day the talks ended as permission was refused for the French commanders in Leith to come to the castle to discuss the proposals with Mary. { Dickinson, Gladys, ed., Two Missions od de la Brosse, SHS (1942), pp.151-157. } While continuing to fortify Edinburgh Castle, { CSP Scotland, vol. i (1898), 389. } Mary became seriously ill, and over eight days her mind began to wander; some days she could not even speak. On 8 June she made her will { Dickinson, Gladys, } { Two Missions of de la Brosse, SHS (1942), 171–177. } and died of dropsy on 11 June 1560. Her body was taken to France and interred at the church in the Convent of Saint-Pierre in Reims, where Mary&apos;s sister Renée was abbess. Of Mary&apos;s five children, only her daughter Mary survived her. In modern times, such as in Philippa Gregory &apos;s novel The Virgin&apos;s Lover, it has been suggested that Queen Elizabeth I of England ordered Mary&apos;s assassination by poison ing her, or, as portrayed in the 1998 film &apos;&apos;Elizabeth&apos;&apos;, that she was assassinated to protect Elizabeth&apos;s interests (without any direct order by the Queen). However, no evidence supports such allegations, and there was an autopsy the day after she died. { Dickinson, Gladys, Two Missions of de la Brosse, SHS (1942), 176–179. } Mary&apos;s death was evidently of natural causes, as she herself complained she had become lame from the swelling of her legs in April and diagnosed dropsy. This swelling was confirmed by her enemy, John Knox, who wrote that in May, &quot; began hir bellie and lothsome leggis to swell. &quot; { Knox, John, History of the Reformation, vol. 2, 68. } Even in the paranoid political climate of the 16th century, in which many royal deaths were suspected to have been murders, no contemporaries saw signs of &quot; foul play &quot; in Mary&apos;s death. { CSP Scotland, vol. i (1898), 389 and CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. ii (1865), 604, 29 April 1560. } The Regent&apos;s death made way for the Treaty of Edinburgh, in which France and England agreed to a withdrawal of both their troops from Scotland. Although the French commissioners were unwilling to treat with the insurgent Lords of the Congregation, they offered the Scots certain concessions from King Francis and Queen Mary, including the right to summon a parliament according to use and custom. The effect of the treaty was to leave power in the hands of the pro-English Protestants. [ Portrayal in fiction ] Mary de Guise appears in volumes 1, 2, 3 and 5 of The Lymond Chronicles by Dorothy Dunnett. Most notably, the events around her visit to her daughter in France in 1550 are portrayed in the second volume, Queens&apos; Play. In the 1998 film &apos;&apos;Elizabeth&apos;&apos;, Mary was played by the French actress Fanny Ardant. [ Ancestry ] [ 100% ] [ 1. Mary of Guise 2. Claude, Duke of Guise 3. Antoinette de Bourbon 4.
