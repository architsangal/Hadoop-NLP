[ Incesticide compilation Nirvana Nirvana-Incesticide.jpg December 14, 1992 1988–1991 Grunge, Pop rock 44:44 DGC Miti Adhikari, Jack Endino, Steve Fisk, Dale Griffin, Butch Vig Nirvana compilations Incesticide(1992) Nirvana (2002) ] Incesticide is a compilation album by the American grunge band Nirvana. Incesticide consists of their 1990 single &quot; Sliver &quot;, demos, outtakes, covers, and radio broadcast recordings. At the time, all of the material on Incesticide was circulating within fan communities (albeit in lower quality). It was widely reported in the music press that the band wanted to offer fans a higher-quality alternative, but in the book Cobain Unseen, Charles R. Cross reveals that Kurt Cobain agreed to the release of this compilation because he was allowed complete control over the album&apos;s artwork. The album was released on December 14, 1992 in Europe, and December 15, 1992 in the United States and eventually reached number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200. [ Release ] Incesticide was released on December 14, 1992 in the United Kingdom, and on December 15, 1992 in the United States. { Azerrad, 1994. p. 357–358 } The record label, Geffen, decided against heavily promoting the album, possibly to avoid a &quot; Nirvana burnout &quot; as the band had released Nevermind and four singles in the preceding fifteen months. { Azerrad, 1994. p. 296 } Despite this lack of promotion and being a collection of old material, Incesticide debuted at number 51 in the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200 and sold 500,000 copies in two months { Cross, p. 269 }. The album is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. [ Artwork and packaging ] The cover art was painted by Cobain, { Azerrad, 1994. p. 295 } who is credited as Kurdt Kobain in the liner notes. { Incesticide liner notes } The rubber duck seen on the album&apos;s back cover also belonged to Cobain. The first several pressings of the album contained liner notes written by Cobain. Versions of the album containing the liner notes by Cobain could be found at record stores as late as 1998. Initial copies in the US and Canada also contained a &quot; Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics &quot; sticker.
