The judiciary of Germany is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in Germany. The German legal system is a civil law based on a comprehensive compendium of statute s, as compared to the common law systems. Germany uses an inquisitorial system where the judge s are actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, as compared to an adversarial system where the role of the judge is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecutor and the defendant. The independence of the judiciary of Germany is historically older than democracy in Germany, the organisation of courts is traditionally strong, and almost all state actions are subject to judicial review. Judges follow a distinct career path. At the end of their legal education at university, all law students must pass a state examination before they can continue on to an apprenticeship that provides them with broad training in the legal profession over two years. They then must pass a second state examination that qualifies them to practice law. At that point, the individual can choose either to be a lawyer or to enter the judiciary. Judicial candidates start working at courts immediately, however they are subjected to a probationary period of up to five years before being appointed as judges for lifetime. [ Law ] [ Law of Germany ] The modern German legal system is a system of law which is founded on the principles laid out by the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, though many of the most important laws were developed prior to the 1949 constitution. It is composed of public law ( [ de öffentliches Recht ] ), which regulates the relations between a citizen/person and the state or two bodies of the state (including criminal law ) and the private law ( [ de Privatrecht ] ) which regulates the relations between two people or companies and the criminal law. It has been subject to a wide array of influences from Roman law such as the Corpus Juris Civilis to Napoleonic law such as the Napoleonic Code. The procedural system of Germany is based on a highly active role of the judge or the judges. In all branches of jurisprudence the judge takes evidence himself, only assisted by the parties or their lawyers, although in some branches the court is limited to proof referred by the parties. [ Court organization ] The primary legislation concerning court organization is the Courts Constitution Act ( [ de Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ], or [ de GVG ] ). The courts are characterized by being specialist, regional, and hierarchically integrated at the federal level. [ Bell 2006 110 ] There are 5 basic types of courts, plus the Federal Constitutional Court : [ Bell 2006 110 ] [ de Bundesgerichtshof ] [ de Bundesverwaltungsgericht ] [ de Bundesfinanzhof ] [ de Bundesarbeitsgericht ] [ de Bundessozialgericht ] [ de Bundesverfassungsgericht ] Ordinary courts, dealing with criminal and most civil cases. The Federal Court of Justice ( ) is the highest ordinary court. Administrative law courts. The Federal Administrative Court ( ) is the highest administrative law court. Tax law courts. The Federal Finance Court ( ) is the highest tax law court. Labour law courts. The Federal Labour Court ( ) is the highest labour law court. Social law courts. The Federal Social Court ( ) is the highest social law court. Constitutional law courts, focusing on judicial review and constitutional interpretation. The Federal Constitutional Court ( ) is the highest court dealing with constitutional matters. The main difference between the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court is, that the Federal Constitutional Court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question (e.g. a possible violation of human rights in a criminal trial), while the Federal Court of Justice may be called in any case. Ordinary courts are the most numerous by far. [ Bell 2006 110 ] Currently there are 828 ordinary courts (687 local, 116 regional, 24 appellate, one federal), 142 labour courts (122 local, 19 appellate, one federal), 69 administrative courts (52 local, 16 higher, one federal), 20 tax courts (19 local, one federal), 86 social courts (69 local, 16 appellate, one federal) and 17 constitutional courts (16 State Constitutional Courts, one Federal Constitutional Court). [ Ordinary courts ] Trial courts are composed of: [ Casper Zeisel 1972 142 ] [ Jehle BMJ 2009 23 ] [ Delmas-Marty 2002 306-307 ] Trial Court Composition Penal jurisdiction Amtsgerichte Amtsgericht 1 judge Criminal offences in which the sentence is expected to be less than two years. Schöffengericht 1 judge, 2 lay judges Criminal cases in which the sentence is expected to be between two and four years. erweitertes Schöffengericht 2 judges, 2 lay judges Cases heard by the Schöffengericht but with special circumstances. Landgerichte große Strafkammer 3 judges, 2 lay judges Cases in which the sentence is expected to exceed four years or in which the prosecutor decided to be not tried by Amtsgerichte. Sonderstrafkammer, Staatsschutzkammer, or Wirtschaftsstrafkammer Specially constituted Strafkammer for économic crimes, and minor political crimes. Schwurgericht Specially constituted Strafkammer for felonies resulting in death and felonies with use of nuclear power. Oberlandesgerichte Strafsenat 3 or 5 judges Serious political crime s like treason. The appellate courts are composed of: [ Casper Zeisel 1972 142 ] Appellate Court Composition Jurisdiction Landgerichte kleine Strafkammer 1 judge, 2 lay judges Appeal for review of facts and law from the Amtsrichter. Oberlandesgerichte Strafsenat 3 judges Appeal for error of law from certain decisions of kleine Strafkammer, and from Amtsrichter if the defendant decides to appeal on points of law only. Bundesgerichte Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) 5 judges Appeal for error of law from trial decisions of the Landgerichte and Oberlandesgericht. For a comparison of the relative activity of the ordinary courts, in 1969 there were 468,273 criminal cases in Germany, and 388,619 or 83% of these were held in the Amtsgericht composed of a single judge. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 143 ] [ Specialized courts ] Specialized courts deal with five distinct subject areas: administrative, labour, social, fiscal, and patent law. Like the ordinary courts, they are organized hierarchically with the state court systems under a federal appeals court. Administrative law courts consist of local administrative courts, higher administrative courts, and the Federal Administrative Court. In these courts, individuals can seek compensation from the government for any harm caused by incorrect administrative actions by officials or even have administrative acts overturned. For instance, many lawsuits have been brought in administrative courts by citizens against the government concerning the location and safety standards of nuclear power plants. Labour law courts also function on three levels and address disputes over collective bargaining agreements and working conditions. Social law courts, organized at three levels, adjudicate cases relating to the system of social insurance, which includes unemployment compensation, workers&apos; compensation, and social security payments. Finance, or fiscal, law courts hear only tax-related cases and exist on two levels. Patent law courts hear intellectual property cases and consists of the single Federal Patents Court located in Munich. [ Constitutional courts ] [ State ] Each state has a state constitutional court. These courts are administratively independent and financially autonomous from any other government body. For instance, a state constitutional court can write its own budget and hire or fire employees, powers that represent a degree of independence unique in the government structure. [ Federal ] The Federal Constitutional Court ( [ de Bundesverfassungsgericht ], or [ de BVerfG ] ) is the supreme constitutional court established by the constitution or Basic Law of Germany. Since its inception with the beginning of the Federal Republic of Germany, the court has been located in the city of Karlsruhe intentionally distanced from the other federal institutions in Berlin (earlier in Bonn ), Munich, and Frankfurt. The sole task of the court is judicial review, and it may declare legislation unconstitutional, thus rendering them ineffective. In this respect, it is similar to other supreme courts with judicial review powers, like the Supreme Court of the United States; yet the Court possesses a number of additional powers, and is regarded as among the most interventionist and powerful national courts in the world. Unlike other supreme court s, the constitutional court is not an integral stage of the judicial or appeals process (aside from in cases concerning constitutional or public international law), and does not serve as a regular appellate court from lower courts or the Federal Supreme Courts on any violation of federal laws. The court&apos;s jurisdiction is focused on constitutional issues and the compliance of all governmental institution with the constitution. Constitutional amendments or changes passed by the Parliament are subject to its judicial review, since they have to be compatible with the most basic principles of the [ de Grundgesetz ] (per the &quot; eternity clause &quot; ). The court&apos;s practice of enormous constitutional control frequency on the one hand, and the continuity in judicial restraint and political revision on the other hand, have created a unique defender of the [ de Grundgesetz ] since World War II and given it a valuable role in Germany&apos;s modern democracy. [ Officers of the court ] [ Professional judges ] The federal Courts are administrated by the federal state, all the other courts belong to a state and are administrated by it. The independence of the judiciary that is laid down in the federal constitution (article 97 para. 1) only refers to the judicial decision-making process of any individual judge, not to the judicial power as a whole. In line with this, the courts are administrative bodies subordinate to the respective department of justice, special rules only applying to the judicial decision-making process and the status of the judges. All professional judges are compose a common corps in that they are recruited through a common process and their career is governed largely by federal law. [ Bell 2006 109-110 ] However, most judges are state ( [ de Länder ] ) civil servants and follow state rules on legal education, appointment, and promotion. [ Bell 2006 110-111 ] [ State ] As a rule, each decision on the initial employment, vesting with lifetime tenure or promotion of a judge is taken by the department of justice. Yet in some of the states there is some kind of a parliamentary body that needs to be heard or even has a say in some of the decisions on careers of individual judges (Richterwahlausschuss). The mostly decisive influence of the administration on the career of judges is exceptional in continental Europe, where mostly bodies of judges, elected by and within the judiciary take this kind of decision (e.g. France: conseil superieur de la magistrature, Italy: consiglio superiore della magistratura). By some it is regarded as a threat to judicial independence that with a view to their personal career judges might be inclined to specially regard possible political effects of their decisions or may choose to support a political party. [ Federal ] Federal judges are picked in an in-camera-procedure by a body composed of a Minister of the federal state, federal MPs and ministers of the states (article 95 para. 2 of the federal constitution). Candidates do not have to be professional judges, but lawyers. There are neither public hearings, nor would the identity of any candidate even be disclosed to the public. Judicial members of the federal constitutional court are elected in turns by the federal chambers (article 94 of the federal constitution). This decision requiring a large majority, it usually follows a political compromise. Public discussion about candidates is very unusual. [ Lay judges ] [ Lay judge#Germany ] Lay judge s ( [ de Geschworenen ] or [ de Schöffe n ] ) are effectively short-term, politically-appointed, non-professional judges. Except for most crimes for which the trier of fact is a single professional judge, and serious political crime s which are tried before a panel of professional judges, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges sit alongside professional judges. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 141 ] Section 263 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure requires a two-thirds majority for most decisions unfavorable to the defendant; denial of probation by simple majority is an important exception. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 141 ] In most cases lay judges do not directly examine documents before the court or have access to the case file. [ Malsch 2009 137 ] The only statutory criteria is that lay judges must be citizens that have not been convicted of, or be under investigation for, a serious crime. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] However, people &quot; ought not &quot; to be chosen if they are under 30 years old, very high government officials, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, policemen, ministers, priests, or have lived in the community less than 1 year. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] In addition, people may refuse to serve if they are over 65 years old, members of the federal or state legislatures, doctors, nurses, druggists if working alone, housewives if overburdened, or have served as a lay judge in the preceding year. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] Applications can be made to become a lay judge by interested citizens, but this does not occur often, and welfare institutions, sports clubs, financial and health insurance institutions, trade unions, industrial companies and other public authorities are primarily called upon to nominate candidates, and it appears that motivation includes social responsibility, image cultivation, advertising, and participation in fine penalty allocation. [ Malsch 2009 137 ] Lay judges are selected by a selection committee from lists that are passed by the municipal councils ( [ de Gemeinderat ] ) with a two-thirds majority of attending local councilors. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] [ Bell 2006 153 ] Given the high threshold for inclusion on the municipal council lists, in practice these lists are first compiled by municipal bureaucracies and the political parties in Germany, [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] [ Bell 2006 153 ] but some municipal councils rely on the list of residents and generate names randomly. [ Bell 2006 153 ] The selection committee consists of a judge from the Amtsgericht, a representative of the state government, and ten &quot; trusted citizens &quot; ( [ de Vertrauenspersonen ] ) who are also elected by two-thirds of the municipal legislature, and selects from the list of candidates the number needed to staff the various tribunals. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] [ Bell 2006 153 ] Lay judges have historically been predominately middle-aged men from middle class socio-economic backgrounds. [ Bell 2006 153 ] [ Vogler 2005 245 ] A study conducted in 1969 found that, of the lay judges in its sample, approximately 25% were civil service employees, compared to only about 12% being blue-collar worker s. [ Casper Zeisel 1972 183 ] A study published in 2009 put this number at 27% civil service employees versus 8% of the general population, and noted the relatively high numbers of housewive s, the relatively low number of private sector employees, and relative old age of lay judges. [ Malsch 2009 137 ] Selection of lay judges has been described as a &quot; highly political and discriminatory process. &quot; [ Casper Zeisel 1972 182 ] Personal acquaintance, political affiliation and occupation have all historically played an important, if publicly unacknowledged, role in the selection procedure. [ Bell 2006 153 ] [ Vogler 2005 245 ] [ Prosecutors ] Public prosecutors, although equally paid as judges, do not enjoy judicial independence and legally are ordinary civil servants. [ Defense counselors ] A lawyer can only act as defense counsel if they fulfill the aptitude criteria for judges. [ Delmas-Marty 2002 299 ] Defense counsel are grouped in divisions of the bar association, [ Delmas-Marty 2002 299 ] wherein membership is mandatory.
