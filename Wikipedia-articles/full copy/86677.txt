Bachman was also a member of the band Brave Belt with Chad Allan, Union and a band called Ironhorse, and has recorded numerous solo albums. He is also a national radio personality on CBC Radio One, hosting a weekly music show called Vinyl Tap. [ Early years ] Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Karl (Charlie) Bachman and Anne (Nancy) Dobrinsky, Bachman is half-German, half-Ukrainian in ancestry. [ http://www.cbc.ca/whodoyouthinkyouare/stories/ext_randy.php Who Do You Think You Are? CBC 14 April 2010 ] At age three he won a singing contest on CKY &apos;s King of the Saddle program and age 5 he had started studying the violin in the Royal Toronto Conservatory system.

At age 15, Bachman saw Elvis Presley play on Tommy Dorsey &apos;s television show and the sight of the guitar around Presley&apos;s neck inspired him. He learned three chords from his cousin, then started practising on a modified Hawaiian dobro. At age 16, Bachman met up with Lenny Breau; over the next two years Breau taught Bachman finger picking and also introduced him to the music of Chet Atkins. In 1959 Bachman bought a ticket to see Les Paul in concert at a Winnipeg supper club but was unable to get in as he was too young. He instead helped Paul set up before the show and also helped him reload everything into the car after the show. Still a budding guitarist at this point, Bachman asked Paul if he could teach him a guitar lick; Paul ended up teaching his version of &quot; How High the Moon &quot;.

By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to The Guess Who. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of Johnny Kidd&apos;s &quot; Shakin&apos; All Over &quot;, which also charted in the U.S. at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and Burton Cummings became the primary vocalist. Starting in 1968, the group released three successful albums: Wheatfield Soul (1968), Canned Wheat (1969), and American Woman (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group&apos;s songs during this period. In early 1970, the single &quot; American Woman &quot; hit #1 on the U.S. charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the &quot; ghetto scenes &quot; and &quot; war machines &quot; of the U.S., reflecting the Guess Who&apos;s experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the Vietnam War at its peak, many American males went to Canada to escape US Military service. Surprisingly, Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of American Woman. He has been quoted for leaving due to the other band members&apos; lifestyle choices conflicting with his (at that time) Mormon beliefs and because he wanted to spend more time with his brothers and other family members. [ http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html Bachman bio at Cbc.ca 2004-01-20 2012-02-28 ] He also was suffering health problems from the constant touring and needed to be under a doctor&apos;s care, something that was impossible to do on the road. [ Brave Belt and Bachman–Turner Overdrive ] Before his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded a solo album for RCA Records, Axe, over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the group Brave Belt with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first LP, Brave Belt I, in 1971. It had much more of a country-rock sound than a rock &apos;n&apos; roll sound, a departure from both Axe and the albums by The Guess Who. Robbie Bachman, one of Bachman&apos;s brothers, was the drummer for Brave Belt, despite being barely 18 years old. Fred Turner subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in a much heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan, though Allan still contributed two songs to Brave Belt II in 1972. Left with a three member lineup, Tim Bachman was added to Brave Belt as the second guitarist. The group then signed with Mercury Records in 1973 and changed their name to Bachman–Turner Overdrive, often referred to as &quot; BTO &quot;. They released their first self-titled album, Bachman–Turner Overdrive in May 1973. In December 1973 BTO released their second LP, Bachman–Turner Overdrive II. This album brought the band much more success than their debut, largely due to the hits &quot; Takin&apos; Care of Business &quot;, which charted at #12 in the U.S., and &quot; Let It Ride &quot;, which rose to #23. In 1974, they released the LP Not Fragile, which hit #1 on the album charts. It also contained the #1 single &quot; You Ain&apos;t Seen Nothin&apos; Yet &quot; (written by Bachman) and the hit &quot; Roll On Down The Highway &quot;, which charted at number 14. BTO stayed on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, Four Wheel Drive and Head On and charted more hits with &quot; Hey You &quot;, &quot; Take It Like a Man &quot;, and the jazz-oriented &quot; Lookin&apos; Out For #1 &quot;. In late 1976, with the recording of the Freeways album, some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two. Some of the other band members felt that they didn&apos;t have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the record. The album did manage to chart at #70 in the U.S., but had no hit singles. Bachman left the band in mid-March 1977. [ Post Bachman–Turner Overdrive ] After his departure from BTO, Bachman recorded a solo album called Survivor. It did not chart in the U.S. He formed a band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called Ironhorse, which released its debut album in 1979. It contained the single &quot; Sweet Lui-Louise &quot;, which charted at #36 in the U.S. and #26 in Canada, and did well in Europe, particularly Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. With Ludwig, Ironhorse released a second album, Everything Is Grey, in 1980. In comparison to the rock sound of the first album, the follow-up album had a more pop sound. In 1981, Fred Turner rejoined Bachman and the band released an album under the name Union. (The Turner-led BTO had broken up in early 1980.) Union released one album, titled On Strike. [ 1980s and 1990s reunions ] Bachman joined The Guess Who reunion in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the American Woman era. They did a tour of Canada and released a live video performance of it. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined a new BTO reunion, consisting also of Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who on drums. Robbie Bachman and classic lineup guitarist Blair Thornton chose not to join the reunion. Bachman stayed with this version of the band until 1987, and they put out an album in 1984. The classic Not Fragile lineup reformed in 1988 and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the group. It was the last time he played with BTO. The Guess Who reunited, including Bachman, on August 8, 1999. [ 2000s ] Bachman played on several tours with The Guess Who until July 31, 2003. Both he and Burton Cummings left the band and formed Bachman Cummings. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on The Simpsons as himself with his former Bachman–Turner Overdrive bandmates, C.F. Turner and Robin Bachman. Simpsons creator Matt Groening (whose father is originally from Winnipeg) is a well-known BTO fan. Homer Simpson yells at Bachman to &quot; get to the working overtime part &quot; while playing &quot; Takin&apos; Care of Business &quot;. In 2001 Bachman received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, along with the other members of The Guess Who. In 2005 Bachman was awarded the Order of Manitoba, the highest award in the Province of Manitoba. Bachman, along with The Guess Who, was also the recipient of The Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, Canada&apos;s foremost distinction for excellence in the performing arts, in 2002. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. [ http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang%3De%26amp%3BDocID%3D5447 Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada ] Bachman travels the world with his wife Denise McCann to write with many European songwriters, including Douglas Carr (producer of the Swedish band Ace of Base) and Michael Saxell in Sweden. Bachman has also performed with Swedish rockers The Soundtrack of Our Lives and appears on a vinyl picturedisc with them from a live performance at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2004. In the summer of 2005, Bachman started hosting the coast-to-coast show Vinyl Tap on CBC Radio One, where he plays audio recordings and reminisces about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock. This show runs from 7–9 pm every Saturday night, and can be accessed via the CBC Radio One web site and Sirius channel 159. There is a replay of the Saturday show on the following Friday night at 11 pm. It also repeats on CBC Radio 2 on Sundays at 6 pm. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global Live 8 megaconcert organized by Bob Geldof. Bachman helped Kalan Porter on his CD 219 Days. He suggested that Kalan do a drone on his violin on one of his songs, &quot; In Spite Of It All &quot;. He was also featured in his song &quot; And We Drive &quot;, playing a guitar solo near the end of the song. Bachman tours with his own band, the Randy Bachman Band and the Bachman-Cummings Band. He has also created a popular theatre show called &quot; Every Song Tells A Story &quot;, featuring Bachman live and unplugged with his band, telling the stories behind the writing of his famous hits from the 1960s and &apos;70s. Bachman and Burton Cummings toured throughout Canada as Bachman &amp; Cummings in the summer of 2006 with Toronto, Ontario&apos;s The Carpet Frogs. Bachman has also released an album of original melodic jazz songs called &quot; Jazz Thing &quot;, which is available on his official website. Bachman and Fred Turner completed a new Bachman &amp; Turner CD that was released in September, 2010. A radio pre-release single, &quot; Rollin&apos; Along, &quot; was posted in June, 2010 for sale on iTunes. The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010–11) under the name Bachman &amp; Turner, which started at the Sweden Rock Festival in June, 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK in July, 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Violin is mostly slow, melodic stuff. So my guitar solos tend to be smooth, slow lines. &quot; [ http://mixonline.com/news/audio_secrets_randy_bachmans/ Secrets of Randy Bachman&apos;s Guitar Sound mixonline.com 2010-11-11 ] Guitar influences he has mentioned in interviews include Lenny Breau, Leslie West, Wes Montgomery [ Bachman Randy Randy Bachman Bachman-Turner Overdrive: King Biscuit 1998 ] and Hank Marvin.

He converted to Mormonism at the time because Stevenson said that she could not marry anyone who was not Mormon. With Stevenson, Bachman had several children, including Tal Bachman, a recording artist best known for his 1999 top-20 hit song &quot; She&apos;s So High &quot;. During his early Guess Who years, his religious beliefs conflicted with the sex, drugs &amp; rock n roll lifestyle of the other band members and caused some bitterness between Bachman and bandmate Burton Cummings. Bachman later renounced his Mormon beliefs, saying, &quot; We found some things that couldn’t be reconciled, &quot; and declaring, &quot; Religion is a bunch of rules, a fear factor. &quot; [ http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jun/14/bachman-cummings-band-stars-have-come-full-circle/ Bachman-Cummings Band: Stars have come full circle Leber, Holly 14 June 2008 Chattanooga Times Free Press 14 April 2010 ] Bachman now lives on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, near Vancouver Island, and is married to singer/songwriter Denise McCann.
