[ Not to be confused with Javanese script ] Jawi (Jawi: [ جاوي ] Jāwī; Pattani : Yawi; Acehnese : Jawoë) is an Arabic alphabet for writing the Malay language, Acehnese, Banjarese, Minangkabau, Tausug and several other languages in Southeast Asia. Jawi is one of the two official scripts in Brunei, and is used as an alternate script in Malaysia. Usage wise, it was the standard script for the Malay language but has since been replaced by a Latin alphabet called Rumi, and Jawi has since been relegated to a script used for religious and cultural purposes. Day-to-day usage of Jawi is maintained in more conservative Malay-populated areas such as Pattani in Thailand and Kelantan in Malaysia.

Its development is linked with the arrival of Islam, mainly from Persian s. It was adapted to suit spoken classical Malay – it is written from right to left and has 6 sounds not found in Arabic: ca pa ga nga va and nya. Many Arabic characters are never used as they are not pronounced in Malay language, and some letters are never joined and some joined obligatorily so. { John U. Wolff, Indonesian Readings Edition: 3, SEAP Publications: 1988: ISBN 0-87727-517-3:480 pages } { Robert Leon Cooper Language spread: studies in diffusion and social change, Center for Applied Linguistics, Indiana University Press,: 1982 p. 40 ISBN 0-253-32000-3: 360 pages } The Jawi script originated from Arabic literature introduced from Persian contact with the Kingdom of Jambi, also called the Kingdom of Malayu, north of Palembang, Sumatera, Indonesia, where classical Malay- the root language from which modern Indonesian and Malay are both derived. { John U.

The etymology of Jawi imply originated in Java, as some scholars argue. { Hans H. Wellisch The conversion of scripts, its nature, history, and utilization: Wiley: 1978 ISBN 0-471-01620-9: 509 pages &quot; pp95-96 } However, as it is present, but not common in Java, it could be the case that the word Jawi was used as a catch-all term to describe those under Javanese rule or from the vague direction of Java. { Ann Kumar, John H. McGlynn, Mastini Hardjoprakoso, Perpustakaan Nasional (Indonesia), Illuminations: the writing traditions of Indonesia : featuring manuscripts from the National Library of Indonesia: Weatherhill: 1996 ISBN 0-8348-0349-6: 297 pages } It could also bereferring to the ancient empire of Javaka, hence the term Jawi, the predecessor to the empires of Majapahit and Srivijaya { Notes on the ancient history of Southeast Asia, Kuwata Rokuro, Memoirs of the Faculty of Literature, Osaka University, ISSN 04721373 } with whom the Arabs traders and missionaries made early contact. The earliest archeological remains have been found on the Terengganu Inscription Stone (Batu Bersurat Terengganu), dated 1303 A.D. (702H by the Islamic calendar ), whereas the earliest use of the Latin script is found near the end of the 19th century. The earliest document so far discovered is the circa 1300–1399 CE romantic poem Syair Bidasari discovered in Sumatra. { Hoevell, WR van, Sjair Bidasari: Een Oorspokelijk Malesich Gedicht, Verhandilengen van het Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetnschappen, 1843 } The region of Terengganu was known to be under the influence of Srivijaya as late as the 13th century, while the Terengganu Sultanate only dates as far back as the 18th century. This adds extra weight to the argument of Jawi originating in Jambi { Bagian Kesenian Bara Ai Ksusasteraan IndonesiaL Catatan-Catatan Tentang Amir Hamza:Bagain Kesenian Kemeterian Pendidak dan Kubudayaan, Yogyakarta: 1955 } by the former Sriwijaya vassal kingdoms of Pasai. [ The spread and extent of Jawi script ] The script became prominent with the spread of Islam, as the Malays found that the earlier Pallava script was totally unsuited as a vehicle to relay religious concepts. The Malays held the script in high esteem as it is the gateway to understanding Islam and its Holy Book, the Quran. The use of jawi script was a key factor driving the emergence of Malay as the lingua franca of the region, alongside the spread of Islam. { An overview of Jawi&apos;s origin in Brunei, Brunei Times article dated July 16, 2007 } It was widely used in the Sultanate of Malacca, Sultanate of Johor, Sultanate of Brunei, Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Pattani, the Sultanate of Aceh to the Sultanate of Ternate in the east as early as the 15th century. The jawi script was used in royal correspondences, decrees, poems and was widely understood by the merchants in the port of Malacca as the main means of communication. Early legal digests such as the Malacca Code and its derivatives including the Codes of Johor, Kedah and Brunei were written in this script. It is the medium of expression of kings, nobility and the religious scholars. It is the traditional symbol of Malay culture and civilization. Jawi was used not only amongst the ruling class, but also the common people. The Islamisation of the region popularised jawi into a dominant script. { The Legacy of Malay Letter, Annabel Teh Gallop, The British Library and Arkib Negara Malaysia, ISBN 0-7125-0376-6 } [ Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] Royal correspondences for example are written, embellished and ceremoniously delivered. Examples of royal correspondences still in the good condition is the letter between Sultan Abu Hayat of Ternate and King John III of Portugal (1521); the letter from Sultan Iskandar Muda of Aceh to King James I of England (1615); the letter from Sultan Abdul Jalil IV of Johor to King Louis XV of France (1719). Many literary works such as epics, poetry and prose use the Jawi script. It is the pinnacle of the classic Malay civilization. Historical epics such as the Malay Annals, as listed by UNESCO under Memories of the World, are among the countless epics written by the Malay people. The Sufi c poems by Hamzah Fansuri and many others contributed to the richness and depth of the Malay civilization. To the Malays, there has never been any difference between using jawi or rumi. Both are scripts that have been appropriated to represent the Malay language in writing. During the colonial period, jawi still predominated throughout the Malay Archipelago, particularly in the literary and artistic domains, Islamic theology, philosophy and mysticism, commerce and trade, as well as in feudal governance and laws. Over time, with the preponderance of rumi, jawi has become primarily reserved for Malay religious discourse. { AKSARA-The Passage of Malay Scripts. Exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg. Retrieved on 2010-10-26. } Jawi script was the official script for Unfederated Malay States during British protectorate. [ Jawi today ] “We should not discard or abandon the jawi script even though Malays are generally using the romanised script. This is because the jawi script belongs to us and is part of our heritage.” &lt; p style= &quot; text-align: right; &quot; &gt; — Pendeta Za’ba in the foreword of the book Panduan Membaca dan Menulis Jawi (1957) { AKSARA-The Passage of Malay Scripts. Exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg. Retrieved on 2010-10-26. } Indonesia, looking back to its Javanese Majapahit { Rediscovering the royal capital of Majapahit, Gomperts, Amrit., The Newsletter No.53, Spring 2010 } roots, is less than enthusiastic with regards to the script. Mainly owed to the fact that Indonesia is predominantly Javanese. Nonetheless, the Jawi script does enjoy a regional status in Malay dominated areas in Indonesia such as Riau, Riau archipelago and Aceh. { [TULISAN ARAB MELAYU BAGIAN DARI KHAZANAH BUDAYA RIAU http://www.riaudailyphoto.com/2012/02/tulisan-arab-melayu-bagian-dari.html] } { Bagian Kesenian Bara Ai Kesusasteraan Indonesia Catatan-Catatan Tentang Amir Hamza:Bagian Kesenian Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Yogyakarta: 1955 } It is still widely used in traditional religious school across Java, however, in the form of Pegon script, a variant of it. Today, the script is used for religious and Malay cultural administration in Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perlis and Johor, as well as its influence in Sulu and Marawi in the Philippines. Various efforts were in place to revive the Jawi script in Malaysia and Brunei due to its important role in the Malay and Islamic spheres. Jawi scripts are also seen at the rear of Malaysian ringgit and Brunei dollar banknotes.The Malays in Pattani still use Jawi today for the same reasons.
