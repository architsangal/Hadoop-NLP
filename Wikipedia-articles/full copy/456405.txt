Noel Edmonds quit the show immediately after, although returned to Saturday night TV with his &apos;Saturday Roadshow&apos;, two years later. [ Telly Addicts ] [ Telly Addicts ] Telly Addicts is the name of a BBC1 game show hosted by Noel Edmonds, broadcast from 3 September 1985 until 29 July 1998. All questions were based on television programmes past and present, and generally took the form of a short clip being shown followed by a series of questions either specifically about the clip or more generally about the programme from which it had been taken. Two teams sat opposite each other on sofas. In 1991, he presented a prime time series called &quot; Noel&apos;s Addicts &quot;, but the format had no similarity to the Telly Addicts show and ran for only one series. [ Noel&apos;s Saturday Roadshow ] [ Noel&apos;s Saturday Roadshow ] Noel&apos;s Saturday Roadshow was a BBC television light entertainment show broadcast live on Saturday evenings from 3 September 1988 to 15 December 1990. It was presented by Noel Edmonds, his first major TV project since the demise of The Late, Late Breakfast Show two years earlier. The programme contained several elements which had been found in its predecessor, such as phone-in quizzes, celebrity interviews and bands performing in the studio.The premise for the new show was that unlike the Late Late Breakfast Show, which had been broadcast from the BBC&apos;s studios each week, the Roadshow would come from a new, different and exotic location each week. These &apos;locations&apos; were in fact elaborate studio sets dressed to resemble each week&apos;s location, such as the North Pole, a space station, Hollywood, Niagara Falls. The irony of this was not lost on Edmonds, whose self-deprecating presentation style frequently made light of the low budget production values.The programme was a slow-burning success, and following the third series in 1990, Edmonds&apos; popularity and reputation were sufficiently re-established with the public for Edmonds to pitch Noel&apos;s House Party to the BBC.The show also introduced regular features such as the Gunge Tank, the Gotcha Oscars and Wait &apos;Till I Get You Home, which would all be carried across and subsequently developed in House Party. Another item was &quot; Clown court &quot;, where a guest actor from a TV series would be on trial for all the bloopers made during the shooting of that show, for example Sylvester McCoy for the title role of Doctor Who, and Tony Robinson for his character of Baldrick in Blackadder the Third. [ Noel&apos;s House Party ] [ Noel&apos;s House Party ] Edmonds returned to television with The Noel Edmonds Saturday Roadshow in 1988, after presenting a show called Whatever Next? earlier in the same year. By 1991, the Saturday Roadshow morphed into Noel&apos;s House Party. This latter series ran for eight years from Edmonds&apos; supposed mansion in the fictional town of Crinkley Bottom. Regular features included NTV, where cameras were secretly hidden in viewer&apos;s homes, often in VHS tape cases. There was also the &quot; Gotchas &quot;, where celebrities were caught in elaborate and embarrassing setups. In one infamous incident NTV&apos;s hidden cameras caught celebrity psychic Uri Geller apparently bending a spoon with his hands while demonstrating his &quot; powers &quot; to a member of the public. When then-Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was &quot; Gotcha&apos;d &quot;, he infamously yelled: &quot; You are a dead man! &quot;. He later participated in Noel himself being &quot; Gotcha&apos;d &quot;. Mr. Blobby, a yellow and pink spotted character, initially appeared in the &quot; Gotcha &quot; section, and became a regular feature of the programme. The character even achieved the 1993 Christmas No. 1. [ Everything2 UK Number One singles of 1993 http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id%3D1341888 2006-09-10 ] Noel&apos;s House Party was a staple of BBC1 &apos;s autumn and spring schedules for more than eight years. Several reformats failed to reverse its declining popularity, and in the final programme, broadcast on 20 March 1999, Edmonds appealed that viewers&apos; memories should be kind to the programme.
