In physics, motion is a change in position of an object with respect to time. Motion is typically described in terms of velocity, acceleration, displacement, and time. { Nave, R. 2005. Motion. Hyper Physics. Georgia State University } Motion is observed by attaching a frame of reference to a body and measuring its change in position relative to another reference frame. A body which does not move is said to be at rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or to have constant ( time-invariant ) position. An object&apos;s motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force, as described by Newton&apos;s first law. An object&apos;s momentum is directly related to the object&apos;s mass and velocity, and the total momentum of all objects in a closed system (one not affected by external forces) does not change with time, as described by the law of conservation of momentum. As there is no absolute frame of reference, absolute motion cannot be determined. { Wåhlin, L. 1997. &quot; THE DEADBEAT UNIVERSE &quot;, Chapter 9. Colutron Research Corporation ISBN 0-933407-03-3 } Thus, everything in the universe can be considered to be moving. { De Grasse Tyson, N., Liu, C., &amp; Irion, R. 2000. One Universe: At home in the cosmos. p.20–21. Joseph Henry Press. ISBN 0-309-06488-0 } More generally, the term motion signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system. For example, one can talk about motion of a wave or a quantum particle (or any other field ) where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions. { Yongsan Station. } [ Laws of Motion ] [ Mechanics ] In physics, motion in the universe is described through two sets of apparently contradictory laws of mechanics. Motions of all large scale and familiar objects in the universe (such as projectile s, planet s, cell s, and human s ) are described by classical mechanics. Whereas the motion of very small atom ic and sub-atomic objects is described by quantum mechanic s. [ Classical mechanics ] [ Classical mechanics ] Classical mechanics is used for describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, star s, and galaxies. It produces very accurate results within these domains, and is one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering, and technology. Classical mechanics is fundamentally based on Newton&apos;s Laws of Motion. These laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body. They were first compiled by Sir Isaac Newton in his work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first published on July 5, 1687. His three laws are: In the absence of a net external force, a body either is at rest or moves with constant velocity. The net external force on a body is equal to the mass of that body times its acceleration; F  =  ma. Alternatively, the acceleration is directly proportional to the force causing it, and inversely proportional to the mass. Whenever one body exerts a force F onto a second body, the second body exerts the force −F on the first body. F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense. Newton&apos;s &quot; Axioms or Laws of Motion &quot; can be found in the &quot; Principia &quot; on page 19 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation. Newton&apos;s three laws of motion, along with his law of universal gravitation, explain Kepler&apos;s laws of planetary motion, which were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model or understanding orbit ing bodies in outer space. This explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth. Classical mechanics was later further enhanced by Albert Einstein&apos;s special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity explains the motion of objects with a high velocity, approaching the speed of light; general relativity is employed to handle gravitation motion at a deeper level. [ Quantum mechanics ] [ Quantum mechanics ] Quantum mechanics is a set of principles describing physical reality at the atomic level of matter ( molecules and atoms ) and the subatomic ( electrons, protons, and even smaller particles ). These descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both matter and radiation energy, this described in the wave–particle duality. In contrast to classical mechanics, where accurate measurement s and prediction s can be calculated about location and velocity, in the quantum mechanics of a subatomic particle, one can never specify its state, such as its simultaneous location and velocity, with complete certainty (this is called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ). In addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena, quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large scale phenomenon such as superfluidity, superconductivity, and biological systems, including the function of smell receptors and the structures of proteins. [ Kinematics ] [ Kinematics ] Kinematics applies geometry to the analysis of movement, or motion, of a mechanical system. [ Theoretical Kinematics reface http://books.google.com/books?id%3Df8I4yGVi9ocC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3Dkinematics%26amp%3Blr%3D%26amp%3Bas_brr%3D0%26amp%3Bsig%3DYfoHn9ImufIzAEp5Kl7rEmtYBKc#PPR7%2CM1 O. Bottema &amp; B. Roth 0-486-66346-9 Dover Publications 1990 true ] The rotation and sliding movement central a mechanical system is modeled mathematically as Euclidean, or rigid, transformations. The set of rigid transformations in three dimensional space forms a Lie group, denoted as SE(3). [ Planar motion ] While all motion in a mechanical system occurs in three dimensional space, planar motion can be analyzed using plane geometry, if all point trajectories are parallel to a plane. In this case the system is called a planar mechanism (or robot). The kinematic analysis of planar mechanisms uses the subset of SE(3) consisting of planar rotations and translations, denoted SE(2). The group SE(2) is three dimensional, which means that every position of a body in the plane is defined by three parameters. The parameters are often the x and y coordinates of the origin of a coordinate frame in M measured from the origin of a coordinate frame in F, and the angle measured from the x-axis in F to the x-axis in M. This is described saying a body in the plane has three degrees-of-freedom. SE(2) is the configuration space for a planar body, and a planar motion is a curve in this space. [ Spherical motion ] It is possible to construct a mechanical system such that the point trajectories in all components lie in concentric spherical shells around a fixed point. An example is the gimbal ed gyroscope. These devices are called spherical mechanisms. { J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, &apos;&apos;Geometric Design of Linkages,&apos;&apos; Springer, New York. } Spherical mechanisms are constructed by connecting links with hinged joints such that the axes of each hinge passes through the same point. This point becomes center of the concentric spherical shells. The movement of these mechanisms is characterized by the group SO(3) of rotations in three dimensional space. Other examples of spherical mechanisms are the automotive differential and the robotic wrist. Select this link for an animation of a Spherical deployable mechanism. The rotation group SO(3) is three dimensional. An example of the three parameters that specify a spatial rotation are the roll, pitch and yaw angles used to define the orientation of an aircraft. SO(3) is the configuration space for a rotating body, and a spherical motion is a curve in this space. [ Spatial motion ] A mechanical system in which a body moves through a general spatial movement is called a spatial mechanism. An example is the RSSR linkage, which can be viewed as a four-bar linkage in which the hinged joints of the coupler link are replaced by rod ends, also called spherical joints or ball joint s. The rod ends allow the input and output cranks of the RSSR linkage to be misaligned to the point that they lie in different planes, which causes the coupler link to move in a general spatial movement. Robot arms, Stewart platform s, and humanoid robotic systems are also examples of spatial mechanisms. Select this link for an animation of Bennett&apos;s linkage, which is a spatial mechanism constructed from four hinged joints. The group SE(3) is six dimensional, which means the position of a body in space is defined by six parameters. Three of the parameters define the origin of the moving reference frame relative to the fixed frame. Three other parameters define the orientation of the moving frame relative to the fixed frame. SE(3) is the configuration space for a body moving in space, and a spatial motion is a curve in this space. [ List of &quot; imperceptible &quot; human motions ] Humans, like all things in the universe are in constant motion, { De Grasse Tyson, N., Liu, C., &amp; Irion, R. 2000. One Universe: At home in the cosmos. p.8–9. Joseph Henry Press. ISBN 0-309-06488-0 } however, aside from obvious movements of the various external body parts and locomotion, humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to perceive. Many of these &quot; imperceptible motions &quot; are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation. The larger scales of &quot; imperceptible motions &quot; are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons: 1) Newton&apos;s laws of motion (particularly Inertia ) which prevent humans from feeling motions of a mass to which they are connected, and 2) the lack of an obvious frame of reference which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving. { Safkan, Y. 2007 &quot; f the term &apos;absolute motion&apos; has no meaning, then why do we say that the earth moves around the sun and not vice versa? &quot; Ask the Experts. PhysicsLink } The smaller scales of these motions are too small for human s to sense. [ Universe ] Spacetime (the fabric of the universe) is actually expanding. Essentially, everything in the universe is stretching like a rubber band. This motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such, but rather a change in the very nature of the universe. The primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by Edwin Hubble who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from us ( &quot; Hubble&apos;s law &quot; ) as predicted by a universal expansion.

It is powered by the force left over from the Big Bang. Many astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 600  km/s relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies. Another reference frame is provided by the Cosmic microwave background. This frame of reference indicates that The Milky Way is moving at around 552  km/s.

Away from the central bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240  km/s (about half-million mi/h). [ Earth ] [ Williams David R.

However, the velocities of plates range widely. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75  mm/yr (3.0  in/yr) and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69  mm/yr (2.1 –2.7 in/yr).

The human lymphatic system is constantly moving excess fluids, lipids, and immune system related products around the body. The lymph fluid has been found to move through a lymph capillary of the skin at approximately 0.0000097  m/s. [ Cells ] The cells of the human body have many structures which move throughout them. [ Hill, David; Holzwarth, George; Bonin, Keith Velocity and Drag Forces on motor-protein-driven Vesicles in Cells abstract American Physical Society, the 69th Annual Meeting of the Southeastern 2002 #EA.002 2002APS..SES.EA002H ] Cytoplasmic streaming is a way which cells move molecular substances throughout the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic Streaming: Encyclopædia Britannica Various motor proteins work as molecular motors within a cell and move along the surface of various cellular substrates such as microtubules s. Motor proteins are typically powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Microtubules Motors: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Vesicle s propelled by motor proteins have been found to have a velocity of approximately 0.00000152  m/s. [ Particles ] According to the laws of thermodynamics all particles of matter are in constant random motion as long as the temperature is above absolute zero. Thus the molecule s and atom s which make up the human body are vibrating, colliding, and moving. This motion can be detected as temperature; higher temperatures, which represent greater kinetic energy in the particles, feel warm to humans whom sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched to their nerves. Similarly, when lower temperature objects are touched, the senses perceive the transfer of heat away from the body as feeling cold. Temperature and BEC. Physics 2000: Colorado State University Physics Department [ Subatomic particles ] Within each atom, electron s exist in an area around the nucleus. This area is called the electron cloud. According to Bohr&apos;s model of the atom, electrons have a high velocity, and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move. If electrons &apos;move&apos; about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun, then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light. However, there is no reason that one must confine one&apos;s self to this strict conceptualization, that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do. Rather one can conceptualize electrons to be &apos;particles&apos; that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud. Ask a scientist archive.

The speed of light (or c) is the speed of all massless particle s and associated field s in a vacuum, and it is believed to be the upper limit on the speed at which energy, matter, and information can travel.
