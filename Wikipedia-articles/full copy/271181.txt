She was a participant in the 2004 season of the reality show The Surreal Life. { The Surreal Life TV.com } [ Early life ] The eldest of eight children, Tammy Faye was born Tamara Faye LaValley in International Falls, Minnesota, to Pentecostal preachers Carl and Rachel Fairchild LaValley. Her parents were married in 1941, one year before Tammy Faye was born. Shortly after she was born, a painful divorce soured her mother against other ministers, { Obituary: (UK) newspaper, the } { Daily Telegraph Issue number 47,317 Monday July 23, 2007 p23 } alienating her from the church. After the divorce, Tammy Faye continued living in a strict atmosphere with her mother and brother. In 1948, when she was six, her mother married Fred Grover, who worked in paper mills. His salary increased their income, but the marriage also added six children to the household. [ April 2010 ] As a girl child in the 1950s, she helped her mother with household chores and babysat her younger siblings; [ April 2010 ] but she was often spoiled by her favorite aunt, Virginia Fairchild, who was a retired department store manager. [ April 2010 ] She attended her aunt&apos;s church in 1952. When she was accompanied by a friend to the Assemblies of God church, at age 10, she said she &quot; felt the glow of God&apos;s love and wanted to call herself upon the Lord. &quot; [ April 2010 ] Her entire family gathered around her for celebrations, particularly Christmas, which was her favorite holiday. In 1956, she started spending summers at Bible camp and was voted &quot; Queen &quot;. Also in 1956, she attended Falls High School, where she sang in the choir, and got an after-school job at Woolworth&apos;s. She didn&apos;t attend school dances, baseball games, or even movie s, as her church did not allow it. [ April 2010 ] Before she graduated in 1960, her mother suggested that Tammy Faye would become a minister. [ April 2010 ] [ Marriage to Jim Bakker ] In 1960, she met Jim Bakker when they were students at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. { Ex-wife of evangelist Jim Bakker dies By William M. Welch, USA TODAY } Tammy Faye worked in a boutique for a time while Jim found work in a restaurant inside a department store in Minneapolis. They were married on April 1, 1961. The following year, they moved to South Carolina, where they began their ministry. Their marriage produced two children, Tammy Sue (Sissy) Bakker Chapman (born 1970) and Jamie Charles (Jay) Bakker (born 1975). [ PTL Club ] Jim and Tammy Bakker had been involved with television from the time of their departure from Minneapolis until they moved to the Charlotte area via Portsmouth, Virginia, where they were founding members of the 700 Club. While in Portsmouth, they were hosts of the popular children&apos;s show &quot; Jim and Tammy &quot;. They then created a puppet ministry for children on Pat Robertson &apos;s Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) from 1964 to 1973 and co-founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network with personal friends Paul and Jan Crouch in California. Jim and Tammy founded the PTL Club (Praise The Lord) in the mid 1970s. During the PTL shows, she provided a sentimental touch to stories and loved to sing. In a move that sharply distinguished her from other televangelists, she showed a more tolerant attitude when it came to homosexuality, and she featured people suffering from AIDS on PTL, urging her viewers to follow Christ and show sympathy and pray for the sick. [ PTL collapse ] The Bakkers&apos; control of PTL collapsed in 1987 after revelations that $287,000 had been paid from the organization to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, who claims a forced sexual encounter with Jim Bakker. The revelations invited scrutiny of the Bakkers, and charges made about their opulent lifestyle, including media reports of an air-conditioned doghouse at their Tega Cay, South Carolina, lakefront parsonage as well as gold-plated bathroom fixtures, dominated newscasts in the 1980s. The Bakkers&apos; home, owned by the ministry, was actually an older home built in the early 1970s, and it was a few miles away from Heritage USA. Jim Bakker stated that the much-talked-about dog house was heated with an old heater to keep the dogs warm in the winter and the reported gold -plated fixtures were actually brass. The home was later sold by the ministry and burned to the ground not long thereafter. Jim Bakker wrote in his book I Was Wrong that he watched the home burn on live television while incarcerated. The epilogue from the publishers of this book contains the following: [ On July 22, 1996, shortly after Jim Bakker had completed the writing of this book, a federal jury ruled that PTL was not selling securities by offering Lifetime Partnerships at Heritage USA. The jury&apos;s ruling thus affirms what Jim Bakker has contended from the first day he was indicted and throughout this volume. ] The Charlotte Observer ran exposes of PTL&apos;s finances and management practices. PTL went bankrupt after being taken over by controversial Lynchburg, Virginia -based Baptist televangelist Jerry Falwell, who offered to step in following the scandals in 1988. [ Richard Ostling Enterprising Evangelism 1987-08-03 http://www.time.com/time/printout/0%2C8816%2C965155%2C00.html Time 2007-01-27 ] Charges surfaced that Falwell&apos;s interest in PTL and Heritage USA was solely an attempt to gain control of its profitable cable television network, something which Falwell was unsuccessful in establishing for his own ministry despite numerous requests to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for permission to obtain a satellite license. Tammy Faye later forgave Falwell regarding these tactics before Falwell&apos;s death in 2007, two months before Tammy Faye&apos;s own death. [ After PTL ] [ Marriage to Roe Messner ] Tammy stood by Bakker through the scandal, including several instances when she cried on camera. In 1989 Bakker was sentenced to 45 years in prison on 24  fraud and conspiracy counts. In 1992, while Bakker was still in prison she filed for divorce, saying in a letter to the New Covenant Church in Orlando, Florida : [ For years I have been pretending that everything is all right, when in fact I hurt all the time...I cannot pretend anymore.

They moved to the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina. Tammy and Roe were neighbors to Christian recording star and friend David L Cook. Messner, who had a contracting business, Messner Enterprises, in the Andover, Kansas, suburb of Wichita, Kansas, had built much of Heritage USA as well as numerous other large churches and had been a family friend to the Bakkers throughout the PTL years. Messner was the one who produced the money for the $265,000 payment to Hahn, later billing PTL for work never completed on the Jerusalem Amphitheater at Heritage USA. { Testimony: Baker knew about Hahn being paid off - Associated Press article via Pacific Stars and Stripes - September 16, 1987 } In the Bakkers&apos; fraud trial, Messner testified for Bakker&apos;s defense saying that Falwell had sent Messner to the Bakker home in Palm Springs, California, to make an offer to &quot; keep quiet. &quot; According to Messner&apos;s testimony, Tammy wrote the offer on her stationery, listing a $300,000-a-year lifetime salary for Jim, $100,000 a year for Tammy, a house, and a year&apos;s worth of free phone calls and health insurance. However, Messner said that Bakker wrote on it: &quot; I&apos;m not making any demands on PTL. I&apos;m not asking for anything. &quot;. { PTL link puts church builder Roe Messner in public eye - Kansas City Star via The News-Post Leader - Frederick, Maryland - June 17, 1987 (available of newspaperarchive.com) } { Bakker witness says Falwell offered hush money - Associated Press article via The Capital - September 26, 1989 } Falwell denied making any offer. In the messy bankruptcy of PTL, Messner was listed as the single biggest creditor of PTL with an outstanding claim of $14 million. In court papers, the new operators accused Messner of $5.3  million in inflated or phony billings to PTL. { PTL accuses builder of theft conspiracy - Associated Press article via DAILY INIEILIGENCER/MONTGOMERY COUNTY RECORD - September 10, 1987 } Messner filed for personal and corporate bankruptcy in 1990, saying he owed nearly $30 million to more than 300 creditors. He wound up being convicted of bankruptcy fraud. As he faced sentencing in 1996, he said that he could not afford to treat his prostate cancer because he lacked health insurance. { Tammy Faye has surgery for colon cancer - Pacific Stars and Stripes - March 22, 1996 } In July 2007, on more solid financial footing, the Messners relocated to a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, the Village of Loch Lloyd, Missouri.

Tammy Faye told Entertainment Tonight they had moved to the &quot; dream house &quot; to be closer to Roe&apos;s children and grandchildren from his first marriage.
