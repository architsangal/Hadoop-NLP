[ referencing violates WP:MEDRS May 2012 ] General structure of an isothiocyanate Isothiocyanate is the chemical group – N = C = S, formed by substituting the oxygen in the isocyanate group with a sulfur. Many natural isothiocyanates from plants are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called glucosinolate s. These natural isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocyanate, are also known as mustard oil s. An artificial isothiocyanate, phenyl isothiocyanate, is used for amino acid sequencing in the Edman degradation. [ Synthesis ] Synthesis of phenyl isothiocyanat General method for synthesis of isothiocyanates by reacting primary amine (e.g. aniline ) with carbon disulphide in aqueous ammonia resulting in precipitation of ammonium dithiocarbamate derivative, which then treated with lead nitrate to yield corresponding isothiocyanate derivative. [ Dains, F. B.; Brewster, R. Q.; Olander, C. P. Phenyl Isothiocyanate 1926 6 72 1 447 CV1P0447 ] Another method relies on a tosyl chloride mediated decomposition of a dithiocarbamate salts that are generated in first step. [ Wong R. Dolman S. J.

They work on a variety of levels, the most notable one being the inhibition of carcinogenesis through inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which oxidize compounds such as benzo[&apos;&apos;a&apos;&apos;]pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into more polar epoxy-diols, which can then cause mutation and induce cancer development.

Some authors report weak genotoxicity for allyl isothiocyanate and phenethyl isothiocyanate. Induction of point mutation s in Salmonella TA98 and TA100, repairable DNA damage in E.coli K-12 cells, and clastogenic effects in mammalian cells by extracts from cruciferous vegetables have also been observed. The goitrogenic effect of Brassicaceae vegetables, interfering with iodine uptake, is also a concern at elevated doses. The average intake of such sulfur-containing compounds through supplementation should not exceed normal levels of consumption. { Spring/Summer 2006 Research Newsletter-Linus Pauling Institute } [ May 2012 ] [ In foods ] Vegetable foods with characteristic flavors due to isothiocyanates include wasabi, horseradish, mustard, radish, Brussels sprout s, watercress, nasturtiums, and caper s. These various species generate different isothiocyanates in different proportions, and so have different, but recognisably related, flavors. All these species are members of the Brassicales, an order that is characterised by the production of glucosinolate s, and of the enzyme myrosinase, which acts on glucosinolates, resulting in the creation of isothiocyanates.
