[ July 2009 ] An aerial view of the Tel Remains of the stronghold { moat } Arsuf ( [ אַרְסוּף, ארשוף, &quot; &apos;aRShOoPh &quot; ], [ &quot; Arsaaf &quot;, أرصف ] ) also known as Arsur or Apollonia, was an ancient city and fortress located in Israel, about 15 kilometres north of modern Tel Aviv, on a cliff above the Mediterranean Sea. The city site, Tel Arsuf, was intensively excavated from 1994. In 2002 it became Apollonia National Park. In 1995 a new village by the name of Arsuf was established to the north of the ancient city. [ History ] The town was settled by Phoenicia ns in the 6th or 5th century BC, and named Arshuf after Resheph, the Canaan ite god of fertility and the underworld. It was then a part of the Persian Empire and governed from Sidon. Phoenicians of Arshuf produced precious purple dye, derived from murex mollusk s, which they exported to the Aegean. During the Hellenistic period it was an anchorage town, ruled by Seleucid s and renamed Apollonia, as the Greeks identified Reshef with Apollo. Under Roman rule, the size of the town increased. It was an important settlement between Jaffa and Caesarea along Via Maris, the coastal road. In 113 AD, Apollonia was destroyed partially by an earthquake, but recovered quickly. The harbor was built, and trade with Italy and North Africa developed. During the Byzantine period, the town extended to cover an area of [ 70 acre m2 ]. In the 5th and 6th century AD it was the second largest city in Sharon valley, after Caesarea, populated by Christian and Samaritans, having an elaborate church and a prosperous glass industry. In 640 AD, the town was captured by Muslims, and the Semitic name Arsuf was restored. The town&apos;s area decreased to about [ 22 acre m2 ] and, for the first time, it was surrounded by a fortified wall with buttresses, to resist the constant attacks of Byzantine fleets from the sea. Large marketplaces appeared, and pottery production developed. In 809 AD, following the death of Harun al-Rashid, the local Samaritan community was destroyed and their synagogue ruined. In 1101 Arsuf fell to a Crusade r army led by Baldwin I of Jerusalem. The Crusaders, who called it Arsur, rebuilt the city&apos;s walls and created the Lordship of Arsur in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1187 Arsuf was captured by the Muslims, but fell again to the Crusaders on September 7, 1191 after a battle between Richard I of England and Saladin. John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut (1177—1236) became Lord of Arsuf in 1207 when he married Melisende of Arsuf (born c.1170). Their son John of Arsuf (c.1211—1258) inherited the title. The title then passed to John of Arsuf&apos;s eldest son Balian of Arsuf (1239—1277). He built new walls, the big fortress and new harbor (1241). From 1261, the city was ruled by the Knights Hospitaller. In 1265 sultan Baibars, ruler of the Mamluk s, captured Arsur, after 40 days of siege. The Mamluks razed the city walls and the fortress to their foundations, fearing a return of the Crusaders. The destruction was so complete that the site was abandoned. In 1596, Ottoman tax registers recorded a village there with 22 families and 4 bachelors [ Hütteroth Wolf-Dieter Kamal Abdulfattah 1977 Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5.
