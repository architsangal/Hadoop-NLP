{ gallery below ) } The Grignard reaction (pronounced [ /ɡriɲar/ ] ) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl - or aryl - magnesium halide s (Grignard reagents) add to a carbonyl group in an aldehyde or ketone. This reaction is an important tool for the formation of carbon–carbon bond s. [ Shirley D. A. 1954 Org. Reactions 8 28–58 ] [ Huryn D. M. 1991 Comp. Org. Synthesis 1 49–75 ] The reaction of an organic halide with magnesium is not a Grignard reaction, but provides a Grignard reagent. { http://goldbook.iupac.org/G02699.html } An example of a Grignard reaction Grignard reactions and reagents were discovered by and are named after the French chemist François Auguste Victor Grignard ( University of Nancy, France), who was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. [ Grignard, V. Sur quelques nouvelles combinaisons organométaliques du magnésium et leur application à des synthèses d&apos;alcools et d&apos;hydrocabures Compt. Rend. 1900 130 1322–1325 http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark%3A/12148/bpt6k3086n/f1322.table ] Grignard reagents are similar to organolithium reagents because both are strong nucleophiles that can form new carbon-carbon bonds. [ Reaction mechanism ] The Grignard reagent functions as nucleophile s attacking electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within the polar bond of the carbonyl group. The addition of the Grignard reagent to the carbonyl typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state. [ Maruyama K. Katagiri T. 1989 J. Phys. Org. Chem 10.1002/poc.610020303 Mechanism of the Grignard reaction 2 205 3 ] The mechanism of the Grignard reaction. However, with hindered Grignard reagents, the reaction may proceed by single-electron transfer. Similar pathways are assumed for other reactions of Grignard reagents, e.g., in the formation of carbon– phosphorus, carbon– tin, carbon– silicon, carbon– boron and other carbon– heteroatom bonds. [ Preparation of Grignard reagent ] Grignard reagents form via the reaction of an alkyl or aryl halide with magnesium metal. The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an ether ial solvent, which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound. Empirical evidence suggests that the reaction takes place on the surface of the metal. The reaction proceeds through single electron transfer : { Garst, J.

Sundberg 2nd Ed. 1983 } [ 10.1021/ja00521a034 ] In the Grignard formation reaction, radicals may be converted into carbanions through a second electron transfer. { de Boer, H.J.R.; Akkerman, O.S; Bickelhaupt, F. “Carbanions as intermediates in the synthesis of Grignard Reagents”, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 27, 687 - 689, 1988. } { van Klink, G.P.M.; de Boer, H.J.R; Schat, G.; Akkerman, O.S.; Bickelhaupt, F.; Spek, A. “Carbanions as Intermediates in the Formation of Grignard Reagents”, Organometallics 21, 2119 – 2135, 2002. } R−X + Mg → R−X •− + Mg •+ R−X •− → R • + X − X − + Mg •+ → XMg • R • + XMg • → RMgX A limitation of Grignard reagents is that they do not readily react with alkyl halides via an S N 2 mechanism. On the other hand, they readily participate in transmetalation reactions: RMgX + ArX → ArR + MgX 2 For this purpose, commercially available Grignard reagents are especially useful because this route avoids the problem with initiation. { Handbook of Grignard Reagents, Silverman, G. S., Rakita, P. E., Eds.; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1996. } [ Reaction conditions ] In reactions involving Grignard reagents, it is important to exclude water and air, which rapidly destroy the reagent by protonolysis or oxidation. Since most Grignard reactions are conducted in anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, side-reactions with air are limited by the protective blanket provided by solvent vapors. Small-scale or quantitative preparations should be conducted under nitrogen or argon atmospheres, using air-free technique s. Although the reagents still need to be dry, ultrasound can allow Grignard reagents to form in wet solvents by activating the magnesium such that it consumes the water. [ 10.1021/ed076p1427 Grignard Reactions in &quot; Wet &quot; Ether 1999 Smith David H. Journal of Chemical Education 76 1427 10 ] [ The organic halide ] Grignard reactions often start slowly. As is common for reactions involving solids and solution, initiation follows an induction period during which reactive magnesium becomes exposed to the organic reagents. After this induction period, the reactions can be highly exothermic. Alkyl and aryl bromide s and iodide s are common substrates. Chloride s are also used, but fluoride s are generally unreactive, except with specially activated magnesium. [ Magnesium ] Typical Grignard reactions involve the use of magnesium ribbon. All magnesium is coated with a passivating layer of magnesium oxide, which inhibits reactions with the organic halide. Specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium, circumvents this problem. [ Lai Yee Hing 1981 Synthesis 1981 585–604 10.1055/s-1981-29537 Grignard Reagents from Chemically Activated Magnesium 8 ] [ Solvent ] { Lewis basic solvents, as shown here for the bis-adduct of methylmagnesium chloride and THF. } Most Grignard reactions are conducted in ethereal solvents, especially diethyl ether and THF. With the chelating diether dioxane, some Grignard reagents undergo a redistribution reaction to give diorganomagnesium compounds (R = organic group, X = halide): 2 RMgX + dioxane R 2 Mg + MgX 2 (dioxane) This reaction is known as the Schlenk equilibrium. [ Testing Grignard reagents ] Because Grignard reagents are so sensitive to moisture and oxygen, many methods have been developed to test the quality of a batch. Typical tests involve titrations with weighable, anhydrous protic reagents, e.g. menthol in the presence of a color-indicator. The interaction of the Grignard reagent with phenanthroline { Arkady Krasovskiy, Paul Knochel &quot; Convenient Titration Method for Organometallic Zinc, Magnesium, and Lanthanide­ Reagents &quot; Synthesis 2006, pp. 890-891. } [ 10.1055/s-2006-926345 ] or 2,2&apos;-bipyridine [ January 2012 ] causes a color change. [ Initiation ] Many methods have been developed to initiate sluggish Grignard reactions. These methods weaken the passivating layer of MgO, thereby exposing highly reactive magnesium to the organic halide. Mechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces in situ, rapid stirring, and sonication [ Smith David H. Grignard Reactions in &quot; Wet &quot; Ether Journal of Chemical Education 1999 76 10 1427 10.1021/ed076p1427 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed076p1427 26 February 2012 ] of the suspension. Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-dibromoethane are common activating agents. The use of 1,2-dibromoethane is particularly advantageous as its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. Furthermore, the side-products are innocuous: Mg + BrC 2 H 4 Br → C 2 H 4 + MgBr 2 The amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant. A small amount of mercuric chloride will amalgamate the surface of the metal, allowing it to react. [ Industrial production ] Grignard reagents are produced in industry for use in situ, or for sale. As with at bench-scale, the main problem is that of initiation; a portion of a previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator. Grignard reactions are exothermic, and this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant. [ Handbook of Grignard reagents Gary S. Silverman, Philip E. Rakita Philip E. Rakita 5.

[ Reactions of Grignard reagents ] [ Reactions with carbonyl compounds ] Grignard reagents will react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives. [ Butyric acid, α-methyl- Henry Gilman and R. H. Kirby 1 361 1941 cv1p0361 ] Reactions of Grignard reagents with carbonyls The most common application is for alkylation of aldehydes and ketones, as in this example: [ Haugan Jarle André 1997 Total Synthesis of C31-Methyl Ketone Apocarotenoids 2: The First Total Synthesis of (3R)-Triophaxanthin Acta Chimica Scandinavica 51 1096–1103 http://actachemscand.dk/pdf/acta_vol_51_p1096-1103.pdf 2009-11-26 10.3891/acta.chem.scand.51-1096 Songe Pål Rømming Christian Rise Frode Hartshorn Michael P. Merchán Manuela Robinson Ward T. Roos Björn O. Vallance Claire ] Reaction of CH 3 C(=O)CH(OCH 3 ) 2 with H 2 C=CHMgBr Note that the acetal function (a masked carbonyl) does not react. Such reactions usually involve an aqueous acidic workup, though this is rarely shown in reaction schemes. In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to a prochiral aldehyde or ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram&apos;s Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will be formed. With easily 1,3- diketone s and related substrates, the Grignard reagent RMgX functions merely as a base, giving the enolate anion and liberating the alkane RH. [ Reactions with other electrophiles ] Grignard reagents will react with other various electrophiles, serving both as a nucleophile for many and as a base for protic substrates. Reactions of Grignard reagents with various electrophiles Not shown, the reaction of bromoethane and Mg in ether followed by the addition of phenol in THF converts the phenol into C 6 H 5 -OMgBr. In the presence of paraformaldehyde powder and triethylamine after the addition of benzene and distillation of the latter solvents, salicylaldehyde will be the major product after the addition of 10% HCl. The reaction works also with iodoethane instead of bromoethane. { Peters, D. G.; C. Ji. J. Chem. Educ., 2006, 83 (2), p 290 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed083p290 } [ Formation of bonds to B, Si, P, Sn ] Like organolithium compound s, Grignard reagents are useful for forming carbon–heteroatom bonds. Reactions of Grignard reagents with non carbon electrophiles [ Reaction with transition metal halides ] Grignard reagents react with many metal-based electrophiles. For example, they undergo transmetallation with cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) to give dialkylcadmium : [ Chemistry Part II Textbook for class XII 2010 81-7450-716-7 355 2 Unit 12 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids National Council of Educational Research and Training India http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_12.Chemistry.ChemistryII/Unit%2012.pdf ] 2 RMgX + CdCl 2 → R 2 Cd + 2 Mg(X)Cl Dialkylcadmium reagents are used for preparation of ketones from acyl halides : 2 R&apos;C(O)Cl + R 2 Cd → 2 R&apos;C(O)R + CdCl 2 [ Carbon–carbon coupling reactions ] A Grignard reagent can also participate in coupling reaction s. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl p-chlorobenzoate to give p-nonylbenzoic acid, in the presence of Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III) (Fe(acac) 3 ), after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac) 3, the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide. [ 4-Nonylbenzoic Acid A. Fürstner, A. Leitner, G. Seidel 2004 81 33–42 v81p0033 ] 4-nonylbenzoicacid synthesis using a grignard reagent For the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignards, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also a good catalyst. Additionally, an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is dilithium tetrachlorocuprate (Li 2 CuCl 4 ), prepared by mixing lithium chloride (LiCl) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl 2 ) in THF. The Kumada-Corriu coupling gives access to [substituted] styrene s. [ Oxidation ] Treatment of a Grignard reagent with oxygen gives the magnesium organoperoxide. Hydrolysis of this material yields hydroperoxide s or alcohol. These reactions involve radical intermediates. Grignard oxygen oxidation pathways The simple oxidation of Grignard reagents to give alcohols is of little practical import as yields are generally poor. In contrast, two-step sequence via a borane (vide supra) that is subsequently oxidized to the alcohol with hydrogen peroxide is of synthetic utility. The synthetic utility of Grignard oxidations can be increased by a reaction of Grignard reagents with oxygen in presence of an alkene to an ethylene extended alcohol. [ Air-Assisted Addition of Grignard Reagents to Olefins. A Simple Protocol for a Three-Component Coupling Process Yielding Alcohols Youhei Nobe, Kyohei Arayama, and Hirokazu Urabe J. Am. Chem. Soc. 127 51 18006–18007 10.1021/ja055732b 2005 16366543 ] This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignards. Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction demonstrating that the presence of oxygen is essential. Only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard although this can partly be circumvented by the use of a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard such as n-butylmagnesium bromide. Grignard oxygen oxidation example [ Nucleophilic aliphatic substitution ] Grignard reagents are nucleophile s in nucleophilic aliphatic substitution s for instance with alkyl halide s in a key step in industrial Naproxen production: Naproxen synthesis [ Elimination ] In the Boord olefin synthesis, the addition of magnesium to certain β-haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene. This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions. Boord olefin synthesis, X = Br, I, M = Mg, Zn [ Degradation of Grignard reagents ] At one time, the formation and hydrolysis of Grignard reagents was used in the determination of the number of halogen atoms in an organic compound.

Covered with THF and a small piece of iodine added. A solution of alkyl bromide was added while heating. After completion of the addition, the mixture was heated for a while. Formation of the Grignard reagent had completed. A small amount of magnesium still remained in the flask. The Grignard reagent thus prepared was cooled to before the addition of carbonyl compound. The solution became cloudy since the Grignard reagent precipitated out. A solution of carbonyl compound was added to the Grignard reagent. The solution was warmed to room temperature. The reaction was complete.
