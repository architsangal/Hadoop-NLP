He has also written numerous books of humor and parody, as well as comedic novels. Barry was born in Armonk, New York, where his father—also named David Barry—was a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School and Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and Pleasantville High School where he was elected &quot; Class Clown &quot; in 1965. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Haverford College in 1969. In his book, Dave Barry&apos;s Greatest Hits, he stated that during college he was in a band called &quot; The Federal Duck. &quot; As the son of a minister and an alumnus of a Quaker -affiliated college, Barry avoided military service during the Vietnam War by registering as a religious conscientious objector. [ May 2012 ] After divorcing his college sweetheart, Barry married his second wife, Beth Lenox, in 1976 and they had one child, Robert, in 1980. Barry and Beth worked together at the Daily Local News in West Chester, PA, where they began their journalism careers on the same day in September, 1971. Barry and Lenox divorced in 1993. In 1996, Barry married Miami Herald sportswriter Michelle Kaufman; they had a daughter, Sophie, in 2000. He has had dogs named Earnest, Zippy, and now Lucy. All are mentioned regularly in Barry&apos;s columns. While with the Miami Herald, he created a band with his colleagues and named it the &quot; Urban Professionals &quot;, where he played lead guitar. At the Tupperware Headquarters in Orlando, Florida, he played his hit song, &quot; The Tupperware Song &quot;. { Barry, Dave. Dave Barry&apos;s Greatest Hits, p. 110 } He currently plays lead guitar in the The Rock Bottom Remainders, a band founded by his late sister-in-law, Kathi Kamen Goldmark in 1992.

He covered government and civic events in communities like Downingtown and Coatesville, and was promoted to City Editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the paper, and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a copy editor for The Associated Press at its Philadelphia Bureau before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm. At Burger, he taught effective writing to business people. In his own words, he &quot; spent nearly eight years trying to get various businesspersons to... stop writing things like &apos;Enclosed please find the enclosed enclosures,&apos; but... eventually realized that it was hopeless. &quot; [ 1999 Dave Barry Biography http://www.davebarry.com/bioold.htm 2007-05-06 ] In 1981 he wrote a humorous guest column in the Philadelphia Inquirer which attracted the attention of Gene Weingarten, then an editor at Tropic, the Sunday magazine of the Miami Herald in Miami, Florida. In 1983, Barry was hired by Weingarten as a humor columnist. Barry won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1988, &quot; for his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns. &quot; [ Pulitzer Prize Winners 1988 http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988 2007-05-06 ] For a 1992 American Booksellers Association convention, several authors including Barry formed a band for charity called The Rock Bottom Remainders ( &quot; remainder &quot; is a publishing term for a book that doesn&apos;t sell). The members of the band, which has at various times included Stephen King, Amy Tan, Ridley Pearson, Mitch Albom, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Roy Blount, Jr., Barbara Kingsolver and Matt Groening, &quot; are not musically skilled, but they are extremely loud, &quot; according to Barry. Several high-profile musicians including Al Kooper, Warren Zevon and Roger McGuinn have performed with the band, and Bruce Springsteen sat in at least once. The band&apos;s road tour resulted in the book Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude, which is now out of print. Barry&apos;s first novel, Big Trouble, was made into a motion picture; directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, it starred Tim Allen, Rene Russo and Dave&apos;s World alumnus Patrick Warburton, with a cameo by Barry. The movie was originally due for release in September 2001, but was postponed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks because the story involved smuggling a nuclear weapon onto an airplane. In 2002, Barry poked fun at the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota; the city responded by naming a sewage pumping station after him. Barry was a good sport and appeared in Grand Forks for the dedication. { Idling in the grand cities - Dave Barry - MiamiHerald.com } Articles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as Boating, Home Office Computing and Reader&apos;s Digest, in addition to the Chicken Soup for the Soul inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in the Best American Sportswriting series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here&apos;s How! (ISBN 0-451-21649-0), a follow-up of Barry&apos;s hand in creating International Talk Like a Pirate Day. His books have frequently appeared on the New York Times Best Seller List. Barry helps organize the Herald Hunt, formerly the Tropic Hunt, an annual puzzlehunt in Miami. He has run several mock campaigns for President of the United States, running on a libertarian platform. He has also written for the Libertarian Party &apos;s national newsletter. { July 2011 Presidency 2000:The Independent, Write-In, and other Candidates, Politics1.com } On October 31, 2004, Dave Barry announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly humor column with the Herald in order to spend more time with his family. He said that he would continue writing humor and children&apos;s books and working on filming the screen adaptation of his book, Dave Barry&apos;s Complete Guide to Guys, which was released in 2005; it premiered at several film festivals, and is available on DVD, though a theatrical release seems unlikely. On December 28, 2005, Barry said in an interview with Editor and Publisher that he will not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, year in review, his weblog, as well as an occasional article or column. [ Dave&apos;s World television series ] CBS broadcast the situation comedy Dave&apos;s World for four seasons, from 1993 to 1997, based on the books Dave Barry Turns 40 and Dave Barry&apos;s Greatest Hits, starring Harry Anderson as Barry, and DeLane Matthews as his wife, Beth. In an early episode, Barry was cast in a cameo role. The program was canceled shortly after being moved from Monday to the &quot; Friday night death slot &quot;. [ Style ] Barry has defined a sense of humor as &quot; a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge. &quot; [ Curtis Bryan An elegy for Dave Barry http://www.slate.com/id/2112218/ 2007-06-03 ] When distinguishing fact from hyperbole, Barry frequently asserts: &quot; I am not making this up. &quot; Among his favorite topics are exploding or flaming items (cows, whales, vacuum cleaners, toilets, Pop-Tarts, Barbie dolls, etc.), dogs lacking intelligence, live blogging, the television series 24, and amusing government studies. He labels various posts on his blog with long acronyms, such as WBAGNFARB ( &quot; would be a good name for a rock band &quot; ), poking fun at long internet abbreviations. He also enjoys making fun of South Florida, where he resides. In Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway, he suggested that many of America&apos;s problems could be solved if South Florida were literally sawed off from the mainland and disowned by the United States. He also has made fun of the region in Homes and Other Black Holes as well as other books of his. Even his novels, Big Trouble and Tricky Business, capitalize heavily in the absurdities that exist only in South Florida. In Big Trouble, for example, the ridiculous nuances of South Florida are expressed through the experiences of the two hit men, Henry and Leonard. They experience an irritating sports talk show host, a highly incompetent airport security detail, and are attacked by a python by the name of Daphne in the same airport before deciding that they never want to return to Florida again. Barry also uses Big Trouble to poke fun at the existence of a Russian arms black market, the corrupt political system (Puggy makes a living off being paid to vote), and the incredibly loose labor laws in the region. The phrase &quot; would be a good name for a rock band &quot; is an observation Barry often applies to phrases that pop up in his writing, such as &quot; The Moos of Derision &quot;, [ Barry Dave Pouch Potatoes http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename%3Darticle%26amp%3Bnode%3D%26amp%3BcontentId%3DA11787-2002Nov19 2007-05-06 The Washington Post 2002-11-24 ] &quot; Decomposing Tubers &quot; [ Barry Dave Keeping an eye on crime http://jewishworldreview.com/dave/barry082806.php3 2007-05-06 ] and &quot; Hearty Polyp Chuckles &quot;.

[ A GOOD NAME FOR A ROCK BAND? http://www.davebarry.com/rockbandlist.html 2007-05-06 ] In his humor books, Barry often cites a humorous phrase or image, which he then mercilessly repeats throughout. Notable examples include the Hawley-Smoot Tariff in Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States, Buffalo Bob in Dave Barry Turns 50, and giant prehistoric zucchini in Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway, e.g. &quot; Growth of U.S. government according to Alan Greenspan=giant prehistoric zucchini. &quot; He continues to reference these things, occasionally with fake subtlety (e.g., &quot; The H*****-S**** T***** &quot; ). His novels typically feature numerous initially unrelated subplots, many related to criminal activity, which slowly intertwine over the course of the story. Many critics explicitly compare this style to that of Elmore Leonard, though with a more comedic tone. { See,for example, Sharp MD. Popular Contemporary Writers. Marshall Cavendish, 2006, ISBN 0-7614-7601-6, p. 182 } [ Religious views ] Barry is the son of a Presbyterian minister, and decided &quot; early on &quot; that he was an atheist. [ Invalid length. ] He said &quot; the problem with writing about religion is that you run the risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes. &quot; In I&apos;ll Mature When I&apos;m Dead, Barry describes himself as non-religious but describes attending synagogue with his Jewish wife.
