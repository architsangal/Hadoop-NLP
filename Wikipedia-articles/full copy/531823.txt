Weide Larry David In the HBO special upon which the series was based, Larry approaches HBO about having his own hour-long HBO special. After a long hiatus, Larry begins performing stand-up comedy again in order to prepare for the special. However, hours away from the show&apos;s scheduled filming, Larry becomes nervous and lies to the HBO executives about the illness of his nonexistent stepfather in order to get the special canceled. [ Season 1 (2000) ] The first season introduces us to Larry&apos;s post-Seinfeld world, where he is wealthy, has a loving wife, a best friend, and he also manages to offend everyone around him. It is not long into the series though that we realize that Larry David is his own worst enemy. He is accused of having an adultery-implying erection because of his extremely baggy trousers that bunch up when he sits down; feuding with a shoe salesman; getting blamed for a newspaper typo after submitting an obituary for Cheryl&apos;s aunt; reacting offensively to drinking from his friend&apos;s mother&apos;s glass; and unintentionally causing someone to believe that his uncle is an incestuous pedophile. Although this season has no major plot line, there is a small plot of Larry trying to obtain a bracelet to give to Cheryl and another small two-episode plot involving Larry and Cheryl trying to have a wire that runs through their backyard removed.
