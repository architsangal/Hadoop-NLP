[ August 2011 ] [ August 2011 ] [ an English-language expression ] { Thomas Hobson } A Hobson&apos;s choice is a free choice in which only one option is offered. As a person may refuse to take that option, the choice is therefore between taking the option or not; &quot; take it or leave it &quot;. The phrase is said to originate with Thomas Hobson (1544–1631), a livery stable owner in Cambridge, England. To rotate the use of his horses, he offered customers the choice of either taking the horse in the stall nearest the door or taking none at all. [ Origins ] According to a plaque underneath a painting of Hobson donated to Cambridge Guildhall, Hobson had an extensive stable of some 40 horses. This gave the appearance to his customers of having their choice of mounts when in fact there was only one: Hobson required his customers to choose the horse in the stall closest to the door. This was to prevent the best horses always being chosen, which would have caused those horses to become overused. An ultimatum game is a form of Hobson&apos;s choice. [ Differences ] Hobson&apos;s choice is different from: Dilemma : a choice between two or more options, none of which is attractive (including Sophie&apos;s choice, a choice between two persons or things that will result in the death or destruction of the person or thing not chosen) False dilemma : only two choices are considered, when in fact there are others Catch-22 : a logical paradox arising from a situation in which an individual needs something that can only be acquired by not being in that very situation Morton&apos;s fork, and a double bind : choices yield equivalent, often undesirable, results. Blackmail and extortion : the choice between paying money (or some non-monetary good or deed) and suffering an unpleasant action [ Early appearances in writing ] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known written usage of this phrase is in The rustick&apos;s alarm to the Rabbies, written by Samuel Fisher in 1660: &quot; If in this Case there be no other (as the Proverb is) then Hobson&apos;s choice...which is, chuse whether you will have this or none. &quot; It also appears in Joseph Addison &apos;s paper The Spectator (14 October 1712); and in Thomas Ward&apos;s 1688 poem &quot; England&apos;s Reformation &quot;, not published until after Ward&apos;s death. Ward wrote: &quot; Where to elect there is but one, / &apos;Tis Hobson&apos;s choice—take that, or none. &quot; [ Modern use ] Hobson&apos;s choice is often misused to mean a false illusion of choice, but it is not a choice between two undesirable options, which is a Morton&apos;s fork. Such a choice between two options of nearly equal value is more properly called a dilemma. Hobson&apos;s choice is one between something or nothing. On occasion, speakers and writers use the phrase &quot; Hobbesian choice &quot; instead of &quot; Hobson&apos;s choice, &quot; confusing the philosopher Thomas Hobbes with the relatively obscure Thomas Hobson.

Chadha, Justice Byron White dissented and classified the Majority&apos;s decision to strike down the &quot; one-house veto &quot; as unconstitutional as leaving Congress with a Hobson&apos;s Choice. Congress may choose between &quot; refrain[ing] from delegating the necessary authority, leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing laws with the requisite specificity to cover endless special circumstances across the entire policy landscape, or in the alternative, to abdicate its lawmaking function to the executive branch and independent agency. &quot; &apos;&apos; INS v.
