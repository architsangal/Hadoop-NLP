Năstase was the World No. 1 tennis player between 1973 (August 23) and 1974 (June 2). He is one of the five players in history to win more than 100 ATP professional titles (57 singles and 45 in doubles). [ ATP Legends profiles – Ilie Nastase http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Na/I/Ilie-Nastase.aspx?t%3Dtf ] He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991. Năstase won seven Grand Slam titles: two in singles, three in men&apos;s doubles, and two in mixed doubles. He also won four Masters Grand Prix year end championship titles and seven Championship Series titles (1970–73) the precursors to the current Masters 1000. In 2005, Tennis magazine ranked him as the 28th-best player of the preceding forty years. He is the second male player to win a Grand Slam without dropping a set and the first one to achieve this feat at French Open (1973). [ Career ] At the beginning of his career in 1966 Năstase travelled around the world competing with his good friend Ion Ţiriac. Together, they represented Romania in the Davis Cup competition, being three times runners up: in 1969, 1971 and 1972. In singles, Năstase won his first tournament at Cannes on April 16, 1967. His first victories at top players happened in 1969 in Stockholm, where he defeated Tony Roche and Stan Smith. Năstase became one of the best players in 1970, with many experts ranking him as the sixth best player in the world at that time after the Australians Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe, and Roche and the American Ashe. Năstase&apos;s high ranking resulted from his success at the Italian Open in Rome and at the U.S. Indoor Open in Salisbury, Maryland. With Tiriac, Năstase won the men&apos;s doubles title at the French Open. In 1971, Năstase was the runner-up at the French Open. where he lost the final in four sets to Jan Kodeš. In December, Năstase won his first Masters Grand Prix title. In 1972, he became the second ranked player in the world, owing to his winning of the US Open in a five-set final over Arthur Ashe. This tournament was the only event of the year in which all the best players participated. Two months before at Wimbledon, Năstase narrowly lost to Stan Smith in an epic [ http://www.octagon-uk.com/content.aspx?menu%3D83 Octagon &gt; Athletes &amp; Personalities &gt; Ilie Nastase Octagon-uk.com July 19, 1946 September 17, 2010 ] five sets final, one of the most exciting championship matches there. [ September 2010 ] Although Smith took the title, public sympathy lay with the volatile Romanian. In the Davis Cup, Năstase was undefeated in singles until losing to Stan Smith in the final played on clay in his native Bucharest. In December at the year end tour finals, Năstase took revenge against Smith winning his second consecutive Masters Grand Prix title. In 1973 he was in sensational form. By winning 17 tournaments, including the French Open, a doubles title at Wimbledon, a third Masters title, Năstase was the undisputed World No.1 that year. In the Davis Cup, he won 7 of 8 singles rubbers, including a victory over Tom Okker, the &quot; Flying Dutchman. &quot; In matches against the other top players, Năstase was 1–0 against Newcombe and 1–1 against Smith. The Romanian won the French Open without dropping a set (a feat repeated by Björn Borg in 1978 and 1980 and by Rafael Nadal in 2008 and 2010), and he won the French Open (clay), Rome (clay) and Queen&apos;s Club (grass) in succession, a feat never repeated in the open era, though Borg won Rome, the French Open, and Wimbledon in succession in 1978, and Nadal won the French Open, Queen&apos;s Club, and Wimbledon in succession in 2008. In 1974 he was the only player to qualify for both the WCT Finals and the Masters Grand Prix finals (also Newcombe played both events, although he played the Masters at Kooyong Stadium as an invitee instead of a qualifier). As usual, Năstase played well in the Masters, in particular against Newcombe in the semifinals. (Năstase finished his career with a 4–1 record versus Newcombe, losing only their first match in 1969.) The Romanian, however, lost the final to Guillermo Vilas in five sets. For the fifth consecutive year, Năstase reached the Masters Grand Prix Final in 1975, where he defeated Björn Borg : 6–2, 6–2, 6–1. During the first half of 1976, Năstase won four tournaments (Atlanta WCT, Avis Challenge Cup WCT, US Open Indoor, and La Costa), and head-to-head, he led Connors 2–1, Vilas 1–0, Ashe 1–0, and Borg 2–0. Năstase did not enter the Australian Open, which was again avoided by most of the top players. Năstase was prevented from entering the French Open because he participated in World Team Tennis. In the second half of the year, Nastase lost to Borg in the men&apos;s singles final of Wimbledon and in the semifinals of the US Open. Năstase won three other tournaments during the second half of the year, the Pepsi Grand Slam, South Orange, and the 4-man tournament of Caracas, Venezuela, in October (not to be confused with the Caracas WCT tournament in March), making seven tournament championships for the year. Năstase was the World No. 3, behind Connors and Borg. In 1977 Năstase finished ninth in the ATP rankings. He was a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon and the French Open and participated in the WCT Finals. Năstase was still one of the 20 best players in 1978. At Wimbledon, he again reached the quarterfinals, losing to Okker after defeating Roscoe Tanner. During the remainder of his career, Năstase steadily declined and only occasionally defeated a good player, such as Johan Kriek in the third round of the 1982 US Open. Năstase retired from the tour in October 1985 at the age of 39 after playing in the tournament in Toulouse, although he did play the challenger tournament at Dijon in June 1988. [ Playing style ] Considered one of the most gifted tennis players in history, Ilie Năstase was noted both for his sorcery with the racket and his ability to entertain, amusing spectators with his antics and mimicry. Even during a crucial phase of a match, he was likely to do something bizarre that would entertain the crowd. Nicknamed the Bucharest Buffoon, Nastase could master all the shots, playing either baseline or serve-and-volley. [ ATP Legends profiles – Ilie Nastase http://www.atpworldtour.com/tennis/5/en/legends/nastase.asp ] One of the fastest players, he is remembered for his magnificent lobs and retrieves. Nastase could apply a discomforting spin to his shots, being an expert at putting the ball just beyond an opponent&apos;s reach. His greatest weakness was a fragile nervous system and erratic temperament, but when he maintained his concentration during a match, he could conjure up the most devastating tennis, being regarded as a tennis magician or an artist creating with great originality and panache. [ Distinctions ] [ The Independent London Nastase embodies an era with a touch of class June 28, 2003 May 5, 2010 ] [ France honours beloved Nastase http://www.winknews.com/news/entertainment/41101157.html April 12, 2009 ] Năstase won the Tennis Masters Cup tournament (today ATP World Tour Finals ) four times, in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1975. Only Roger Federer (6 times), Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl (5 times) succeeded to win more. He is one of the five tennis players (third place) in the world who won more than 100 pro titles (57 singles and 45 doubles) according to the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) website., though there are many titles that are not included in the ATP statistics. (see Career statistics section). Năstase was the first professional sports figure to sign an endorsement contract with Nike in 1972. Năstase and Connors were good friends, often playing doubles together. They refused to join the Association of Tennis Professionals, preferring to play in a parallel tour organized by their long-time manager Bill Riordan. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2005, TENNIS Magazine put Năstase in the 28th place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the TENNIS era. Năstase wrote a few novels in French in the 1980s and entered politics in the 1990s, making an unsuccessful run for mayor of Bucharest in 1996. According to British media Năstase is best remembered for being one of the best players never to win the singles title at Wimbledon, for his tantrum s, and his good looks. In March 2009 Ilie Năstase was made a knight of the France&apos;s Legion d&apos;honneur, being acclaimed for his &quot; impressive sporting career &quot; and &quot; the sense of spectacle &quot; created when playing. He is mentioned as a mail recipient from Donnatella Moss, Josh Lyman&apos;s assistant in the NBC series The West Wing. (episode 10, season 4, &quot; Arctic Radar &quot; ). [ Quotations ] [ January 2012 ] [ January 2012 ] [ January 2012 ] [ January 2012 ] [ January 2012 ] [ January 2012 ] &quot; If you have confidence, you have patience.

Năstase met Amalia at a Sting concert and married her in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on June 5, 2004 followed by a Civil ceremony in July of the same year. They divorced in February 2010, after six years of marriage. { Ilie Nastase, the Romanian George Best By Alastair McKay published online WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2006 based on an Interview with Ilie Năstase during the 2004 promotional tour for his autobiography. } [ Career statistics ] [ Grand Slam finals ] [ Singles: 5 (2–3) ] [ TCH ] [ USA ] [ USA ] [ YUG ] [ SWE ] Outcome Year Championship Surface Opponent in the final Score in the final Runner-up 1971 French Open Clay Jan Kodeš 6–8, 2–6, 6–2, 5–7 Runner-up 1972 Wimbledon Grass Stan Smith 6–4, 3–6, 3–6, 6–4, 5–7 Winner 1972 US Open Grass Arthur Ashe 3–6, 6–3, 6–7(1:5), 6–4, 6–3 Winner 1973 French Open Clay Nikola Pilić 6–3, 6–3, 6–0 Runner-up 1976 Wimbledon &lt; small &gt; (2) Grass Björn Borg 4–6, 2–6, 7–9 [ Doubles: 5 (3–2) ] [ Romania 1965 ] [ United States ] [ United States ] [ Romania 1965 ] [ United States ] [ United States ] [ United States ] [ Australia ] [ Netherlands ] [ United States ] [ Australia ] [ Australia ] [ United States ] [ Netherlands ] [ United States ] Outcome Year Championship Surface Partner Opponents in the final Score in the final Runner-up 1966 French Championships Clay Ion Ţiriac Clark Graebner Dennis Ralston 3–6, 3–6, 0–6 Winner 1970 French Open Clay Ion Ţiriac Arthur Ashe Charlie Pasarell 6–2, 6–4, 6–3 Runner-up 1973 French Open Clay Jimmy Connors John Newcombe Tom Okker 1–6, 6–3, 3–6, 7–5, 4–6 Winner 1973 Wimbledon Grass Jimmy Connors John Cooper Neale Fraser 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 8–9(3), 6–1 Winner 1975 US Open Clay Jimmy Connors Tom Okker Marty Riessen 6–4, 7–6 [ Mixed doubles: 3 (2–1) ] [ United States ] [ USSR ] [ USSR ] [ United States ] [ Australia ] [ Australia ] [ United States ] [ Australia ] [ United States ] Outcome Year Championship Surface Partner Opponents in the final Score in the final Winner 1970 Wimbledon Grass Rosemary Casals Olga Morozova Alex Metreveli 6–3, 4–6, 9–7 Winner 1972 Wimbledon Grass Rosemary Casals Evonne Goolagong Cawley Kim Warwick 6–4, 6–4 Runner-up 1972 US Open Grass Rosemary Casals Margaret Court Marty Riessen 3–6, 5–7 [ Year-End Championships ] [ Singles: 5 (4 &lt; ref &gt; &lt; template type= &quot; cite web &quot; &gt; &lt; tag name= &quot; title &quot; &gt; List of Masters Cup Finals &lt; /tag &gt; &lt; tag name= &quot; url &quot; &gt; http://www.masters-cup.com/3/history/finals.asp &lt; /tag &gt; &lt; /template &gt; &lt; /ref &gt; –1) ] [ USA ] [ USA ] [ NED ] [ ARG ] [ SWE ] Outcome Year Championship Surface Opponent in the final Score in the final Winner 1971 Paris Hard (i) Stan Smith 5–7, 7–6(4), 6–3 Winner 1972 Barcelona Hard (i) Stan Smith 6–3, 6–2, 3–6, 2–6, 6–3 Winner 1973 Boston Carpet Tom Okker 6–3, 7–5, 4–6, 6–3 Runner-up 1974 Melbourne Grass Guillermo Vilas 6–7(6), 2–6, 6–3, 6–3, 4–6 Winner 1975 Stockholm Carpet Björn Borg 6–2, 6–2, 6–1 [ Singles performance timeline ] &apos;&apos;Qualifying matches and Walkover s are neither official match wins nor losses.

Because the term &quot; challenger &quot; started to be applied to second-rank tournaments in 1978, those tournaments are termed &quot; minor tournaments &quot; in the following list. 1967 – Cannes (minor tournament), Travemünde (minor tournament) 1968 – Viareggio, Bucharest (minor tournament) 1969 – Madras (minor tournament), New Delhi (minor tournament), Gauhati (minor tournament), Travemünde, La Corogne, Budapest, Denver &apos;&apos; 1970 – Napoli, Ancona 1971 – Omaha, Istanbul 1973 – Istanbul, Kingston 1974 – Portland, World Invitational Tennis Classic (WITC) at Hilton Head (four-man invitational tournament, not to be confused with the CBS Classic tournament also played at Hilton Head) 1975 – WITC at Hilton Head (four-man invitational tournament), Helsinki, Dutch Round Robin (Utrecht Netherlands), Graz, Uppsala 1976 – Caracas (a four-man invitation tournament in October, not to be confused with the Caracas WCT in March that was won by Raúl Ramírez ), Argentine Round Robin (invitational tournament) 1977 – Rotterdam World Star (invitational tournament) 1978 – Frankfurt (invitational tournament) [ Singles runner-ups (36) ] [ YUG ] [ NED ] [ YUG ] [ TCH ] [ RSA 1928 ] [ YUG ] [ USA ] [ USA ] [ USA ] [ ESP 1945 ] [ USA ] [ ITA ] [ NED ] [ NED ] [ USA ] [ Rhodesia ] [ SWE ] [ ARG ] [ TCH ] [ AUS ] [ ARG ] [ ESP 1945 ] [ USA ] [ USA ] [ MEX ] [ POL ] [ USA ] [ SWE ] [ AUS ] [ USA ] [ ARG ] [ USA ] [ USA ] [ HUN ] [ USA ] [ TCH ] [ USA ] Outcome Year Tournament Surface Opponent in the final Score in the final 1. 1969 Stockholm, Sweden Hard (i) Nikola Pilić 4–6, 6–4, 1–6 2. 1970 Hamburg, Germany Clay Tom Okker 6–4, 3–6, 3–6, 4–6 3. 1971 Macon, U.S. Hard Željko Franulović 4–6, 5–7, 7–5, 6–3, 6–7 4. 1971 French Open, Paris Clay Jan Kodeš 6–8, 2–6, 6–2, 5–7 5. 1971 Brussels, Belgium Clay Cliff Drysdale 0–6, 1–6, 5–7 6. 1971 Buenos Aires, Argentina Clay Željko Franulović 3–6, 6–7, 1–6 7. 1972 Salisbury, U.S. Hard (i) Stan Smith 7–5, 2–6, 3–6, 4–6 8. 1972 Hampton, U.S. Hard (i) Stan Smith 3–6, 2–6, 7–6, 4–6 9. 1972 Wimbledon, London Grass Stan Smith 6–4, 3–6, 3–6, 6–4, 5–7 10. 1972 Båstad, Sweden Clay Manuel Orantes 4–6, 3–6, 1–6 11. 1973 Hampton, U.S. Hard (i) Jimmy Connors 6–4, 3–6, 5–7, 3–6 12. 1973 Bournemouth, United Kingdom Clay Adriano Panatta 8–6, 5–7, 3–6 13. 1973 London Carpet Tom Okker 3–6, 4–6 14. 1974 Toronto WCT, Canada Carpet Tom Okker 3–6, 4–6 15. 1974 Hampton, U.S. Carpet Jimmy Connors 4–6, 4–6 16. 1974 Monte Carlo, Monaco Clay Andrew Pattison 7–5, 3–6, 4–6 17. 1974 Rome, Italy Clay Björn Borg 3–6, 4–6, 2–6 18. 1974 Tennis Masters Cup, Melbourne Grass Guillermo Vilas 6–7, 2–6, 6–3, 6–3, 4–6 19. 1975 Basel, Switzerland Carpet Jiří Hřebec 1–6, 6–7, 6–2, 4–6 20. 1975 Tucson, U.S. Hard John Alexander 5–7, 2–6 21. 1975 Louisville, U.S. Clay Guillermo Vilas 4–6, 3–6 22. 1975 Montreal, Canada Hard Manuel Orantes 6–7, 0–6, 1–6 23. 1976 Baltimore, U.S. Carpet Tom Gorman 5–7, 3–6 24. 1976 Hampton, U.S. Carpet Jimmy Connors 2–6, 2–6, 2–6 25. 1976 Caracas WCT, Venezuela Clay Raúl Ramírez 3–6, 4–6 26. 1976 Stockholm WCT, Sweden Carpet Wojtek Fibak 4–6, 6–7 27. 1976 Nottingham, U.K. Grass Jimmy Connors ABN 28. 1976 Wimbledon, London Grass Björn Borg 4–6, 2–6, 7–9 29. 1976 Hong Kong Hard Ken Rosewall 3–6, 3–6 30. 1977 Rotterdam, Netherlands Carpet Dick Stockton 6–2, 3–6, 3–6 31. 1977 Virginia Beach, U.S. Hard Guillermo Vilas 2–6, 6–4, 2–6 32. 1978 Houston WCT, U.S. Clay Brian Gottfried 6–3, 2–6, 1–6 33. 1978 Forest Hills WCT, U.S. Clay Vitas Gerulaitis 2–6, 0–6 34. 1978 Barcelona, Spain Clay Balázs Taróczy 6–1, 5–7, 6–4, 3–6, 4–6 35. 1979 Cleveland, U.S. Hard Stan Smith 6–7, 5–7 36. 1981 Nancy, France Hard (i) Pavel Složil 2–6, 5–7 37. 1981 Bologna, Italy Carpet Sandy Mayer 5–7, 3–6 [ Sources for this section ] Michel Sutter, Vainqueurs Winners 1946–2003, Paris, 2003. Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1) the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s); and (2) the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present day challenger tournaments. Sutter&apos;s book is probably the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the open era are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years from 1946 to April 27, 2003, period.
