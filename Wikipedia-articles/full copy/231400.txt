The Hand of Glory is the dried and pickled hand of a man who has been hanged, often specified as being the left (Latin: sinister) hand, or else, if the man were hanged for murder, the hand that &quot; did the deed. &quot; According to old Europe an beliefs, a candle made of the fat from a malefactor who died on the gallows, virgin wax, and Lapland sesame oil - lighted and placed (as if in a candlestick) in the Hand of Glory, which comes from the same man as the fat in the candle - would have rendered motionless all persons to whom it was presented. The candle could only be put out with milk. (In another version the hair of the dead man is used as a wick, also the candle is said to give light only to the holder.) The Hand of Glory also purportedly had the power to unlock any door it came across.

Skeat writes: &quot; The identification of the hand of glory with the mandrake is clinched by the statement in Cockayne &apos;s Leechdoms, i. 245, { Thomas Oswald Cockayne. &apos;&apos;Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England&apos;&apos;.
