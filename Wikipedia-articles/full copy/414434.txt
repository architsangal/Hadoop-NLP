[ 1950 07 10 yes ] { Uxbridge, London, } { England } { British } { Pippa } { Conservative } { two } { University of Sussex } { Barrister } Anthony Brian &apos;Tony&apos; Baldry (born 10 July 1950) is a British Conservative Party politician. He is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Banbury. [ Early life ] Born in 1950, he was educated at Leighton Park School, a Quaker school, and the University of Sussex where he read Law. He became actively involved in student politics and during his time at Sussex, took the Students&apos; Union to the High Court on the grounds that the Students&apos; Union was making &quot; ultra vires &quot; payments out of Student Union funds to various political organisations. Baldry v. Feintuck (1972) 2 All ER 81 for the first time defined the legal status of Students&apos; Unions. [ Ultra vires: what it says, what it doesn&apos;t say and how to beat it http://www.free-education.org.uk/ultravires 26 March 2010 ] [ May 2010 ] In the February 1974 general election, Baldry was personal assistant to Maurice MacMillan, then Chief Secretary to the Treasury and in the October 1974 general election, he was personal assistant to Margaret Thatcher. When Margaret Thatcher became Leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, Baldry joined her Private Office, mainly to work as the link between Mrs Thatcher and the &quot; Britain in Europe Campaign &quot;, the &quot; Yes &quot; Campaign, for the 1975 EU referendum. Baldry was active in the European movement and won the Robert Schumann Silver Medal in 1978 for contributions to Europe. Baldry was called to the Bar at Lincoln&apos;s Inn in 1975 and became a common lawyer. He joined the Oxford and Midlands Circuit. Baldry joined the Sussex Yeomanry whilst at University. He reached the rank of Colonel during his nearly 20 years in the Royal Artillery from 1971. Tony Baldry was first selected as a Parliamentary candidate for the Thurrock constituency for the 1979 general election where he secured one of the largest swings to the Conservative Party. [ Parliamentary career ] Following the retirement of veteran Conservative MP Neil Marten who represented Banbury, Baldry successfully contested the seat at the 1983 general election and was elected to Parliament with a majority of 13,025. From 1985 to 1990, Baldry was a Parliamentary Private Secretary, successively to Lynda Chalker and John Wakeham, who was leader of the House of Commons. In January 1990 Margaret Thatcher made Baldry a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Energy, where he helped John Wakeham privatise the electricity industry. Baldry is one of the last of those made a Minister by Margaret Thatcher still to be in the House of Commons. Following the election of John Major as Prime Minister in November 1990, Michael Heseltine asked that Baldry move to the Department for the Environment, where he stayed for four years covering every aspect of the Department&apos;s work including housing, planning, Local Government and construction. In 1994 Baldry moved to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to cover in the House of Commons for Lynda Chalker who was the Minister for Overseas Development but in the House of Lords. As a consequence he spoke for the Government on International Development in the House of Commons. In 1995 he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - where he had to grapple with the twin problems of BSE and increasingly unpopular EU fisheries policies, and was a position he held until the fall of the Major government in 1997. His civil servants nicknamed him &apos; Baldrick &apos;. [ Criddle Byron Robert Waller Almanac of British Politics Routledge 2002 944 0-415-26833-8 ] On 21 June 2010, he was appointed Second Church Estates Commissioner, with responsibility for answering questions in the House in a manner similar to questions to ministers on the work of the Church Commissioners., { Number 10 Press Notice: Second Church Estates Commissioner, 21 June 2010. } { Church Times - Interview: Tony Baldry MP, Second Church Estates Commissioner, 2 July 2010 } { The Church of England: Tony Baldry Second Estates Commissioner } In the 2010 general election Baldry was re-elected with an increased majority, of 18,227 votes.

[ Annex to the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges Eighth Report of Session 1999-2000 http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmstnprv/369/36906.htm 30 March 2010 ] Baldry gave Lord Feldman (Chairman of the Conservative Party in London at the time) a letter of support for a recommendation of a public honour that Lord Feldman was making on behalf of Sarosh Zaiwalla. It was later held by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that in that reference or separately, Baldry should have declared that he was at the time a beneficiary of a loan from Sarosh Zaiwalla. Baldry was consequently ordered to apologise to the House over the incident.

[ Written evidence received by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmstnprv/421/42105.htm 19 March 2010 ] He asked Benn whether his department could endorse the company as conforming to &quot; best practices &quot; in the diamond industry. In his letter to Benn, which was written on House of Commons notepaper, he did not reveal that Milestone had paid $75,000 into a company in which he was a one-third shareholder. Benn replied that the government &quot; could not endorse an individual company&apos;s activities &quot;. At the time Baldry was the chairman of the House of Commons International Development Committee. He had also written letters to the President and Vice-President of Sierra Leone on behalf of Milestone in late 2004. Baldry also sent a series of letters on Angelgate Aviation notepaper from St James&apos;s Square (seen by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards) to Sierra Leone Vice President Solomon Berewa on behalf of Angel Gate Aviation, a company that was trying to set up flights between London and Freetown. In investigating this case, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards concluded that Baldry should not have used House of Commons notepaper in the letter to Benn.

[ James Ibori ] In September 2009 Baldry, in his capacity as a barrister instructed by the solicitor Sarosh Zaiwalla, wrote a letter to Foreign Secretary David Miliband on behalf of Nigerian governor James Ibori, who was under investigation by Scotland Yard for corruption. [ Tory MP Accused Over Links to Nigerian Politician David Connett Michael Gillard The Independent on Sunday 15 February 2010 ] The Oxford Mail reported that Mr Baldry had been &quot; paid more than £37,000 for 29 hours work between September and December by Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based solicitor who had acted for the Ibori family &quot;.

The correction clarified that Mr Baldry had not lobbied on Mr Ibori&apos;s behalf, and supported his claim that despite it being contrary to legal protocol, he had written to the Foreign Secretary in his capacity as a barrister, and not as an MP.
