Remicade is marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. (formerly Centocor Biotech, Inc.) in the USA, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma in Japan, Xian Janssen in China, and Schering-Plough (now part of Merck &amp; Co ) elsewhere. [ Remicade Becomes First Anti-TNF Biologic Therapy to Treat One Million Patients Worldwide http://www.jnj.com/connect/NewsArchive/all-news-archive/20071106_141812 Johnson &amp; Johnson November 6, 2007 2009-11-14 ] Infliximab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psoriasis, Crohn&apos;s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Infliximab won its initial approval by the FDA for the treatment of Crohn&apos;s disease in August 1998. [ http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/ucm093327.htm Infliximab Product Approval Information - Licensing Action Drugs@FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2009-11-14 ] Infliximab works by binding to tumour necrosis factor alpha. TNFα is a chemical messenger ( cytokine ) and a key part of the autoimmune reaction. Originally, infliximab was assumed to work by blocking the action of TNFα by preventing it from binding to its receptor in the cell, and for the action of infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis. This still seems to be true. However, another TNFα-neutralizing medication, etanercept (Enbrel), is worse than a placebo in Crohn&apos;s disease, so TNFα-neutralisation is not responsible for its powerful action in the latter disease. [ Van Den Brande JM, Peppelenbosch MP, Van Deventer SJ Treating Crohn&apos;s disease by inducing T lymphocyte apoptosis Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 973 166–80 2002 November 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04628.x 12485856 ] Infliximab causes programmed cell death of TNFα-expressing activated T lymphocytes, an important cell type mediating inflammation, but etanercept does not have this activity; now, resolution of activated T cells by infliximab is generally assumed to explain its efficacy in Crohn&apos;s disease. [ Van den Brande JM, Braat H, van den Brink GR, et al. Infliximab but not etanercept induces apoptosis in lamina propria T-lymphocytes from patients with Crohn&apos;s disease Gastroenterology 124 7 1774–85 2003 July 10.1016/S0016-5085(03)00382-2 12806611 ] Infliximab is an artificial antibody. It was originally developed in mice as a mouse antibody. Because humans have immune reactions to mouse proteins, the mouse common domains were replaced with similar human antibody domains. Because the antibodies were produced from one cell grown into a clone of identical cells, it is called a monoclonal antibody. Because it is a combination of mouse and human antibody, it is called a chimeric monoclonal antibody. Infliximab was developed by Junming Le and Jan Vilcek at New York University School of Medicine and developed by Centocor, (now Jannsen Biotech, Inc.) [ Knight DM, Trinh H, Le J, et al. Construction and initial characterization of a mouse-human chimeric anti-TNF antibody Mol. Immunol. 30 16 1443–53 1993 November 10.1016/0161-5890(93)90106-L 8232330 ] Infliximab can cost $19,000 to $22,000 a year per patient wholesale, according to Centocor. { &quot; Priced out of pain relief; Insurers balk at high costs of promising new treatments &quot;, Victoria Colliver, } { San Francisco Chronicle, May 8, 2007 } It is typically covered under major medical insurance (rather than prescription drug insurance). Other monoclonal antibodies targeting TNFα are golimumab (Simponi), adalimumab (Humira), and certolizumab pegol (Cimzia). Etanercept also binds and inhibits the action of TNFα, but is not a monoclonal antibody (it is instead a fusion of TNF-receptor and an antibody constant region ). [ Peppel K et al. 1991 A tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity J. Exp. Med. 174 6 1483–9 10.1084/jem.174.6.1483 1660525 2119031 ] Infliximab is administered by intravenous infusion, typically at six- to eight-week intervals, at a clinic or hospital. It cannot be administered orally, because the digestive system would destroy the drug. [ Steinhilber D Schubert-Zsilavecz, M; Roth, HJ Medizinische Chemie Deutscher Apothekerverlag Stuttgart 2005 1 5 Molekülstruktur und biologische Eigenschaften 3-7692-3483-9 German ] [ Pharmacology ] According to product labeling, infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of TNFα by binding with high affinity to the soluble (free floating in the blood) and transmembrane (located on the outer membranes of T cells and similar immune cells) forms of TNFα, and inhibits or prevents the effective binding of TNFα with its receptors. Infliximab and adalimumab (another TNF antagonist) are in the subclass of &quot; anti-TNF antibodies &quot; (they are in the form of naturally occurring antibodies), and are capable of neutralizing all forms (extracellular-, transmembrane -, and receptor -bound) TNFα. [ Choy EH, Panayi GS Cytokine pathways and joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis The New England Journal of Medicine 344 12 907–16 2001 March 10.1056/NEJM200103223441207 11259725 ] Etanercept, a third TNF antagonist, is in a different subclass (receptor-construct fusion protein), and, because of its modified form, cannot neutralize receptor-bound TNFα. { Etanercept product labeling } Additionally, the anti-TNF antibodies adalimumab and infliximab have the capability of lysing cells involved in the inflammatory process, whereas the receptor fusion protein apparently lacks this capability. { Etanercept, Adalimumab and Infliximab product labeling } Although the clinical significance of these differences have not been absolutely proven, they may account for the differential actions of these drugs in both efficacy and side effects. Infliximab has high specificity for TNFα, and does not neutralize TNF beta (TNFβ, also called lymphotoxin α), an unrelated cytokine that uses different receptors from TNFα. Biological activities attributed to TNFα include: induction of proinflammatory cytokine s such as interleukin s IL-1 and IL-6, enhancement of leukocyte movement or migration from the blood vessels into the tissues by increasing the permeability of endothelial layer of blood vessels; and increasing the release of adhesion molecule s. Infliximab prevents disease in transgenic mice (a special type of mice biologically engineered to produce a human form of TNFα and which are used to test the results of these drugs that might be expected in humans). These experimental mice develop arthritis as a result of their production of human TNFα, and when administered after disease onset, infliximab allows eroded joints to heal. [ Infliximab in Crohn&apos;s disease ] Three phenotype s, or categories of disease, present in Crohn&apos;s disease : stricturing disease (which causes narrowing of the bowel), penetrating disease (which causes fistula e or abnormal connections of the bowel), and inflammatory disease (which causes primarily inflammation ).

In a 94-patient, phase II clinical trial, the researchers showed infliximab was effective in closing fistulae between the skin and bowel in 56-68% of patients. [ Present D, Rutgeerts P, Targan S, Hanauer S, Mayer L, van Hogezand R, Podolsky D, Sands B, Braakman T, DeWoody K, Schaible T, van Deventer S Infliximab for the treatment of fistulas in patients with Crohn&apos;s disease The New England Journal of Medicine 340 18 1398–405 1999 May 10228190 10.1056/NEJM199905063401804 ] A large, 296-patient, Phase III clinical trial called the ACCENT 2 trial, showed infliximab was additionally beneficial in maintaining closure of fistulae, with almost two-thirds of all patients treated with the three initial doses of infliximab having a fistula response after 14 weeks, and 36% of patients maintaining closure of fistulae after a year, compared with 19% who received placebo therapy. This final trial resulted in the FDA approval of the drug to treat fistulizing disease.

The ACCENT 1 trial, a large, multicentre trial, found 39 to 45% of patients treated with infliximab, who had an initial response to it, maintained remission after 30 weeks, compared with 21% who received placebo treatment. It also showed a mean maintenance of remission from 38 to 54 weeks compared with 21 weeks for patients who received placebo treatment.

Severe flares are usually treated with steroid medications to obtain remission, but steroids have many undesirable side effects, so some gastroenterologists are now advocating the use of infliximab as the first drug to try to get patients into remission. This has been called the top-down approach to treatment.

Ulcerative colitis was thought to be a Th2 disease, and infliximab would be of limited use. However, patients with ulcerative colitis have begun to be treated with infliximab on the basis of two large clinical trials conducted in 2005 by Paul Rutgeerts and William Sandborn. The Acute ulcerative Colitis Treatment) trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to evaluate the utility of infliximab in ulcerative colitis showed 44-45% of patients treated with infliximab for a year maintained a response to the medication, compared with 21% of patients who were treated with placebo medication. At two months, the response was 61-69% for patients treated with infliximab, and 31% for those treated with placebo.

A number of studies and reports of adverse and serious adverse reactions in patients receiving infliximab have been conducted. Risks include: [ Keane J, et al.

Combination treatment with methotrexate (an antifolate drug which suppresses the immune system) has been shown to reduce the formation of these antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ Maini R, St Clair EW, Breedveld F, et al. Infliximab (chimeric anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody) versus placebo in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving concomitant methotrexate: a randomised phase III trial. ATTRACT Study Group Lancet 354 9194 1932–9 1999 December 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)05246-0 10622295 ] and combination therapy with other immunosuppressants has been shown to reduce the likelihood of these antibodies being formed in Crohn&apos;s disease. The use of immunosuppressants may not be necessary in all diseases for which infliximab is indicated, and indiscriminant uses of these other immunosuppressants carry their own risks. Infliximab was studied in monotherapy (without concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or azathioprine ) in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Only its use in rheumatoid arthritis requires the concomitant use of methotrexate by FDA product labeling; however, the concomitant use of methotrexate in other disease states may help to reduce the body&apos;s immune response to the infliximab and increase its duration of efficacy. [ Other uses ] Case studies have been conducted on other uses of infliximab, such as to treat skin diseases. It was approved for treating ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn&apos;s disease (fistulizing and pediatric ), psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Infliximab is also prescribed (out of indication) for the treatment of Behçet&apos;s disease, [ Sfikakis PP Behçet&apos;s disease: a new target for anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment Ann. Rheum.

Inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, substantially improve the signs and symptoms of psoriasis (level 1b, grade A). Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, the results suggest infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab have the potential to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. Results suggest infliximab is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA (level 1b, grade B).

Rheumatol. 33 7 1417–21 2006 July 16724373 ] [ Availability/affordability ] Like all of the TNF inhibitors, infliximab is an expensive medication, costing about US$900 for a 100  mg dose, and is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans make it possible to be covered for only a subset of treatments in the course of a year). [ March 2009 ] Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, { http://www.rxlist.com/remicade-drug.htm } so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages. Infliximab is available from the NHS in the UK for Crohn&apos;s disease treatment provided three criteria are met. { &quot; Guidance on the use of infliximab for Crohn’s disease (TA40) &quot; } Patients should have severe active Crohn&apos;s disease with a CDAI score of 300 or more, have not responded to immunomodulating drugs and corticosteroids, and for whom surgery is inappropriate. Infliximab is available through the PBS in Australia for Crohn&apos;s disease treatment provided the patient has not responded to conventional treatment and is suffering from a severe case of the condition. { &quot; Section 100 arrangements; only for infliximab &quot; } Infliximab is available in the Republic of Ireland through the HSE&apos;s Medical Card and Drug Payment Scheme.
