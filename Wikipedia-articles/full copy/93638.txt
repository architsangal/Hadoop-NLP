It thus included 180 square miles (470  km 2 ) of the Pawnee Reservation, established one year before the county. In 1873, the state legislature removed these reservation lands from the county, leaving it with a jagged northern border from which narrow panhandles extended northward from the northeast and northwest corners. In 1897, the Pawnee Reservation became Nance County. { &quot; Merrick County&apos;s 100th Year: 1858-1958 &quot;. NEGenWeb Project.
