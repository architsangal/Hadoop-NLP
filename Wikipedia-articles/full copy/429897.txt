It is one of the largest marathons in the world, with 45,103 finishers in 2010. [ http://www.nycmarathon.org/Results.htm ING New York City Marathon 2010, Finisher Demographics, November 7, 2010 2011-04-17 New York Road Runners ] Along with the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors. The race is organized by New York Road Runners (NYRR) and has been run every year since 1970. In recent years, it has been sponsored by the financial group ING. It is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Runners who are members of NYRR can gain entry by meeting the qualifications for guaranteed entry or via nomination from an official running club.

[ New York City Marathon Marius Bakken http://www.marathon-training-schedule.com/new-york-city-marathon.html 2009-04-17 ] Nowadays the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island near the approach to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge, which normally carries only vehicular traffic, is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the upper level of the bridge and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event. After descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn for approximately the next eleven miles (18 km). Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint. At [ 21.0975 km mi ], runners cross the Pulaski Bridge, marking the halfway point of the race and the entrance into Long Island City, Queens. After about two and a half miles in Queens, runners cross the East River on the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan. It is at this point in the race when many runners begin to tire, as the climb up the bridge is considered one of the most difficult points in the marathon. Reaching Manhattan after about [ 16 mi km ], the race proceeds north on First Avenue, then crosses briefly into The Bronx via the Willis Avenue Bridge for a mile before returning to Manhattan via the Madison Avenue Bridge. It then proceeds south through Harlem down Fifth Avenue and into Central Park. At the southern end of the park, the race proceeds across Central Park South, where thousands of spectators cheer runners on during the last mile. At Columbus Circle, the race re-enters the park and finishes outside Tavern on the Green. The time limit for this course is 8½ hours from the 10:10 a.m. start. In 2008, the race initiated a corral system. Women were given a head start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip worn on the shoe, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as &quot; net &quot;, as opposed to &quot; gun &quot;, time. Runners also pass timing mats at 5  km intervals along the course and email notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to see how the runners are doing. In addition, while the distance is the same, there are different courses taken through Bay Ridge and up Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn until the course reaches Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn at Mile 8. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5  km intervals to accommodate the publishing [ http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/Results.htm Results The ING New York City Marathon 2011-01-31 ] of splits and also enabling potential world record s for 20  km, 30  km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded. [ History ] The first New York City Marathon was held in 1970, organized by New York Road Runners Club presidents Fred Lebow and Vincent Chiappetta, [ http://everything.explained.at/New_York_City_Marathon/ New York City Marathon Explained accessdate=5/13/11 ] with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about one-hundred spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. In fact, a total of only 55 runners crossed the finish line. { &quot; History of the ING New York City Marathon &quot;, New York City Marathon website, retrieved November 2, 2007. } Over the years, the marathon grew larger and larger. In order to accommodate the growing number of participants, co-founder Fred Lebow redrew the course in 1976 to incorporate all five boroughs of New York City. The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women&apos;s world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times. An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000, and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35 minute headstart before the elite men and rest of the field. Thirty-nine years after it was started in 1970, the New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million cheering spectators line the course from all different neighborhoods of New York. The marathon is broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC, on Universal Sports for the entire country, and online. { &quot; Tune-In &quot; Anywhere } [ 1979 ] In a normally trivial mistake, Cuban American Rosie Ruiz was accidentally given a finish time of 2:56:29. This qualified her for the 1980 Boston Marathon, where she crossed the finish line with a record time of 2:31:56. It was quickly determined that she had not run the entire course in either race, igniting the best-known scandal in the history of modern distance running. New York Marathon chief Fred Lebow rescinded Ruiz&apos;s time after determining she had not finished the 1979 race, and officials in Boston quickly followed suit. { &quot; Rosie Ruiz Pulls The Ultimate Prank &quot;, The Boston Globe, April 22, 1980. } [ 1981 ] Alberto Salazar &apos;s 2:08:13 was initially considered to be a world&apos;s best in the marathon, but the mark was later rescinded by The Athletics Congress, now known as USA Track &amp; Field, when the course was measured to be short by approximately 150 meters.

He was caught at the 26 mile mark in Central Park by 1972 Olympic 1500 metres bronze medalist Rod Dixon from New Zealand, who won by just 9 seconds. Dixon had been as far as 2 and a half minutes behind with 10Km to go, but steadily loomed over Smith&apos;s shoulder.

However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because they competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men&apos;s Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course, three loops of which Trials were in Central Park.
