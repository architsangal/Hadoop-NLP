[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1245951 } [ 3 ] Hemingway is a town in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. The population was 573 at the 2000 census. [ Historical Sketch ] Hemingway was created from a crossroads community named Lamberts in 1911 by Dr. W. C. Hemingway, in an effort to secure a depot for the proposed Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which was to run from Mullins to Andrews. Land owned by Dr. Hemingway was surveyed and the lots auction ed off. Subsequently the railroad established a Hemingway depot, and the post office name was changed to Hemingway. { water tower in downtown Hemingway, SC } With rail access, Hemingway grew into a market town for local agricultural products. Cotton declined after 1921, when the boll weevil arrived, but was already being replaced by flue cured tobacco as the primary money crop for farmer s. Other local products were naval stores from the pine forests (later replaced by timbering ), corn, soybean s, wheat, and vegetable s. Hemingway is near the Pee Dee River, which was the main commercial route for the area until the coming of the railroad. Snows Lake is a lake near Hemingway. This is also a site in the Revolutionary War camp of US war hero, General Francis Marion. The river was named by early explorers after the Pee Dee tribe. A major tributary is the Waccamaw River likewise named. [ Jobs ] Besides agriculture, the manufacture of textile s has been important in the past, with numerous sewing factories, but most of these have closed. Talous, where insect proof suits for sportsmen are sewed, and Hemingway Apparel, are exceptions. Important industries today are Tupperware (plastic kitchenware), House of Raeford (meat products), C-V Unlimited (remanufactured auto parts), Don&apos;s Scrap Iron and Metal Co., Southeastern Wire Fabricators, Inc. (manufactured wire products) and Palmetto Paper Tube. Some people commute to Wellman Industries in Johnsonville, South Carolina or to International Paper Company or Georgetown Steel in Georgetown, South Carolina. Williamsburg County runs bus service for workers who commute to nearby Myrtle Beach, which offers jobs in the hospitality industry and construction. Hemingway has always been associated with Johnsonville, which, though divided by a county line, is only 4 miles north, and are sometimes referred to locally as the twin cities. Hemingway recently completed a new industrial park midway between the two cities, with a deep well and sewer service.
