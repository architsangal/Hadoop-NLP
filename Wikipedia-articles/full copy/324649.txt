Mosley was the frontman of the band Faith No More for their first two albums, We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself. [ History ] Mosley was born in Hollywood, California in January 1958, but raised in South Central Los Angeles and Venice. He was adopted at a very early age, as talked about in the Faith No More biography book. Chuck first met Billy Gould in 1977, going to a The Zeros, Johnny Navotnee and The Bags show. He then went on to play keyboards in Billy&apos;s first band, The Animated, in 1979. In 1984 he joined Haircuts That Kill, a post-punk band from the San Francisco area, which lasted up until Mosely&apos;s joining of Faith No More. He joined Faith No More in 1985 replacing Courtney Love ( Hole ) who had a brief stint as lead singer. Chuck parted ways with FNM in 1988 for a number of reasons, including creative differences with his band members and rumors of substance abuse. His departure made quite a stir, when he sued the band for publishing rights, in an attempt to clear his name of the accusations of substance abuse. In 1990 Mosley began a stint as lead singer in revered hardcore punk band Bad Brains. He performed at nearly sixty shows in the United States and Europe before leaving the band in January 1992. Mosley immediately went on to form a new band, Cement. They released two albums: Cement and Man with the Action Hair. Both albums were distributed by Dutch East India Trading (United States) and Rough Trade (Europe). The band toured both locations promoting their music. During the first week of what was to be a year-long tour for Man with the Action Hair, the band’s driver fell asleep at the wheel causing a major accident. Chuck spent a year recovering from a broken back, the tour was canceled, and the album was, subsequently, shelved. Mosley relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in March 1996. He has spent the last several years writing and compiling new material while raising his two daughters Sophie and Erica, and working as a chef in various restaurants. Throughout his apparent hiatus, Chuck has continued to be cited as a major influence by prevalent groups such as Korn, Disturbed, Limp Bizkit, and others. He was featured in Billboard Magazine in spite of the fact that he has not released a record in several years. He then announced the album title ( &quot; Will Rap Over Hard Rock For Food &quot; ) and that it would be released under the name of &quot; V.U.A. (Vanduls Ugainst Alliteracy) &quot;. The band name was later extended to include Chucks name. His original recording of “We Care a Lot” remains as popular and relevant as ever [ December 2009 ]. It has been featured as the theme song for the Discovery Channel show Dirty Jobs as well as in the major motion pictures Grosse Pointe Blank and Bio-Dome. He retains an extremely loyal “cult” following amongst fans, both in the United States and overseas [ December 2009 ]. Chuck recently teamed up with multi-platinum award winning producer/engineer Michael Seifert and inked a production deal for a new full-length album which is currently in production at Ante Up Audio, a multi-suite recording complex in Cleveland, Ohio. A supplemental documentary chronicling the making of the new record is also in the works. Chuck&apos;s new LP &quot; Will Rap Over Hard Rock For Food &quot; was released on August 11 { 2.

On April 14, 2010, Mosley made a surprise appearance on stage at a Faith No More concert in San Francisco. This marks the first time since 1988 that he has performed with the band. Chuck performed the songs &quot; As the Worm Turns &quot;, &quot; Death March &quot;, &quot; We Care A Lot &quot;, and &quot; Mark Bowen &quot; on his own with the band, and was joined by Mike Patton during the final encore to perform a duet on &quot; Introduce Yourself &quot; [ Discography ] [ Haircuts That Kill ] [ Faith No More ] We Care a Lot (1985) Introduce Yourself (1987) [ Cement ] Cement (1993) Man with the Action Hair (1994) [ Solo ] Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food (2009) [ References ] [ External links ] Chuck Mosley on Myspace Haircuts That Kill on Myspace Chuck Mosley Interview on Billboard.com [ Mosley, Chuck 1958-01-27 Hollywood, California, United States ] Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:American male singers Category:American heavy metal singers Category:American rock singers Category:Musicians from California Category:Faith No More members Category:African American rock musicians Category:Bad Brains members es:Chuck Mosley fr:Chuck Mosley it:Chuck Mosley he:צ&apos;אק מוזלי pt:Chuck Mosley
