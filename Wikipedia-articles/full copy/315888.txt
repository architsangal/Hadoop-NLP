A string figure is a design formed by manipulating string on, around, and using one&apos;s finger s or sometimes between the fingers of multiple people. String figures may also involve the use of the mouth, wrist, and feet. They may consist of singular images or be created and altered as a game, known as a string game, or as part of a story involving various figures made in sequence. String figures have also been used for divination, such as to predict the sex of an unborn child. [ Foster Jr. George M. String-Figure Divination American Anthropologist, New Series 43 1 126–127 1941 10.1525/aa.1941.43.1.02a00300 ] The most popular and well-known string game appears to be cat&apos;s cradle. String figures, which are well distributed throughout the world, [ http://www.stringfigure.com/ The Ancient Art of Hawaiian String Figures Lois &amp; Earl W. Stokes Web of Life International, a project of Aloha International ] include &quot; Jacob&apos;s Ladder &quot; ( &quot; Osage Diamonds &quot;, &quot; Fishnet &quot; ), &quot; Cup and Saucer &quot; ( &quot; Sake Glass &quot;, &quot; Coffee Cup &quot; ), and &quot; Tree Hole &quot; { Elffers, Joost and Schuyt, Michael (1978/1979).

[ History ] According to Camilla Gryski, a Canadian librarian and author of numerous string figure books, &quot; We don&apos;t know when people first started playing with string, or which primitive people invented this ancient art. We do know that all primitive societies had and used string—for hunting, fishing, and weaving—and that string figures have been collected from native peoples all over the world. &quot; &quot; Of the games people play, string figures enjoy the reputation of being the most widespread form of amusement in the world: more cultures are familiar with string figures than with any other game. Over 2,000 individual patterns have been recorded worldwide since 1888, when anthropologist Franz Boas first described a pair of Eskimo string figures (Boas 1888a, 1888b, Abraham 1988:12). &quot; { Averkieva, Julia P. and } { Sherman, Mark A. (1992). &quot; Introduction by Mark A. Sherman &quot;, Kwakiutl String Figures, p.xiii. University of British Columbia.

The Daring Book for Girls, p.277. ISBN 978-0-06-147257-2. } { Wallace, Alfred (1872). The Malay Archipelago, Volume 1, p.89. Macmillan. } The anthropologist Louis Leakey has also attributed string figure knowledge with saving his life { Morell, Virginia (1996). Ancestral Passions, p.33. ISBN 978-0-684-82470-3. } and described his use of this game in the early 1900s to obtain the cooperation of Sub-Saharan African tribe s otherwise unfamiliar with, and suspicious of, Europeans, having been told by his teacher A.C. Haddon, &quot; You can travel anywhere with a smile and a piece of string. &quot; The Greek physician Heraklas produced the earliest known written description of a string figure in his first century monograph on surgical knots and slings. [ Miller Lawrence G. The Earliest (?) Description of a String Figure American Anthropologist, New Series 47 3 461–462 1945 10.1525/aa.1945.47.3.02a00190 ] [ http://www.isfa.org/sfmv6n2.htm ISFA Plinthios Brokhos String Figure Magazine 6 2 3–4 International String Figure Association June 2001 2008-08-13 ] This work was preserved by republication in Oribasius &apos; fourth century Medical Collections. The figure is described as a sling to set and bind a broken jaw, with the chin being placed in the center of the figure and the four loops tied near the top of the head. Called the &quot; Plinthios Brokhos &quot;, the resulting figure has been identified by multiple sources as the figure known to Aboriginal Australians as &quot; The Sun Clouded Over &quot;. [ Day Cyrus L. Quipus and Witches&apos; Knots University of Kansas Press 1967 Lawrence, Kansas 86–89, 124–126 ] The Inuit are purported to possess a string figure representing the extinct Wooly Mammoth. { T. T. Paterson (1949), &quot; Eskimo String Figures and Their Origin, &quot; Acta Arctica 3:1-98. } String figures were widely studied by anthropologist s like James Hornell [ A Tribute to James Hornell (1865-1949) Bulletin of the International String Figure Association 7 2000 Heppell David Sherman Mark 1–56 ] from the 1880s through around 1900, as they were used in attempts to trace the origin and developments of cultures. String figures, once thought to have proven monogenesis, appear to have arisen independently as an entertainment pastime in many societies. Many figures were collected and described from south-east Asia, Japan, South America, West Indies, Pacific Islander s, Inuit and other Native Americans. { Gryski, Camilla (1983). Cat&apos;s Cradle, Owl&apos;s Eyes: A Book of String Games, p.4. ISBN 0-688-03941-3. } Figures have also been collected in Europe and Africa. One of the major works on the subject is String Figures and How to Make Them ( ), by Caroline Furness Jayne. The International String Figure Association (ISFA) was formed in 1978 with the primary goal of gathering, preserving, and distributing string figure knowledge so that future generations will continue to enjoy this ancient pastime. [ http://www.isfa.org/isfa2.htm 1999-06-26 2008-12-09 About ISFA ] [ Terms ] In string figure literature there are many phrases often used, however there may be some variation with the fingers, loops, and strings indicated in different ways. A loop is the strings that go around the back of a finger, multiple fingers, or another body part such as the wrist. Some authors name the strings, fingers and their loops (near middle finger string, right index finger, pinky loop, for example), while others number them (3n, R1, 5 loop). One of the first methods of recording figures and sets of terminology was &quot; A Method of Recording String Figures and Tricks &quot; by W. H. R. Rivers and A. C. Haddon. { &quot; A Method of Recording String Figures and Tricks &quot;. W. H. R. Rivers; A. C. Haddon. Man, Vol. 2. (1902), pp. 146-153. Man is currently published by Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. } Below are some common moves, openings, and extensions. Murray Opening/Index Opening: Grasp the loop with your middle, ring, and little fingers so that there is a couple inches of string between them. Put these fingers together so there is a circle made by the overlapping strings. Insert your index finger from your far side into the circle, then rotate the index finger upwards, circling towards you. Position 1: Put the untwisted loop on your thumb and little fingers. Opening A and Japanese Opening: To do Opening A, first do Position 1. Then make the right index finger pick up the string on the left hand going between the thumb and the little finger. Finally, make the left index finger go between both strings of right index finger, and pick up the string going from the right thumb to little finger. The Japanese Opening is almost the same except you pick up the strings with your middle fingers, not index fingers. { Extensions } Caroline Extension: Starting with a loop on the thumb, lift the string in the nook of the index finger, then pinch it between the index finger and thumb. This requires a lot of practice to do properly, so don&apos;t get discouraged if you fail at first. { Moves } Pick up Navajo leap or &quot; navajoing &quot; : Given two loops on one finger, move the lower loop over the upper loop and release it from the finger.
