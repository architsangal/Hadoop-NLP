It is unique in the world as a national, federal, provincial and municipal policing body. The RCMP provides policing services to all of Canada at a federal level, and also on a contract basis to the three territories, eight of Canada&apos;s provinces (the RCMP does not provide provincial or municipal policing in either Ontario or Quebec), more than 190 municipalities, 184 aboriginal communities, and three international airports. [ http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/index-eng.htm About the RCMP Rcmp-grc.gc.ca March 30, 2009 May 22, 2010 ] RCMP in everyday uniform The RCMP was formed in 1920 by the merger of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP, founded 1873) with the Dominion Police (founded 1868). The former was originally named the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), and was given the Royal prefix by King Edward VII in 1904. Much of the present-day organization&apos;s symbolism has been inherited from its days as the NWMP, including the distinctive Red Serge uniform, paramilitary heritage, and mythos as a frontier force. The RCMP/GRC wording is specifically protected under the Trade-marks Act. [ http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/T-13/bo-ga%3As_1%3A%3Abo-ga%3As_2?page%3D2 Trade-marks Act Laws.justice.gc.ca May 18, 2010 May 22, 2010 ] [ March 2012 ] As the national police force of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is primarily responsible for enforcing federal laws throughout Canada, while general law and order including the enforcement of the Criminal Code and applicable provincial legislation is constitutionally the responsibility of the provinces and territories. This responsibility is sometimes further delegated to municipalities which can form their own municipal police departments. This is common in the largest cities. The two most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, maintain their own provincial forces; the Ontario Provincial Police and Sûreté du Québec. The other eight provinces, however, have chosen to contract most or all of their provincial policing responsibilities to the RCMP. Under these contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing in those provinces under the direction of the provincial governments in regard to provincial and municipal law enforcement. When Newfoundland joined the confederation in 1949, the RCMP entered the province and absorbed the then Newfoundland Ranger Force and took over responsibilities in that area. Today the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary has reclaimed some of that province to their jurisdiction. In the three territories, the RCMP serves as the sole territorial police force. Additionally, many municipalities throughout Canada contract the RCMP to serve as their police force. The RCMP consequently provides policing services at the federal, provincial and municipal level. The RCMP is responsible for an unusually large breadth of duties. Under their federal mandate, the RCMP provides policing throughout Canada, including Ontario and Quebec (albeit under smaller scales there). Federal operations include: enforcing federal laws including commercial crime, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, border integrity, organized crime and other related matters; providing counter-terrorism and domestic security; providing protection services for the Monarch, Governor General, Prime Minister, their families and residences, and other ministers of the Crown, visiting dignitaries, and diplomatic missions; and participating in various international policing efforts. Under provincial and municipal contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing in all areas outside of Ontario and Quebec that do not have an established local police force. There are detachments located in small villages in the far north, remote First Nations reserves, and rural towns, but also larger cities such as Surrey, British Columbia (population 394,976). In these provinces the RCMP maintains units that provide investigational support to their own detachments, as well as smaller municipal police forces, including the investigation of major crimes such as homicides, forensic identification services, police dog services, emergency response teams, explosives disposal, undercover operations, and others. Under its National Police Services branch the RCMP provides support to all police forces in Canada through the operation of support services such as the Canadian Police Information Centre, the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, Forensic Science and Identification Services, the Canadian Firearms Program and the Canadian Police College. The RCMP Security Service was a specialized political intelligence and counterintelligence branch with national security responsibilities, but was replaced with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in 1984, following revelations of illegal covert operation s relating to the Quebec separatist movement. { &quot; Inquiry Into Certain Activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Royal Commission of, &quot; Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved August 26, 2007. } CSIS is not part of the RCMP, but is its own entity. [ History ] [ Founding and early history ] [ North-West Mounted Police#history ] Prime Minister Sir John A. MacDonald first began planning a permanent force to patrol the Northwest Territory after the Dominion of Canada purchased the territory from the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company. Reports from Army officers surveying the territory led to the recommendation that a mounted force of between 100 to 150 mounted riflemen could maintain law and order. The Prime Minister first announced the force as the North West Mounted Rifles but concern from the United States of America fearing a military build up led the Prime Minister to rename the force the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) when formed in 1873. { p.52 Sendzikas, Aldona Stanley Barracks: Toronto&apos;s Military Legacy Dundurn Press Ltd., 01/01/2011 } The force was merged with the Dominion Police in 1920 and was renamed as the &quot; Royal Canadian Mounted Police &quot;. The new organization was charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories, and immediately set about establishing its modern role as protector of Canadian national security, as well as assuming responsibility for national counterintelligence. As part of its national security and intelligence functions, the RCMP was responsible for infiltrating any ethnic or political groups that were considered to be dangerous to Canada&apos;s existing order. This included the Communist Party of Canada, but also a variety of minority cultural and nationalist groups. The force was also deeply involved in immigration matters, and especially deportations of suspected radicals. They were especially concerned with Ukrainian groups, both nationalist and socialist. { Hewitt, Steve. &quot; Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period &quot;, The Prairie West as Promised Land ed.

Historians estimate that fully two per cent of the Chinese community was deported between 1923 and 1932, largely under the provisions of the Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act (ONDA). { Hewitt, 322 } Besides the RCMP&apos;s new responsibilities in intelligence, drugs enforcement, and immigration, the force also provided assistance to numerous other federal agencies, such as enforcing the residential school system for Aboriginal children. In 1935, the RCMP, collaborating with the Regina Police Service, crushed the On-to-Ottawa Trek by sparking the Regina Riot, in which one city police officer and one protester were killed. The Trek, which had been organized to call attention to the abysmal conditions in the relief camps, therefore failed to reach Ottawa, but nevertheless had profound political reverberations. RCMP patrolling with sled dogs, 1957. Not pictured, sled. The RCMP employed special constable s to assist with strikebreaking in the interwar period. For a brief period in the late 1930s, a volunteer militia group, the Legion of Frontiersmen were affiliated with the RCMP. Many members of the RCMP belonged to this organization, which was prepared to serve as an auxiliary force. In later years, special constables performed duties such as policing airports and, in certain Canadian provinces, the court houses. In 1932, men and vessels of the Preventive Service, National Revenue, were absorbed, creating the RCMP Marine Section. The acquisition of the RCMP schooner St. Roch facilitated the first effective patrol of Canada&apos;s Arctic territory. It was the first vessel to navigate the Northwest Passage from west to east (1940–42), the first to navigate the Passage in one season (from Halifax to Vancouver in 1944), the first to sail either way through the Passage in one season, and the first to circumnavigate North America (1950). { Kelly, Nora and William. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police - A Century Of History 1873-1973. (Edmonton, Hurtig Publishers. 1973) pp 199-200. } Counterintelligence work was moved from the RCMP&apos;s Criminal Investigation Department to a specialized intelligence branch, the RCMP Security Service, in 1939. [ Post-war ] { Plymouth Gran Fury RCMP car, 1980s. } April 1, 1949, Newfoundland joined in full confederation with Canada and the Newfoundland Ranger Force amalgamated with the RCMP. Following the 1945 defection of Soviet cipher clerk, Igor Gouzenko and his revelations of espionage, the RCMP Security Service implemented measures to screen out &quot; subversive &quot; elements from the public sector. { Reg Whitaker, &quot; Left-Wing Dissent and the State: Canada in the Cold War Era. &quot; In C.

This led to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP, better known as the &quot; McDonald Commission, &quot; named for the presiding judge, Mr Justice David Cargill McDonald. The Commission recommended that the force&apos;s intelligences duties be removed in favour of the creation of a separate intelligence agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).

In 1993, the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT), were transferred to the Canadian Forces, creating a new unit called Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). JTF2 inherited some equipment and SERT&apos;s former training base near Ottawa. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been involved in training and logistically supporting the Haitian National Police since 1994, a controversial matter in Canada considering allegations of widespread human rights violations on the part of the HNP. Some Canadian activist groups have called for an end to the RCMP training. { RCMP Website and &quot; Haiti Support Hits the Streets &quot; } [ March 2012 ] The RCMP has also provided training overseas in Iraq and other peace-keeping missions. The suspected driver of the reconnaissance vehicle involved in the Khobar Towers bombing fled to Canada where he was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the winter of 1997, and was extradited to the United States. [ Mayerthorpe tragedy ] On March 3, 2005, four RCMP officers were fatally shot during an operation to recover stolen property and investigate a possible marijuana grow-op and serve an arrest warrant just outside of Mayerthrope, Alberta. Shooter James Roszko, 46, then killed himself. It was the single worst multiple killing of RCMP officers since the North-West Rebellion.

An internal investigation resulted in no action being taken against the constable, [ August 2007 ] and, as a result, a public inquest was commissioned. The inquest recommended that the RCMP refrain from carrying out internal investigations with regard to fatal incidents involving the RCMP and the public. [ August 2007 ] [ Spiritwood Incident ] On July 7, 2006, two RCMP officers were shot to death near Mildred, Saskatchewan.

In 2006, the United States Coast Guard &apos;s Ninth District and the RCMP began a program called &quot; Shiprider, &quot; in which 12 Mounties from the RCMP detachment at Windsor and 16 Coast Guard boarding officers from stations in Michigan ride in each other&apos;s vessels. The intent is to allow for seamless enforcement of the international border. { PA1 John Masson, &quot; Territorial Teamwork, &quot; Coast Guard Magazine 2/2006, pp.  26–27 } On December 6, 2006, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli resigned one day after informing the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security that his earlier testimony about the Maher Arar case was inaccurate. The RCMP had improperly given information to the US that resulted in Arar, a Canadian returning to Montreal via the US, being sent to Syria where he was imprisoned for 10 months and tortured into signing a false confession of links to terrorists. [ August 2007 ] Earlier, on September 28, 2006, and before the same Commons committee, Commissioner Zaccardelli had issued a carefully worded public apology to Arar and his family: [ http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/28/zaccardelli-appearance.html RCMP chief apologizes to Arar for &apos;terrible injustices&apos; Cbc.ca September 28, 2006 May 22, 2010 ] On January 26, 2007, after months of negotiations between the Canadian government and Arar&apos;s Canadian legal counsel, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology &quot; for any role Canadian officials may have played in what happened to Mr. Arar, Monia Mazigh and their family in 2002 and 2003 &quot; [ August 2007 ] and announced that Arar would receive $10.5 million settlement for his ordeal and an additional $1 million for legal costs. [ Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar ] On October 6, 2007, Constable Christopher John Worden of Hay River Detachment, Northwest Territories was shot and killed in Hay River while on duty in that community. A nationwide arrest warrant was issued for Emrah Bulatci. Bulatci was apprehended on October 12 in Edmonton, Alberta. On October 14, 2007, Robert Dziekański, an emigrant from Poland, died at Vancouver International Airport. Dziekański had failed to clear Customs and after eight hours of loitering became agitated, perhaps because he spoke no English and therefore was unable to ask for assistance. Four RCMP officers were summoned after he threw a computer and a small table. During his arrest, he was Taser ed at least twice within 25 seconds of the officers&apos; arrival. After dropping to the floor, he was held down and handcuffed by the officers. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. The incident was videotaped and eventually released to the public, resulting in outrage over the RCMP&apos;s handling of the unarmed man. The Dziekanski confrontation has provoked considerable debate about the use of Tasers in policing. On November 6, 2007, Constable Doug Scott, 20, was killed in Kimmirut, Nunavut when responding to a report of a possible impaired driver. He had been with the service for only six months.

Review Order is worn by the mounted troop performing the Musical Ride, an equestrian drill in which mounted members demonstrate their riding skills and handling of the cavalry lance. On normal duties, the RCMP uses standard police methods, equipment, and uniforms. Horses are still used for such ceremonial operations as escorting the Governor General&apos;s open landau to the Opening of Parliament. The Red Serge tunic that identified initially the NWMP, and later the RNWMP and RCMP, is of the standard British military pattern. The NWMP was originally kitted out from militia stores, resulting initially in several different styles of tunic, although the style later became standardized. This style was used both to emphasize the British nature of the force and to differentiate it from the blue American military uniforms. The blue shoulder epaulets were added in the 1920s, long after King Edward VII granted the Force &quot; Royal &quot; status for its service in the Second Boer War, replacing gold-trimmed scarlet straps from the earlier uniforms. Currently, RCMP personnel under the rank of inspector wear blue &quot; gorget &quot; patches on the collar, while officers from inspector to commissioner have solid blue collars, along with blue pointed-sleeve cuffs. Reenactors portraying the NWMP K Troop. Initially the NWMP wore buff breeches. Later dark blue breeches with yellow-gold strapping (stripes) were adopted. Members of the NWMP were known to exchange kit with U.S. cavalry units along the border and it is suggested that this was the initial source for the breeches; however, blue breeches were considered early on, although with a white strap. Dark blue with yellow-gold strapping is another British cavalry tradition. The wide, flat-brimmed Stetson hat was not adopted officially until about 1904. Although the NWMP contingent at Queen Victoria &apos;s Diamond Jubilee wore the Stetson, it was an unofficial item of dress. The primary official summer headdress at the time was the white British foreign service helmet, also known as a pith helmet. This was not particularly practical as headdress in the Canadian west, and members wore a Stetson type hat on patrol and around camp. Sam Steele is often credited with introducing the Stetson-type hat, and when he left the force to command Lord Strathcona&apos;s Horse and took the regiment to South Africa he also adopted the Stetson for this unit. For winter a Canadian military fur wedge cap or busby was worn. Black riding boots were later changed to the modern brown style. The original crossbelts were later changed to the brown Sam Browne type currently worn. The brown colour of the boots and belt worn with the Red Serge come from the individual member applying numerous coats of polish, often during their time in training at Depot Division. Sidearms are standard now, but were often not worn in the early years. The everyday uniform consists of a grey shirt with dark blue tie, dark blue trousers with gold strapping, regular patrol boots called &quot; ankle boots, &quot; regular duty equipment, and a regular policeman&apos;s style cap. A blue Gore-Tex open-collar jacket (patrol jacket) is worn by members on operational duty, while a dark blue jacket (blue serge), is worn by sergeant majors and certain non-commissioned officer s (NCOs) usually involved in aspects of recruit training or media relations. Officers wear white shirts and the patrol jacket or blue serge, depending on their duties. Short-sleeved shirts with no tie are worn in the summer by all members. Winter dress consists of a long-sleeved shirt and tie for all members and, depending on the climate of the detachment area, heavier boots, winter coats (storm coats) and a fur cap are worn. In British Columbia the hat features a black bearskin rim belt. In 1990, Baltej Singh Dhillon became the first Sikh officer in the RCMP to be allowed to wear a turban instead of the traditional Stetson. On March 15, the federal government, despite protests, decided that Sikhs would be permitted to wear turbans while on duty as RCMP officers. [ Women in the RCMP ] { Calgary Stampede } RCMP female officer On May 23, 1974, RCMP Commissioner Maurice Nadon announced that the RCMP would begin to accept applications from females as regular members of the force. This opened up positions that had been previously reserved for male members. Troop 17 was the first group of 32 females who arrived at Depot in Regina on September 18 and 19, 1974, to begin training to become regular members. This first all-female troop graduated from Depot on March 3, 1975. After an initial period of being required to wear rather unflattering discrete female rig, women officers were ultimately given standard RCMP uniforms and all officers are now identically attired regardless of gender, with two exceptions. The ceremonial dress uniform, or &quot; walking-out order &quot;, for female members currently consists of a long, blue skirt and footwear with a higher heel that slips on, commonly known as pumps. Female officers are also attired with a small black clutch purse when walking-out order is called for. The second exception in uniform is the official maternity uniform, worn when pregnant female officers are assigned to administrative duties. In 1981 the first female was promoted to corporal and the first females served on the musical ride; in 1987 the first female served in a foreign post; in 1990 the first female was appointed detachment commander; in 1992 the first female officers were commissioned and in 1998 the first female Assistant Commissioner was appointed. From December 15, 2006, to July 2007, Beverley Busson served as interim Commissioner of the RCMP, making her the first woman to hold the top position in the force. She was replaced by William J. S.

[ Service in wartime ] During the Second Boer War, members of the North-West Mounted Police were given leaves of absence to fight with the 2nd Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles (CMR) and Lord Strathcona&apos;s Horse. The force raised the Canadian Mounted Rifles, mostly from NWMP members, for service in South Africa. For the CMR&apos;s distinguished service there, King Edward VII honoured the NWMP by changing the name to the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) on June 24, 1904. During the First World War, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP) conducted border patrols, surveillance of enemy alien s, and enforcement of national security regulations within Canada. However, RNWMP officers also served overseas. On August 6, 1914, a squadron of volunteers from the RNWMP was formed to serve with the Canadian Light Horse in France. In 1918, two more squadrons were raised, A Squadron for service in France and Flanders and B Squadron for service in the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force In 1939, No. 1 Provost Company (RCMP), Canadian Provost Corps, was raised for service in Europe and served throughout the Second World War as Military Police.

They are the police officers of the RCMP and are responsible for investigating crime and have the authority to make arrests. RMs operate in over 750 detachments, including 200 municipalities and more than 600 Aboriginal communities. RMs are normally assigned to general policing duties at an RCMP detachment for a minimum of three years. These duties allow them to experience a broad range of assignments and experiences, such as responding to alarms, foot patrol, bicycle patrol, traffic enforcement, collecting evidence at crime scenes, testifying in court, apprehending criminals and plain clothes duties. Regular members also serve in over 150 different types of operational and administrative opportunities available within the RCMP, these include: major crime investigations, emergency response, forensic identification, international peacekeeping, bike or marine patrol, explosives disposal and police dog services. Also included are administrative roles including human resources, corporate planning, policy analysis and public affairs. [ Auxiliary constables and other staff ] Besides the regular RCMP officers, several types of designations exist which give them assorted powers and responsibilities over policing issues. Currently, there are: Auxiliary constables: 2,400+ Community safety officers: 16 Reserve constables : not reported Special constables: 78 Civilian members: 3,760 Public servants: 6,194 Auxiliary constables (A/Cst.) Volunteers within their own community, appointed under provincial police acts. Auxiliary Constable Program They are not police officers and can not identify themselves as such. However, they are given peace officer powers when on duty with a regular member (RM). Their duties consist mainly of assisting the RM in routine events, for example cordoning off crime scene areas, crowd control, participating in community policing, assistance during situations where regular members might be overwhelmed with their duties (e.g., keep watch of a backseat detainee while RM interviews a victim). They are identified by the wording of &quot; RCMP Auxiliary &quot; on cars, jackets and shoulder flashes.

Community safety officers are paid, unarmed RCMP staff members with similar RCMP uniform but distinct shoulder badges with baton and pepper spray. Community Safety Officers Enhanced Policing Options—Community Safety Officers CSOs work with regular members in five areas: community safety; crime prevention; traffic support; community policing and investigation support.

A program reinstated in 2004 in British Columbia to allow for retired, regular RCMP members or other provincially trained officers to provide extra manpower when a shortage is identified. R/Cst. are appointed under Section 11 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act as paid part-time, armed officers with the same powers as regular members. Local officer named first female reserve constable However, they are not allowed to carry force-issued sidearms and use of force options unless they are called upon to duty. They generally carry out community policing roles but may also be called upon if an emergency occurs. Retired Mounties back in saddle Special constable s (S/Cst.) Employees of the RCMP, they have varied duties depending on where they are deployed, but are often given this designation because of an expertise they possess which needs to be applied in a certain area. For example, an Aboriginal person might be appointed a special constable in order to assist regular members as they police an Aboriginal community where English is not well understood, and where the special constable speaks the language well. From the early years of policing in northern Canada, and well into the 1950s, local aboriginal people were hired by the RCMP as special constables and were employed as guides and to obtain and care for sled dog teams. Many of these former special constables still reside in the North to this day and are still involved in regimental functions of the RCMP. A row of uniforms Civilian members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police While not delegated the powers of police officers, they are instead hired for their specialized scientific, technological, communications and administrative skills. Since the RCMP is a multi-faceted law enforcement organization with responsibilities for federal, provincial and municipal policing duties, it offers employment opportunities for civilian members as professional partners within Canada&apos;s national police force. Civilian members represent approximately 14% of the total RCMP employee population, and are employed within RCMP establishments in most geographical areas of Canada. The following is a list of the most common categories of employment that may be available to interested and qualified individuals.

They are not police officers, do not wear a uniform, have no police authority and are not bound by the RCMP Act. Municipal Employees Abbreviated as &quot; ME &quot; they are found in RCMP detachments where a contract exists with a municipality to provide front-line policing. MEs are not actually employees of the RCMP, but are instead employed by the local municipality to work in the RCMP detachment. They conduct the same duties that a PSE would and are required to meet the same reliability and security clearance to do so. Many detachment buildings house a combination of municipal and provincially funded detachments, and therefore there are often PSEs and MEs found working together in them. [ Ranks ] The rank system of the RCMP illustrates their origin as a paramilitary force. The insignia were based upon the Canadian Army of the time, which is almost identical to that of the current British Army. Higher ranks have been increased over the years since the formation of the force, whereas the rank of inspector, which was initially a subaltern, is now a field officer level, the lower officer ranks having been dropped. With the military introducing the warrant officer, the RCMP non-commissioned officers were maintained using the older military style. The numbers are current as of September 1, 2011 &apos;&apos;&apos;Rank Structure of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioned officers Commissioner Commissaire 1 Deputy Commissioner Sous-commissaire 9 Assistant Commissioner Commissaire adjoint 25 Chief Superintendent Surintendant principal 51 Superintendent Surintendant 186 Inspector Inspecteur 440 Non-commissioned officers Corps Sergeant Major Sergent-major du corps 1 Sergeant Major Sergent-major 3 Staff Sergeant Major Sergent-major d&apos;état major 16 Staff Sergeant Sergent d&apos;état-major 942 Sergeant Sergent 2,140 Corporal Caporal 3,672 Constable Gendarme 11,717 (no rank badge) The ranks of inspector and higher are commissioned ranks and are appointed by the Governor-in-Council. Depending on the dress, badges are worn on the shoulder as slip-ons, on shoulder boards, or directly on the epaulette s. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers and the insignia continues to be based on British army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers&apos; rank insignia has been embroidered on the epaulette slip-ons. Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. The constables wear no rank insignia. There are also special constables, auxiliary constables, and students who wear identifying insignia. Insignia are as follows: { Rank Insignia - Royal Canadian Mounted Police } Commissioner (crown over bath star over crossed sword and baton) Deputy Commissioner (crown over crossed sword and baton) Assistant Commissioner (crown over three bath stars in a triangular formation) Chief Superintendent (crown over two bath stars) Superintendent (crown over bath star) Inspector (crown) Corps Sergeant Major (coat of arms of Canada) Sergeant Major (crown over four downward-pointing chevrons) Staff Sergeant Major (wreathed crown) Staff Sergeant (four upward-pointing chevrons) Sergeant (crown over three downward-pointing chevrons) Corporal (two downward-pointing chevrons) [ Equipment and vehicles ] [ Land fleet ] An emergency command vehicle in Burnaby, British Columbia RCMP truck at the G20 summit in Toronto RCMP Land Transport Fleet Inventory includes: [ http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/land-terre/index-eng.htm Land Transport Rcmp-grc.gc.ca November 14, 2006 May 22, 2010 ] High-speed catamaran patrol vessels &apos;&apos;Nadon&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Higgitt&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Lindsay&apos;&apos; Cars: 5,600 Trucks: 2,350 Motorcycles: 34 Small snowmobiles: 481 All-terrain vehicles: 181 Gas railway car: 1 Tractors: 27 Buses: 3 Total: 8,677 Many of the following vehicles have been used by the RCMP as marked and unmarked police vehicles: [ January 2012 There are four different types. ] Chevrolet Camaro B4C Chevrolet Caprice Chevrolet Impala Chevrolet Lumina Chevrolet Silverado Chevrolet Suburban Chevrolet Tahoe Chrysler PT Cruiser Dodge Caravan Dodge Diplomat Dodge Durango Dodge Intrepid (Chrysler Intrepid) Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor Ford Escape Ford Econoline Ford Excursion Ford Expedition Ford Explorer Ford Freestar Ford Mustang SSP Ford Super Duty Ford Taurus Ford Windstar GMC Yukon (see Chevrolet Suburban/Tahoe) Honda Civic Jeep Cherokee Plymouth Caravelle Smart Fortwo Toyota Camry Toyota Prius [ Marine craft ] RCMP-CCG vessel &apos;&apos;Simmonds&apos;&apos; with CCGS &apos;&apos;Cape Hurd&apos;&apos; The RCMP is responsible for policing in Canadian Internal Waters, including the territorial sea and contiguous zone as well as the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway; such operations are provided by the RCMP&apos;s Federal Services Directorate and includes enforcing Canada&apos;s environment, fisheries, customs and immigration laws. In provinces and municipalities where the RCMP performs contract policing, the force is also responsible for policing on freshwater lakes and rivers. To meet these challenges, the RCMP operates what is known as the Marine Division, with five Robert Allan Ltd. –designed high-speed catamaran patrol vessels; Inkster and the Commissioner-class Nadon, Higgitt, Lindsay and Simmonds, based on all three coasts and manned by officers specially trained in maritime enforcement.

The Mounties have been immortalized as symbols of Canadian culture in numerous Hollywood Northwestern movies and television series, which often feature the image of the Mountie as square-jawed, stoic and polite, yet with a steely determination and physical toughness that sometimes appears superhuman. Coupled with the adage that the Mountie &quot; always gets his man, &quot; the image projects them as fearsome, incorruptible, dogged yet gentle champions of the law. The RCMP&apos;s motto is actually Maintiens le droit, French for &quot; Defending the Law &quot;; it accidentally also means &quot; Keep Right, &quot; describing the rule of the road in Canada (which is one of the few Commonwealth realm s to drive on the right-hand side).

Mounties fiction became a popular genre in both pulp magazine s and book form. Among the best-selling authors who specialized in tales of the Mounted Police were James Oliver Curwood, Laurie York Erskine, James B Hendryx, T Lund, Harwood Steele (the son of Sam Steele) and William Byron Mowery. In other media, a famous example is the radio and television series, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Dudley Do-Right (of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show ) is a 1960s example of the comic aspect of the Mountie myth, as is Klondike Kat, from Total Television. The Broadway musical and Hollywood movie Rose-Marie is a 1930s example of its romantic side. A successful combination were a series of Renfrew of the Royal Mounted boy&apos;s adventure novels written by Laurie York Erskine beginning in 1922 running to 1941. In the 1930s Erskine narrated a Sgt Renfrew of the Mounties radio show and a series of films with actor-singer James Newill playing Renfrew were released between 1937 and 1940. In 1953 portions of the films were mixed with new sequences of Newill for a Renfrew of the Mounted television series. A former Mounted Police corporal (1919–1923), Bruce Carruthers, served as an unofficial technical advisor to Hollywood in many films with RCMP characters. { Barr, William Red Serge and Polar Bear Pants &quot; The Biography of Harry Stallworthy, RCMP University of Alberta Press 2004 } [ Modern culture ] In 1959, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired R.C.M.P., a half hour dramatic series about an R.C.M.P. detachment keeping the peace and fighting crime. Filmed in black and white, in and around Ottawa by Crawley Films, the series was co-produced with the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and ran for 39 episodes. It was noted for its pairing of Québécois and Anglo officers. Canadians also poke fun at the RCMP with Sergeant Renfrew and his faithful dog Cuddles in various sketches produced by the Royal Canadian Air Farce comedy troupe. On That &apos;70s Show Mounties were played by SCTV alumni Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas. The British have also exploited the myth: the BBC television series Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus featured a group of Mounties singing the chorus in The Lumberjack Song in the lumberjack sketch. { Iqaluit, } { Canada Day, 1999. } The 1972–90 CBC series The Beachcombers featured a character named Constable John Constable who attempted to enforce the law in the town of Gibsons, British Columbia. In comic books, the Marvel Comics characters of Alpha Flight were described on several occasions as &quot; RCMP auxiliaries, &quot; and two of their members, Snowbird and the second Major Mapleleaf were depicted as serving members of the force. In the latter case, due to trademark issues, Major Mapleleaf was described as a &quot; Royal Canadian Mountie &quot; in the opening roll call pages of each issue of Alpha Flight he appeared in. Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin starred in the 1981 movie Death Hunt that fictionalized the RCMP pursuit of Albert Johnson. In the early 1990s, Canadian professional wrestler Jacques Rougeau utilized the gimmick of &quot; The Mountie &quot; while wrestling for the WWF. He typically wore the Red Serge to the ring, and carried a shock stick as an illegal weapon. As his character was portrayed as an evil Mountie, the RCMP ultimately won an injunction preventing Rougeau from wrestling as this character in Canada, though he was not prevented from doing so outside the country. He briefly held the Intercontinental Championship in 1992. The 1998 swan song of Nick Berry &apos;s time on UK drama Heartbeat featured his character, Sergeant Nick Rowan, transferring to Canada and taking the rank of constable in the Mounties. The special telemovie was titled Heartbeat: Changing Places. In the 1994–98 TV series Due South paired a Mountie, (and his deaf half-wolf) with a streetwise American detective cleaning up the streets of Chicago, mainly deriving its entertainment from the perceived differences in attitude between these two countries&apos; police forces. A pair of Mounties staffed the RCMP Detachment in the fictional town of Lynx River, Northwest Territories, in the CBC series North of 60. The series, which aired from 1992 to 1998, was about events in the native community, but the Mounties featured prominently in each episode. Another TV series from 1990s, Bordertown featured a NWMP corporal paired with a U.S. marshal securing law and order on a frontier U.S.-Canadian bordertown. In the ABC TV mini-series Answered by Fire, at least three mounties are featured. The 1987 Brian De Palma film The Untouchables featured cooperation between the Treasury Department task force, led by Eliot Ness, and the Mounties against liquor smuggling across the American-Canadian border. [ Mountie merchandise ] There are products and merchandise that are made in the image of the RCMP, like Mounties statues or hats. Before 1995, the RCMP had little control over these products. The RCMP Heritage Centre is a multi-million dollar museum designed by Arthur Erickson that opened May 2007 in Regina, Saskatchewan at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division. It replaced the old RCMP museum and is designed to celebrate the role of the force in Canada&apos;s history. [ Trademark ] The Royal Canadian Mounted Police received an international license on April 1, 1995 requiring those who use the RCMP to pay a licensing fee. Proceeds from the fees would be used for community awareness programmes.

Through a Master Licensing Agreement (MLA) with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the RCMP Foundation is responsible for managing the commercial use of the RCMP name, { Royal Canadian Mounted Police, &quot; &quot;, Retrieved July 28, 2011 } image and protected marks. The Foundation issues selected companies a royalty-based agreement allowing them to produce and market high quality official RCMP merchandise. Walt Disney Co. (Canada) Ltd. was contracted to aid in the initial set up of the Licensing Program { CBC Digital Archives &quot; &quot;, Retrieved July 28, 2011 } but contrary to popular belief, Disney never owned or controlled any of the RCMP&apos;s protected marks. Following expiration of the Disney contract in 2000, all responsibilities and activities were taken over by the then Executive Director and his staff, reporting to the Foundation President and Board of Directors.
