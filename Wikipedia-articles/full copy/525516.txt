[ a neighborhood in the United States the Mission District in Canada Mission, Calgary ] [ October 2011 ] [ http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Mission-District-San-Francisco-CA.html Mission District (The Mission) neighborhood in San Francisco, California (CA), 94103, 94110 subdivision profile April 11, 2010 ] { 1.865 } { 2008 } { 47234 } { 25329 } { 37.76001 } { -122.41482 } { ZIP Code } { 94103, 94110 } { 415 } The Mission District, also commonly called &quot; The Mission &quot;, is a neighborhood in San Francisco, California, USA, originally known as &quot; the Mission lands &quot; { Daily Alta California newspaper, Oct 7, 1854, page 1 column 4 } meaning the lands belonging to the sixth Alta California mission, Mission San Francisco de Asis. This mission, San Francisco&apos;s oldest standing building, is located in the neighborhood. [ Location and climate ] Aerial view of Mission District. The principal thoroughfare of the Mission District of San Francisco is Mission Street. Its borders are U.S. Route 101 to the east which forms the boundary between the eastern portion of the district, known as &quot; Inner Mission &quot; and its eastern neighbor, Potrero Hill, while Sanchez Street separates the neighborhoods from Eureka Valley (also known as &quot; The Castro &quot; ) and Noe Valley to the west. The part of the neighborhood from Valencia Street to Sanchez Street, north of 20th, is known as Mission Dolores. South of 20th towards 22nd, and between Valencia and Dolores Streets is a distinct sub-neighborhood known as Liberty Hill. { Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association } Cesar Chavez Street (formerly Army Street) is the southern border which lies next to Bernal Heights, while to the north the neighborhood is separated from South of Market roughly by Duboce Avenue and the elevated highway of the Central Freeway which runs above 13th Street. Also along Mission Street, further south-central are the Excelsior and Crocker-Amazon neighborhoods, sometimes referred to as the &quot; Outer Mission &quot; (not to be confused with the actual Outer Mission neighborhood ). The Mission District is part of San Francisco&apos;s supervisorial districts 6, 9 and 10. The microclimate s of San Francisco create a system by which each neighborhood can have radically different weather at any given time. The Mission&apos;s geographical location insulates it from the fog and wind from the west. As a result, the Mission has a tendency to be warmer and sunnier than the rest of the city. This climatic phenomenon becomes apparent to visitors who walk downhill from 24th Street in the west from Noe Valley (where clouds from Twin Peaks in the west tend to accumulate on foggy days) towards Mission Street in the east, partly because Noe Valley is on higher ground whereas the Inner Mission is at a lower elevation.

Spanish missionaries arrived in the area during the late 18th century. They found these people living in two villages on Mission Creek. It was here that a Spanish priest named Father Francisco Palóu founded Mission San Francisco de Asis on June 29, 1776. The Mission was moved from the shore of Laguna Dolores to its current location in 1783.

[ Carl Nolte Centuries-old murals revealed in Mission Dolores Indians&apos; hidden paintings open window into S.F.&apos;s sacred past http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file%3D%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F01%2F29%2FMNGC74KEA71.DTL San Francisco Chronicle A-1 January 29, 2004 November 27, 2006 ] This period marked the beginning of the end of the Yelamu culture. The Indian population at Mission Dolores dropped from 400 to 50 between 1833 and 1841. Ranchos owned by Spanish-Mexican families such as the Valenciano, Guerrero, Dolores, Bernal, Noé and De Haro continued in the area, separated from the town of Yerba Buena, later renamed San Francisco (centered around Portsmouth Square ) by a two mile wooden plank road (later paved and renamed Mission Street). The lands around the nearly abandoned mission church became a focal point of raffish attractions { VIA magazine, April 2003 } including bull and bear fighting, horse racing, baseball and dueling. A famous beer parlor resort known as The Willows was located along Mission Creek just south of 18th Street between Mission Street and San Carlos Street. { BurritoJustice, March 3, 2010 } From 1865 to 1891 a large conservatory and zoo known as Woodward&apos;s Gardens was located along the west side of Mission Street between 13th and 15th Streets. { SF History Encyclopedia } In the decades after the Gold Rush, the town of San Francisco quickly expanded, and the Mission lands were developed and subdivided into housing plots for working class immigrants, largely German, Irish and Italian, and also for industrial uses. [ Professional Baseball ] As the city grew in the decades following the Gold Rush, the Mission District became home to the first professional baseball stadium in California, opened in 1868 and known as Recreation Grounds seating 17,000 people which was located at Folsom and 25th Streets, a portion of the grounds remain as present day Garfield Square. { “The Mission Has Always Been The Home of Baseball” February 17, 2010, BurritoJustice.com } Also, in the 20th century, the Mission District was home to two other baseball stadiums, Recreation Park located at 14th and Valencia and Seals Stadium located at 16th and Bryant with both these stadiums being used by the baseball team named after the Mission District known as the Mission Reds and the San Francisco Seals. [ Ethnicity trends ] During European settlement of the City in the 19th and 20th century, large numbers of Irish and German immigrant workers moved into the area. Development and settlement intensified after the 1906 earthquake, as many displaced businesses and residents moved into the area, making Mission Street a major commercial thoroughfare. In 1926, the Polish Community of San Francisco converted a church on 22nd Street and Shotwell Street and opened its doors as the Polish Club of San Francisco, referred to today as the &quot; Dom Polski &quot;, or Polish Home. The Irish American community made their mark during this time, with notable people like etymologist Peter Tamony calling the Mission home. During the 1940-1960s, large numbers of Mexican immigrants moved into the area, initiating white flight, giving the Mission the Latin character it is known for today. During the 1980s and into the 1990s, the neighborhood received a higher influx of immigrants and refugees from Central and South America fleeing civil wars and political instability at the time. These immigrants brought in many Central American banks and companies which would set up branches, offices, and regional headquarters on Mission Street. [ Recent history ] In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Valencia Street corridor had a lively punk night life with several clubs including The Offensive, The Deaf Club and Valencia Tool &amp; Die and the former fire station on 16th Street, called the Compound, sported what was commonly referred to as &quot; the punk mall &quot;, an establishment that catered to punk style and culture. On South Van Ness, Target Video and Damage Magazine were located in a three-story warehouse. The neighborhood was dubbed &quot; the New Bohemia &quot; by the San Francisco Chronicle in 1995. Since at least the 1980s, a wave of gang affiliation appeared in the Mission. Branches of the Sureño and Norteño gangs settled in and engaged in criminal activities and open violence over territorial boundaries in the neighborhood, northwest and southeast respectively.

Although during the late 1990s and into the 2000s gang prevention programs, including a 2007 injunction, { San Francisco City Attorney, 2007 } have attempted to reduce the associated violence from these gangs, these kind of activities still continue to be a persistent problem for the neighborhood, resulting in uncomfortable socio-economic overlaps of a neighborhood in transition. { http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Prison_System/CrimePunish_Pelican.html } { Gangs and Cupcakes, The Atlantic, March 10, 2011 } [ http://articles.sfgate.com/1997-04-18/news/17747254_1_gang-members-gang-slaying-gang-violence Gangs Alarm the Mission / Police and residents take stand against rising tide of violence Glen Martin April 18, 1997 San Francisco Chronicle 12-20-2011 &quot; There are two main gang categories in the Mission. The Surenos (Southerners) wear blue and use the letter M and the number 13 as identifying emblems. The letter -- the 13th in the alphabet -- stands for the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang affiliated with the Surenos. The Nortenos (Northerners) favor red clothes, the letter N -- for Norte, or North -- and 14, reflecting N&apos;s position in the alphabet. &quot; ] Following that decade in the late 1990s and into the 2010s, and especially during the dot-com boom, young urban professionals, to twentysomething s and thirtysomething s living the hipster lifestyle moved into the area, initiating gentrification, and raising rent and housing prices [ Chris Roberts Iconic Mission district transforming into a true melting pot 2011-12-18 http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/12/changing-demographics-make-iconic-mission-melting-pot SF Examiner 2011-12-19 These commingling cultural contrasts are at least part of what makes the Mission one of The City’s most popular and fascinating places. ], with a number of Latino middle-class families as well as artists moving to the Outer Mission area, or out of the city entirely to the suburbs of East Bay and South Bay area. Despite rising rent and housing prices, many Mexican and Central American immigrants continue to reside in the Mission, although the neighborhood&apos;s high rents and home prices have led to the Latino population dropping by 20% over the last decade. { &apos;&apos;Los Angeles Times&apos;&apos;, Sept 21, 2011 } Most recently, the Mission has a reputation of being edgy and artsy. { &apos;&apos;New York Times&apos;&apos;, Sept. 14, 2008 } [ Landmarks and features ] { Alta California mission, } { Mission San Francisco de Asis, the namesake of the neighborhood, and the oldest building in the city located in the far western end of the neighborhood on Dolores Street. } Roxie Theater, 16th Street and Valencia Street { murals and paintings of Latin American culture by local artists are a common feature and attraction } { Day of the Dead celebration, Garfield Square. } { Dolores Park is a popular recreation area } Carnival dancers, 24th Street The large Latino population in the Mission District can be seen highlighted in this thematic map of San Francisco Mission Dolores, the eponymous former mission located the far western border of the neighborhood on Dolores Street, continues to operate as a museum and as a California Historical Landmark, while the newer basilica built and opened next to it in 1913 continues to have an active congregation. Near Mission Dolores, Dolores Park, officially Mission Dolores Park, bounded by Dolores Street, Church Street, 18th Street, and 20th Street, the largest park in the neighborhood, and one of the most popular parks in the city. Across from Dolores Park is Mission High School, built in 1927 in the Mediterranean Revival / Baroque Churrigueresque style. Although gentrification during the 1990s and 2000s shifted the demographics and culture of the neighborhood, to account for a large younger, more White American, the Mission remains the cultural nexus and epicenter of San Francisco&apos;s, and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area&apos;s Latino, Chicano, Nicaraguan Salvadorian and Guatemalan community. While Mexican, Salvadorian, and other Latin American businesses are pervasive throughout the neighborhood, residences are not evenly distributed. Most of the neighborhood&apos;s Hispanic residents live on the eastern and southern sides. The western and northern sides of the neighborhood are more affluent and less diverse. { http://www.sfgate.com/travel/neighborhoods/sf/mission_24thstreet/ sfgate.com } [ Food ] The Mission district is also famous and influential for its restaurants. Dozens of Taquería s are located throughout the neighborhood, showcasing a localized styling of Mexican food and is the original home of the San Francisco burrito. { New York Times, May 11, 2010 } There are also a high concentration of Salvadorean, Guatemalan, Nicaraguan, restaurants there as well as a large number of street food vendors.

A large number of other restaurants are also popular, including: Mission Chinese Food and Foreign Cinema on Mission Street, Delfina on 18th and Alma, the Slated Door and Luna Park on Valencia. { New York Times, May 29, 2011 } { New York Times, Dec. 9, 2001 } [ Art scene ] Due to the existing cultural attractions, less expensive housing and commercial space, and the high density of restaurants and drinking establishments, the Mission is a magnet for young people. An independent arts community also arose and, since the 1990s, the area has been home to the Mission School art movement. Many studios, galleries, performance spaces, and public art projects are located in the Mission, including the Project Artaud, First Exposures, Southern Exposure, Art Explosion Studios, Artist Xchange, Artists&apos; Television Access, and the oldest, alternative, not-for profit art space in the city of San Francisco, Intersection for the Arts. The Roxie Theater, the oldest continuously-operating movie theater in San Francisco, is host to repertory and independent films as well as local film festivals. Poets, musicians, emcees, and other artists sometimes gather on the southwest corner of the 16th &amp; Mission intersection to perform.

The Mission Cultural Center for the Latino Arts, established by Latino artists and activists, is an art space. The local bilingual newspaper, El Tecolote, was founded in 1970. The Mission&apos;s Galería de la Raza, founded by local artists active in el Movimiento (the Chicano civil rights moment), is a nationally recognized arts organization. Late May, the city&apos;s annual Carnaval festival and parade marches down Mission Street. Meant to mimic the festival in Rio de Janeiro, it is held in late May instead of the traditional late February to take advantage of better weather. [ Murals ] Throughout the Mission walls and fences are decorated with mural s initiated by the Chicano Art Mural Movement of the 1970s [ Latorre, Guisela Walls of empowerment: Chicana/o indigenist murals of California University of Texas Press Austin 2008 0-292-71906-X 30–31 ] and inspired by the traditional Mexican paintings made famous by Diego Rivera. Some of the more significant mural installations are located on Balmy Alley, and Clarion Alley.
