Panorama of Minonk from the north during Harvest 2006 [ History ] The founding of Minonk corresponds with the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad. The Illinois Central Railroad main line was completed in 1854, and ran through Section Seven, which eventually became the City of Minonk. The plat of the town was first recorded on November 7, 1854. { Schneider 1981, p. 1 } David Neal, an agent with the Illinois Central Railroad, is credited for naming the city. Local folklore provides varying accounts about the origins of the name “Minonk.” One version states that he originally named the area after a street in Boston, MA, where he owned property. A second story suggests that he changed the name of the settlement, originally referred to as “Marquette” on old French maps, to the Ojibwe word “Minonk,” meaning “a good place.” Minonk is the only city in the world with that name. { Schneider 1981, p. 1 } Early settlers were attracted to Minonk by a variety of livelihoods. Many came to work on the railroad. Others settled in the area to farm on the abundant, rich farmland. However, coal mining was the leading industry in the early years of Minonk. The first coal mines were developed in the 1860s, and at one point employed over 300 men. { Schneider 1981, p. 87 } Two mines operated in Minonk: the first mine was located on the north edge of the city, and the second was situated a half-mile north of town. { Schneider 1981, pg. 87 } The distinctive slag piles resulting from mine residue were referred to as “Jumbos” by local citizens. One slag heap currently remains on Minonk’s northern border. In late 2011, a 75-turbine wind farm, that could deliver $360,000 in fees and permits for Woodford County, will start construction (another part of the project is in neighboring Livingston County, Illinois, with 25 towers). The plot of land was purchased by Navitas Energy Inc. in 2009. In 2010, its application to use the land as a wind farm was approved. After approval, the land was sold to Minonk Wind farm LLC. (NOTE) The Wind Farm Companies do NOT purchase the land. They lease it from the current property owners and pay property taxes for the portion of the property the wind farm utilizes. This is what generates the additional tax money that the county retains. [ Notes ] [ References ] Schneider, Alice Hayes. Tales from the Trees. Minonk, IL: Schneider, 1981.
