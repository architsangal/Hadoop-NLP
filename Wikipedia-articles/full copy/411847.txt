Maxie &quot; Max &quot; Burns (born November 8, 1948) was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2005, representing [ Georgia 12 ]. He was born in Millen, Georgia, was educated at Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University ( Ph.D. ) and served in the United States Army Reserve. He was a professor at Georgia Southern University for 20 years and a visiting professor at a number of international universities located in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden. He served as a member of the Screven County Commission from 1993 to 1998. After representing the 12th District of Georgia Burns was Dean of the Mike Cottrell Business School at North Georgia College &amp; State University in Dahlonega, Georgia. As of January 1st, 2012 Burns is now President of Gordon College (www.gdn.edu) in Barnesville, Georgia. [ 2002 election ] The 12th District was a new district, one of two Georgia gained after the 2000 census. The district was designed as a Democratic stronghold — it was 40% black, and would have voted for Al Gore by a large margin in 2000. Burns won the Republican primary, but was initially seen as a sacrificial lamb candidate, given his extremely conservative profile. However, the Democratic candidate, Augusta businessman Charles &quot; Champ &quot; Walker, Jr., was dogged by ethical questions and began losing ground during the summer. Eventually, Burns won by a surprising 10-point margin, taking 55% to Walker&apos;s 45 percent. Term in office 2003-2005 Burns&apos; term in office was undistinguished. As a freshman member of Congress, he, like most freshmen did little other than take direction from party leaders. Burns&apos; term was most noted for a high level of staff turn-over including his chief of staff Chris Ingram and his legislative director Christy Seifert and press secretary Jailliene Erickson. Ingram was fired by Burns and Ingram contended that his firing was due to inappropriate political meddling by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Following the departure of Burns&apos; senior staff, the office faced a number of media controversies including a report that one of Burns&apos; supporters spoke at a campaign rally and referred to one of Burns&apos; potential Democratic opponents as &quot; that Jew boy &quot; while Burns listened and stood silent. [ 2004 election ] Burns was elected president of the Republican freshman class, but was a top Democratic target in the 2004 elections. His 2004 Democratic opponent was Athens - Clarke County Commissioner John Barrow, who beat Burns 52% to 48%. [ 2006 election ] In May 2005, Burns announced that he would seek a rematch against Barrow in 2006. The state legislature, now controlled by Republicans, had conducted a highly controversial mid-decade redistricting. In the process, they drew Barrow&apos;s home in Athens out of the district and moved several Republican-leaning Savannah suburbs from the 1st District. Although the result was to make the 12th about five points more African-American than its predecessor, it was also slightly less Democratic. Barrow narrowly defeated Burns, 50.3% to 49.7%--the closest margin for a Democratic incumbent in the cycle. While Burns won 14 of the district&apos;s 22 counties, he lost badly in the two largest counties, Chatham and Richmond, home to Savannah and Augusta respectively. President George W. Bush made personal appearances campaigning on behalf of former Representative Burns.
