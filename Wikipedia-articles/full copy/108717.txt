The population was 10,347 at the 2000 census. The town center was defined as a census-designated place known as Salmon Brook in the 2000 census.Other areas in town include North Granby and West Granby. Granby is a rural town with a suburban center. The outskirts of town are either very wooded and mountainous or consist of farms. [ History ] Granby was part of Simsbury, Connecticut until 1786, when it became independent. { Town of Southwick, Massachusetts } Part of Southwick, Massachusetts known as &quot; the Notch &quot; seceded from Massachusetts in 1774, just before the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. This territory became part of Granby when it seceded from Simsbury, but was returned to Southwick as part of an 1803-4 border dispute compromise. (See History of Massachusetts.) [ Daniel Hayes ] Daniel Hayes Gravestone In 1707, Daniel Hayes, then aged twenty-two, was captured by the indigenous people and carried off to Canada. The capture was witnessed, and a rescue party raised, but the group did not catch up with the captors. He was tied up each night, and bound to saplings. It took thirty days to reach Canada, at which point Hayes was forced to run the gauntlet. Near the end of the gauntlet, he hid in a wigwam to avoid an attempted blow by a club. The squaw in the wigwam declared that the house was sacred, and having lost a husband and son to a war, adopted Hayes as her son. He remained for several years, attending to the squaw. Eventually, he was sold to a Frenchman, who learned that Hayes had skill as a weaver, so put him to work in that business. Hayes managed to earn enough to buy his freedom after two years. He then returned to Simsbury, settled down on a farm and married. He became prominent, both in civil affairs as well as the church at Salmon Brook (now Granby). [ Phelps 37–44 ] [ First American colonies coins ] The first unauthorized coins minted in the American colonies, and the first in Connecticut, were struck by Dr. Samuel Higley in 1737 from copper mined from his own mine. The coins, including the Trader&apos;s Currency Token of the Colony of Connecticut were minted in North Simsbury, now called Granby. These coins were made of pure copper, which is very soft. Consequently, there are very few in existence today. The first coins were inscribed with a value of three pence. Later versions carried the phrase &quot; Value me as you please. &quot; [ Modern history ] In 2009 Connecticut Magazine ranked Granby the #3 overall Connecticut small town (population 10,000-1500) to live in, and #1 small town in Hartford County. { http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/November-2009/Rating-the-Towns-2009-Cities-10000-15000/ } [ Geography ] According to the USPS, Granby is located at 41.966062°N, 72.796407°W.
