Also reviewed by David Zieve } This article uses the dysmenorrhea definition of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities, and uses the term menstrual pain as any pain during menstruation whether it is normal or abnormal. Menstrual pain is often used synonymously with menstrual cramps, but the latter may also refer to menstrual uterine contractions, which are generally of higher strength, duration and frequency than in the rest of the menstrual cycle. { medicinenet.com &gt; Menstrual Cramps Retrieved January 2011 } Dysmenorrhea can feature different kinds of pain, including sharp, throbbing, dull, nauseating, burning, or shooting pain. Dysmenorrhea may precede menstruation by several days or may accompany it, and it usually subsides as menstruation tapers off. Dysmenorrhea may coexist with excessively heavy blood loss, known as menorrhagia. Secondary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed when symptoms are attributable to an underlying disease, disorder, or structural abnormality either within or outside the uterus. Primary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed when none of these are detected. [ Classification ] Dysmenorrhea can be classified as either primary or secondary based on the absence or presence of an underlying cause. Secondary dysmenorrhea is dysmenorrhea which is associated with an existing condition. The most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea is endometriosis. Other causes include leiomyoma, [ Hilário SG, Bozzini N, Borsari R, Baracat EC Action of aromatase inhibitor for treatment of uterine leiomyoma in perimenopausal patients Fertil.

It is also commonly felt in the right or left abdomen. It may radiate to the thigh s and lower back. Symptoms often co-occurring with menstrual pain include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, headache, dizziness, disorientation, hypersensitivity to sound, light, smell and touch, fainting, and fatigue. Symptoms of dysmenorrhea often begin immediately following ovulation and can last until the end of menstruation. This is because dysmenorrhea is often associated with changes in hormonal levels in the body that occur with ovulation. The use of certain types of birth control pills can prevent the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, because the birth control pills stop ovulation from occurring. [ Pathophysiology ] During a woman&apos;s menstrual cycle, the endometrium thickens in preparation for potential pregnancy. After ovulation, if the ovum is not fertilized and there is no pregnancy, the built-up uterine tissue is not needed and thus shed. Molecular compounds called prostaglandin s are released during menstruation, due to the destruction of the endometrial cells, and the resultant release of their contents. [ Lethaby A, Augood C, Duckitt K, Farquhar C Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for heavy menstrual bleeding Cochrane Database Syst Rev 4 CD000400 2007 17943741 10.1002/14651858.CD000400.pub2 Lethaby Anne ] Release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus cause the uterus to contract. These substances are thought to be a major factor in primary dysmenorrhea. { Wright, Jason and Solange Wyatt. The Washington Manual Obstetrics and Gynecology Survival Guide. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2003. ISBN 0-7817-4363-X } When the uterine muscles contract, they constrict the blood supply to the tissue of the endometrium, which, in turn, breaks down and dies. These uterine contractions continue as they squeeze the old, dead endometrial tissue through the cervix and out of the body through the vagina. These contractions, and the resulting temporary oxygen deprivation to nearby tissues, are responsible for the pain or &quot; cramps &quot; experienced during menstruation. Compared with other women, females with primary dysmenorrhea have increased activity of the uterine muscle with increased contractility and increased frequency of contractions. [ Rosenwaks Z, Seegar-Jones G Menstrual pain: its origin and pathogenesis J Reprod Med 25 4 Suppl 207–12 1980 October 7001019 ] In one research study using MRI, visible features of the uterus were compared in dysmenorrheic and eumenorrheic (normal) participants. The study concluded that in dysmenorrheic patients, visible features on cycle days 1-3 correlated with the degree of pain, and differed significantly from the control group.

Koyama T. Fujii S. ] [ Diagnosis ] The diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is usually made simply on a medical history of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities. However, there is no universally accepted gold standard technique for quantifying the severity of menstrual pains. Yet, there are quantification models, called menstrual symptometrics, that can be used to estimate the severity of menstrual pains as well as correlate them with pain in other parts of the body, menstrual bleeding and degree of interference with daily activities. [ 12095497 ] [ Further work-up ] Once a diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is made, further work-up is required to search for any underlying cause of it, in order to be able to treat it specifically and to avoid aggravation of a perhaps serious underlying cause. Further work-up includes a specific medical history of symptoms and menstrual cycles and a pelvic exam. Based on results from these, additional exams and tests may be motivated, such as: A pap test Certain lab tests Gynecologic ultrasonography In some cases, laparoscopy may be required. [ Management ] [ NSAIDs ] Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhea. [ Marjoribanks J Proctor, M, Farquhar, C, Derks, RS Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) 2010 Jan 20 1 CD001751 20091521 10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub2 Marjoribanks Jane ] They can have side effect s of nausea, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and diarrhea. { Rossi S, editor. } { Australian Medicines Handbook 2006.

[ Alternative medicine ] A number of alternative therapies have been studied in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. The effectiveness of acupressure, behavioral interventions, thiamine, vitamin E, topical heat, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is likely while the effects of acupuncture, fish oil, magnets and vitamin B12 is unknown.

A 2007 systematic review found some scientific evidence that behavioral interventions may be effective, but that the results should be viewed with caution due to poor quality of the data.
