Two of Vega&apos;s songs (both from her second album Solitude Standing, 1987) reached the top 10 of various international chart listings: &quot; Luka &quot; and &quot; Tom&apos;s Diner &quot;. The latter was originally an a cappella version on Vega&apos;s album, which was then remade in 1990 as a dance track produced by the British dance production team DNA. [ Early life ] Vega was born July 11, 1959 in Santa Monica, California.

Later she attended New York&apos;s prestigious High School of Performing Arts (now called LaGuardia High School). There she studied modern dance and graduated in 1977. [ Career ] While majoring in English literature at Barnard College, [ http://www.suzannevega.com/suzanne/biography/brief.aspx Biography Official Community of Suzanne Vega 2008-05-26 http://web.archive.org/web/20080430145005/http%3A//www.suzannevega.com/suzanne/biography/brief.aspx 2008-04-30 ] she performed in small venues in Greenwich Village, where she was a regular contributor to Jack Hardy &apos;s Monday night songwriters&apos; group at the Cornelia Street Cafe and had some of her first songs published on Fast Folk anthology albums. { Fricke, David. Suzanne Vega Album Review, } { Rolling Stone, July 4, 1985. Accessed June 5, 2009. } In 1984, she received a major label recording contract, making her one of the first Fast Folk artists to break out on a major label. Vega&apos;s self-titled debut album was released in 1985 and was well-received by critics in the U.S.; it reached platinum status in the United Kingdom. Produced by Lenny Kaye and Steve Addabbo, the songs feature Vega&apos;s acoustic guitar in straightforward arrangement s. A video was released for the album&apos;s song &quot; Marlene on the Wall &quot;, which went into MTV and VH1 &apos;s rotations. During this period Vega also wrote lyrics for two songs on Songs from Liquid Days by composer Philip Glass. Her next effort, Solitude Standing (1987), garnered critical and commercial success including the hit single &quot; Luka &quot;, an international success. &quot; Luka &quot; is written about, and from the point of view of, an abused child—at the time an uncommon subject for a pop hit. While continuing a focus on Vega&apos;s acoustic guitar, the music is more strongly pop-oriented and features fuller arrangements. The a cappella &quot; Tom&apos;s Diner &quot; from this album was later a hit, remix ed by two British dance producers under the name DNA, in 1990. The track was originally a bootleg, until Vega allowed DNA to release through her record company, and it became her all-time biggest hit. [ Tom&apos;s Diner ] { Tom&apos;s Restaurant, after which the song } { Tom&apos;s Diner was named } Vega&apos;s song &quot; Tom&apos;s Diner &quot; was used as the reference track in an early trial of the MP3 compression system, thus earning her the distinction of being named &quot; The Mother of the MP3 &quot;. Because it is an a cappella vocal with relatively little reverberation, it was used as the model for Karlheinz Brandenburg &apos;s sound compression algorithm. [ http://www.suzannevega.com/suzanne/funfacts/music.aspx Fun Facts Music Official Community of Suzanne Vega 2008-08-22 http://web.archive.org/web/20080515164214/http%3A//www.suzannevega.com/suzanne/funfacts/music.aspx 2008-05-15 ] Brandenburg heard “Tom&apos;s Diner” on a radio playing the song and was excited and at first convinced it would be “nearly impossible to compress this warm a cappella voice.” &quot; Tom&apos;s Diner &quot; takes place in Tom&apos;s Restaurant at 112th Street and Broadway in New York City. Exterior shots of the same restaurant appear in the television sitcom Seinfeld as Monk&apos;s, which is the eatery where Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer hang out. The DNA remix of the track was so popular that it inspired many cover versions—the best of which were eventually collected by Vega on an album titled Tom&apos;s Album. The remixed version of &quot; Tom&apos;s Diner &quot; was later sampled by hip hop artist Nikki D in her single &quot; Daddy&apos;s Little Girl &quot;. Rapper Tupac Shakur sampled the track in &quot; Dopefiend&apos;s Diner &quot;. [ Luka ] On a 1987 Swedish television special, Vega said this about her song &quot; Luka &quot; : { in real life I don&apos;t think he was. I think he was just different. } [ http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id%3D3528 Luka by Suzanne Vega Songfacts 2008-08-22 ] Also, in an ASCAP interview, she responded to a question about &quot; Luka &quot; : [ http://www.ascap.com/poprock/memberprofiles/suzannevega.html ASCAP 2008-08-22 ] &quot; Luka &quot; was covered by The Lemonheads on the 1989 album Lick, shortly before the band was signed by Atlantic Records, and was a minor college-airplay hit. [ 1990s ] Vega&apos;s third album, Days of Open Hand (1990) continued in the style of her first two albums. In 1992 she released the album 99.9F°. It consists of a mixture of folk music, dance beats and industrial music. Her fifth album, Nine Objects of Desire, was released in 1996. The music varies between a frugal, simple style and the industrial production of 99.9F°. This album contains &quot; Caramel &quot;, featured in the movie The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs and, later, the trailer for the movie Closer. A song not included on that album, &quot; Woman on the Tier &quot;, was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Dead Man Walking. In 1997 she took a singing part on the concept album Heaven and Hell, a musical interpretation of the Seven deadly sins by her colleague Joe Jackson, with whom she had already collaborated in 1986 on &quot; Left of Center &quot; from the Pretty in Pink soundtrack (with Vega singing and Jackson playing piano). In 1999, Avon Books published Vega&apos;s book &quot; The Passionate Eye: The Collected Writings Of Suzanne Vega &quot;; a volume of poems, lyrics, essays and journalistic pieces. [ 2000s ] On stage, 2008 September 2001 saw the release of a new album, Songs In Red and Gray. Three songs deal with Vega&apos;s divorce from first husband Mitchell Froom. At the memorial concert for her brother Tim Vega in December 2002, she began as the long-term subject of a direct cinema documentary, Some Journey, by director Christopher Seufert of Mooncusser Films. This has not been completed. In 2003, the twenty-one-song greatest hits compilation Retrospective: The Best of Suzanne Vega was released. (The UK version of Retrospective included an eight-song bonus CD as well as a DVD containing twelve songs.) In the same year she was invited by Grammy Award -winning jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, to play at the Century of Song concerts at the famed RuhrTriennale in Germany. In 2003, she hosted the American Public Media radio series American Mavericks, about 20th century American composer s, which received the prestigious Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting. On August 3, 2006, Vega became the first major recording artist to perform live in the Internet-based virtual world, Second Life. The event was hosted by John Hockenberry of public radio&apos;s The Infinite Mind. On September 17, 2006, she performed in Central Park, as part of a benefit concert for The Save Darfur Coalition.

At the end of the festival she performed her classical songs, and added one brand new piece called &quot; New York Is a Woman &quot;. Vega is also interviewed in the book Everything Is Just a Bet which was published in Czech in October 2006. The book contains twelve interview transcriptions from the talk show called Stage Talks that regularly runs in the Švandovo divadlo (Švandovo Theatre) in Prague.
