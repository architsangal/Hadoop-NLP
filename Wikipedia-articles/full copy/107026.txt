[ History ] [ Settlement and Growth ] Mine Creek Baptist Church was built along the banks of Mine Creek by the Rev. Issac Cooper Perkins (1790–1852) in the area where Nashville now stands around 1835. { The Nashville Leader, 21 Sept. 2009 } Settlers later established a post stop along the settlement roads in 1840, { &lt; i &gt; Centennial history of Arkansas, Volume 1. Dallas Tabor Herndon (Chicago and Little Rock: S.J. Clarke, 1922):902-903 } and a post office incorporated in 1848. { The Nashville Leader, 21 Sept. 2009 } Michael Womack (1794–1861), a Tennessee native reputed to have killed the British General Edward Packenham during the War of 1812, settled in the area with his family in 1849. { Genealogy of Michael Womack } The area was then known by locals as Mine Creek, but was also called Hell&apos;s Valley { Arkansas Historical Quarterly Hell&apos;s Valley, Nashville, 13:265 } and Pleasant Valley. Settlement in the area progressed slowly but steadily, though industry declined during the American Civil War. Following the war, the village&apos;s prospects improved, industry and settlement picked up, and the town was officially incorporated as Nashville on 18 October 1883, with D.A. Hutchinson serving as the first mayor. { &apos;&apos;Centennial history of Arkansas, Volume 1. Dallas Tabor Herndon (Chicago and Little Rock: S.J. Clarke, 1922):903 } Womack is attributed with first proposing the name and called the town after Nashville, Tennessee. { Genealogy of Michael Womack } The following year, Nashville and Hope were connected via railroad, spurring further growth, and the county seat was relocated from Center Point to Nashville. { ArkansasHeritage.com } With the establishment of county government in the town, and due to the increased trade and access brought by the railroad, Nashville continued to grow. The town had a population of 928 in 1900, and boasted &quot; a cotton-compress and gin &quot; and a &quot; bottling-works &quot;; { &lt; i &gt; Lippencott&apos;s New Gazetteer: A Complete Pronouncing Gazetteer or Geographical Dictionary of the World&apos;&apos;, Vol.2. A. Heilprin and L. Heilprin, Eds. (Philadelphia: J. Lippencott, 1906):1257 } by 1920 the population had risen to 2,144. { &lt; i &gt; Centennial history of Arkansas, Volume 1. Dallas Tabor Herndon (Chicago and Little Rock: S.J. Clarke, 1922):903 } In the years before the Great Depression, Nashville was a prosperous, if small, town. According to Herndon (1922:903), Nashville was &quot; a banking town, with electric lights, waterworks, an ice and cold storage plant, a canning factory, foundries, machine shops, a flour mill, two newspapers, a brick factory, fruit box and crate factory, mercantile concerns... well-kept streets, [and] modern public schools. &quot; { &lt; i &gt; Centennial history of Arkansas, Volume 1. Dallas Tabor Herndon (Chicago and Little Rock: S.J. Clarke, 1922):903 } [ Peach Farming ] Peach pickers in Nashville in 1915 Peach farming sustained Nashville during the Depression. The peach industry came to the Nashville area in the late nineteenth century. Peak years of production lasted from the 1920s until the 1950s. Nashville&apos;s peak peach production was 1950, with over 400,000 bushels collected from 425 orchards. &quot; Up to 175 boxcars, each carrying 396 bushel baskets, were shipped from Nashville each day during peak production years. &quot; { Encyclopedia of Arkansas, &quot; Peach Industry &quot; } Late freezes and early thaws in 1952 and 1953 led to the devastation of the peach harvests. Two-thirds of the crops were destroyed, and production sank to 150,000 bushels. &quot; The Arkansas growers lost the market, and the impact was devastating. For Howard County growers, the only option was to pull up the trees and convert the land for other purposes, often pasture for cattle, or to raise chickens, &quot; which remain the dominant agricultural products in the Nashville area to this day. { Encyclopedia of Arkansas, &quot; Peach Industry &quot; } The peach industry in the area continued to decline as industrial farming in the Sun Belt and shifting production patterns made southwest Arkansas less attractive to larger produce companies. However, many small peach orchards still remain and are farmed by local families. [ Railroads ] The first railroad to connect Nashville with the surrounding area was originally known as the Washington &amp; Hope Railroad Co., chartered in 1876. { &apos;&apos;Annual report of the Railroad Commission of the State of Arkansas, Volume 3&apos;&apos; (Hot Springs: Sentinel Record, 1903):354 } The first stage of the railroad was a ten-mile (16  km) stretch connecting Hope and Washington, Arkansas in 1879. In 1881 the railroad was renamed the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Co., and on 1 October 1884 a nearly [ 26 mi km on ] extension to Nashville was opened. { &apos;&apos;Annual report of the Railroad Commission of the State of Arkansas, Volume 3&apos;&apos; (Hot Springs: Sentinel Record, 1903):354 } By the turn of the century the railroad was operated as an extension of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, which stretched from St. Louis, Missouri to Texarkana, Arkansas. { &apos;&apos;Annual report of the Railroad Commission of the State of Arkansas, Volume 3&apos;&apos; (Hot Springs: Sentinel Record, 1903):354 } The earliest trains coming in and out of Nashville operated under the Missouri Pacific Railroad mark. At one time the city boasted three railroads: [ 32 mi km ] The earliest was the Iron Mountain Railway branch from Nashville to Hope. The second, granted a charter on 22 June 1906, was the Memphis Paris and Gulf (MP &amp; G), later the Memphis Dallas and Gulf. &apos;&apos;Arkansas Biennial Report of the Secretary of State&apos;&apos;, 1905-1906. (Little Rock: Tunnah &amp; Pittard, 1906):376 The track ran twenty-five miles from Nashville to Ashdown, Arkansas, and then on to Hot Springs, Arkansas. The MP &amp; G was broken up in 1922 forming the Graysonia Nashville and Ashdown (GN &amp; A) running from Nashville to Ashdown. The GN &amp; A was merged into the Kansas City Southern Railroad in 1993. &apos;&apos;American Shortline Railway Guide&apos;&apos;, 5th Ed. Edward A. Lewis (Waukasha, WI: Kalmbach, 1996):357 The third railroad in Nashville was the Murfreesboro Nashville Southwestern (MNSW), which ran from Nashville to Murfreesboro, Arkansas, in 1909. The MNSW later became the Murfreesboro-Nashville railroad which folded in 1951. Encyclopedia of Arkansas, &quot; Murfreesboro &quot; [ Dillard&apos;s Department Store ] William T. Dillard, founder of Dillard&apos;s, opened his first department store in Nashville. { New York Times, 9 February 2002 } He started his successful franchise in 1938 when, with $8,000 borrowed from his father, he opened a small store in his wife&apos;s hometown of Nashville. Aside from a short period during World War II, the Dillard Company continued operating and expanding its Nashville location.

Gillett, &quot; Tracking the Arkansas Dinosaurs, &quot; The Arkansas Naturalist, (March 1984) v. 2 no. 3, pp 1-12. } { Pittman, Jeffrey, Transactions of the Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies, vol. XXXIV (1984), pp. 202-209 } A field of 5-10,000 sauropod footprints were found in a mudstone layer covering a layer of gypsum. { &quot; Geologists to Make Casts of Rare Dinosaur Prints, &quot; Arkansas Gazette, January 1, 1984; sec. B, p. 8, col. 5. } Casts [ 65 ft m ] long and [ 7 ft m ] wide were made and put on permanent display, first at the courthouse and finally at the Nashville City Park, while many of the original tracks were disbursed to local museums such as the Mid-America Museum in Hot Springs, Arkansas and the Arkansas Museum of Discovery in Little Rock.
