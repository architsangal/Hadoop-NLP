[ Cinnamon Transport Information Service Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft e.V. http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/gewuerze/zimt/zimt.htm 2007-10-23 ] This pale yellow viscous liquid occurs naturally in the bark of cinnamon tree s and other species of the genus Cinnamomum. The essential oil of cinnamon bark is about 90% cinnamaldehyde. [ Structure and synthesis ] Cinnamaldehyde was isolated from cinnamon essential oil in 1834 by Dumas and Péligot [ March 2012 ] and synthesized in the laboratory by Chiozza in 1854. [ March 2012 ] The natural product is trans -cinnamaldehyde. The molecule consists of a phenyl group attached to an unsaturated aldehyde. As such, the molecule can be viewed as a derivative of acrolein. Its color is due to the π → π* transition: increased conjugation in comparison with acrolein shifts this band towards the visible. { Kozo Inuzuka, Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan Vol.34, [No.11(1961)pp.1557-1560] http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=bcsj1926 &amp; cdvol=34 &amp; noissue=11 &amp; startpage=1557 } [ Synthesis ] Several methods of laboratory synthesis exist, but cinnamaldehyde is most economically obtained from the steam distillation of the oil of cinnamon bark. The compound can be prepared from related compounds like cinnamyl alcohol, (the alcohol form of cinnamaldehyde), but the first synthesis from unrelated compounds was the aldol condensation of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde. [ Metabolism ] Cinnamaldehyde occurs widely and closely related compounds give rise to lignin. All such compounds are biosynthesized starting from phenylalanine, which undergoes conversion. { Boerjan, W.; Ralph, J. and Baucher, M., &quot; Lignin Biosynthesis &quot;, Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003. 54:519–46, 2003, 54, pages 519–546, } [ 10.1146/annurev.arplant.54.031902.134938 ] Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase is an enzyme responsible for the production of cinnamoyl-CoA ( cinnamoyl ester of coenzyme A ) from cinnamaldehyde. [ Applications ] [ As a flavorant ] The most obvious application for cinnamaldehyde is as flavoring in items like chewing gum, ice cream, candy, and beverage s range from 9 to 4900 ppm (parts per million) (that is, less than 0.5%). It is also used in some perfume s of natural, sweet, or fruit y scent s. Almond, apricot, butterscotch, and other aroma s may partially employ the compound for their pleasant smells. Cinnamaldehyde can be used as a food adulterant; powdered beech nut husk aromatized with cinnamaldehyde can be marketed as powdered cinnamon. { Karl-Georg Fahlbusch, Franz-Josef Hammerschmidt, Johannes Panten, Wilhelm Pickenhagen, Dietmar Schatkowski, Kurt Bauer, Dorothea Garbe, Horst Surburg “Flavors and Fragrances” in Ullmann&apos;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. } [ 10.1002/14356007.a11_141 ] [ As an agrichemical ] Cinnamaldehyde is also used as a fungicide. [ Cinnamaldehyde Use PAN Pesticides Database http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_ChemUse.jsp?Rec_Id%3DPC33596 2007-10-23 ] Proven effective on over 40 different crops, cinnamaldehyde is typically applied to the root systems of plants. Its low toxicity and well-known properties make it ideal for agriculture. Cinnamaldehyde is an effective insecticide, and its scent is also known to repel animals like cat s and dog s. Cinnamaldehyde has recently been recognized as a very effective insecticide for mosquito larva e. { Cornelia Dick-Pfaff: Wohlriechender Mückentod, 19.07.2004 } As little as 29 ppm (parts per million) of cinnamaldehyde kills half of Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae in 24 hours.

Agric. Food Chem. 52 14 4395–4400 2004 July 15237942 10.1021/jf0497152 ] [ As an antimicrobial ] Another use for cinnamaldehyde is as an antimicrobial. Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago (who were funded by the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company) have found that cinnamic aldehyde, when used in Big Red, prevented oral bacterial growth by more than 50 percent. [ Popular Chewing Gum Eliminates Bacteria That Cause Bad Breath Science Daily http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/04/040401080031.htm 2009-09-22 ] It is especially effective against bacteria living at the back of the tongue, reducing anaerobic bacteria populations by about 43 percent. [ As an anti-cancer agent ] Recent research documents anti-cancer activity of cinnamaldehyde/cinnamic aldehyde observed in cell culture and animal models of the disease. Proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth were inhibited in a murine A375 model of human melanoma, though only at high doses not achievable through dietary intake.

It can be used in combination with additional components such as dispersing agents, solvent s and other surfactant s. Its high refractive index of 1.6220 makes it a fairly safe and useful fluid for examining gemstone rough for inclusions. [ Derivatives of cinnamaldehyde ] Numerous derivatives of cinnamaldehyde are commercially useful. Dihydrocinnamic alcohol, which occurs naturally but is produced by double hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, is used to confer the fragrances of hyacinth and lilac. Cinnamic alcohol similarly occurs naturally and has the odor of lilac. Dihydrocinnamaldehyde is produced by the selective hydrogenation of the alkene subunit. α-Amyl- and α-hexylcinnamaldehyde are important commercial fragrances, but they are not prepared from cinnamaldehyde. [ Toxicology ] Cinnamaldehyde is used in agriculture because of its low toxicity. It is however a skin irritant. The level of coumarin detected in &apos;cinnamon&apos; extracts and powders has concerned the German BfR. { High daily intakes of cinnamon: Health risk cannot be ruled out.
