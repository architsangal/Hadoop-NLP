[ May 2010 March 2011 March 2011 ] [ Láadan Suzette Haden Elgin 1982 experiment in feminist linguistics, and featured in Elgin&apos;s novel Native Tongue artistic and philosophical language fictional language a priori language, with influences from Navajo and English ldn IPA ] Láadan is a constructed language created by Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982 to test the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis, specifically to determine if development of a language aimed at expressing the views of women would shape a culture; a subsidiary hypothesis was that Western natural language s may be better suited for expressing the views of men than women. The language was included in her science fiction &apos;&apos;Native Tongue&apos;&apos; series. Láadan contains a number of words that are used to make unambiguous statements that include how one feels about what one is saying. According to Elgin, this is designed to counter male-centered language&apos;s limitations on women, who are forced to respond &quot; I know I said that, but I meant this &quot;. [ Phonology ] [ Tones ] Unusually for constructed languages, Láadan is a tonal language. It utilises two distinct tones: [ /lō/ ] [ /lò/ ] [ /ló/ ] lo or, a short, medium or low tone, represented by a single unmarked vowel ló, a short, high tone, represented by a single marked vowel The word &quot; Láadan &quot; has three syllables: &quot; lá- &quot; with the short vowel /a/ plus high tone; &quot; -a &quot; with the short vowel /a/ and no tone; and &quot; -dan &quot;. Láadan does not allow any double [i.e., long] phonemes. Whenever two identical short vowels would occur side by side in a single morpheme, one of them has to be marked for high tone. When adding an affix would result in two identical vowels side by side, an epenthetic /h/ is inserted to prevent the forbidden sequence. The language will allow either &quot; máa &quot; or &quot; maá, &quot; but not &quot; maa &quot;. These combinations can be described as: [ /lǒː/ ] [ /lôː/ ] loó, a long, low-rising tone, represented by a double vowel, the second of which is marked lóo, a long, high-falling tone, represented by a double vowel, the first of which is marked (Some people analyze these tone sequences as tonemic as well, for a total of four tones.) Elgin prefers an analysis of the language as having no long vowels and a single tone, the high tone (distinguished from &quot; neutral, baseline pitch &quot; ), but she acknowledges that linguists using other formalisms would be justified in saying that there are two tones, high and low (or unmarked or mid). { Elgin&apos;s blog } [ Vowels ] Láadan has five vowel s : [ /ɑ/ ] [ /ɛ/ ] [ /ɪ/ ] [ /o/ ] [ /u/ ] a, an open back unrounded vowel (as English calm), e, an open-mid front unrounded vowel (as English bell), i, a near-close near-front unrounded vowel (as English bit), o, a close-mid back rounded vowel (as English home), u, a close back rounded vowel (as English boon). [ Consonants ] [ /m/ ] [ /n/ ] [ /b/ ] [ /d/ ] [ /θ/ ] [ /ɬ/ ] [ /ʃ/ ] [ /h/ ] [ /ʒ/ ] [ /r/ ] [ /w/ ] [ /l/ ] [ /j/ ]   Labial Dental / Alveolar Postalveolar / Palatal Glottal Central Lateral Nasal m n Plosive b d Fricative voiceless th lh sh h voiced zh Rhotic r Approximant w l y Láadan lacks the consonant s [ /p, t, k, ɡ, s/ ]. However, it uses b, d, sh ( [ /ʃ/ ] ), m, n, l, r, w, y ( [ /j/ ] ), h with the same phonetic value as English. In addition to these, three digraphs require further explanation: [ /θ/ ] [ /ʒ/ ] [ /ɬ/ ] th, a voiceless dental fricative (always as in English think, never as then), zh, a voiced postalveolar fricative (as English pleasure), lh, a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (as Welsh llan). [ Grammar ] Most Láadan sentences contain three particles : Bíi : Indicates a declarative sentence (usually optional) Báa : Indicates a question Bó : Indicates a command; very rare, except to small children Bóo : Indicates a request; this is the usual imperative/ &quot; command &quot; form Bé : Indicates a promise Bée : Indicates a warning wa : Known to speaker because perceived by speaker, externally or internally wi : Known to speaker because self-evident we : Perceived by speaker in a dream wáa : Assumed true by speaker because speaker trusts source waá : Assumed false by speaker because speaker distrusts source; if evil intent by the source is also assumed, the form is &quot; waálh &quot; wo : Imagined or invented by speaker, hypothetical wóo : Used to indicate that the speaker states a total lack of knowledge as to the validity of the matter Láadan is a verb–subject–object (VSO) language. Verb s and adjective s are interchangeable. There are no articles, and the object is marked by the -th or -eth suffix. The plural number is shown only by the me- prefix to the verb (wo- is used in some versions of the language). The particle ra following a verb makes it negative.

Affix meaning example (-)lh(-) disgust or dislike hahodimi: &quot; pleasantly bewildered &quot;; hahodimilh: &quot; unpleasantly bewildered &quot; du- to try to bíi eril dusháad le wa: &quot; I tried to come &quot; dúu- to try in vain to bíi eril dúusháad le wa: &quot; I tried in vain to come &quot; ná- progressive aspect bíi eril dúunásháad le wa: &quot; I was trying in vain to come &quot; -(e)tha natural possessor lalal betha: &quot; her mother&apos;s milk &quot; -(e)tho customary or legal possessor ebahid letho: &quot; my husband &quot; -(e)thi possessor by chance losh nethi: &quot; your money (gambling winnings) &quot; -(e)the possessor by unknown provenance ana worulethe: &quot; the cats&apos; food &quot; -id denotes male (otherwise female or gender neutral) thul: &quot; mother/parent &quot;; thulid: &quot; father &quot; The speech act particle, at the beginning of a sentence, can also carry several suffixes, which expand on the overall state of the sentence. For example, bíi begins a statement, but bíide begins a statement that is part of a narrative; bóoth begins a request made in pain; báada begins a question that is meant in jest. [ Pronouns ] Pronoun s in Láadan are built up from a number of constituent parts. The consonant l marks the first person, n the second person and b the third person. Usually, these are followed by the vowel e. However, the vowel a is used to designate someone who is loved (lhe- is prefixed to describe someone who is despised). The suffix -zh is used to mark a plural pronoun for numbers up to four, and -n for numbers beyond that. Therefore, lazh means &quot; we, several beloved &quot;, and lheben means &quot; they, many despised &quot;.
