[ the fish ] [ Late Cretaceous Recent ] [ Rajidae 2009 January ] { Animal ia } { Chordata } { Chondrichthyes } { Elasmobranchii } { Batoidea } { Rajiformes } { Berg, 1940 } { Rajidae } { Bonaparte, 1831 } { General } Skates are cartilaginous fishes belonging to the family Rajidae in the superorder Batoidea of rays. More than 200 species have been described, in 27 genera. There are two subfamilies, Rajinae (hardnose skates) and Arhynchobatinae (softnose skates). [ Genera ] Amblyraja Arhynchobatis Atlantoraja Bathyraja Breviraja Brochiraja Cruriraja Dactylobatus Dentiraja Dipturus Fenestraja Gurgesiella Hongeo Insentiraja Irolita Leucoraja Malacoraja Neoraja Notoraja Okamejei Pavoraja Psammobatis Pseudoraja Raja Rajella Rhinoraja Rioraja Rostroraja Sympterygia Zearaja [ Conservation ] Skates have slow growth rates and, since they mature late, low reproductive rates. As a result, skates are vulnerable to overfishing and appear to have been overfished and are suffering reduced population levels in many parts of the world. The barndoor skate, Raja laevis, is currently listed with the IUCN as vulnerable due to being severely overfished. { Florida Museum of Natural History } However, population data are lacking to determine the exploitation of the big skate at this time. [ January 2010 ] In 2010, Greenpeace International added the barndoor skate, bottlenose skate, spotback skate, and maltese skate to its seafood red list. &quot; The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries. &quot; { Greenpeace International Seafood Red list } [ Gallery ] Skate, Raja erinacea Broad skate, Amblyraja badia Uncooked skate wing A skate, half-buried beneath the sand A cut-away view of a skate egg case [ See also ] Jenny Haniver, a fake sea monster created from a skate corpse Mokpo city of South Korea is famous for its skate cuisine.
