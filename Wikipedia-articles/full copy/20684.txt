Instructions per second (IPS) is a measure of a computer &apos;s processor speed. Many reported IPS values have represented &quot; peak &quot; execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches, whereas realistic workloads typically lead to significantly lower IPS values. The performance of the memory hierarchy also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in MIPS calculations. Because of these problems, researchers created standardized tests such as SPECint to attempt to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications, and raw IPS has fallen into disuse. The term is commonly used in association with a numeric value such as thousand instructions per second (kIPS), million instructions per second (MIPS), Giga instructions per second (GIPS), or Million Operations per Second (MOPS). [ Thousand instructions per second ] Before standard benchmarks were available, average speed rating of computers was based on calculations for a mix of instructions with the results given in kilo Instructions Per Second (kIPS). The most famous was the Gibson Mix, produced by Jack Clark Gibson of IBM for scientific applications. Other ratings were also produced for commercial applications. Computer Speeds From Instruction Mixes pre-1960 to 1971 has results for around 175 computers, providing scientific and commercial ratings. For IBM, the earliest Gibson Mix calculations shown are the 1954 IBM 650 at 0.06 kIPS and 1956 IBM 705 at 0.5 kIPS. The results are mainly for IBM and others known as the BUNCH - Burroughs, Univac, NCR, CDC and Honeywell. A thousand instructions per second (kIPS) is rarely used, as most current microprocessors can execute at least a billion instructions per second. The thousand means 1000, not 1024. kIPS is also a common joke name for 16 bit microprocessor designs developed in undergraduate computer engineering courses that use the text Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy (ISBN 1-55860-428-6), which explains computer architecture concepts in terms of the MIPS architecture. Such architectures tend to be scaled down versions of the MIPS R2000 architecture. [ Million instructions per second ] Comparison of processors speeds requires thorough analysis, as the speed of a given CPU is dependent upon many factors, such as the type of instructions being executed, the execution order and the presence of branch instructions (problematic in CPU pipelines). CPU instruction rates are different from clock frequencies, usually reported in Hz, as each instruction may require several clock cycles to complete or may be capable of executing multiple independent instructions at once. Additionally, the number of cycles required for instructions to complete is dependent upon the instruction being executed. MIPS can be useful when comparing performance between processors made from a similar architecture (e.g. Microchip branded microcontrollers). However, MIPS are difficult to compare between CPU architecture s. This and other limitations of the unit lead many computer engineers to define MIPS as Meaningless Indicator of Processor Speed. [ http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/enewsletterexclusive/9806p1.aspx Don&apos;t be Misled by MIPS Ted MacNeil IBM magazine ] In the late 1970s, minicomputer performance was compared using VAX MIPS, where computers were measured on a task and their performance rated against the VAX 11/780 that was marketed as a 1 MIPS machine. (The measure was also known as the VAX Unit of Performance or VUP. Though orthographically incorrect, the s in VUPs is sometimes written in upper case.) This was chosen because the 11/780 was roughly equivalent in performance to an IBM System/370 model 158-3, which was commonly accepted in the computing industry as running at 1  MIPS. Many of the minicomputer performance claims were based on the Fortran version of the Whetstone benchmark. This produces an artificial speed rating in Millions of Whetstone Instructions Per Second (MWIPS). The VAX 11/780 with FPA (1977) is shown as having a rating of 1.02 MWIPS. Effective MIPS speeds are highly dependent on the programming language used. The Whetstone Report has a table showing MWIPS speeds of PCs via early interpreters and compilers up to modern languages. The first compiler was for BASIC (1982) when a 4.8  MHz 8088/87 CPU obtained 0.01  MWIPS. Results on a 2.4  GHz Core 2 Duo (1 CPU 2007) vary from 9.7  MWIPS using BASIC Interpreter, 59  MWIPS via BASIC Compiler, 347  MWIPS using 1987 Fortran, 1,534  MWIPS through HTML/Java to 2,403  MWIPS us ing a modern C / C++ compiler. For the most early 8-bit and 16-bit microprocessors the performance was recognized in thousand instructions per second (kIPS), which equals 0.001  MIPS. The first general purpose microprocessor, the Intel i8080, ran at 0.64  MIPS. The Intel i8086 microprocessor, the first 16-bit microprocessor in the line of processors made by Intel and used in IBM PC s, [ July 2011 ] ran at 0.8  MIPS. [ July 2011 ] Early 32-bit PCs (386) ran at about 3  MIPS. zMIPS refers to the MIPS measure used internally by IBM to rate its mainframe servers ( zSeries, IBM System z9, and IBM System z10 ). Weighted million operations per second (WMOPS) is a similar measurement, used for audio codecs.
