It is an oxide of nitrogen. At room temperature, it is a colorless, non-flammable gas, with a slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as &quot; laughing gas &quot; due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anesthetic. It is also used as an oxidizer in rocket ry and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen. Nitrous oxide gives rise to NO ( nitric oxide ) on reaction with oxygen atoms, and this NO in turn reacts with ozone. As a result, it is the main naturally occurring regulator of stratospheric ozone. It is also a major greenhouse gas and air pollutant. Considered over a 100-year period, it has 298 times more impact &apos;per unit weight&apos; ( Global warming potential ) than carbon dioxide. { 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by Working Group 1 (WG1), Chapter 2 &quot; Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing &quot; which contains information on } { global warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse gases. } [ Occurrence ] Greenhouse gas trends. Nitrous oxide is emitted by bacteria in soils and oceans, and thus has been a part of Earth&apos;s atmosphere for eons [ January 2012 ]. Agriculture is the main source of human-produced nitrous oxide: cultivating soil, the use of nitrogen fertilizer s, and animal waste handling can all stimulate naturally occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide. The livestock sector (primarily cows, chickens, and pigs) produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide.

Rosales, C. de Haan 2008-02-02 2006 ] Industrial sources make up only about 20% of all anthropogenic sources, and include the production of nylon, and the burning of fossil fuel in internal combustion engines. Human activity is thought to account for 30%; tropical soils and oceanic release account for 70%. [ http://www.epa.gov/nitrousoxide/sources.html Sources and Emissions -- Where Does Nitrous Oxide Come From? U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2008-02-02 2006 ] Nitrous oxide reacts with ozone in the stratosphere. Nitrous oxide is the main naturally occurring regulator of stratospheric ozone. Nitrous oxide is a major greenhouse gas. Considered over a 100-year period, it has 298 times more impact per unit weight than carbon dioxide. Thus, despite its low concentration, nitrous oxide is the fourth largest contributor to these greenhouse gases. It ranks behind water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. Control of nitrous oxide is part of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. [ January 2012 ] [ History ] The gas was first synthesized by English natural philosopher and chemist Joseph Priestley in 1772, who called it phlogisticated nitrous air (see phlogiston ). [ http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/citation/1941/09000/The_Development_of_Anesthesia.8.aspx Keys TE The_Development_of_Anesthesia Anesthesiology journal 1941 2 552–574 1982AmSci..70..522D American Scientist ] Priestley published his discovery in the book Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air (1775), where he described how to produce the preparation of &quot; nitrous air diminished &quot;, by heating iron filings dampened with nitric acid. [ http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_journal1.shtml Priestley J Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air (vol.2, sec.3) 1776 ] [ Early use (1794–1843) ] The first important use of nitrous oxide was made possible by Thomas Beddoes and James Watt, who worked together to publish the book Considerations on the Medical Use and on the Production of Factitious Airs (1794). This book was important for two reasons. First, James Watt had invented a novel machine to produce &quot; Factitious Airs &quot; (i.e. nitrous oxide) and a novel &quot; breathing apparatus &quot; to inhale the gas. Second, the book also presented the new medical theories by Thomas Beddoes, that tuberculosis and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of &quot; Factitious Airs &quot;. The machine to produce &quot; Factitious Airs &quot; had three parts: A furnace to burn the needed material, a vessel with water where the produced gas passed through in a spiral pipe (for impurities to be &quot; washed off &quot; ), and finally the gas cylinder with a gasometer where the gas produced, &apos;air,&apos; could be tapped into portable air bags (made of airtight oily silk). The breathing apparatus consisted of one of the portable air bags connected with a tube to a mouthpiece. With this new equipment being engineered and produced by 1794, the way was paved for clinical trial s, [ April 2011 ] which began when Thomas Beddoes in 1798 established the &quot; Pneumatic Institution for Relieving Diseases by Medical Airs &quot; in Hotwells (Bristol). In the basement of the building, a large-scale machine was producing the gases under the supervision of a young Humphry Davy, who was encouraged to experiment with new gases for patients to inhale. The first important work of Davy was examination of the nitrous oxide, and the publication of his results in the book: Researches, Chemical and Philosophical (1800). In that publication, Davy notes the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide at page 465 and its potential to be used for surgical operations at page 556. [ http://books.google.com/?id%3DjhUAAAAAQAAJ%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3DResearches%2C%2Bchemical%2Band%2Bphilosophical%26amp%3Bcd%3D1#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq Davy H Researches, chemical and philosophical –chiefly concerning nitrous oxide or dephlogisticated nitrous air, and its respiration 1800 Printed for J. Johnson ] Despite Davy&apos;s discovery that inhalation of nitrous oxide could relieve a conscious person from pain, another 44 years elapsed before doctors attempted to use it for anaesthesia. The use of nitrous oxide as a recreational drug at &quot; laughing gas parties &quot;, primarily arranged for the British upper class, became an immediate success beginning in 1799. While the effects of the gas generally make the user feel stuporous, dreamy and sedated, some people also &quot; get the giggles &quot; in a state of euphoria, and frequently, erupt in laughter.

[ http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?artid%3D1703729%26amp%3Bblobtype%3Dpdf Erving HW The Discoverer of Anæsthesia: Dr. Horace Wells of Hartford Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, May 1933; v.5, n.5, p.421–430 1933 ] In the following weeks, Wells treated the first 12–15 patients with nitrous oxide in Hartford, and according to his own record only failed in two cases.

Gaylord Wells ] In spite of these convincing results being reported by Wells to the medical society in Boston already in December 1844, this new method was not immediately adopted by other dentists. The reason for this was most likely that Wells, in January 1845 at his first public demonstration towards the medical faculty in Boston, had been partly unsuccessful, leaving his colleagues doubtful regarding its efficacy and safety. [ http://www.ijaweb.org/text.asp?2007%2F51%2F6%2F472%2F61183 Desai SP, Desai MS, Pandav CS The discovery of modern anaesthesia-contributions of Davy, Clarke, Long, Wells and Morton Indian J Anaesth 2007;51:472-8 2007 ] The method did not come into general use until 1863, when Gardner Quincy Colton successfully started to use it in all his &quot; Colton Dental Association &quot; clinics, that he had just established in New Haven and New York City. Over the following three years, Colton and his associates successfully administered nitrous oxide to more than 25,000 patients. Today, nitrous oxide is used in dentistry as an anxiolytic, as an adjunct to local anesthetic. In hospitals, nitrous oxide was however found not to be a strong enough anesthetic for the use in large operations. Being a stronger and more potent anesthetic, sulfuric ether was instead demonstrated and accepted for use in October 1846, along with chloroform in 1847. When Joseph Thomas Clover invented the &quot; gas-ether inhaler &quot; in 1876, it however became a common practice at hospitals to initiate all anesthetic treatments with a mild flow of nitrous oxide, and then gradually increase the anaesthesia with the stronger ether/chloroform. Clover&apos;s gas-ether inhaler was designed to supply the patient with nitrous oxide and ether at the same time, with the exact mixture being controlled by the operator of the device. It remained in use by many hospitals until the 1930s. Although hospitals today are using a more advanced anaesthetic machine, these machines still use the same principle launched with Clover&apos;s gas-ether inhaler, to initiate the anesthesia with nitrous oxide, before the administration of a more powerful anesthetic. [ Production ] Nitrous oxide production Nitrous oxide is most commonly prepared by careful heating of ammonium nitrate, which decomposes into nitrous oxide and water vapor. [ Holleman A. F. Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry Academic Press San Diego 2001 0-12-352651-5 ] The addition of various phosphate s favors formation of a purer gas at slightly lower temperatures. One of the earliest commercial producers was George Poe in Trenton, New Jersey.

Washington Post February 3, 1914 2007-12-29 ] NH 4 NO 3 (s) → 2 H 2 O (g) + N 2 O (g) This reaction occurs between 170 and 240 °C, temperatures where ammonium nitrate is a moderately sensitive explosive and a very powerful oxidizer. Above 240  °C the exothermic reaction may accelerate to the point of detonation, so the mixture must be cooled to avoid such a disaster. Superheated steam is used to reach reaction temperature in some turnkey production plants. [ http://www.sanghioverseas.com/nitrous_oxide_gas_plants/nitrous_oxide_gas_plants.htm Sanghi Organization Nitrous oxide plant ] Downstream, the hot, corrosive mixture of gases must be cooled to condense the steam, and filtered to remove higher oxides of nitrogen. Ammonium nitrate smoke, as an extremely persistent colloid, will also have to be removed. The cleanup is often done in a train of three gas washes; namely base, acid and base again. Any significant amounts of nitric oxide (NO) may not necessarily be absorbed directly by the base (sodium hydroxide) washes. The nitric oxide impurity is sometimes chelate d out with ferrous sulfate, reduced with iron metal, or oxidised and absorbed in base as a higher oxide. The first base wash may (or may not) react out much of the ammonium nitrate smoke. However, this reaction generates ammonia gas, which may have to be absorbed in the acid wash. [ Other routes ] The direct oxidation of ammonia may someday rival the ammonium nitrate pyrolysis synthesis of nitrous oxide mentioned above. This capital-intensive process, which originates in Japan, uses a manganese dioxide - bismuth oxide catalyst: { Synthesis of Nitrous Oxide by Oxidation of Ammonia T Suwa, A Matsushima, Y Suziki, Y Namina, Kohyo Kagaku Zasshi, 1961; Showa Denka Ltd. } 2 NH 3 + 2 O 2 → N 2 O + 3 H 2 O Higher oxides of nitrogen are formed as impurities. In comparison, uncatalyzed ammonia oxidation (i.e. combustion or explosion) goes primarily to N 2 and H 2 O. Nitrous oxide can be made by heating a solution of sulfamic acid and nitric acid. Many gases are made this way in Bulgaria. [ February 2008 ] { Brozadzhiew &amp; Rettos, 1975. } HNO 3 + NH 2 SO 3 H → N 2 O + H 2 SO 4 + H 2 O There is no explosive hazard in this reaction if the mixing rate is controlled. However, as usual, toxic higher oxides of nitrogen are formed. Nitrous oxide is produced in large volumes as a by-product in the synthesis of adipic acid; one of the two reactants used in nylon manufacture.

Currently much of the gas is decomposed before release for environmental protection. Greener processes may prevail that substitute hydrogen peroxide for nitric acid oxidation; hence no generation of oxide of nitrogen by-products. Hydroxylammonium chloride can react with sodium nitrite to produce N 2 O as well: NH 3 OH + Cl − + NaNO 2 → N 2 O + NaCl + 2 H 2 O If the nitrite is added to the hydroxylamine solution, the only remaining byproduct is salt water. However, if the hydroxylamine solution is added to the nitrite solution (nitrite is in excess), then toxic higher oxides of nitrogen are also formed.Also, HNO 3 can be reduced to N 2 O by SnCl 2 and HCl mixture: 2 HNO 3 + 8 HCl + 4 SnCl 2 → 5 H 2 O + 4 SnCl 4 + N 2 O Natural production of N 2 O occurs through the process of denitrification in oxygen-poor soils and marine environments, in which denitrifying bacteria respire NO 3 -. [ Produced in soil ] Of the entire anthropogenic N 2 O emission (5.7 Tg N 2 O-N yr −1 ), agricultural soils provide 3.5 Tg N 2 O–N yr −1 { IPCC, 2006 }. Nitrous oxide is produced naturally in the soil during the microbial processes of nitrification, denitrification, nitrifier denitrification and others: aerobic autotrophic nitrification, the stepwise oxidation of ammonia (NH 3 ) to nitrite (NO 2 − ) and to nitrate (NO 3 − ) (e.g., Kowalchuk and Stephen, 2001), anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification, the stepwise reduction of NO 3 − to NO 2 −, nitric oxide (NO), N 2 O and ultimately N 2, where facultative anaerobe bacteria use NO 3− as an electron acceptor in the respiration of organic material in the condition of insufficient oxygen (O 2 ) (e.g. Knowles, 1982), and nitrifier denitrification, which is carried out by autotrophic NH 3 −oxidizing bacteria and the pathway whereby ammonia (NH 3 ) is oxidized to nitrite (NO 2 − ), followed by the reduction of NO 2 − to nitric oxide (NO), N 2 O and molecular nitrogen (N 2 ) (e.g., Webster and Hopkins, 1996;Wrage et al., 2001). Other N 2 O production mechanisms include heterotrophic nitrification (Robertson and Kuenen, 1990), aerobic denitrification by the same heterotrophic nitrifiers (Robertson and Kuenen, 1990), fungal denitrification (Laughlin and Stevens, 2002), and non-biological process chemodenitrification (e.g. Chalk and Smith, 1983; Van Cleemput and Baert, 1984; Martikainen and De Boer, 1993; Daum and Schenk, 1998; Mørkved et al., 2007). Soil N 2 O emissions are reported to be controlled by soil chemical and physical properties such as the availability of mineral N, soil pH, organic matter availability, and soil type, and climate related soil properties such as soil temperature and soil water content (e.g., Mosier, 1994; Bouwman, 1996; Beauchamp, 1997; Yamulki et al. 1997; Dobbie and Smith, 2003; Smith et al. 2003; Dalal et al. 2003). [ Properties and reactions ] Nitrous oxide is a colorless, non-toxic gas with a faint, sweet odor. It dissolves in water to give a neutral solution. The equilibrium that exists when nitrous oxide is dissolved in water lies far to the left: [ ⇌ ] N 2 O + H 2 O H 2 N 2 O 2 Nitrous oxide supports combustion by releasing the dative-bonded oxygen radical, thus it can relight a glowing split.N 2 O is inert at room temperature and has few reactions, at elevated temperatures, its reactivity increases. For example, nitrous oxide reacts with NaNH 2 at 460K to give NaN 3 2 NaNH 2 + N 2 O → NaN 3 + NaOH + NH 3 The above reaction is actually the route adopted by commercial chemical industry to produce azide salts, which is used as a detonator. {. } [ Inorganic Chemistry, 3rd Edition Chapter 15: The group 15 elements Catherine E. Housecroft Alan G. Sharpe Pearson 2008 978-0-13-175553-6 464 ] [ Applications ] [ Rocket motors ] Nitrous oxide can be used as an oxidizer in a rocket motor. This has the advantages over other oxidizers in that it is non-toxic and, due to its stability at room temperature, easy to store and relatively safe to carry on a flight. As a secondary benefit it can be readily decomposed to form breathing air. Its high density and low storage pressure enable it to be highly competitive with stored high-pressure gas systems. In a 1914 patent, American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard suggested nitrous oxide and gasoline as possible propellants for a liquid-fueled rocket. Nitrous oxide has been the oxidizer of choice in several hybrid rocket designs (using solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer). The combination of nitrous oxide with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene fuel has been used by SpaceShipOne and others. It is also notably used in amateur and high power rocket ry with various plastic s as the fuel. Nitrous oxide can also be used in a monopropellant rocket. In the presence of a heated catalyst, N 2 O will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately 1300  °C [ April 2012 ]. Because of the large heat release, the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this can provide a monopropellant specific impulse (I sp ) of as much as 180 s. While noticeably less than the I sp available from hydrazine thrusters (monopropellant or bipropellant with nitrogen tetroxide ), the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating. Nitrous oxide is said to deflagrate somewhere around [ 600 C F ] at a pressure of 21  atm. It can also easily be ignited using a combination of the two. At 600  psi for example, the required ignition energy is only 6  J, whereas N2O at 130  psi would not react even with a 2500  J ignition energy input. { NOX as a monopropellant 1 } { NOX as a monopropellant 2 } { NOX as a monopropellant 3 } { NOX as a monopropellant 4 } Specific impulse (I sp ) can be improved by blending a hydrocarbon fuel with the nitrous oxide inside the same storage tank, becoming a nitrous oxide fuel blend (NOFB) monopropellant. This storage mixture does not incur the danger of spontaneous ignition, since N 2 O is chemically stable. When the nitrous oxide decomposes by a heated catalyst, high temperature oxygen is released and rapidly ignites the hydrocarbon fuel-blend. NOFB monopropellants are capable of I [ sp ] greater than 300 seconds, while avoiding the toxicity associated with hypergolic propulsion systems. [ http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20090133788 Nitrous Oxide Fuel Blend Monopropellants Patentdocs 2009-11-11 ] [ http://www.firestar-engineering.com/ FireStar Engineering, LLC FireStar Engineering 2009-12-11 ] The low freezing point of NOFB eases thermal management compared to hydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide—a valuable property for space storable propellants. [ Internal combustion engine ] [ Nitrous ] In vehicle racing, nitrous oxide (often referred to as just &quot; nitrous &quot; ) allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen than air alone, resulting in a more powerful combustion. The gas itself is not flammable at a low pressure/temperature, but it delivers more oxygen than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures. Therefore, it is often mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate. Nitrous oxide is stored as a compressed liquid; the evaporation and expansion of liquid nitrous oxide in the intake manifold causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Nitrous oxide is sometimes injected into (or prior to) the intake manifold, whereas other systems directly inject right before the cylinder (direct port injection) to increase power. The technique was used during World War II by Luftwaffe aircraft with the GM-1 system to boost the power output of aircraft engine s. Originally meant to provide the Luftwaffe standard aircraft with superior high-altitude performance, technological considerations limited its use to extremely high altitudes. Accordingly, it was only used by specialized planes like high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, high-speed bombers, and high-altitude interceptor aircraft. One of the major problems of using nitrous oxide in a reciprocating engine is that it can produce enough power to damage or destroy the engine. Very large power increases are possible, and if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced, the engine may be severely damaged or destroyed during this kind of operation. It is very important with nitrous oxide augmentation of internal combustion engine s to maintain proper operating temperature s and fuel levels to prevent &quot; preignition &quot;, or &quot; detonation &quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot; knock or &quot; pinging &quot; ). Most problems that are associated with nitrous do not come from mechanical failure due to the power increases. Since nitrous allows a much denser charge into the cylinder it dramatically increases cylinder pressures. The increased pressure and temperature can cause problems such as melting the piston or valves. It may also crack or warp the piston or head and cause preignition due to uneven heating. Automotive-grade liquid nitrous oxide differs slightly from medical-grade nitrous oxide. A small amount of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) is added to prevent substance abuse. [ http://www.holley.com/TechService/FAQ.asp?category%3DNOS Holley Holley performance products, FAQ for Nitrous Oxide Systems ] Multiple washes through a base (such as sodium hydroxide ) can remove this, decreasing the corrosive properties observed when SO 2 is further oxidized during combustion into sulfuric acid, making emissions cleaner. [ January 2012 ] [ Aerosol propellant ] The gas is approved for use as a food additive (also known as E942), specifically as an aerosol spray propellant. Its most common uses in this context are in aerosol whipped cream canisters, cooking spray s, and as an inert gas used to displace oxygen, to inhibit bacterial growth, when filling packages of potato chips and other similar snack foods. The gas is extremely soluble in fatty compounds. In aerosol whipped cream, it is dissolved in the fatty cream until it leaves the can, when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam. Used in this way, it produces whipped cream four times the volume of the liquid, whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume. If air were used as a propellant, oxygen would accelerate rancidification of the butterfat; nitrous oxide inhibits such degradation. Carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water, which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer-like &apos;sparkling&apos; sensation. However, the whipped cream produced with nitrous oxide is unstable and will return to a more or less liquid state within half an hour to one hour. Thus, the method is not suitable for decorating food that will not be immediately served. Similarly, cooking spray, which is made from various types of oils combined with lecithin (an emulsifier ), may use nitrous oxide as a propellant; other propellants used in cooking spray include food-grade alcohol and propane. Users of nitrous oxide often obtain it from whipped cream dispensers that use nitrous oxide as a propellant (see above section), for recreational use as a euphoria-inducing inhalant drug. It is not harmful in small doses, but risks due to lack of oxygen do exist (see &apos;&apos; Recreational use below). [ In medicine ] [ Nitrous oxide and oxygen ] { dentistry. } Nitrous oxide has been used for anesthesia in dentistry since December 1844, where Horace Wells made the first 12–15 dental operations with the gas in Hartford. Its debut as a generally accepted method, however, came in 1863, when Gardner Quincy Colton introduced it more broadly at all the Colton Dental Association clinics, that he founded in New Haven and New York City. [ http://books.google.com/?id%3DmYQxRY9umjcC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3DDrug%2BDiscovery%2Bhistory%26amp%3Bcd%3D1 Sneader W Drug Discovery –A History (Part 1: Legacy of the past, chapter 8: systematic medicine, p.74-87) 2005 2010-04-21 John Wiley and Sons 978-0-471-89980-8 ] The first devices used in dentistry to administer the gas, known as Nitrous Oxide inhalers, were designed in a very simple way with the gas stored and breathed through a breathing bag made of rubber cloth, without a scavenger system and flowmeter, and with no addition of oxygen/air. [ http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/citation/1941/07000/Technical_Development_of_Gas_Anesthesia.4.aspx Miller AH Technical Development of Gas Anesthesia Anesthesiology journal (July 1941, vol.2, is.4, p.398-409) 1941 ] Today these simple and somewhat unreliable inhalers have been replaced by the more modern relative analgesia machine, which is an automated machine designed to deliver a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen, for the patient to inhale safely. The machine used in dentistry is designed as a simplified version of the larger anaesthetic machine used by hospitals, as it doesn&apos;t feature the additional anaesthetic vaporiser and medical ventilator. The purpose of the machine allows for a simpler design, as it only delivers a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen for the patient to inhale, in order to depress the feeling of pain while keeping the patient in a conscious state. The relative analgesia machine typically feature a constant-supply flowmeter, which allow the proportion of nitrous oxide and the combined gas flow rate to be individually adjusted. The gas is administered by dentists through a demand-valve inhaler over the nose, which will only release gas when the patient inhales through the nose. Because nitrous oxide is minimally metabolized in humans (with a rate of 0.004%), it retains its potency when exhaled into the room by the patient, and can pose an intoxicating and prolonged exposure hazard to the clinic staff if the room is poorly ventilated. Where nitrous oxide is administered, a continuous-flow fresh-air ventilation system or nitrous scavenger system is used to prevent a waste-gas buildup. Hospitals administer nitrous oxide as one of the anesthetic drugs delivered by anaesthetic machine s. Nitrous oxide is a weak general anesthetic, and so is generally not used alone in general anesthesia. In general anesthesia it is used as a carrier gas in a 2:1 ratio with oxygen for more powerful general anesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood:gas partition coefficient of 0.46. The medical grade gas tanks, with the tradename Entonox and Nitronox contain a mixture with 50%, but this will normally be diluted to a lower percentage upon the operational delivery to the patient. Inhalation of nitrous oxide is frequently used to relieve pain associated with childbirth, trauma, oral surgery, and acute coronary syndrome (includes heart attacks). Its use during labor has been shown to be a safe and effective aid for women wanting to give birth without an epidural. { Nitrous Oxide Analgesia for Childbirth, by Claudia Copeland, Ph.D. &lt; http://www.pregnancy.org/article/nitrous-oxide-analgesia-child-birth &gt; } Its use for acute coronary syndrome is of unknown benefit.

Until at least 1863, a low availability of equipment to produce the gas, combined with a low usage of the gas for medical purposes, meant it was a relatively rare phenomenon that mainly happened among students at medical universities. When equipment became more widely available for dentistry and hospitals, most countries also restricted the legal access to buy pure nitrous oxide gas cylinder s to those sectors. As only medical staff and dentists today are legally allowed to buy the pure gas, the recreational use is also believed to be somewhat limited. The consumers union report from 1972, however found that the use of the gas for recreational purpose still take place in present time, based upon reports of its use in Maryland 1971, Vancouver 1972, and a survey made by Dr. Edward J. Lynn of its nonmedical use in Michigan 1970. [ Nitrous Oxide: It&apos;s a Gas Lynn, Edward J. et al. 1972 http://www.cnsproductions.com/pdf/Lynn.pdf Journal of Psychedelic Drugs ] [ It was not uncommon [in the interviews] to hear from individuals who had been to parties where a professional (doctor, nurse, scientist, inhalation therapist, researcher) had provided nitrous oxide. There also were those who work in restaurants who used the N 2 O stored in tanks for the preparation of whip cream. Reports were received from people who used the gas contained in aerosol cans both of food and non-food products. At a recent rock festival nitrous oxide was widely sold for 25 cents a balloon. Contact was made with a &quot; mystical-religious &quot; group that used the gas to accelerate arriving at their transcendental-meditative state of choice. Although a few, more sophisticated users employed nitrous oxide-oxygen mixes with elaborate equipment, most users used balloons or plastic bags. They either held a breath of N 2 O or rebreathed the gas. There were no adverse effects reported in the more than one hundred individuals surveyed. Edward J. Lynn, et. al Nitrous Oxide: It&apos;s a Gas, Journal of Psychedelic Drugs (1972) ] Inhaling nitrous oxide from tanks used in automotive systems is unsafe, because the toxic gas sulfur dioxide is mixed in around 100  ppm, specifically to discourage recreational use. Some people purify automotive grade nitrous oxide with one of two common techniques. Bubbling the denatured gas through strong sodium hydroxide so lution works though is quite complicated and dangerous due to hazardous chemicals, high pressure and the dangers of the gas itself. The other method, gaining popularity in recent years, [ April 2012 ] uses a gas mask canister that is effective against the denaturant. Products utilizing this method are slowly gaining in popularity. [ April 2012 ] Whipped cream chargers as well as cans of whipped cream are the most common sources of N2O used recreationally. Denatured automotive grade nitrous oxide is becoming more popular because of the significantly lower price at ~1/6 the cost of chargers. [ April 2012 ] In Australia, nitrous oxide bulbs are known as nangs, possibly derived from the sound distortion perceived by consumers. { nang at } { Urban Dictionary, retrieved 2011-08-29 } [ Neuropharmacology ] The pharmacological mechanism of action of N 2 O in medicine is not fully known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of ligand-gated ion channel s, and this likely plays a major role in many of its effects. It moderately blocks NMDA and β 2 -subunit -containing nACh channel s, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABA C, and 5-HT 3 receptor s, and slightly potentiates GABA A and glycine receptor s.

[ Emmanouil DE, Quock RM Advances in Understanding the Actions of Nitrous Oxide Anesthesia Progress 54 1 9–18 2007 17352529 1821130 10.2344/0003-3006(2007)54[9:AIUTAO]2.0.CO;2 0003-3006 ] In addition to its effects on ion channels, N 2 O may act to imitate nitric oxide (NO) in the central nervous system as well, and this may be related to its analgesic and anxiolytic properties. [ Anxiolytic effect ] In behavioral tests of anxiety, a low dose of N 2 O is an effective anxiolytic, and this anti-anxiety effect is associated with enhanced activity of GABA A receptors, as it is partially reversed by benzodiazepine receptor antagonist s. Mirroring this, animals which have developed tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepine s are partially tolerant to N 2 O.

When animals are given morphine chronically they develop tolerance to its pain-killing effects, and this also renders the animals tolerant to the analgesic effects of N 2 O. [ Tolerance to nitrous oxide analgesia in rats and mice Berkowitz, B.A., Finck, A.D., Hynes, M.D. &amp; Ngai, S.H. Anesthesiology 51 4 309–12 1979 10.1097/00000542-197910000-00006 484891 ] Administration of antibodies which bind and block the activity of some endogenous opioids (not β-endorphin ) also block the antinociceptive effects of N 2 O. [ Role of brain dynorphin in nitrous oxide antinociception in mice Branda, E.M., Ramza, J.T., Cahill, F.J., Tseng, L.F. &amp; Quock, R.M. Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 65 217–21 2000 10.1016/S0091-3057(99)00202-6 2 ] Drugs which inhibit the breakdown of endogenous opioids also potentiate the antinociceptive effects of N 2 O. Several experiments have shown that opioid receptor antagonists applied directly to the brain block the antinociceptive effects of N 2 O, but these drugs have no effect when injected into the spinal cord. Conversely, α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists block the antinociceptive effects of N 2 O when given directly to the spinal cord, but not when applied directly to the brain. [ Nitrous oxide produces antinociceptive response via alpha2B and/or alpha2C adrenoceptor subtypes in mice Guo, T.Z., Davies, M.F., Kingery, W.S., Patterson, A.J., Limbird, L.E. &amp; Maze, M.

J. Neurosci. 20 24 9242–51 2000 11125002 ] It seems N 2 O-induced release of endogenous opioids causes disinhibition of brain stem noradrenergic neurons, which release norepinephrine into the spinal cord and inhibit pain signaling.

[ Euphoric effect ] In rats, N 2 O stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway via inducing dopamine release and activating dopaminergic neuron s in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, presumably through antagonization of NMDA receptors localized in the system.

However, it is remarkable that in mice, N 2 O blocks amphetamine -induced carrier-mediated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavioral sensitization, abolishes the conditioned place preference (CPP) of cocaine and morphine, and does not produce reinforcing (or aversive) effects of its own.

Moreover, Olney&apos;s lesions have never been observed in primates (including humans). However, Olney&apos;s lesions must be observed within a few hours of death, which may explain why they have not been observed in primates. After a few hours, depending on dose, the vacuoles that have appeared in the neurons resolve. If the dose is large enough to kill neurons, glial cells fill in any spaces left by the dead neurons within a short time, making it impossible to tell that neurons were even there.

It is then impossible to determine if brain injury does result from the use of nitrous oxide, it is most likely that it does not cause cell death, because exposure is typically not long enough to do so. [ Vitamin B12 Interference ] Nitrous oxide anesthesia may precipitate serious neurological damage in people with unrecognized deficiency of vitamin B12. Chronic exposure to nitrous oxide may cause neurological damage even when the serum level of B12 is within normal range. [ March 2012 ] [ Safety ] The major safety hazards of nitrous oxide come from the fact that it is a compressed liquefied gas, an asphyxiation risk, and a dissociative anaesthetic.

Additionally, estimated emissions from agricultural soils were 6% higher in 2008 than 1990. According to 2006 data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, industrial sources make up only about 20% of all anthropogenic sources, and include the production of nylon, and the burning of fossil fuel in internal combustion engines.

India&apos;s gas cylinder rules (1985) permit the transfer of gas from one cylinder to another for breathing purposes. This law benefits remote hospitals, which would otherwise suffer as a result of India&apos;s geographic immensity. Nitrous Oxide IP is transferred from bulk cylinders (17,000 liters capacity gas) to smaller pin-indexed valve cylinders (1,800 liters of gas), which are then connected to the yoke assembly of Boyle&apos;s machine s. Because India&apos;s Food &amp; Drug Authority (FDA-India) rules state that transferring a drug from one container to another (refilling) is equivalent to manufacturing, anyone found doing so must possess a drug manufacturing license.
