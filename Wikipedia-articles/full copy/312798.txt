First to Zion), is the fourth-largest city in Israel, located along the central Israeli coastal plain 12 kilometers south of Tel Aviv. It is part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area. The city had a population of 228,200 at the end of 2009. Founded in 1882 by European Jewish immigrants, it was the second Jewish farm colony established in Land of Israel in the 19th century, after Petah Tikva. [ Etymology ] The name Rishon LeZion is derived from a biblical verse: &quot; First to Zion are they, and I shall give herald to Jerusalem &quot; [ ראשון לציון הנה הינם, ולירושלים מבשר אתן ] { ) } ( Isaiah 41:27) and literally translates as &quot; First to Zion &quot;. [ History ] Rishon LeZion was founded on July 31, 1882 by ten Hovevei Zion pioneers from Kharkov, Ukraine (then the Russian Empire ) headed by Zalman David Levontin. Reuven Yudalevich was also a member of the group. The pioneers purchased [ 835 acres 2 on out ] of land southeast of present-day Tel Aviv, part of the townland of the Arab village of Ayun Kara (literally &apos; fountain of the crier&apos;). [ http://onlinedictionary.datasegment.com/word/enhakkore Definition of enhakkore Onlinedictionary.datasegment.com September 24, 2011 ] Ayun Kara was the scene of a bloody battle between Turkish and New Zealand troops on November 14, 1917.

The soil was sandy, water was scarce and the settlers had no agricultural experience. After a well was dug and more pioneers arrived – the Bilu im – the colony slowly took shape. Notable members of this group include Fani Belkind, Israel Belkind, Shimshon Belkind, Yoel Drubin, Dr. Haim Hissin, and David Yudilovich. When Baron Edmond James de Rothschild took over, sending in his administrators, major progress was made in the spheres of agriculture, citrus and viticulture. Under Rothschild&apos;s patronage, the Carmel-Mizrahi Winery was established in 1886. David Ben-Gurion was head of workers&apos; union at the winery before later becoming Israel &apos;s first Prime Minister. The first Hebrew school in the country opened in Rishon LeZion in 1889.

Baron Rothschild brought in experts who located water at 42 meters below ground. The groundwater table in the area was found to be uneven and wells were mostly constructed at between 20 and 25 meters in depth. Orchards were then developed around the settlement, and by the late 1920s the city developed a burgeoning citrus industry. Rishon was declared a city in 1950. By 1983 it had a population of 103,000. In 2006, 222,300 people were living in the city. By 2020, the population is expected to reach 315,000.
