[ Vincent Chin ] Vincent Jen Chin [ Henry Yee and the Estate of Vincent Chin (deceased) vs. Ronald Ebens, Michael Nitz, and Fancy Pants lounge 83-309788 CZ Mich 3rd Cir 1983 ] ( [ 陳 果 仁 陈 果 仁 Chén Guǒrén ]; May 18, 1955 – June 23, 1982) was a Chinese American beaten to death in June 1982 in the United States, in the Detroit, Michigan enclave of Highland Park by Chrysler plant superintendent Ronald Ebens, with the help of his stepson, Michael Nitz. The murder generated public outrage over the lenient sentencing the two men originally received in a plea bargain, as the attack, which included blows to the head from a baseball bat, possessed many attributes consistent with hate crime s. Many of the layoffs in Detroit&apos;s auto industry, including Nitz&apos;s in 1979, had been due to the increasing market share of Japanese automakers, leading to allegations that Chinese American Vincent Chin received racially charged comments before his death. The case became a rallying point for the Asian American community, and Ebens and Nitz were put on trial for violating Chin&apos;s civil rights. Because the subsequent Federal prosecution was a result of public pressure from a coalition of many Asian ethnic organizations, Vincent Chin&apos;s murder is often considered the beginning of a pan-ethnic Asian American movement.

The group was thrown out and after a heated exchange of words subsequently parted ways. Ebens instigated the incident by declaring, &quot; It&apos;s because of you little motherfucker s that we&apos;re out of work! &quot; referring to U.S. auto manufacturing jobs being lost to Japan, despite the fact that Chin was not Japanese. Ebens and Nitz searched the neighborhood for 20 to 30 minutes and even paid another man 20 dollars to help look for Chin, { Bedi, Sheila (2003). &quot; The Constructed Identities of Asian and African Americans: A Story of Two Races and the Criminal Justice System. Havard Blackletter Law Journal. 19, 181 – 199 } before finding him at a McDonald&apos;s restaurant. Chin tried to escape, but was held by Nitz while Ebens repeatedly bludgeoned Chin with a baseball bat. Chin was struck at least four times with the bat, including blows to the head. When rushed to Henry Ford Hospital, he was unconscious and died after four days in a coma, on June 23, 1982. [ Legal history ] [ State criminal charges ] Ronald Ebens was arrested and taken into custody at the scene of the murder by two off-duty police officers who had witnessed the beating. [ Weingarten Paul Deadly Encounter Chicago Tribune July 31, 1983 ] Ebens and Nitz were convicted in a county court for manslaughter by Wayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman, after a plea bargain brought the charges down from second-degree murder. They served no jail time, were given three years probation, fined $3,000 and ordered to pay $780 in court costs. In a response letter to protests from American Citizens for Justice, Kaufman said, &quot; These weren&apos;t the kind of men you send to jail... You don&apos;t make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal. &quot; [ Asian American Dreams Helen Zia Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux 0-374-14774-4 2000 ] [ Federal civil rights charges ] The verdict angered the Asian American community in the Detroit area and around the country.

Le Asian-Nation Asian-Nation: Anti-Asian Racism 2007-03-14 ] Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Cheuk May Chan (陳綽薇) led the fight for federal charges, which resulted in the men being accused of two counts of violating Chin&apos;s civil rights, under Section 245 of Title 18 of the United States Code. For these charges, it was not enough that Ebens had injured Chin, but that &quot; a substantial motivating factor for the defendant&apos;s actions was Mr. Chin&apos;s race, color, or national origin, and because Mr. Chin had been enjoying a place of entertainment which serves the public. &quot; { Defendant&apos;s Requested Jury Instruction No. 30, U.S. v. Ebens } Because of possible mitigating factors that could lead to reasonable doubt, such as intoxication leading to the defendant&apos;s inability to form the specific intent, { Defendant&apos;s Requested Jury Instruction No. 18, U.S. v. Ebens } the prosecution&apos;s proving the evidence of uttered racial slurs were not self-sufficient for conviction. { Defendant&apos;s Requested Jury Instruction No. 31, U.S. v. Ebens } In addition, the defense found Racine Colwell, the witness who overheard the &quot; It&apos;s because of you motherfuckers we&apos;re out of work &quot; remark, to have received some clemency on a jail sentence for a prostitution charge, which suggested that the government may have tried to cut a deal for her testimony. { U.S. vs. Ebens transcript, Tuesday, June 19, 1984, p.209-211 } The 1984 federal civil rights case against the men found Ebens guilty of the second count and sentenced him to 25 years in prison; Nitz was acquitted of both counts. After an appeal, Ebens&apos; conviction was overturned in 1986 —a federal appeals court found an attorney improperly coached prosecution witness es. [ US. v. Ebens 800 F.2d 1422 U.S. App. 6th Cir. 1986 ] After a retrial that was moved to Cincinnati, Ohio due to the publicity the case had received in Detroit, a jury cleared Ebens of all charges in 1987. [ US. v. Ebens 654 F. Supp. 144 E.D. Mich. 1987 ] [ Civil suits ] A civil suit for the unlawful death of Vincent Chin was settled out of court on March 23, 1987. Michael Nitz was ordered to pay $50,000 in $30 weekly installments over the following 10 years. Ronald Ebens was ordered to pay $1.5 million, at $200/month for the first two years and 25% of his income or $200/month thereafter, whichever was greater. This represented the projected loss of income from Vincent Chin&apos;s engineering position, as well as Lily Chin&apos;s loss of Vincent&apos;s services as laborer and driver. However, the estate of Vincent Chin would not be allowed to garnish social security, disability, or Ebens&apos; pension from Chrysler, nor could the estate place a lien on Ebens&apos; house. In November 1989, Ebens was forced to reappear in court for a creditor&apos;s hearing, where he detailed his finances and reportedly pledged to make good on his debt to the Chin estate.

Ebens 97-727321-CZ Mich 3rd Cir 1997 ] the Chin estate was forced to renew the civil suit, as it was allowed to do every ten years. With accrued interest and other charges, the adjusted total became $4,683,653.89.

Nevertheless, during a 1998 House of Representatives hearing on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1997, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. suggested that the problem in making people sufficiently aware of the causes for and injustices of the Vincent Chin case was that it was a political &quot; hot potato &quot; that did not get picked up for &quot; political reasons &quot; with respect to the automobile industry.
