Succinate plays a biochemical role in the citric acid cycle. The name derives from Latin succinum, meaning amber, from which the acid may be obtained. The carboxylate anion is called succinate and ester s of succinic acid are called alkyl succinates. At room temperature, pure succinic acid is a solid that forms colorless, odorless crystals. It has a melting point of 185 °C and a boiling point of 235 °C. It is a diprotic acid. [ History ] Spirit of amber was originally procured from amber by pulverising and distilling it using a sand bath. It was chiefly used externally for rheumatic aches and pains, and internally in inveterate gleet s. Succinic acid is now used within the food and beverage industry, primarily as a sweetener. Global production is estimated at 16,000 to 30,000 tonnes a year, with an annual growth rate of 10%. { NNFCC Renewable Chemicals Factsheet: Succinic Acid } [ Biochemical role ] Succinate is a component of the citric acid cycle and is capable of donating electron s to the electron transport chain by the reaction: succinate + FAD → fumarate + FADH 2. This is catalysed by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (or complex II of the mitochondrial ETC). The complex is a 4 subunit membrane-bound lipoprotein which couples the oxidation of succinate to the reduction of ubiquinone. Intermediate electron carriers are FAD and three Fe 2 S 2 clusters part of subunit B. Succinic acid can be converted into fumaric acid by oxidation. The diethyl ester is a substrate in the Stobbe condensation. [ Fermentation ] [ Acids in wine ] Succinic acid is created as a byproduct of the fermentation of sugar. It lends to fermented beverages such as wine and beer a common taste that is a combination of saltiness, bitterness and acidity. { Peynaud, Emile (1984) Knowing and Making Wine. } [ Interactive pathway map ] [ Succinic_acid ] [ Safety ] The acid is combustible and corrosive, capable of causing burns. In nutraceutical form as a food additive and dietary supplement, is safe and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. { http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/iig/index.cfm } As an excipient in pharmaceutical products it is used to control acidity { http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/Drugtopics.com+Exclusives/Overview-of-pharmaceutical-excipients-used-in-tabl/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/561047 } and, more rarely, in effervescent tablets.
