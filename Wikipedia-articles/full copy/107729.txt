Novato is located about [ 10 mi km 0 ] north-northwest of San Rafael, [ 673 ] at an elevation of 30 feet above sea level (nine meters). The 2010 U.S. Census estimated the city population to be about 51,904. Novato is about [ 30 mi km ] north of San Francisco on U.S. 101. [ History ] What is now Novato was originally the site of several Coast Miwok villages: Chokeche, near downtown Novato, Puyuku, near Ignacio, and Olompali, at the present Olompali State Historic Park. { Peterson, Bonnie J. (1976). Dawn of the World: Coast Miwok Myths. ISBN 0-912908-04-1 } In 1839 the Mexican government granted the [ 8876 acre km2 on ] Rancho Novato to Fernando Feliz. The rancho was named after a local Miwok leader who had probably been given the name of Saint Novatus at his baptism. [ Bright, William (1998) 1500 California Place Names University of California Press 978-0-520-21271-8 ] Subsequently four additional land grant s were made in the area; Rancho Corte Madera de Novato to John Martin in 1839, Rancho San Jose to Ignacio Pacheco in 1840, Rancho Olompali awarded in 1843 to Camilo Ynitia, son of a Coast Miwok chief, and Rancho Nicasio, by far the largest at [ 56621 acre km2 1 ], awarded to Pablo de la Guerra and John B.R. Cooper in 1844. { Marin County Ranchos } Novato, along with the rest of California, became part of the United States on February 2, 1848. Early pioneers included Joseph Sweetser and Francis De Long who bought [ 15000 acre km2 0 ] in the mid-1850s and planted orchards and vineyards. The first post office at Novato opened in 1856; it closed in 1860, and a new post office opened in 1891. The first school was built in 1859 at the corner of Grant Avenue at what is today Redwood Boulevard. The original town was located around Novato Creek at what is now South Novato Boulevard. A railroad was built in 1879, connecting Novato to Sonoma County and San Rafael. The area around the train depot became known as New Town, and forms the edge of what today is Old Town Novato. The current depot was built in 1917, but closed in 1959 and is largely derelict. The depot consisted of two buildings, a warehouse and a station. The warehouse burned twice in the intervening years and was torn down in late 2007 to make way for a Whole Foods development, while the station is still standing. A Presbyterian church, still a landmark in Novato today, was built in 1896. Until 2006 it housed a number of City offices, but was vacated that year due to safety concerns and condemned. The church has since been renovated. The Great Depression of the 1930s had a marked effect on the area as many farmers lost their land. After World War II, Novato grew quickly with the construction of tract homes and a freeway. As the area was unincorporated much of the growth was unplanned and uncontrolled. Novato was finally incorporated as a city in 1960. One of the most important venues of the time (1960 to 1965) was &quot; Western Weekend &quot;. Beard growing contests sponsored by Bob&apos;s Barber Shop and many other odd activities helped to bring this community together. A program titled A Century of Gentle Seasons, The History of Novato, was released on DVD in 2009 and tells the varied stories of Novato&apos;s vibrant community. Novato was deemed &quot; America&apos;s Least Eligible Town &quot; by Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s Handsome Men&apos;s Club in their 2011 award ceremonies.
