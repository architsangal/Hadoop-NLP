As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient conspiracy, encountering organizations such as Majestic 12, the Illuminati, and the Hong Kong Triad s throughout his journey. First published for personal computers running Windows, Deus Ex was later ported to Macintosh systems, as well the PlayStation 2 game console, the latter under the title Deus Ex: The Conspiracy. Loki Games worked on a Linux version of the game, but the company went out of business before releasing it.

The player assumes the role of JC Denton, a nanotech -augmented operative of the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). { Deus Ex game manual } This nanotechnology is a central gameplay mechanism, and allows players to perform superhuman feats. [ Role-playing elements ] As the player accomplishes objectives, the player character is rewarded with &quot; skill points &quot;. Skill points are used to enhance a character&apos;s abilities in eleven different areas, and were designed to provide players with a way to customize their characters; a player might create a combat-focused character by increasing proficiency with pistols or rifles, while a more furtive character can be created by focusing on lock picking and computer hacking abilities. There are four different levels of proficiency in each skill, with the skill point cost increasing for each successive level. [ PC Gamer Deus Exreview Kieron Gillen http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/?page_id%3D16 Kieron Gillen 87 2010-02-14 ] [ April 2012 H3llBot ] Weapons may be customized through &quot; weapon modifications &quot;, which can be found or purchased throughout the game. The player might add scopes, silencers, or laser sight s; increase the weapon&apos;s range, accuracy, or magazine size; or decrease its recoil and reload time. Not all modifications are available to all weapons; for example, a rocket launcher cannot be silenced, and recoil cannot be reduced on a flamethrower. Players are further encouraged to customize their characters through nano-augmentations— cybernetic devices that grant characters superhuman powers. While the game contains eighteen different nano-augmentations, the player can install a maximum of nine, as each must be used on a certain part of the body: one in the arms, legs, eyes, and head; two underneath the skin; and three in the torso. [ Deus Ex @ GameBanshee http://www.gamebanshee.com/deusex/augmentations.php 2007-11-09 ] This forces the player to choose carefully between the benefits offered by each augmentation. For example, the arm augmentation requires the player to decide between boosting their character&apos;s skill in hand-to-hand combat or his ability to lift heavy objects. Interaction with non-player characters was a large design focus. When the player interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene -like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting from a list of dialogue options. The player&apos;s choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance). [ Combat elements ] Deus Ex features combat similar to first-person shooters, with real-time action, a first-person perspective, and reflex-based gameplay. As the player will often encounter enemies in groups, combat often tends toward a tactical approach, including the use of cover, strafing, and &quot; hit-and-run &quot;. A USA Today reviewer found &quot; At the easiest difficulty setting, your character is pureed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth. &quot; [ Berman A.S.

[ Deus Ex Augmentation Guide v1.3 http://faqs.neoseeker.com/Games/PC/deus_ex_augmentation_masterofthevg.txt?k%3D1992 2007-11-09 ] Non-player characters will praise or criticize the main character depending on his use of force, incorporating a moral element into the gameplay.

How quickly the reticle shrinks depends on the character&apos;s proficiency with the equipped weapon, the number of accuracy modifications added to the weapon, and the level of the &quot; targeting &quot; nano-augmentation. Deus Ex features twenty-four weapons, ranging from crowbars, electroshock weapon s, and riot baton, to laser guided anti-tank rocket s and assault rifle s; both lethal and non-lethal weapons are available. The player can also make use of several weapons of opportunity, such as fire extinguisher s. [ Player choice ] Players are given multiple ways to traverse obstacles, from lockpicking to armed combat. Gameplay in Deus Ex emphasizes player choice, which GameSpot &apos;s review explains: &quot; Deus Ex is quite long for an action-packed first-person game &quot;, it states, &quot; but even so, most of its situations present you with two or three possible solutions. &quot; [ http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/deusex/review.html Deus Ex for PC review Gamespot Greg Kasavin September 22, 2006 ] Objectives can be completed in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and certain aspects of the story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its &quot; boss &quot; villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player. Because of its design focus on player choice, Deus Ex has been compared with System Shock, a game that inspired its design.

[ Multiplayer ] Deus Ex was designed as a single player game, and the initial releases of the Windows and Macintosh versions of the game did not include multiplayer functionality. [ http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/specials/special.pl?spec%3Ddeusex%26amp%3Bpagenum%3D1 Interview with Warren Spector www.gaming-age.com Patrick Klepek 2006-12-13 ] Support for multiplayer modes was later incorporated through patches.

Only five maps, based on levels from the single-player portion of the game, were included with the original multiplayer patch, but many user-created maps now exist. The PlayStation 2 release of Deus Ex does not offer a multiplayer mode. [ http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p%3Dagg%26amp%3Bsql%3D1%3A34996 Deus Ex: The Conspiracy overview allgame.com Storn A. Cook March 10, 2007 ] [ Plot ] [ Setting ] Deus Ex takes place in a dystopia n future in a world that draws heavily upon present day conspiracy theories. This dark setting is enhanced by the fact that the entire game takes place at night, a backdrop that adds to the atmosphere of conspiracies and stealth. The game contradicts itself in several instances regarding the exact year in which the events of the story take place, but information in the sequel Deus Ex: Invisible War reconciles this inconsistency via retroactive continuity, placing the events of Deus Ex in the year 2052. [ http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/april02/dxbible/dx1/ DX1 Continuity Bible: Part I Gamespy The Deus Ex Team March 11, 2007 ] Most of the game takes place in fictionalized versions of real-world locations, including New York City, Hong Kong, Paris, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Area 51. The plot of Deus Ex depicts a society on a slow spiral into chaos. A lethal pandemic known as the &quot; Gray Death &quot; ravages the world&apos;s population, especially within the United States, and has no cure. A synthetic vaccine, &quot; Ambrosia &quot;, manufactured by the company VersaLife, nullifies the effects of the virus, but is in critically short supply. Because of its scarcity, Ambrosia is available only to those deemed &quot; vital to the social order &quot;, and finds its way primarily to government officials, military personnel, the rich and influential, scientists, and the intellectual elite. With no hope for the common people of the world, riots occur worldwide, and a number of terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden, among them the National Secessionist Force of the U.S. and a French group known as Silhouette. In order to combat these threats to the world order, the United Nations has greatly expanded its governmental influence around the globe. The United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) is formed, with the intent of maintaining peace internationally and combating the world&apos;s ever-growing number of terrorist groups. { Wendi White (in Righteous Angels: Perspectives on UNATCO ): As the giddiness that greeted the new millennium faded to grim apathy in the face of the plague, famine, and the inevitable waves of national convulsions that followed in their wake, the United Nations found itself increasingly outmoded and unable to cope with the worldwide rise in terrorism. } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] It is headquartered near New York City in a bunker beneath Liberty Island, placed there after a terrorist strike on the Statue of Liberty. { UNATCO Handbook: UNATCO and the World :Not only did the United States become a charter member of UNATCO, but UNATCO headquarters are now located on Liberty Island in the shadow of that shattered monument to FREEDOM. &quot; } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] [ Synopsis ] The player assumes the identity of JC Denton, a nanotechnologically -augmented ( &quot; nano-aug &quot; ) UNATCO agent. After completing his training, JC takes several missions given by Director Joseph Manderley to track down members of the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) and their stolen shipments of the &quot; Ambrosia &quot; vaccine, the cure for the &quot; Gray Death &quot; virus. Through these missions, JC is reunited with his brother, Paul, who is also nano-augmented. JC tracks the Ambrosia shipment to a private terminal at LaGuardia Airport. Paul meets JC outside the plane, and explains that he has defected from UNATCO and is now working with the NSF after learning that the Gray Death is a man-made virus, with UNATCO using its power to make sure only the elite receive the vaccine. { Paul: The Gray Death is a man-made virus. Everyone up to the President is at UNATCO&apos;s mercy as long as UNATCO controls the supply of Ambrosia. / JC: You believe that? / Paul: We have proof. We need to get the Ambrosia to Hong Kong. Heard of Tracer Tong? He can help us synthesize it ourselves. } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] JC returns to UNATCO headquarters and is told by Manderley that both he and Paul have been outfitted with a 24-hour kill switch, and that Paul&apos;s has been activated due to his betrayal. Manderley orders JC to fly to Hong Kong to eliminate Tracer Tong, a hacker whom Paul has contact with, and who can disable the kill switches. Instead, JC returns to Paul&apos;s apartment to find Paul hiding inside. Paul further explains his defection and encourages JC to also defect by sending out a distress call to alert the NSF&apos;s allies. Upon doing so, JC becomes a wanted man by UNATCO, and his own kill switch is activated by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director Walton Simons. JC is unable to escape UNATCO forces, and both he and Paul (provided he survived the raid on the apartment) are taken to a secret prison below UNATCO headquarters. An entity named &quot; Daedalus &quot; contacts JC and informs him that the prison is part of Majestic 12, and arranges for him and Paul to escape. The two flee to Hong Kong to meet with Tong, who deactivates their kill switches. Tong requests JC infiltrate the VersaLife building. Doing so, JC discovers that the corporation is the source for the Gray Death, and he is able to steal the plans for the virus and destroy the &quot; universal constructor &quot; that produces it. { Daedalus: Majestic 12 seeks to use force and intimidation to seize absolute control. Of everything. They will not hesitate to use all means necessary to achieve this goal, and have engineered the disease you refer to as the &quot; Gray Death &quot; in an effort to accomplish this. The Gray Death is a nanotechnologically engineered virus. You must locate the Universal Constructor used to create the Gray Death and destroy it. My information indicates that it is in Hong Kong, housed in a Majestic 12 facility beneath the corporation known as VersaLife. } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] Analysis of the virus shows it was manufactured by the Illuminati, prompting Tong to send JC to Paris to try to make contact with the organization and obtain their help fighting Majestic 12. JC eventually meets with Illuminati leader Morgan Everett, and learns that the Gray Death virus was intended to be used for augmentation technology, but Majestic 12, led by trillionaire businessman and former Illuminatus Bob Page, was able to steal and repurpose it into its current viral form. Everett recognizes that without VersaLife&apos;s universal constructor, Majestic 12 can no longer create the virus, and will likely target Vandenberg Air Force Base, where X-51, a group of former Area 51 scientists, has built another one. After aiding the base personnel in repelling a Majestic 12 attack, JC meets X-51 leader Gary Savage, who reveals that Daedalus is an artificial intelligence borne out of the ECHELON program. Everett attempts to gain control over Majestic 12&apos;s communications network by releasing Daedalus onto the U.S. military networks, but Page counters by releasing his own AI, Icarus, which merges with Daedalus to form a new AI, Helios, with the ability to control all global communications. After this, Savage enlists JC&apos;s help in procuring schematics for reconstructing components for the UC that were damaged during Majestic 12&apos;s raid of Vandenberg. JC finds the schematics and electronically transmits them to Savage, but they are intercepted by Page as well, who launches a nuclear missile at Vandenberg to ensure that Area 51, which is now Majestic 12&apos;s headquarters, will be the only location in the world with an operational UC. However, JC is able to reprogram the missile to strike Area 51. JC then travels there himself to confront Page. When JC locates him, Page reveals that he seeks to merge with Helios and gain full control over all nanotechnology. JC is contacted by Tong, Everett, and the Helios AI simultaneously. All three factions ask for his help in defeating Page, while furthering their own objectives, and JC is forced to choose between them. Tong seeks to plunge the world into a second Dark Age by destroying the global communications hub and preventing anyone from taking control of the world. { JC Denton: If we destroy the Aquinas Hub, we&apos;ll take down the global network. / Tracer Tong: Exactly. They dug their own grave, JC. We&apos;re going to eliminate global communications altogether. / JC: I don&apos;t know... sounds like overkill. / Tong: As long as technology has a global reach, someone will have the world in the palm of his hand. If not Bob Page, then Everett, Dowd... / JC: Another Stone Age would hardly be an improvement. / Tong: Not so drastic. A dark age, an age of city-states, craftsmen, government on a scale comprehensible to its citizens. } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] Everett offers Denton the chance to bring the Illuminati back to power by killing Bob Page and using the technology of Area 51 to rule the world with an invisible hand. { Everett: No, JC. Spare the facility. Spare Helios, the power station. They can be made to serve us. / JC: Us? / Everett: You and me, JC. We&apos;ll rule the world in secret, with an invisible hand, the way the Illuminati have always ruled. } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] Helios wishes to merge with Denton and rule the world as a benevolent dictator with infinite knowledge and reason. { Helios: You are ready. I do not wish to wait for Bob Page. With human understanding and network access, we can administrate the world, yes, yes. / JC: Rule the world...? Why? Who gave you the directive? There must be a human being behind your ambition. / Helios: I should regulate human affairs precisely because I lack all ambition, whereas human beings are prey to it. Their history is a succession of inane squabbles, each one coming closer to total destruction. } [ Deus Ex Ion Storm Inc. Eidos Interactive 2002-03-25 PlayStation 2 ] The player&apos;s decision determines the course of the future, and brings the game to a close. [ Literary and popular culture allusions ] { The Man Who Was Thursday &apos;&apos; } [ Name etymology ] The title &quot; Deus Ex &quot; is derived from the Latin expression deus ex machina, literally meaning &quot; god out of the machine &quot;. It is used in drama and literature to describe an outside force that suddenly solves the seemingly unsolvable problem(s) the characters face in an extremely unlikely or impossible way. Warren Spector, executive producer for Deus Ex, has stated the name was both meant as a reference to the various factions in the game who aspire to god-like powers, as well as a dig at the typical video game plot, which tends to be laden with &quot; deus ex machina &quot; artifices and other poor script writing techniques. [ http://www.rpgfan.com/archive/1998/06.html Deus Ex Interview! Rpgfan Webber December 20, 2006 ] What the JC initialism in the protagonist&apos;s codename, JC Denton, means is unclear. The story itself makes no references to what the initials stand for. Harvey Smith, lead designer for Deus Ex, has stated that originally JC was supposed to be a descendant of Jesus Christ; however, Warren Spector has said the name &quot; JC &quot; was chosen for its unisex qualities when the developers were still planning to let the player choose the gender of the main character, which was used later in the game&apos;s first sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War, where the player took on the unisex name &apos;Alex D&apos; and could choose for the protagonist to be either male or female.

These various bits of media serve a variety of purposes, from providing the player with useful gameplay information (such as a needed keycode), to the advancement of the plot, to the creation of atmosphere and metafictional irony. It is this last aspect that is most prevalent in the novels found in Deus Ex, with excerpts usually providing reflective commentary on the player&apos;s current situation. Such real-life works as The Man Who Was Thursday by G. K. Chesterton, Sun Tzu &apos;s The Art of War, Common Sense by Thomas Paine, and Shakespeare&apos;s Richard III are used for this purpose throughout the game. Along with these is Jacob&apos;s Shadow, a work of fiction created by Chris Todd, one of the writers for the game. It is attributed to the fictitious author Andrew Hammond (in homage to crime writer Andrew Vachss ). [ http://www.deusex-machina.com/articles/makingofdeusex.asp Behind the Scenes Look in the Making of Deus Ex September 28, 2006 Eberon DeusEx-Machina.com ] The first chapter displayed is Chapter Twelve with a subsequent six other chapters (fifteen, twenty, twenty-three, twenty-seven, thirty-two, and thirty-four) that portray the cyberpunk themes of the game in the style of William Gibson. The book appears to be a violent, spiritual journey of a man named Jacob as he searches for a woman, who is never named, through a city described as &apos;Hell&apos;. [ http://www.7crows.com/archives/2000/01/entry_39.html Jacob&apos;s Shadow 7crows Todd, Chris December 18, 2006 ] A chapter from a &quot; sequel &quot; to Jacob&apos;s Shadow, titled Jacob&apos;s War, can be found in the game&apos;s sequel Deus Ex: Invisible War. A number of other more subtle fiction references also permeate the game. For instance, The Man Who Was Thursday protagonist Gabriel Syme&apos;s name appears in a hotel register, along with the names of fellow literary characters Gully Foyle, Oberst Enzian, Smilla Jasperson, and Hippolyta Hall (from the The Stars My Destination, Gravity&apos;s Rainbow, Smilla&apos;s Sense of Snow, and various DC Comics series respectively). Another comic reference is &quot; Harleen Quinzel &quot;, being an MJ12 employee who sends an e-mail out about a &quot; company picnic &quot;. Other literary sources alluded to include Olaf Stapledon &apos;s Last and First Men, Neal Stephenson &apos;s cyberpunk novel The Diamond Age, Isaac Asimov &apos;s Foundation series, and the Ancient Greek myth of Icarus and Daedalus. The name of the AI Helios and the merging of JC with it may also be a reference to Euripedes &apos; Medea, Medea appearing at the end of the play in the sun god Helios&apos; chariot (a machine from the gods). Continuing the seam of literature references &quot; O &quot; and &quot; René &quot; from Histoire d&apos;O can be found in conversation in Flat 12 in Paris. Allusion s are also incorporated into computer security passwords and e-mails encountered during the course of the game. An instance of this is the code &quot; reindeerflotilla &quot;, a password originally used in the 1982 science fiction film Tron. Another is an e-mail found on Paul Denton&apos;s computer containing a notice from a movie rental company. It mentions the fictional movies See You Next Wednesday and Blue Harvest. &quot; See You Next Wednesday &quot; is a reference to the famous signature appearing in most of John Landis &apos; films, while Blue Harvest was the code name used during the filming of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Gunther&apos;s killphrase &quot; Laputan Machine &quot; is a reference to the fictional island of Laputa from Gulliver&apos;s Travels. This practice also extends to the ubiquitous key codes found in most levels of the game, with examples including the first door-code in the game being &quot; 0451 &quot;, &quot; an allusion to System Shock&apos;s allusion to Fahrenheit 451 (the first code in System Shock was also 451) &quot; according to Harvey Smith, as well as the sequence &quot; 8675309 &quot; opening the only 7-digit key code lock in the game. There also exists a &quot; Lord Brinne &quot; tombstone found in the Baltimore Cemetery level, which is actually a memorial for the real life Bill Iburg, an RPG fan and regular of multiple forums who died in 1999.

[ Real world parallels ] Conspiracies are one of the main themes of Deus Ex, and the game draws heavily upon popular real world conspiracy theories for many of its plot elements. These include speculations regarding black helicopter s, vaccinations, and FEMA, as well as Area 51, the ECHELON network, Men in Black, cow mutilations, chupacabras (in the form of &quot; greasels &quot; ), and extraterrestrials.

During sections of the game where the New York skyline is visible in the background, the two towers of the World Trade Center are noticeably missing; the real towers were destroyed a year after the game was released.
