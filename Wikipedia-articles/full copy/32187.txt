Kitty Hawk was both the first and last active ship of her class, and the last conventionally-fuelled aircraft carrier in service with the US Navy. Kitty Hawk was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, 27 December 1956; and launched 21 May 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Camilla F. McElroy, wife of Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy; and commissioned 21 April 1961 at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Captain William F. Bringle in command. Kitty Hawk was launched by flooding her drydock. A conventional slide down ways was ruled out because of her mass and the risk of impact with the Philadelphia shore on the far side of the Delaware River. With the decommissioning of [ Independence CV-62 2 ] on 30 September 1998, Kitty Hawk became the United States warship with the second longest active status in the Navy – the [ Constitution ] sailing ship in Boston Harbor is still retained on active Navy status. With this title came the distinction of being one of only two aircraft carriers ever to be honored with flying the First Navy Jack. This came to an end with an instruction dated 31 May 2002, where the Secretary of the Navy directed all United States Navy ships to fly this flag in honor of those killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks for the duration of the War on Terrorism. [ Navy Jack http://www.navyjack.info/war.html War ] {. } For 10 years, Kitty Hawk was the forward-deployed carrier at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan. In October 2008, she was replaced in this role by the [ George Washington CVN-73 2 ]. Kitty Hawk then returned to the United States and had her decommissioning ceremony on 31 January 2009. She was officially decommissioned on 12 May 2009 after almost 49 years of service. { Navy Decommissions USS Kitty Hawk } Kitty Hawk was replaced by the [ George H.W. Bush CVN-77 2 ]. She was the last oil fired carrier in service with the United States Navy. [ 1961 to 1964 ] Following a shakedown in the Western Atlantic, Kitty Hawk departed Norfolk on 11 August 1961. After a brief stop at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she embarked the Secretary of the Brazilian Navy for a demonstration of exercise at sea with five Brazilian destroyers, the attack carrier rounded Cape Horn on 1 October. She steamed into Valparaíso, Chile on 13 October and then sailed two days later for Peru, arriving in Callao on 20 October where she entertained the President of Peru. At San Diego, Admiral George W. Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations, landed on her deck 18 November to witness antisubmarine demonstrations by [ Henry B. Wilson DDG-7 2 ] and [ Blueback SS-581 2 ], a Terrier missile demonstration by [ Topeka CLG-8 2 ] and air demonstrations by Kitty Hawk. Kitty Hawk entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 23 November 1961 for alterations. Following operations out of San Diego, she sailed from San Francisco on 13 September 1962. Kitty Hawk joined the United States Seventh Fleet on 7 October 1962, relieving [ Midway CV-41 2 ] as the flagship. After participating in the Philippine Republic Aviation Week Air Show, Kitty Hawk steamed out of Manila Harbor on 30 November 1962, and welcomed Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, for a demonstration of modern naval weapons on 3 December. The ship visited Hong Kong early in December and returned to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 2 January 1963. In conjunction with Commander, Carrier Division Seven, Kitty Hawk carried out several exercises in January and February 1963. { Aviation Historical Summary, USS Kitty Hawk, OPNAV Form 5750-2, 30 September 1962 – 30 March 1963 } On 4 Jan 1963, Operation Checkertail saw Kitty Hawk and three other attack aircraft carriers launch practice airstrikes against the Okinawa Air Defense Command. From 27 Jan – 2 Feb 1963, &apos;Picture Window III&apos; saw &apos;foreign aircraft&apos; intercepted and visually identified in the Northern Japan area. Though the official ship&apos;s papers released in 2011 do not identify the nationality, it is likely that the &apos;foreign aircraft&apos; in question were from the Soviet Far Eastern Military District or Soviet Naval Aviation. From 16–19 Feb 1963, Exercise &apos;Red Wheel,&apos; was conducted around Southern Japan also under the direction of Commander, Carrier Division Seven. It aimed to improve the United States Seventh Fleet &apos;s ability to conduct conventional and nuclear warfare while maintaining defense against air and submarine attack. It also aimed to evaluate the capability of &apos;the HUK [Hunter-Killer] Group&apos; to protect two CVA Task Groups. During these exercises, the ship visited Kobe, Beppu and Iwakuni before returning to San Diego on 2 April 1963. On 6 June 1963, President John F. Kennedy, with top civilian and military leaders, boarded Kitty Hawk to witness a carrier task force weapons demonstration off the California coast. Addressing the men of the task group from Kitty Hawk, President Kennedy told them that, as in the past, control of the seas still means security, peace and ultimate victory. He later wrote to President and Madame Chiang Kai-Shek who had witnessed a similar demonstration on board [ Constellation CV-64 2 ] : &quot; I hope you were impressed as I was, on my visit to Kitty Hawk, with the great force for peace or war, which these mighty carriers and their accompanying escorts provide, helping to preserve the freedom of distant nations in all parts of the world. &quot; Film director John Frankenheimer filmed shots for the movie &quot; Seven Days in May &quot; on board the vessel in 1963. Following a series of strike exercises and tactics reaching along the California coast and off Hawaii, Kitty Hawk again sailed for the Far East. While approaching Japan, she learned an assassin had shot President Kennedy. Flags were at half mast as she entered Sasebo Harbor on 25 November 1963, the day of the President&apos;s funeral and, as senior ship present, she had the sad honor of firing memorial salutes. After cruising the South China Sea and ranging to the Philippines in readiness operations with the 7th Fleet, she returned to San Diego on 20 July 1964. [ 1965 to 1972 ] Kitty Hawk overhauled in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, then trained along the western seaboard. She sailed from San Diego on 19 October 1965, for Hawaii thence to Subic Bay, Philippines, where she prepared for combat operations off the coast of Vietnam. Kitty Hawk was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 26 November 1965-14 May 1966 while participating in combat operations displayed undaunted spirit, courage, professionalism and dedication to maintain their ship as a fighting unit under the most arduous operating conditions to enable her pilots to destroy vital military targets in North Vietnam despite intense opposition and extremely adverse weather conditions. Kitty Hawk returned to San Diego in June 1966 for overhaul and training until 4 November 1966, when she again deployed to serve in waters of Southeast Asia. Kitty Hawk arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 19 November to relieve Constellation as flagship for Rear Admiral David C. Richardson, Commander Task Force 77. On 26 November, Kitty Hawk departed Yokosuka for Yankee Station via Subic Bay, and on 5 December, aircraft from Kitty Hawk began their around-the-clock missions over North Vietnam. About this time Kitty Hawk — already accustomed to celebrities as guests – entertained a number of prominent visitors: William Randolph Hearst, Jr.; Bob Considine; Dr. Billy Graham; Nancy Sinatra and John Steinbeck, among others. She remained in the Far East supporting the US in Southeast Asia until departing Subic Bay on 28 May 1967. Steaming via Japan, the carrier reached San Diego on 19 June and a week later entered the naval shipyard at Long Beach for maintenance. Kitty Hawk returned to San Diego on 25 August and began a rigorous training program to prepare her for future action. Cruise: Nov 67 – Jun 68: The &quot; Kitty Hawk &quot; had a fire in port Subic Bay PI, and went to GQ for 51 hours.. Had a plane crash on this cruise also, Jan 1968 lost Bill Reedy AO3 from &quot; G &quot; div. and two other men in that crash. Cruise: Nov 68 – Jun 69: After the cruise The &quot; Kitty Hawk &quot; came back to San Diego for a month and then went to puget sound shipyary in Washington State Sept 1969 for dry dock.... On 12 October 1972 during the Vietnam War, Kitty Hawk was en route to her station in the Gulf of Tonkin when a racial riot involving more than 200 sailors broke out. According to crew members, the riot began over a grilled-cheese sandwich. Nearly 50 sailors were injured in this widely-publicized incident. { Report by the Special Subcommittee on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy. 92nd Cong., 2d sess., 1973, H.A.S.C. 92-81 } This incident resulted in a congressional inquiry into discipline in the Navy. [ 1973 to 1977 ] From January through July 1973, Kitty Hawk changed homeports from San Diego to Hunter&apos;s Point. Kitty Hawk moved into dry dock on 14 January 1973, and work began to convert the ship from an attack (CVA) to a multi-mission carrier (CV). The &quot; CV &quot; designation indicated that Hawk was no longer strictly an attack carrier, in that anti-submarine warfare would also become a major role. Kitty Hawk became the first Pacific Fleet carrier to carry the multi-purpose &quot; CV &quot; designation. The conversion consisted of adding 10 new helicopter calibrating stations, installing sonar / sonobuoy readout and analysis center and associated equipment, and changing a large portion of the ship&apos;s operating procedures. One of the major equipment/space changes in the conversion was the addition of the Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) in the CIC area. ASCAC worked in close conjunction with the ASW aircraft assigned aboard Carrier Air Wing 11. During the yard period, the Engineering Department underwent a major change in its propulsion plant. The Navy Standard Oil (black oil) fuel system was completely converted to Navy Distillate Fuel. The Air Department added several major changes to the flight deck, including enlarging the jet blast deflector s (JBD) and installing more powerful catapults in order to handle the new Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which Kitty Hawk was standing by to receive for its next deployment. Enlarging JBD#1 meant the No. 1 Aircraft Elevator had to be redesigned, making Kitty Hawk the only carrier at the time having an aircraft elevator which tracked from the hangar deck to the flight deck angling out 6°. Kitty Hawk moved out of dry dock on 28 April 1973, and the next day, on her 12th birthday, was named a Multi-Purpose Aircraft Carrier (CV). { Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney } Fire on Kitty Hawk 10–11 December 1973 1800 hours. − Kitty Hawk during a refresher training exercise departing from Hunters point shipyard, and during refuleing experienced a failure of a flange gasket in one of the fuel transfer tubes of JP5 that pass through Number 1 engine room when fuel sprayed and ignited the ship went to GQ for 38 hours, and the crew was ordered to abandon ship. The ship listing and six safety&apos;s went off on her stacks when the fire finally became under control. and abandon ship was cancelled. Three days of wating for the bulkheads which glowed red before the ships damage control could enter the engine room where six enlisted sailors lives were claimed from the fire. They were: FR Michael Deverich, FR Linn Schambers, FR Kevin Johnson, FA Alan Champine, Samuel Cardenas and FA Joseph Tulipana. Thirty four sailors were treated for smoke inhalation and several minor injures were reported from fighting the fire. Reference: Kitty Hawk Flyer News article Thursday 13 December 1973 Vol. 12, Number 28JO3 Jeff Starke, PAO Kitty Hawk stayed busy throughout the mid-1970s with numerous deployments to the Western Pacific and involvement in a large number of exercises, including RIMPAC in 1973 and 1975. Kitty Hawk departed San Diego on 8 March 1976, and on 12 March entered dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, to commence a US$100 million complex overhaul, scheduled to last just more than 12 months. This overhaul configured Kitty Hawk to operate with the F-14 and S-3A &quot; Viking &quot; aircraft in a total CV sea control mode. This included adding spaces for storage, ordnance handling and maintenance facilities for the two aircraft. Also included in the work package were more efficient work areas for airframes and a repair facility for ground support equipment and the addition of avionics support capability for the S-3. The ship also replaced the Terrier Surface-to-Air missile system with the NATO Sea Sparrow system, and added elevators and modified weapons magazines to provide an increased capability for handling and stowing the newer, larger air-launched weapons. Kitty Hawk completed the overhaul in March 1977, and departed the shipyard 1 April of that year to return to San Diego. After a six month pre-deployment workup, Kitty Hawk departed NAS North Island 25 September 1977 for another WESTPAC and returned 15 May 1978. [ 1979 to 1998 ] In May 1979, the ship teamed with Carrier Air Wing 15 for another WESTPAC deployment. Her duties included search and assistance operations to aid refugees in small boats fleeing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. During that deployment, Kitty Hawk also offered contingency support off the coast of Korea following the assassination of Republic of Korea President Park Chung Hee. The deployment was then extended two-and-a-half months to support contingency operations in the North Arabian Sea during the Iran hostage crisis. For their actions in the region, Kitty Hawk and CVW-15 were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal. The &apos;&apos;Kitty Hawk&apos;&apos; docked in Sydney harbor. { close-in weapon system ( } { Phalanx ) at the stern of the vessel can be seen distinctly in this photograph. } Kitty Hawk had a cameo appearance in the 1980 movie The Final Countdown, standing in for [ Nimitz CVN-68 2 ]. On her way home from her WESTPAC deployment, Kitty Hawk was filmed entering Pearl Harbor with the crew manning the rail s as the ship passed the USS &apos;&apos;Arizona&apos;&apos; Memorial. (At the time of the filming, Nimitz was still an Atlantic Fleet, vice Pacific Fleet, aircraft carrier.) Kitty Hawk returned to San Diego in late February 1980 and was also awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Naval Air Force Pacific Battle Efficiency &quot; E &quot; Award as the best carrier in the Pacific Fleet. In April 1981, Kitty Hawk left San Diego for her thirteenth deployment to the Western Pacific. Following the cruise, the crew was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea. In January 1982, Kitty Hawk returned to Bremerton for another year-long overhaul. Following the comprehensive upgrade and a vigorous training period with Carrier Air Wing 2, Kitty Hawk deployed in 1984 as the flagship for Battle Group Bravo. Kitty Hawk logged more than [ 62000 mi km on ] on this deployment and remained at &quot; Station Gonzo &quot; in the north Arabian Sea for more than 60 consecutive days. In March 1984, Kitty Hawk participated in &quot; Team Spirit &quot; exercises in the Sea of Japan. The Soviet &apos;&apos;Victor&apos;&apos;-class nuclear attack submarine &apos;&apos;K-314&apos;&apos; shadowed the task group. On 21 March 1984, at the end of the Sea of Japan part of the exercise, K-314 surfaced directly in front of Kitty Hawk, far too close for &quot; Kitty Hawk &quot; to avoid the resulting collision, with minor damage to the aircraft carrier, and significant damage to the Soviet submarine. At the time of the accident, Kitty Hawk is estimated to have carried several dozen nuclear weapons, and K-314 probably carried two nuclear torpedoes. Kitty Hawk went to the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay in the Philippines for repairs. A piece of one of K-314 s propellers was embedded in Kitty Hawk s bow, as were some chunks of the Soviet anechoic coating, from scraping along the side of the submarine. The result was something of an &quot; accidental &quot; intelligence coup for the U.S. Navy. The ship returned to San Diego on 1 August 1984. Seven months later, Kitty Hawk was awarded another Battle Efficiency &quot; E &quot; Award. In July 1985, Kitty Hawk and CVW-9 deployed again as flagship for Battle Group Bravo. Kitty Hawk and CVW-9 combined to set a standard for operations, completing their second consecutive fatality-free deployment. CVW-9 crews logged more than 18,000 flight hours and 7,300 arrested landings while Kitty Hawk maintained her catapults and arresting gear at 100 percent availability. Kitty Hawk bid farewell to San Diego on 3 January 1987, as the ship departed her homeport of 25 years and set out on a six-month world cruise. During the circumnavigation, Kitty Hawk and CVW-9 again showed their commitment to safety by conducting a third fatality-free deployment(edit: 1 Airman was killed during flight operations when he was struck by an aircraft while checking &quot; elongs &quot; during a launch). Kitty Hawk spent 106 consecutive days on station in the Indian Ocean and was again awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service. The world cruise ended at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 3 July. Six months later, Kitty Hawk began a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) overhaul. Kitty Hawk emerged from the yards on 2 August 1990. The overhaul was estimated to have added 20 years of service to the ship. The Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department was also awarded the Air Forces, US Pacific Fleet Departmental Excellence Award, the Black &quot; E &quot; for this deployment. With the return of CVW-15 to its decks, Kitty Hawk began its second deployment around &quot; the Horn &quot; of South America to her original homeport of San Diego on 11 December 1991, performing Gringo-Gaucho with the Argentine Naval Aviation during the transit. On 1 August 1992, Kitty Hawk was appointed as Naval Air Force Pacific&apos;s &quot; ready carrier. &quot; The ship embarked Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5; Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17 and CVW-15 for three months of work-ups before deploying to the Western Pacific on 3 November 1992. While on deployment, Kitty Hawk spent nine days off the coast of Somalia supporting U.S. Marines and coalition forces involved in Operation Restore Hope. In response to increasing Iraq i violations of United Nations sanctions, the ship rushed to the Persian Gulf on 27 December 1992. Just 17 days later, Kitty Hawk led a joint coalition offensive strike against designated targets in southern Iraq. Kitty Hawk set sail on her 17th deployment 24 June 1994, with the goal of providing a stabilizing influence operating in the Western Pacific during a time of great tension in the Far East, particularly concerning North Korea. In 1995, the Kitty Hawk embarked airwing transitioned to CVW-11, marking a change to a single F-14 squadron, and 3 F/A-18 squadrons. { Former crewmember, with VFA-94 } Kitty Hawk began her 18th deployment, this time with CVW-11, in October 1996. During the six-month underway period, the ship visited ports in the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific. The carrier made a rare visit to Hobart, Tasmania as well as being only the second carrier to ever stop in Manama, Bahrain. { Former crewmember, with VFA-94 } Kitty Hawk returned to San Diego 11 April 1997, immediately beginning a 15-month, $110 million overhaul, including three months in dry dock in Bremerton, from January to March 1998.

Kitty Hawk also welcomed aboard Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5, operating from Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan. Kitty Hawk arrived at her new operating location of Yokosuka, Japan, on 11 August 1998. With the decommissioning of Independence on 30 September 1998, Kitty Hawk became the second oldest active warship in the US Navy and was authorized to fly the First Navy Jack. Kitty Hawk set sail for a planned three-month underway period 2 March 1999, which included Exercise Tandem Thrust off Guam. Following the exercise, the Kitty Hawk/ CVW-5 team was ordered to the Persian Gulf to enforce the No-Fly Zone over Southern Iraq. CVW-5 pilots flew more than 8,800 sorties in 116 days, including 1,300 combat sorties, dropping more than 20  tons of ordnance. On the return trip to Japan, Kitty Hawk made port visits to Perth, Western Australia, and Pattaya, Thailand. Kitty Hawk returned to Yokosuka 25 August 1999. She was again underway to the Sea of Japan 22 October to participate in Exercises Foal Eagle and AnnualEx 11G. On 11 April 2000, Kitty Hawk departed Yokosuka, Japan for routine local area operations and to participate in Exercise Cobra Gold with the navies of Singapore and Thailand. Kitty Hawk participated in Exercise Foal Eagle in Fall 2000, and deployed again in March 2001 for a Spring underway period with a historic stop. On 22 March, Kitty Hawk became the first aircraft carrier to ever moor pier-side in Singapore, as the ship visited the brand new Changi Pier, located at the Republic of Singapore Navy &apos;s Changi Naval Base. On 29 April, shortly after a visit to Guam, Kitty Hawk celebrated 40 years of active service as the ship and crew sailed south to participate in Exercise Tandem Thrust 2001 with the Australian and Canadian navies. The ship returned to Yokosuka 11 June 2001. On 17 October 2001, and again in 9 November 2001, Kitty Hawk was buzzed by a group of Russian warplanes in the sea of Japan, which proceeded to take pictures of the reaction on deck. General Anatoly Kornukov, then Russian air force&apos;s commander in chief, stated that the Russian warplanes managed to evade Kitty Hawk&apos;s antiaircraft defense system and that &quot; In the pictures, you can clearly see the panic on deck. &quot; [ http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/16/news/mn-52886 Russians Cocky Over U.S. Encounter LA Times 16 November 2000 25 January 2012 ] In October 2001, Kitty Hawk deployed to the North Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The ship served as an afloat forward staging base for U.S. special forces. In April 2002, Kitty Hawk was underway for her scheduled spring training. Along with a Guam port call, the spring underway included port visits to Singapore and Hong Kong, where the crew celebrated Kitty Hawk s 41st birthday. In the fall of 2002, Kitty Hawk was training in the Western Pacific. Kitty Hawk and her battle group combined with U.S. Air Force units and elements of the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force to conduct AnnualEx 14G in the waters surrounding Japan. Later, Kitty Hawk s crew made a port visit to Hong Kong. On 11 September 2002, all US Navy ships were ordered to fly the First Navy Jack. The ship once again departed Yokosuka on 23 January 2003 for a routine training mission, { U.S. Navy – A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers – USS &apos;&apos;Kitty Hawk&apos;&apos; (CV 63) } but a short time later, orders were received to transit to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to support the Global War on Terrorism and to prepare for future contingencies. Kitty Hawk was soon involved in Operations Southern Watch and Iraqi Freedom in the North Persian Gulf. Although the cruise was originally intended to be short, the ship ended up serving 104 continuous days at sea. Kitty Hawk returned to Yokosuka on 5 June 2003, immediately entering an extensive dry-dock period, or dry-docking ship&apos;s restricted availability (DSRA). On 3 July 2005, Kitty Hawk pulled in at Sydney, Australia for shore leave. Later, during the same cruise, Kitty Hawk made a port call in Guam for four days. In November 2005, Kitty Hawk anchored at Hong Kong, and was there for Thanksgiving. In June 2006, after a six-month SRA period, the Kitty Hawk once again got underway, was overflown by a Russian Il-38, and shortly after pulled into Otaru, which is on the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, and Singapore. In August 2006, the carrier pulled into Fremantle, Australia for shore leave. In September 2006, Kitty Hawk made the final port call of her Summer deployment at Pattaya, Thailand, after which she returned to her home port of Yokosuka. In the month of October 2006, Kitty Hawk and her escort warships were undergoing exercises near Okinawa, and a Chinese Song class submarine shadowed the group then surfaced within [ 5 mi km on ] of the group on 26 October 2006. { Washingtontimes.com } It was considered to be quite rare for Chinese subs to operate that far from their homeports on the mainland, though with this incident that may be changing. Reports claim that the submarine had been undetected until it surfaced. { Bill Gertz, &quot; China sub secretly stalked U.S. fleet &quot;, } { Washington Times, 13 November 2006 } { Michael Goldfarb: Red China &amp; Red Lines. } { Weekly Standard, 2007-JAN-12.

Keating, commander of the United States Pacific Command, commented on the issue, stating that the carrier was &quot; in a very relaxed posture. If there were some heightened state of tension, we would, believe me, we would not let them get that close. &quot; { Gertz, Bill, &quot; Inside the Ring: China intelligence gaps &quot;, } { Washington Times, 26 February 2009, p. B1. } On 11 January 2007, Kitty Hawk entered a scheduled period of maintenance in Yokosuka, her place being taken by [ Ronald Reagan CVN-76 2 ] which made an unscheduled deployment three weeks later. This refit is &quot; smaller than the one the ship completed [in 2006] &quot; { Kitty Hawk Enters Maintenance Period } which took six months. On 5 July 2007, Kitty Hawk pulled in at Sydney, Australia for six days of shore leave after participating in Exercise Talisman Sabre. On 21 September 2007, Kitty Hawk pulled into Yokosuka, Japan, after a four-month summer deployment. { USS &apos;&apos;Kitty Hawk&apos;&apos; (CV 63) } In November 2007, Kitty Hawk and other US Navy ships performed a joint military exercise, in the Bay of Bengal. Other nations that took part in this exercise were Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. Later that month, Kitty Hawk was scheduled to dock at Hong Kong for Thanksgiving.

China then reversed its position based on humanitarian grounds but by that time, Kitty Hawk was too far away to dock in time for the holiday. The cause of the Chinese refusal remains unclear.
