[ Surrounding communities ] [ Newton Falls Austintown Youngstown Deerfield Canfield Boardman Salem Columbiana North Lima ] [ Culture ] [ June 2007 ] Canfield is a suburb of Youngstown, with strict zoning regulations that prohibit large signage and overgrown lawns. It is the most affluent suburb of Youngstown. A tree-lined &quot; Village Green &quot; sits at the heart of the New England -style village, which resembles many communities established in the days of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The town center is a venue for a wide range of community activities. In 1992, Canfield city residents, although surrounded completely by Canfield Township, voted to secede from the township. This motion created two separate governmental entities — one a municipality, the other a township. However this did not destroy the community spirit that exists between both the city and township. Both cooperate with each other for the mutual benefit of their particular constituents. An example of this is mutual fire protection service, communications with each other with respect to roads and highways, and the physical assets of both (schools, parks, etc.). The Canfield Local School District serves the city of Canfield, Canfield Township, and a small portion of Boardman and Beaver Township s. The district ranks &quot; excellent &quot; with the Ohio Department of Education. The district, which operates one high school, one middle school, and two elementary schools, is ranked 12th of 614 schools throughout the state of Ohio. [ August 2011 ] Canfield continues to grow: new housing development s have been built throughout the city and adjacent Canfield Township, providing a stark contrast to the homes and buildings in the central city, much of which are well over a century old (Canfield was Mahoning County&apos;s original seat before it was moved to Youngstown in 1876). While the growth is embraced by the city, it is also gobbling up the family farm s and bucolic countryside that the village was once known for. The Canfield Fairgrounds have existed at their present location on State Route 46 in Canfield since 1851. Every year in late August/early September for six days the Canfield Fair ( &quot; Ohio&apos;s Largest Fair &quot; ) takes place at the Canfield Fairgrounds. The fair attracts many Ohio citizens. A few famous entertainers have performed at the Canfield Fair, including Bob Hope, Dolly Parton, Rascal Flatts, The Beach Boys, The Monkees, &quot; Weird Al &quot; Yankovic, Brad Paisley, Styx, The Goo Goo Dolls, Bill Cosby, Hank Williams Jr., and Peter Frampton. [ August 2011 ] Canfield is served by a branch of the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County. [ Industries ] Canfield is home to several light manufacturing companies, including: Canfield Metal Coating Converse All Steel Services - steel cutting Star Extruded Aluminum Shapes Lifetime Truck Products - truck fenders Canfield Manufacturing Company United Extrusion - aluminum extrusion dies and tooling LaFarge, a multinational building materials company, also has a laboratory in Canfield. [ Politics ] In the state legislature Canfield is located in the 33rd Senate District, represented by Democrat Joe Schiavoni, and in the 59th State Representative District, represented by Democrat Ron Gerberry.
