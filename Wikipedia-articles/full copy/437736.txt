His father wanted the son to be a wrestler and his political guru, Natthu Singh, spotted him in a wrestling match at Mainpuri. Impressed by his muscle power Mulayam was rewarded the political pocket of Jaswantnagar by Singh. Yadav first became a state minister in 1977, Later in 1980, he became the president of the Lok Dal (People&apos;s Party) in Uttar Pradesh which became a part of the Janata Dal (People&apos;s Party) afterward. In 1982, he was elected leader of the opposition in the Uttar Pradesh legislative council. He holds a M.A. from Agra University and B.T. [ May 2012 ] from Jain Inter College, Karhal (Mainpuri).

He was very close to Ram Manohar Lohia, Raj Narain and Chaudhary Charan Singh. [ Political career ] [ First term as chief minister ] [ May 2012 ] Yadav first became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1989. After the collapse of the V P Singh government at the center in November 1990, Yadav joined Chandra Shekhar &apos;s Janata Dal (Socialist) party and continued in office as chief minister with the support of the Congress Party. His government fell when the Congress withdrew support to his government in April 1991 in reaction to the aftermath of developments at the center, wherein the Congress party withdrew support to Chandra Shekhar&apos;s government. Mid-term elections to Uttar Pradesh assembly were held in mid 1991, in which Mulayam Singh&apos;s party lost power to BJP. [ Second term as chief minister ] [ May 2012 ] On October 7, 1992, Yadav founded his own Samajwadi Party (Socialist Party). In 1993, he allied with the Bahujan Samaj Party for the elections to Uttar Pradesh assembly due to be held in November 1993. The alliance between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party prevented the return of BJP to power in the state. Though the alliance did not win the majority, Mulayam Singh Yadav could become chief minister of Uttar Pradesh with the support of Congress and Janata Dal. His stand on movement for demanding separate statehood for Uttarakhand was as much controversial as his stand on Ayodhya movement in 1990 was. There was a firing on Uttarakhand activists at Muzaffarnagar on October 2, 1994, something for which Uttarakhand activists held him responsible. He continued holding that post until his ally opted into another alliance in June 1995. [ As union cabinet minister ] [ May 2012 ] In 1996, Yadav was elected to the eleventh Lok Sabha from Mainpuri constituency. In the United Front coalition government formed that year, his party joined and he was named India&apos;s Defence Minister. That government fell in 1998 as India went in for fresh elections, but he returned to the Lok Sabha that year from Sambhal parliamentary constituency. After the fall of Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the center in April 1999, he did not support the Congress party in the formation of the government in central. He contested Lok Sabha elections of 1999 from two seats, Sambhal and Kannauj, and won from both. He resigned from Kannauj seat for his son Akhilesh in the by-elections. [ Third term as chief minister ] [ May 2012 ] In the year 2002, following a fluid post-election situation in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party and Bahujan Samaj Party joined to form a government under dalit leader Mayawati, considered to be Mulayam&apos;s greatest rival. After a one-and-a-half year stint, the BJP pulled out of the government on August 25, 2003, and enough rebel legislators of the Bahujan Samaj Party left to allow Mulayam to become the Chief Minister, with the support of independents and small parties. Mulayam Singh Yadav was sworn in as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for the third time in September 2003. It is widely believed that this change was done with the blessings of the BJP, which was also ruling at the Centre then. In September 2003, when Yadav was sworn in as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yadav was a member of the Lok Sabha. In order to meet the constitutional requirement of becoming the member of state legislature within 6 months of being sworn in, Yadav contested the assembly by-election from Gunnaur assembly seat in January 2004. Yadav won by a record margin and polled almost 92% of the total votes. Yadav&apos;s victory margin of 183,899 votes is the highest margin of victory in assembly elections so far. With the hope of playing a major role at the center, Yadav contested Lok Sabha elections of 2004 from Mainpuri when Yadav was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Yadav won the seat and his party, Samajwadi Party won more seats in Uttar Pradesh than all other parties. However the Congress party, which formed the coalition government at the center after the elections had majority in the Lok Sabha with the support of the communist parties. As a result, Yadav could not play any significant role at the center, Yadav resigned from Lok Sabha and chose to continue as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh until he lost 2007 election when he lost to BSP.
