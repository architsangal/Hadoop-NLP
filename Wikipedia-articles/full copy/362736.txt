Roth, National Executive Director } Directors Guild of America (DGA) is an entertainment guild which represents the interests of film and television directors in the United States motion picture industry and abroad. Founded as the Screen Directors Guild in 1936, the group merged with the Radio and Television Directors Guild in 1960 to become the modern Directors Guild of America. { Amy Dawes, &quot; A More Perfect Union &quot;, DGA Quarterly, Spring 2011 } [ Overview ] As a union that seeks to organize an individual profession, rather than multiple professions across an industry, the DGA is a craft union. It represents directors and members of the directorial team (assistant directors, unit production managers, stage managers, associate directors, production associates, technical coordinators, and location managers (New York &amp; Chicago only)) in film, television, documentaries, news, sports, commercials and new media production. The Guild has various training programs whereby successful applicants are placed in various productions and can gain experience working in the film or television industry. [ 2011 ], its 75th anniversary, the guild had about 14,500 members. { The Guild Members Retrieved August 7, 2011. } The DGA headquarters are located on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, with satellite offices in New York and Chicago and coordinating committees in San Francisco, Chicago and London. [ Labor Agreements ] The agreements signed between the Guild and film and television production companies make various stipulations covering pay and working conditions for Guild members, and require that all those employed in the relevant fields on a film made by that company are Guild members. Guild members are generally prevented from working for companies that have not signed an agreement with the DGA. This sometimes leads production companies which have no such agreement to form new companies, purely for the purpose of making a particular film, which do then sign an agreement with the DGA. [ December 2011 ] Other than wages and basic working condition the DGA has a particular role in protecting the creative rights of the film director. Such protections that the guild provides include defining the director&apos;s role, guarding the key concept of &quot; one director to a picture &quot; and the right to prepare a director&apos;s cut or edit. Generally each of these protections is to help offset the power that producers can have over a director during the filmmaking process. [ DGA Awards ] The DGA hosts the annual DGA Awards, an important precursor to the Academy Awards { Susan King, &quot; Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese receive nominations for DGA Award &quot;, Los Angeles Times, January 9, 2012 }. In its 64-year history, the DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film has been a near perfect barometer for the Best Director Academy Award. Only six times since the DGA Award&apos;s inception has the DGA Award winner not won the corresponding Academy Award { Scott Feinberg, &quot; With DGA Win, &apos;The Artist&apos; and Its Artist Look Virtually Unstoppable at Oscars &quot;, The Hollywood Reporter, January 29, 2012 }. [ One Director to a Picture ] The rule that a film can only have one single director was adopted to preserve the continuity of a director&apos;s vision and to avoid producers and actors lobbying for a director&apos;s credit, or studios hiring multiple directors for a single film or television episode. The rule is waived only for recognized directorial teams (as determined by the DGA) who have a history of working together and sharing a common vision, such as The Wachowskis, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Hughes brothers, Brothers Strause, and the Coen brothers. The Coens for years divided credit, with Ethan taking producing credit, Joel taking directing credit, and both of them sharing the writing credit (even though the two of them shared all three duties between themselves) until The Ladykillers. For instance, the DGA would not recognize Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller as a directorial &quot; team &quot; for Sin City because they had never worked together before, which resulted in Rodriguez quitting the DGA so that Miller would receive director&apos;s credit. Not all Hollywood directors are DGA members. Notable directors such as George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez have refused membership or resigned from the guild over specific differences, while Quentin Tarantino recently became a DGA member { &quot; Membership Report - West Coast Additions &quot; DGA Monthly Magazine, January 2012 }. Those who are not members of the guild are unable to direct for the larger movie studios, which are signatories to the guild&apos;s agreements that all directors must be guild members.
