He featured as Varga, the lead villain in the 1968 Doctor Who story The Ice Warriors. Even though all the actors playing the aliens were over six feet tall, Bresslaw towered over them. Sonny Caldinez, who played an Ice Warrior in the story, stated in a 2004 interview that Bresslaw &quot; was the only man that could make me feel small. &quot; Although officially starring in 14 Carry On films, Bresslaw did appear in one other: Carry On Nurse. The legs of Terence Longdon were deemed to be too thin and scrawny looking, so Bresslaw&apos;s were used as stand-ins for the scene where Joan Sims gives him a bath. [ April 2011 ] Bresslaw&apos;s catchphrase, in his strong Cockney accent, was &quot; I only arsked &quot; (sic), first used in The Army Game, [ http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15430448_ITM National service with a smile 2006-05-30 Bristol Evening Post Northcliffe Newspapers Group 2008-08-08 ] and later revived in Carry On Camping (1969). In his fleeting appearance as an angry lorry driver in the 1970 film Spring and Port Wine (set in Bolton ), his character was dubbed. Bresslaw, at exactly 6  ft 7 in (2.01 m), was the tallest of the Carry On cast, head and shoulders over fellow Carry On regular, Barbara Windsor, who is [ 4 ft 10 in m on ]. Because of his height he was briefly considered for the part of the Creature in Hammer&apos;s Curse of Frankenstein (1957), which ultimately (and famously) went instead to [ 6 ft 5 in m on ] Christopher Lee. Bresslaw later made a comedy version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for Hammer titled The Ugly Duckling (1959). He made great efforts to follow up any role, learning genuine Swahili phrases for Carry On Up the Jungle (1970).
