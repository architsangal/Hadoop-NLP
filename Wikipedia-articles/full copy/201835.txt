[ Lord Patten of Barnes the other Lord Patten John Patten, Baron Patten ] [ May 2012 ] [ May 2012 ] [ 1944 5 12 y ] { Cleveleys, England, UK } { Lavender Patten } { Conservative } { Balliol College, Oxford } { Roman Catholicism } [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/profiles/chris_patten.stm BBC News 1 April 2010 ] Christopher Francis Patten, Baron Patten of Barnes, CH, PC (born 12 May 1944) is a British Conservative politician and administrator. He is the current chairman of the BBC Trust, and was the last Governor of British Hong Kong. Patten was Member of Parliament for Bath, eventually rising to a cabinet minister and party chairman. In the latter capacity, he orchestrated the Conservatives&apos; unexpected fourth consecutive electoral victory in 1992, but lost his own seat in the House of Commons. He then accepted the post of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Hong Kong, and oversaw its handover to the People&apos;s Republic of China in July 1997. As Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Patten presided over a steady rise in the living standards of ordinary Hong Kongers while encouraging a significant expansion of Hong Kong&apos;s social welfare system. { The Last Governor: Chris Patten and the Handover of Hong Kong by Jonathan Dimbleby } From 2000 to 2004 he served as one of the United Kingdom&apos;s two members of the European Commission. After leaving that post, he returned to the UK and became the Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 2003, and he was made a Life Peer in 2005. Patten is a Roman Catholic and oversaw Pope Benedict XVI&apos;s visit to the United Kingdom in September 2010. On 7 April 2011 the Queen approved Patten&apos;s appointment as the Chairman of the BBC Trust, the governing body of the British Broadcasting Corporation. [ http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/press-notices/2011/04/new-chairman-and-vice-chairman-appointed-to-the-bbc-62992 New Chairman and Vice Chairman appointed to the BBC&apos; Prime Minister&apos;s Office 7 April 2011 7 July 2011 ] [ Early life ] Chris Patten attended primary school at Our Lady of the Visitation, in Greenford, and later was educated at the independent St Benedict&apos;s School in Ealing, west London, and at Balliol College, Oxford. He was the first member of his family to attend university. In 1965, Patten worked for the campaign of New York Mayor John Lindsay, where he reported on the television performance of rival William F. Buckley, Jr.. { Hilton, Isabel, &quot; Profile: For God and the right &quot;, The Independent, 14 November 1993 } He worked for the Conservative Party from 1966, first as desk officer and then director (from 1974 to 1979) of the Conservative Research Department. [ Member of Parliament ] [ In government ] Patten was a Member of Parliament for Bath from 1979 to 1992, serving as Minister for Overseas Development at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1986 to 1989. In 1989 he was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for the Environment and became responsible for the unpopular Community Charge (or so-called &quot; Poll Tax &quot; ). Though he robustly defended the policy at the time, in his 2006 book Not Quite the Diplomat (published in the United States as Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain and Europe in the New Century) he claims to have thought it was a mistake on Margaret Thatcher &apos;s part. He also introduced, and steered through Parliament, the major legislation that became the Environmental Protection Act 1990. In 1990, John Major made Patten Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Chairman of the Conservative Party, with responsibility for organising the coming general election campaign. As party chairman, he was widely considered to be the main architect of the somewhat unexpected Conservative victory in the 1992 election. However, he lost his marginal seat of Bath to the Liberal Democrat candidate Don Foster in 1992. Patten&apos;s defeat was attributed to several factors: the Poll Tax that he implemented, which was especially unpopular in his constituency, and his duties as party chairman that prevented him from much local campaigning. [ Governor of Hong Kong ] If Patten had been re-elected in 1992, sections of the media thought he would have been rewarded by appointment as Foreign Secretary, although in his autobiography John Major said that he would have made Patten Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, in the three weeks leading up to the election, many party insiders sensed that Patten would lose his seat, and Major was considering a patronage appointment. In any event, in July 1992, he became the 28th and the last Governor of Hong Kong until its handover to the People&apos;s Republic of China on 30 June 1997. He was given an official Chinese name, Pang Ding-hong ( [ 彭定康 ] ), a name with an etymology based on the words &quot; stability &quot; and &quot; health &quot;. Unlike most previous Hong Kong Governors, he was not a career diplomat from the UK Foreign Office but a politician. However, he was not the first former MP to become a Governor of Hong Kong: that was John Bowring (Governor of Hong Kong 1854–1859). Also, John Pope Hennessy (Governor of Hong Kong 1877–1882), was a Conservative MP before he entered Colonial Service. Patten&apos;s tenure faced several different challenges, as many in Hong Kong were still reeling from the Tiananmen Square Massacre a few years earlier, while others were suspicious of whether or not the British would act in their best interest. [ October 2010 ] However the general opinion regarded him positively. He took steps to get in touch with the people of the colony, and was known for his penchant for taking public strolls around Hong Kong as well as in the media limelight. Hong Kong affectionately nicknamed him Fat Pang ( [ 肥彭 ] ), making him the only governor to have a widely recognised Chinese nickname. [ http://us.rediff.com/getahead/2006/mar/13ga-inter.htm &apos;India is a big priority&apos; at Oxford Us.rediff.com 30 June 2010 ] Patten&apos;s most controversial actions are related to the election of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Legco members returned in 1995 were originally to serve beyond the handover, thereby providing institutional continuity across the reversion of Hong Kong to the PRC. Beijing had expected that the use of functional constituencies with limited electorates would be used to elect this council, however Patten extended the definition of functional constituencies and thus virtually every Hong Kong subject was able to vote for the so-called indirectly elected members (see Politics of Hong Kong ) of the Legislative Council. His measure was strongly criticised by the pro- Beijing political parties of Hong Kong, which would suffer from the electoral changes [ January 2009 ]. Patten was also denounced by the PRC government as the &apos;whore of the East,&apos; a &apos;serpent&apos; and a &apos;wrongdoer who would be condemned for a thousand generations&apos; ( [ 千古罪人 ] ). [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_1910000/newsid_1910800/1910806.stm BBC News ´^w±d¡G¼e§ &quot; ¹ï &quot; Ý¤¤°ê½ ¦W 4 April 2002 1 April 2010 ] The legislative council which was elected under Patten&apos;s governorship was dissolved upon the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC and replaced by a Provisional Legislative Council ( [ 臨時立法會 ] ) which functioned until elections were held under the previous rules in 1998. However, Patten&apos;s institutional reform gained unprecedented support in Hong Kong and the criticism from the PRC government raised his popularity to a level he had not previously enjoyed in the UK; he was widely seen as standing up for the colony&apos;s rights [ January 2009 ]. Notwithstanding the electoral controversy, even some of his critics admired his eloquence and praised his efforts to raise the level of debate in the colony. Ending up, the PRC did bow to pressure and after the handover, an increasing portion of seats in the Legco would be directly elected. At 00:00 HKT 1 July 1997 (16:00 GMT, 30 June 1997), he sent the following telegram: I have relinquished the administration of this government. God Save The Queen. Patten. This marked the end of British rule in Hong Kong and after the handover ceremony he left the city, together with Prince Charles, on board the British royal yacht, HMY &apos;&apos;Britannia&apos;&apos;. Patten was noted to be in tears after his speech at the Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.

From 1998 to 1999, he chaired the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, better known as the Patten Commission, which had been established in 1998 as part of the Belfast Agreement. On 9 September 1999, the Commission produced its report, entitled A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland but popularly known as the Patten Report, which contained 175 symbolic and practical recommendations.

He is the co-chair of International Crisis Group, overseeing many international operations. He is also a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organisation which works to promote good governance around the world.

[ June 2010 ] In 2011 Patten took seat in the advisory council of The Hague Institute for Global Justice. [ European Commissioner ] In 1999, he was appointed as one of the United Kingdom&apos;s two members to the European Commission as Commissioner for External Relations where he was responsible for the Union&apos;s development and co-operation programmes, as well as liaison with Javier Solana, the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He held this position within the Prodi Commission from 23 January 2000 until 22 November 2004. Patten oversaw many crises in the area of European foreign policy, most notably the failure of the European Union to come up with a common unified policy before the Iraq war in 2003. Although nominated for the post of President in the next Commission in 2004, he was unable to gain support from France and Germany. According to information from wikileaks Patten was in Moscow in April 2004, and had concluded EU-Russia ministerial consultations in Brussels. He considered that the EU had become overly dependent on Russian energy supplies, and should become more engaged with the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia in order to diversify supplies. { Wikileaks cable } According to information from the US Embassy in Brussels (published by Wikileaks in November 2010): Patten said in April 2004 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has done a good job for Russia mainly due to high world energy prices, but he had serious doubts about the man’s character. Cautioning that “I’m not saying that genes are determinant,” Patten then reviewed the Putin family history – grandfather part of Lenin’s special protection team; father a communist party apparatchik, and Putin himself decided at a young age to pursue a career in the KGB. “He seems a completely reasonable man when discussing the Middle East or energy policy, but when the conversation shifts to Chechnya or Islamic extremism, Putin’s eyes turn to those of a killer.” [ University roles and elevation to the Peerage ] { Chancellor of the University of Oxford } Patten was Chancellor of Newcastle University from 1999 to 2009, and was elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 2003. In 2005 Patten was raised to the Peerage as Baron Patten of Barnes, of Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond. In 2003 he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Bath. In September 2005 he was elected a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of Massey College in the University of Toronto (the only person so elected except for the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh, the Duke of Edinburgh ) as well as receiving an honorary Doctorate of Sacred Letters from the University of Trinity College, Toronto and an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Ulster. [ http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2005/1549.html University Of Ulster News Release – UU Unveils Summer Honorary Graduates News.ulster.ac.uk 28 February 2005 30 June 2010 ] In March 2009, Patten received the title Doctor Honoris Causa by South East European University. [ Chairman of the BBC Trust ] On the advice of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government led by Prime Minister David Cameron Lord Patten of Barnes was appointed by the Queen-in-Council as Chairman of the BBC Trust, and he took office on 1 May 2011, in the place of Sir Michael Lyons. [ Charity ] In 2010 Lord Patten of Barnes was appointed President of Medical Aid for Palestinians. [ http://www.map-uk.org/about/trustees_and_patrons/ Medical Aid for Palestinians – About Us – Trustees and Patrons Map-uk.org 30 June 2010 ] [ Personal life ] Lord Patten of Barnes is married to Lavender, who is a barrister. They have three daughters, Kate, Laura (married to Elton Charles), and Alice Patten (actress); and two Norfolk terrier s, Whisky and Soda. On 29 September 2005, he published his memoirs, Not Quite the Diplomat: Home Truths About World Affairs.In October 2009, Lord Patten was Chief Guest at The Doon School, a boarding school in Dehradun, India, which is a member of the United Kingdom&apos;s Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference. { http://www.doonschool.com/images/weekly_pdf/founders2009.pdf } [ In the media ] Patten made as a politician as well as chancellor of the University of Oxford a remarkable comment on Myron Scholes and Robert Merton :. &quot;...  it is surely laughable when the highest awards are showered on those who promote the most gimcrack schemes to make themselves rich, at least for a while. The geniuses who invented the pyramid of derivatives at Long-Term Capital Management were awarded the Nobel Prize for their cleverness, not long before the whole edifice came crashing down with the financial community digging deep into its pockets to prevent too much collateral damage. To every excess, there comes a reaction. &quot; (pls. ref. to &quot; Not Quite the DIPLOMAT – Home Truths about World Affairs &quot;, November 2005, p.  218) Patten was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series Tory! Tory! Tory!. [ Criticism of Sri Lanka ] In an Op-Ed contribution in The New York Times (12 January 2010), Patten made the comment, &quot;.....After all, both General Fonseka and Mr. Rajapaksa executed the 30-year conflict to its bloody conclusion at the expense of huge numbers of Tamil civilian casualties.By early May, when the war was ending, the United Nations estimated that some 7,000 civilians had died and more than 10,000 had been wounded in 2009 as the army’s noose was being drawn tight around the remaining rebels and hundreds of thousands of non-combatants, who could not escape government shelling. The final two weeks likely saw thousands more civilians killed, at the hands of both the army and the rebels. &quot; [ Sri Lanka&apos;s Choice, and the World&apos;s Responsibility http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/opinion/13iht-edpatten.html The New York Times 12 January 2010 8 June 2011 Chris Patten ] [ Books ] [ Chris Patten 1983 The Tory Case Longman Higher Education 0-582-29612-9 ] [ Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated 9. ] [ Chris Patten 2005 Not Quite the Diplomat: Home Truths About World Affairs Allen Lane 0-7139-9855-5 ] [ Chris Patten 2006 Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain, and Europe in a New Century Times Books 0-8050-7788-X ] [ Chris Patten 2008 What Next?
