This requires the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels. Blood pressure involves two measurements, systolic and diastolic, which depend on whether the heart muscle is contracting (systole) or relaxed between beats (diastole). Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-140mmHg systolic (top reading) and 60-90mmHg diastolic (bottom reading). High blood pressure is said to be present if it is persistently at or above 140/90  mmHg. Hypertension is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension; about 90–95% of cases are categorized as &quot; primary hypertension &quot; which means high blood pressure with no obvious underlying medical cause. [ Carretero OA, Oparil S Essential hypertension. Part I: definition and etiology Circulation 101 3 329–35 2000 January 10645931 http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/3/329.long 10.1161/01.CIR.101.3.329 ] The remaining 5–10% of cases (secondary hypertension) are caused by other conditions that affect the kidneys, arteries, heart or endocrine system. Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attacks), heart failure, aneurysm s of the arteries (e.g. aortic aneurysm ), peripheral arterial disease and is a cause of chronic kidney disease. Even moderate elevation of arterial blood pressure is associated with a shortened life expectancy. Dietary and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure control and decrease the risk of associated health complications, although drug treatment is often necessary in people for whom lifestyle changes prove ineffective or insufficient.

Lower thresholds are used (135  mmHg systolic or 85  mmHg diastolic) if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring.

JNC7 (2003) uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120-139  mmHg systolic and/or 80-89  mmHg diastolic, while ESH-ESC Guidelines (2007) [ Mancia G, De Backer G, Dominiczak A, et al. 2007 ESH-ESC Practice Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension: ESH-ESC Task Force on the Management of Arterial Hypertension J.

Hypertension is also sub-classified: JNC7 distinguishes hypertension stage I, hypertension stage II, and isolated systolic hypertension. Isolated systolic hypertension refers to elevated systolic pressure with normal diastolic pressure and is common in the elderly. The ESH-ESC Guidelines (2007) and BHS IV (2004), additionally define a third stage (stage III hypertension) for people with systolic blood pressure exceeding 179  mmHg or a diastolic pressure over 109  mmHg.Hypertension is classified as &quot; resistant &quot; if medications do not reduce blood pressure to normal levels. [ Neonates and infants ] Hypertension in neonates is rare, occurring in around 0.2 to 3% of neonates, and blood pressure is not measured routinely in the healthy newborn. [ Dionne JM, Abitbol CL, Flynn JT Hypertension in infancy: diagnosis, management and outcome Pediatr. Nephrol. 27 1 17–32 2012 January 21258818 10.1007/s00467-010-1755-z ] Hypertension is more common in high risk newborns. A variety of factors, such as gestational age, postconceptional age and birth weight needs to be taken into account when deciding if a blood pressure is normal in a neonate. [ Children and adolescents ] Hypertension occurs quite commonly in children and adolescents (2-9% depending on age, sex and ethnicity) [ Din-Dzietham R, Liu Y, Bielo MV, Shamsa F High blood pressure trends in children and adolescents in national surveys, 1963 to 2002 Circulation 116 13 1488–96 2007 September 17846287 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.683243 ] and is associated with long term risks of ill-health.

Blood pressure rises with age in childhood and, in children, hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure on three or more occasions equal or higher than the 95th percentile appropriate for the sex, age and height of the child. Prehypertension in children is defined as average systolic or diastolic blood pressure that is greater than or equal to the 90th percentile, but less than the 95th percentile. In adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension and pre-hypertension are diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults. [ Signs and symptoms ] Hypertension is rarely accompanied by any symptoms, and its identification is usually through screening, or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem. A proportion of people with high blood pressure reports headache s (particularly at the back of the head and in the morning), as well as lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or fainting episodes. [ Fisher ND, Williams GH Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, et al. Harrison&apos;s Principles of Internal Medicine 16th 2005 McGraw-Hill New York, NY 0-07-139140-1 1463–81 Hypertensive vascular disease ] On physical examination, hypertension may be suspected on the basis of the presence of hypertensive retinopathy detected by examination of the optic fundus found in the back of the eye using ophthalmoscopy. [ Wong T, Mitchell P The eye in hypertension Lancet 369 9559 425–35 2007 February 17276782 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60198-6 ] Classically, the severity of the hypertensive retinopathy changes is graded from grade I–IV, although the milder types may be difficult to distinguish from each other. Ophthalmoscopy findings may also indicate how long a person has been hypertensive. [ Secondary hypertension ] [ Secondary hypertension ] Some additional signs and symptoms may suggest secondary hypertension, i.e. hypertension due to an identifiable cause such as kidney diseases or endocrine diseases. For example, truncal obesity, glucose intolerance, moon facies, a &quot; buffalo hump &quot; and purple striae suggest Cushing&apos;s syndrome. [ O&apos;Brien, Eoin; Beevers, D. G.; Lip, Gregory Y. H. ABC of hypertension BMJ Books London 2007 1-4051-3061-X ] Thyroid disease and acromegaly can also cause hypertension and have characteristic symptoms and signs. An abdominal bruit may be an indicator of renal artery stenosis (a narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys), while decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and/or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses may indicate aortic coarctation (a narrowing of the aorta shortly after it leaves the heart). Labile or paroxysmal hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pallor, and perspiration should prompt suspicions of pheochromocytoma. [ Hypertensive crises ] [ Hypertensive emergency ] Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 or diastolic of 110 — sometime termed malignant or accelerated hypertension) is referred to as a &quot; hypertensive crisis &quot;, as blood pressures above these levels are known to confer a high risk of complications. People with blood pressures in this range may have no symptoms, but are more likely to report headaches (22% of cases) [ Papadopoulos DP, Mourouzis I, Thomopoulos C, Makris T, Papademetriou V Hypertension crisis Blood Press. 19 6 328–36 2010 December 20504242 10.3109/08037051.2010.488052 ] and dizziness than the general population. Other symptoms accompanying a hypertensive crisis may include visual deterioration or breathlessness due to heart failure or a general feeling of malaise due to renal failure. Most people with a hypertensive crisis are known to have elevated blood pressure, but additional triggers may have led to a sudden rise. [ Marik PE, Varon J Hypertensive crises: challenges and management Chest 131 6 1949–62 2007 June 17565029 10.1378/chest.06-2490 http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/131/6/1949.long ] A &quot; hypertensive emergency &quot;, previously &quot; malignant hypertension &quot;, is diagnosed when there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs as a result of the severely elevated blood pressure. This may include hypertensive encephalopathy, caused by brain swelling and dysfunction, and characterized by headaches and an altered level of consciousness (confusion or drowsiness). Retinal papilloedema and/or fundal hemorrhages and exudates are another sign of target organ damage. Chest pain may indicate heart muscle damage (which may progress to myocardial infarction ) or sometimes aortic dissection, the tearing of the inner wall of the aorta. Breathlessness, cough, and the expectoration of blood-stained sputum are characteristic signs of pulmonary edema, the swelling of lung tissue due to left ventricular failure an inability of the left ventricle of the heart to adequately pump blood from the lungs into the arterial system. Rapid deterioration of kidney function (acute kidney injury) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of blood cells) may also occur. In these situations, rapid reduction of the blood pressure is mandated to stop ongoing organ damage. In contrast there is no evidence that blood pressure needs to be lowered rapidly in hypertensive urgencies where there is no evidence of target organ damage and over aggressive reduction of blood pressure is not without risks Use of oral medications to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48 h is advocated in hypertensive urgencies. [ In pregnancy ] Hypertension occurs in approximately 8-10% of pregnancies. Most women with hypertension in pregnancy have pre-existing primary hypertension, but high blood pressure in pregnancy may be the first sign of pre-eclampsia, a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and puerperium. Pre-eclampsia is characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine. It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all maternal death s globally. Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of perinatal mortality. Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening. When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache, visual disturbance (often &quot; flashing lights &quot; ), vomiting, epigastric pain, and edema. Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called eclampsia, which is a hypertensive emergency and has several serious complications including vision loss, cerebral edema, seizures or convulsions, renal failure, pulmonary edema, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a blood clotting disorder).

[ National Clinical Guideline Centre Hypertension (NICE CG 127) National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 7 Diagnosis of Hypertension, 7.5 Link from evidence to recommendations 102 August 2011 http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf 2011-12-22 ] Pseudohypertension in the elderly or noncompressibility artery syndrome may also require consideration. This condition is believed to be due to calcification of the arteries resulting an abnormally high blood pressure readings with a blood pressure cuff while intra arterial measurements of blood pressure are normal.

Hypertension 2012 Feb 59 2 173-8 22184330 ] Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, physicians will attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present. Secondary hypertension is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by renal disease. Primary or essential hypertension is more common in adolescents and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension. [ Luma GB, Spiotta RT Hypertension in children and adolescents Am Fam Physician 73 9 1558–68 may 2006 16719248 ] Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the heart, eyes, and kidney s. Additional tests for diabetes and high cholesterol levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of heart disease and may require treatment. Serum creatinine is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension. Serum creatinine alone may overestimate glomerular filtration rate and recent guidelines advocate the use of predictive equations such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). eGFR can also provides a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain antihypertensive drugs on kidney function. Additionally, testing of urine samples for protein is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure. It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle ( left ventricular hypertrophy ) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack. A chest X-ray or an echocardiogram may also be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to the heart. [ Prevention ] Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labelled as hypertensive. [ Williams B Poulter, NR, Brown, MJ, Davis, M, McInnes, GT, Potter, JF, Sever, PS, McG Thom, S, British Hypertension, Society Guidelines for management of hypertension: report of the fourth working party of the British Hypertension Society, 2004-BHS IV Journal of human hypertension 2004 Mar 18 3 139–85 14973512 10.1038/sj.jhh.1001683 ] Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive drug therapy. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting drug therapy. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines proposed the following lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002 [ Whelton PK et al. 2002 Primary prevention of hypertension.

In Japan starting with any one of six classes of medications including: CCB, ACEI/ARB, thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and alpha-blockers is deemed reasonable while in Canada all of these but alpha-blockers are recommended as options. [ Drug combinations ] The majority of people require more than one drug to control their hypertension. JNC7 and ESH-ESC guidelines advocate starting treatment with two drugs when blood pressure is &gt; 20 mmHg above systolic or &gt; 10 mmHg above diastolic targets.

Unacceptable combinations are non-dihydropyridine calcium blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) and beta-blockers, dual renin–angiotensin system blockade (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor + angiotensin receptor blocker), renin–angiotensin system blockers and beta-blockers, beta-blockers and anti-adrenergic drugs. Combinations of an ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin II–receptor antagonist, a diuretic and an NSAID (including selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-prescribed drugs such as ibuprofen) should be avoided whenever possible due to a high documented risk of acute renal failure.
