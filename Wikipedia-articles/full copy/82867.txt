Clementines can be separated into seven to fourteen segments. They tend to be very easy to peel, like a tangerine, but are almost always seedless. For this reason they are sometimes known as seedless tangerines; the clementine is also occasionally referred to as the Algerian tangerine [ October 2011 ]. They are typically juicy and sweet, with less acid than oranges. Their oils, like other citrus fruits, contain mostly limonene as well as myrcene, linalool, α-pinene and many complex aromatics.

James Saunt has commented that &quot; Some authorities believe it is virtually identical to the variety known as the Canton mandarin widely grown in Guangxi and Guangdong Provinces in China. &quot; [ Saunt James Citrus Varieties of the World (Second edition) Sinclair International Business Resources January 1, 2000 which page? 978-1-872960-01-2 ] The clementine is not always easy to distinguish from other varieties of mandarin oranges. [ January 2010 ] However, it should not be confused with similar fruit such as the satsuma or honey sweet orange, or other popular varieties. This variety was introduced into California commercial agriculture in 1914, though it was grown at the Citrus Research Center at the University of California, Riverside as early as 1909.

A market for them in the United States was created recently, when the harsh 1997 winter in Florida devastated domestic orange production, increasing prices and decreasing availability. California clementines are available from mid-November through January; this availability has them referred to in some areas as &quot; Christmas Oranges &quot;. Clementines are typically shipped in small wooden or cardboard boxes [ Code of Federal Regulations, Title 7, Agriculture, Pt. 300-399 Office of the Federal Register (U.S.) 2010-03-12 Animal and Plant Inspection Service, USDA Section 319.56-34 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DZ3yaSDjAGDsC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA383%26amp%3Bdq%3DClementines%2Bboxes 17 July 2010 978-0-16-084757-8 ] with a move in recent years to net bags. [ July 2010 ] Clementines lose their desirable seedless characteristic when they are cross-pollinated with other fruit. To prevent this, in 2006 growers such as Paramount Citrus in California threatened to sue local beekeeper s to keep bees away from their crops.
