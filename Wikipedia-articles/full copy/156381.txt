[ A Toast the ritual in which a drink is taken Toast (honor) ] [ March 2008 ] { (the 7th stanza) } { Stanko Premrl, 1905 } { France Prešeren } { 1844 } { 1989 } { Zdravljica.ogg } { &quot; Zdravljica &quot; (instrumental) } &quot; Zdravljica &quot; (English: &quot; A Toast &quot; ) or &quot; Zdravica &quot;, written in 1844 and published with some changes in 1848, is a poem by the Slovene Romantic poet France Prešeren, considered the national poet of Slovenes. On 27 September 1989, it became the national anthem of Slovenia. [ http://www.delo.si/clanek/127578 Katero kitico č&apos;mo kot himno zapet&apos; Slovene Which Stanza Should We As the Anthem Sing? Dragan Božič 3 November 2010 14 February 2011 ] &quot; Zdravljica &quot; is a drinking song and a carmen figuratum because the shape of each stanza resembles a wine cup. In it, the poet declares his belief in a free-thinking Slovene and Slavic political awareness. It has been interpreted as a promotion of the idea of a united Slovenia, which the March Revolution in 1848 elevated into a national political programme. With the act on the national symbols of Slovenia, passed in 1994, the eponymous melody by Stanko Premrl, written after the lyrics of the seventh stanza of the Prešeren&apos;s poem, emphasising internationalism, has been defined as the anthem.

A modified version was published in full in 1848. } Censorship did not allow for the poem to be printed. Later Prešeren himself intended to include it in his poem collection Poezije (Poems), and to that end omitted the third stanza ( &quot; V sovražnike &apos;z oblakov / rodú naj naš&apos;ga treši gróm &quot; ) in order to save the rest. However the censor (fellow-Slovene Franc Miklošič in Austrian service) saw in the fourth stanza ( &quot; Edinost, sreča, sprava / k nam naj nazaj se vrnejo &quot; ) an expression of pan-Slavic sentiment and therefore did not allow its publication either. Prešeren believed the poem would be mutilated without both the third and the fourth stanza and decided against including it in the Poezije. The integral version was first published after the March Revolution when the censorship was abolished. It was published on 26 April 1848 in the newspaper Kmetijske in rokodelske novice, edited by the conservative Slovene leader Janez Bleiweis. &quot; Zdravljica &quot; was first set to music in 1905 by the Slovene composer Stanko Premrl in a choral composition. [ National anthem ] &quot; Zdravljica &quot;, in the composition of Premrl, was adopted as the anthem on 27 September 1989 by the Socialist Republic of Slovenia before the breakup of Yugoslavia. Therefore, it was the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Slovenia as a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 8 March 1990 to 25 June 1991, and of the Republic of Slovenia as a sovereign state. The question about whether the entire &quot; Zdravljica &quot; or only its seventh stanza constitute the national anthem of Slovenia is still unresolved. According to the Article 6 of the Constitution of Slovenia, valid since 1991, the national anthem of Slovenia is the entire &quot; Zdravljica &quot;. According to the Act Regulating the Coat-of-Arms, Flag and Anthem of the Republic of Slovenia and the Flag of the Slovene Nation, valid since 1994, the national anthem of Slovenia is its seventh stanza and the web pages of the National Assembly cite the 7th stanza as the anthem of Slovenia. In practice, mostly only the seventh stanza is sung and reproduced as the national anthem. Jernej Letnar Černič, a law expert and university lecturer, wrote in September 2010 that the act contradicted the constitution and therefore the entire Zdravljica should be considered the anthem. He also stated that from the ethic, moral, civilization and statehood [ April 2011 ] point of view it seemed to be necessary for Slovenia to use the entire poem as its anthem.
