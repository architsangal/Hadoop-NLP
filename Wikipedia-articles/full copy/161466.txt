Later roles included the leads in Ice Station Zebra and the popular television series McMillan &amp; Wife along with a role in the hugely successful series Dynasty. Hudson was voted &quot; Star of the Year &quot;, &quot; Favorite Leading Man &quot;, and similar titles by numerous movie magazines. The [ 6 5 ] tall actor was one of the most popular and well-known movie stars of the time. He completed nearly 70 motion pictures and starred in several television productions during a career that spanned over four decades. Hudson died in 1985, being the first major celebrity to die from an AIDS -related illness. { http://www.tcmdb.com/participant.jsp?participantId=90260|133734 &amp; afiPersonalNameId=null } [ Early life ] Hudson was born Roy Harold Scherer, Jr., in Winnetka, Illinois, the only child of Katherine Wood (of English and Irish descent), a telephone operator, and Roy Harold Scherer, Sr., (of German and Swiss descent) an auto mechanic who abandoned the family during the depths of the Great Depression. His mother remarried and his stepfather Wallace &quot; Wally &quot; Fitzgerald adopted him, changing his last name to Fitzgerald. Hudson&apos;s years at New Trier High School were unremarkable. He sang in the school&apos;s glee club and was remembered as a shy boy who delivered newspapers, ran errands and worked as a golf caddy. After graduating from high school, he served in the Philippines as an aircraft mechanic for the United States Navy during World War II. { Berger, Joseph, &quot; Rock Hudson, Screen Idol, Dies at 59 &quot;, } { The New York Times, Oct. 3, 1985. Retrieved 2011-02-12. } In 1946, Hudson moved to the Los Angeles area to pursue an acting career and applied to the University of Southern California &apos;s dramatics program, but he was rejected owing to poor grades. Hudson worked for a time as a truck driver, longing to be an actor but with no success in breaking into the movies. A fortunate meeting with Hollywood talent scout Henry Willson in 1948 got Hudson his start in the business. [ Career ] [ Early career ] Hudson made his debut with a small part in the 1948 Warner Bros. &apos; Fighter Squadron. Hudson needed no fewer than 38 takes before successfully delivering his only line in the film. { The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson by Robert Hofler, Carroll &amp; Graf, 2005, pp. 163-164 ISBN 0-7867-1607-X } Hudson was further coached in acting, singing, dancing, fencing, and horseback riding, and he began to be featured in film magazine s where he was promoted, possibly on the basis of his good looks. Success and recognition came in 1954 with Magnificent Obsession in which Hudson plays a bad boy who is redeemed opposite the popular star Jane Wyman. The film received rave reviews, with Modern Screen Magazine citing Hudson as the most popular actor of the year. Hudson&apos;s popularity soared with George Stevens &apos; Giant, based on Edna Ferber &apos;s novel and co-starring Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean. Hudson and Dean both were nominated for Oscars in the Best Actor category. Following Richard Brooks &apos; notable Something of Value (1957) was a moving performance in Charles Vidor &apos;s box office failure A Farewell to Arms, based on Ernest Hemingway &apos;s novel. In order to make A Farewell to Arms, he had reportedly turned down Marlon Brando &apos;s role in Sayonara, William Holden &apos;s role in The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Charlton Heston &apos;s role in Ben-Hur. Those films went on to become hugely successful and critically acclaimed, while A Farewell to Arms proved to be one of the biggest flops in cinema history. [ April 2011 ] Hudson sailed through the 1960s on a wave of romantic comedies. He portrayed humorous characters in Pillow Talk, the first of several profitable co-starring performances with Doris Day. This was followed by Lover Come Back, Come September, Send Me No Flowers, Man&apos;s Favorite Sport?, The Spiral Road, and Strange Bedfellows. Along with Cary Grant, Hudson was regarded as one of the best-dressed male stars in Hollywood, and received &quot; Top 10 Stars of the Year &quot; a record eight times from 1957 to 1964. He worked outside his usual range on the science-fiction thriller Seconds (1966). The film flopped but it later gained cult status, and Hudson&apos;s performance is often regarded as one of his best. { YouTube - Rock Hudson in &apos;&apos;Seconds&apos;&apos; } { Apollo Movie Guide&apos;s Review of Seconds } He also tried his hand in the action genre with Tobruk (1967), the lead in 1968&apos;s spy thriller Ice Station Zebra, a role which he had actively sought and remained his personal favorite, and westerns with The Undefeated (1969) opposite John Wayne. [ Later career ] Hudson&apos;s popularity on the big screen diminished after the 1960s. He starred in a number of made-for-TV movies and series. His most successful TV series was McMillan &amp; Wife opposite Susan Saint James which ran from 1971 to 1977. In it, Hudson played police commissioner Stewart &quot; Mac &quot; McMillan with Saint James as his wife Sally. Their on-screen chemistry helped make the show a hit. In the early 1980s, following years of heavy drinking and smoking, Hudson began having health problems which resulted in a heart attack in November 1981. Emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery sidelined Hudson and his new TV show The Devlin Connection for a year; the show was canceled in December 1982 not long after it first aired. Hudson recovered from the heart surgery but continued to smoke. He was in ill health while filming The Ambassador in Israel during the winter of 1983-84 with Robert Mitchum. The two stars reportedly did not get along with each other, with Mitchum himself having a serious drinking problem. { Server, Lee Baby, I Don&apos;t Care (2001) } During 1984, Hudson&apos;s health grew worse, prompting different rumors that he was suffering from liver cancer, among other ailments, because of his increasingly gaunt face and build. From December 1984 to April 1985, Hudson landed a recurring role on the ABC prime time soap opera Dynasty as Daniel Reece, the love interest for Krystle Carrington (played by Linda Evans ) and biological father of the character Sammy Jo Carrington ( Heather Locklear ). While he had long been known to have difficulty memorizing lines, which resulted in his use of cue cards, on Dynasty it was Hudson&apos;s speech itself that began to deteriorate. Hudson was originally slated to appear for the duration of the show&apos;s 5th season, however, because of his progressing ill health, his character was abruptly written out of the show and died offscreen. [ Personal life ] While Hudson&apos;s career was developing, he and his agent Henry Willson kept his personal life out of the headlines. In 1955, Confidential magazine threatened to publish an exposé about Hudson&apos;s secret homosexual life. Willson forestalled this by disclosing information about two of his other clients. { Willson provided information about } { Rory Calhoun &apos;s years in prison and the arrest of } { Tab Hunter at a party in 1950.

Retrieved 2011-02-12. } former costars Elizabeth Taylor and Susan Saint James claimed they knew of his homosexual activity, as did Carol Burnett, who often worked on television and in live theatre with Hudson, but also that she did not care. However, after Hudson&apos;s death, Doris Day, widely thought to be a close off-screen friend, said she never knew of Hudson engaging in any homosexual behavior. [ April 2012 ] Soon after the Confidential incident, Hudson married Willson&apos;s secretary Phyllis Gates. Gates later wrote that she dated Hudson for several months, lived with him for two months before his surprise marriage proposal, and married Hudson out of love and not, as it was later purported, to prevent an exposé of Hudson&apos;s sexual orientation. { Phyllis Gates, My Husband, Rock Hudson (1987), written with } { Bob Thomas, pp.?? } Press coverage of the wedding quoted Hudson as saying, &quot; When I count my blessings, my marriage tops the list. &quot; Gates filed for divorce after three years in April 1958, charging mental cruelty. Hudson did not contest the divorce, and Gates received alimony of US$250 a week for 10 years. [ Dennis Mclellan Phyllis Gates: Her marriage to Hudson had fan magazines raving http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/obituaries/stories/011706dnmetgatesobit.ce8c30d.html Los Angeles Times January 16, 2006 2007-09-05 ] After her death from lung cancer in January 2006, some informants reportedly stated that she was actually a lesbian who married Hudson for his money, knowing from the beginning of their relationship that he was gay.

According to the 1986 biography Rock Hudson: His Story by Hudson and Sara Davidson, Hudson was good friends with American novelist Armistead Maupin, and Hudson&apos;s lovers included: Jack Coates (born 1944); Hollywood publicist Tom Clark (1933–1995), who also later published a memoir about Hudson, Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine; and Marc Christian, who later won a suit against the Hudson estate. An urban legend states that Hudson married Jim Nabors in the 1970s. In fact the two were never more than friends. According to Hudson, the legend originated with a group of &quot; middle-aged homosexuals who live in Huntington Beach &quot; who sent out joke invitations for their annual get-together. One year, the group invited its members to witness &quot; the marriage of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors &quot;, at which Hudson would take the surname of Nabors&apos; most famous character, Gomer Pyle, becoming &quot; Rock Pyle &quot;. Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor. As a result, Nabors and Hudson never spoke to each other again. [ Barbara Mikkelson Good Nabors Policy http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/nabors.htm Snopes August 10, 2007 2007-09-05 ] In 2007, Shannon Ragland described Hudson&apos;s involvement in a 1962 sex scandal at the University of Kentucky involving the football team. He told how wrestling promoter Jim Barnett hired players, including Hudson, as prostitutes. [ Ragland Shannon P. The Thin Thirty Louisville, Kentucky Set Shot Press 2007 0-9791222-1-X ] [ AIDS and death ] { Ronald Reagan and first lady } { Nancy Reagan at a White House state dinner, May 1984 } In July 1985, Hudson joined his old friend Doris Day for the launch of her new TV cable show, Doris Day&apos;s Best Friends. His gaunt appearance and nearly incoherent speech were so shocking that it was broadcast again all over the national news shows that night and for weeks to come. Hudson had been diagnosed with HIV on June 5, 1984, but when the signs of illness became apparent a few months later his publicity staff and doctors told the public he had inoperable liver cancer. During most of 1984 and 1985, Hudson kept his illness a secret while continuing to work and at the same time travel to France and other countries seeking a cure, or at least treatment to slow the progress of the disease. It was not until July 25, 1985, while in Paris for treatment, that Hudson issued a press release announcing that he was dying of AIDS. In another press release a month later, Hudson speculated he might have contracted HIV through transfused blood from an infected donor during the multiple blood transfusions he received during his heart bypass procedure in November 1981. He flew back to Los Angeles on July 31, where he was so physically weak he was taken off by stretcher from the Air France Boeing 747 he had chartered and upon which he and his medical attendants were the only passengers. { Shilts, Randy. And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic. New York: St. Martin&apos;s Press. 1987. p.580. ISBN 0-312-00994-1 } He was flown by helicopter to Cedars Sinai Hospital, where he spent nearly a month undergoing further treatment. When the doctors told him there was no hope of saving his life, since the disease had progressed into the advanced stages, Hudson returned to his house, &quot; The Castle &quot;, in Beverly Hills, where he remained in seclusion until his death on October 2, 1985 at 8:37  a.m. PDT. He was a month and a half away from his 60th birthday. The disclosure of Hudson&apos;s HIV status provoked widespread public discussion of his homosexuality. In its August 15, 1985 issue, &apos;&apos;People&apos;&apos; published a story that discussed his disease in the context of his sexuality. The largely sympathetic article featured comments from famous show business colleagues such as Angie Dickinson, Robert Stack, and Mamie Van Doren, who claimed they knew about Hudson&apos;s homosexuality and expressed their support for him. At that time People had a circulation of more than 2.8 million, { Diamond, Edwin. Celebrating Celebrity: The New Gossips. } { New York Magazine, Vol. 18, No. 19. May 13, 1985. } and, as a result of this and other stories, theories about Hudson&apos;s homosexuality became fully public. Hudson&apos;s revelation had an immediate impact on visibility of AIDS, and on funding of medical research related to the disease. Among activists who were seeking to de-stigmatize AIDS and its victims, Hudson&apos;s revelation of his own infection with the disease was viewed as an event that could transform the public&apos;s perception of AIDS. Shortly after Hudson&apos;s press release disclosing his infection, William M. Hoffman, the author of As Is, a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: &quot; If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It&apos;s just a disease, not a moral affliction. &quot; At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: &quot; Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn&apos;t get one major star to turn out.... Rock&apos;s admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS to the attention of the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage. &quot; Morgan Fairchild said that &quot; Rock Hudson&apos;s death gave AIDS a face &quot;.

I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth. &quot; Shortly after his death, People reported: &quot; Since Hudson made his announcement, more than $1.8 million in private contributions (more than double the amount collected in 1984) has been raised to support AIDS research and to care for AIDS victims (5,523 reported in 1985 alone). A few days after Hudson died, at 59, on Oct. 2, 1985, Congress set aside $221 million to develop a cure for AIDS. &quot; { &quot; Rock Hudson: His Name Stood for Hollywood&apos;s Golden Age of Wholesome Heroics and Lighthearted Romance—Until He Became the Most Famous Person to Die of Aids &quot;, } { People Magazine, Vol. 24 No. 26, Dec. 23, 1985.

Retrieved 2011-02-11 } However, Hudson&apos;s revelation did not immediately dispel the stigma of AIDS. Although then-president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan were friends of Hudson, Reagan, who was viewed by some as indifferent to the disease and its sufferers, made no public statement concerning Hudson&apos;s condition. { Boffey, Philip M. &quot; Reagan Defends Financing for AIDS &quot;, } { The New York Times, Sept. 17, 1985. Retrieved 2001-02-11. } At the same time, privately, Reagan called Hudson in his Paris hospital room where he was being treated in July 1985, and Nancy Reagan telephoned French President Francois Mitterrand to ensure that Hudson would receive the best possible care. Reagan&apos;s first public mention of the disease came in response to questions at a September 15, 1985 press conference, nearly two months after Hudson&apos;s announcement. In those remarks, Reagan called medical research on AIDS a &quot; top priority &quot;. However, when asked, &quot; If you had younger children, would you send them to a school with a child who had AIDS?, &quot; Reagan responded equivocally: &quot; [G]lad I&apos;m not faced with that problem today....  I can understand both sides of it. &quot; Several days later, Reagan sent a telegram to the Commitment to Life AIDS benefit, in which he reiterated his position that his administration would make stopping the spread of AIDS a top priority. Nevertheless, Reagan did not publicly address AIDS at length for another two years. { Boffey, Philip M. &quot; Reagan Urges Wide AIDS Testing But Does Not Call for Compulsion &quot;, } { The New York Times, June 1, 1987. Retrieved 2011-02-11 } In addition, a controversy arose concerning Hudson&apos;s participation in a scene in the television drama Dynasty in which he shared a kiss with actress Linda Evans. When filming the scene Hudson was aware that he had AIDS, but did not inform her. Some felt that he should have disclosed his condition to her beforehand. { Haller, Scot. “Rock Hudson&apos;s Startling Admission That He Has AIDS Prompts An Urgent Call for Action  — And Some Extreme Reactions”, } { People Magazine, Vol. 23, No. 13, Sept. 23, 1985.

According to comments given in August 1985 by Ed Asner, then president of the Screen Actors Guild, Hudson&apos;s revelation caused incipient &quot; panic &quot; within the film and television industry. Asner said that he was aware of scripts being rewritten to eliminate kissing scenes. { Harmetz, Aljean. &quot; Old and New Hollywood Seen in Attitude to AIDS &quot;, } { The New York Times, Aug. 8, 1985. Retrieved 2011-02-11. } Later in the same year, the Guild issued rules requiring that actors be notified in advance of any &quot; open-mouth &quot; kissing scenes, and providing that they could refuse to participate in such scenes without penalty. { Harmetz, Aljean. &quot; A Rule on Kissing Scenes and AIDS &quot;, } { The New York Times, Oct. 31, 1985.

Hudson was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea. [ Post burial, debate and legacy ] Following Hudson&apos;s funeral, Marc Christian sued Hudson&apos;s estate on grounds of &quot; intentional infliction of emotional distress &quot;. [ Willard Manus The Cleaning Man Airs Rock Hudson&apos;s Dirty Laundry in L.A. http://www.playbill.com/news/article/57447.html Playbill 18 December 2000 2007-09-05 ] Christian tested negative for HIV but claimed Hudson continued having sex with him until February 1985, more than eight months after Hudson knew he had HIV. Hudson biographer Sara Davidson later stated that, by the time she had met Hudson, Christian was living in the guest house, and Tom Clark, who had allegedly been Hudson&apos;s partner for many years before, was living in the house.

Kelley, starring Richard Henzel as Roy and Hannah Gomez as Caregiver, which was staged at American Theatre Company in Chicago in 2010 and Rock, by Tim Fountain, starring Michael Xavier as Rock and Bette Bourne as his agent Henry Willson, which was staged at London&apos;s Oval House Theatre in 2008. In 2010, with the gag orders finally lifted from the 1985 lawsuit trial of Marc Christian versus the estate of Rock Hudson, Robert Park Mills, the attorney who represented the Hudson estate against Christian in court, released a new 492 page book entitled Between Rock and a Hard Place-In Defense of Rock Hudson. In the book, Mills argues that the public was blinded from the real truth, the gross injustice done to the late actor by Christian and by Rock’s alleged friend, Mark Miller, as was the court, the jury, and the press. Mills argues that the jury overlooked the possibility Christian may have been AIDS-free simply because Hudson never had the relationship with Christian which Christian claimed to have had with him. According to this argument, if Hudson had had such a relationship, Christian would have had to have acquired HIV and AIDS if the repeated unprotected sexual activity claimed had taken place. Christian, who died in 2006 at age 56, never had HIV or AIDS. Mills argues that Christian did not tell the truth to his attorney Harold Rhoden or in court, and that Rock Hudson could not defend himself before the jurors because Christian waited until Rock died. Only when Christian found out he was not in the late actor&apos;s will did he bring his lawsuit, which won $5.5 million dollars from Hudson&apos;s estate (minus attorney&apos;s fees). { http://www.authorhouse.com/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000420092 } In the book Rock Hudson, Friend of Mine by his live-in Hollywood publicist Tom Clark, Clark said he would go to his grave believing Hudson acquired HIV from blood transfusions during his emergency quintuple bypass open heart surgery in 1981. Clark&apos;s book characterized Christian as &quot; a criminal, a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist and a squatter. &quot; Christian then sued Clark. Christian was living in the guest house after Clark, who had left in 1983, had returned to Hudson&apos;s home in 1985 to take care of him at assistant Mark Miller&apos;s request.

The episode depicted those close to Rock Hudson as untrusting of Marc Christian while one of Marc Christian&apos;s former lovers depicts Marc Christian as not being the person depicted by the friends of Rock Hudson. If you believe the friends of Rock Hudson, then Marc Christian was only using Rock Hudson to immerse himself into Hollywood society to launch a film career. After Rock Hudson&apos;s death and the receipt of millions from the lawsuit, Marc Christian did not attempt to use the fame he achieved from the lawsuit for any personal gain leaving people independent of the situation to question which side is telling the true story.
