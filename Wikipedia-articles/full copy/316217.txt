[ the view of this character in the Hebrew Bible the view of him as a Prophet in Islam Shuayb (prophet) ] [ Jethro ] In the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible, Jethro ( [ icon ˈ dʒ ɛ θ r oʊ ]; [ יִתְרוֹ ], Standard Yitro Tiberian [ Yiṯrô ]; &quot; His Excellence/Posterity &quot;; Arabic [ ar شعيب ] Shu-ayb ) is Moses &apos; father-in-law, a Kenite shepherd and priest of Midian. { Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. } He is also revered as a prophet in his own right in the Druze religion, [ http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140251 MK Kara: Druze are Descended from Jews Lev David 25 October 2010 Israel National News Arutz Sheva 13 April 2011 ] and considered an ancestor of the Druze. [ Blumberg Arnold Zion Before Zionism: 1838-1880 1985 Syracuse University Press Syracuse, NY 0-8156-2336-4 201 ] [ In Exodus ] { Jan Victors, c. 1635, from the incident in } [ Exodus 4:18 NIV ] {. Jethro is seated on the left, in red. } Jethro is called a priest of Midian and became father-in-law of Moses after he gave his daughter, Zipporah, in marriage to Moses. He is introduced in [ Exodus 2:18 NIV ]. Jethro is recorded as living in Midian; a territory stretching along the eastern edge of the Gulf of Aqaba in what is today, northwestern Saudi Arabia. Some believe Midian is within the Sinai Peninsula. Biblical maps from antiquity show Midian on both locations. [ June 2011 ] Jethro&apos;s daughter, Zipporah, became Moses&apos;s wife after Moses had fled Egypt, after he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave. Moses is said to have worked as a shepherd for Jethro for 40 years before returning to Egypt to lead the Hebrews to Canaan, the &quot; promised land &quot;. After Moses had begun to lead the Israelites on their Exodus, it was Jethro that encouraged Moses to appoint others to share in the burden of ministry to the nation Israel by allowing others to help in the judgment of smaller matters coming before him. This takes place in the Torah portion Yitro (Exodus 18:1-20:23). [ Names ] There is a controversy about this father-in-law of Moses and whether or not the Bible contradicts itself in regard to his name(s). In the KJV version of [ Judges 4:11 KJV ], a man named Hobab appears as Moses&apos; father-in-law, while [ Numbers 10:29 KJV ] makes him &quot; the son of Raguel [Reuel] the Midianite, Moses&apos; father in law &quot;.One thing to consider is that there is only one Biblical Hebrew word for both &quot; brother-in-law &quot; and &quot; father-in-law &quot; (chathan) { Strong&apos;s number 2859 }. It is, in fact, the word for any and all relations by marriage. If one takes into account the Biblical custom of multiple names for one person as well as [ Judges 4:11 KJV ] calling Hobab Reuel&apos;s son, Reuel and Jethro both appear as Moses&apos; father-in-law, while Hobab must be seen as his brother-in-law.There are, however, disputes among theologians in this matter. { Parallel Translations of Judges 4:11 with commentaries } { Parallel Translations of Numbers 10:29 with commentaries } [ Jethro in Islam ] [ Shuʿayb ] Under the name Shuʿayb or Shoaib, ( [ شعيب ]; meaning Who shows the right path), Jethro is revered as a Prophet of Islam { Brandon M. Wheeler, Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Shuayb, pg. 303 } though Islam attributes to him many deeds not attested in the Bible. He is believed to have lived after Abraham, and Muslims believe that he was sent as a prophet to two communities, namely the Midianites { Quran 7:85-93 } and the People of the Wood. { Quran 26:176-177 } To both the people, Shoaib proclaimed the faith of Islam and warned the people to end their fraudulent ways. When they did not repent, God destroyed both the communities. [ 7 85 91 ns ] { Quran 26:189 } Shoaib is understood by Muslims to have been one of the few Arabian prophets mentioned by name in the Qur&apos;an, the others being Saleh, Hud, Ishmael and Muhammad. It is said that he was known by early Muslim s as &quot; the eloquent preacher amongst the prophets &quot;, because he was, according to Islamic tradition, granted talent and eloquence in his language. { Stories of The Prophets, } { Ibn Kathir, pg. 220 } Unlike the account in the Hebrew Bible, Islam does not closely associate Shuʿayb with Moses/Musa, also hounored as a Prophet of Islam. Shoaib is particularly central in the rites and pilgimages of the Druze religion.
