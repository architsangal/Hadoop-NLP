It was replaced on 1 April 2010 by the UK Space Agency. [ Amos http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8579270.stm &apos;Muscular&apos; UK Space Agency launched BBC News Jonathan 23 March 2010 23 March 2010 ] [ Structure ] BNSC operated as a voluntary partnership of ten British government departments and agencies and research councils. The civil portion of the British space programme focused on space science, Earth observation, satellite telecommunications, and global navigation (for example GPS and Galileo ). The latest version of the UK civil space strategy which defined the goals of BNSC was published in February 2008. { &quot; UK Civil Space Strategy 2008 - 2012 &quot;. } Notably the BNSC had a policy against human spaceflight, [ UK vision to stay at the forefront of space sector published http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/7203.aspx 2009-05-29 ] and did not contribute to the International Space Station. [ http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html European Participation, ISS Participating States 2009-05-29 ] [ Staffing arrangements ] Rather than being a full space agency as maintained in some other countries, BNSC HQ comprised around thirty civil servants on rotation from the partners. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) was the &apos;host&apos; department and provided the central policy staff including the Director General. The last DG, Dr. David Williams, was the first to have been externally appointed. Much of Britain&apos;s yearly civil space budget of £268 million was contributed by the Department of Trade and Industry (until the DTI was broken up in 2007) or controlled by the partnership rather than the BNSC, and about three-quarters of that budget flows directly to the European Space Agency. { BNSC - How we work, BNSC website, retrieved 15 July 2009: &quot; In the year 2008-9, BNSC&apos;s partners spent £268 million on space programmes - about 76% of which was the UK&apos;s contribution to European Space Agency &quot; } BNSC staff represented the UK at the various programme boards of ESA and also its governing Council. In 2004, the budget for BNSC headquarters was approximately £500,000 (US$1 million). { &quot; British Audit Finds Strengths, Needs in Space Program &quot;, Peter de Selding, Space News, 29 March 2004. &lt; -- http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive04/auditarch_032904.html now offline -- &gt; } { From January 2009, the BNSC was headquartered in } { Swindon, Wiltshire, in the same building as the } { Science and Technology Facilities Council ( } { Research Councils ) and the } { Technology Strategy Board.

Investments were also made in the ESA telecommunications programme &apos;ARTES&apos; in order to develop payload technology used, for example, in the satellites of Inmarsat, the UK based mobile satellite operator. The BNSC partnership co-funded a private sector project led by Avanti Communications to build a satellite called HYLAS { &apos;Our satellite HYLAS&apos; } to provide broadband communications to rural and remote users. Current projects in the field of space science include LISA Pathfinder, for which UK industry is the prime contractor and UK universities are building key payload elements; the astrometry Gaia mission, for which UK industry is supplying the detectors, avionics, software and data processing electronics; and the James Webb Space Telescope, for which a UK consortium led by the UK Astronomy Technology Centre is building the European part of the Mid Infra Red Instrument (MIRI). The UK has contributed the SPIRE instrument for the Herschel Space Observatory and detector and cooling system technology for the Planck cosmic microwave background mission. In the field of Earth observation, projects include the ESA ADM-Aeolus wind profiling mission, for which UK industry is the prime contractor and CryoSat-2 which is led by UK scientist Professor Duncan Wingham of University College London. Recent BNSC activities include the Mosaic small satellite programme, which led to the launch of the TopSat high resolution EO mission and also the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. [ Harwell ] In November 2008, BNSC announced new contributions to ESA and an agreement in principle to establish an ESA centre at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. { &quot; Deal struck on UK-ESA Research Centre and GMES &quot; BNSC press release, 26 November 2008. } The ESA facility at Harwell was opened officially on 22 July 2009. { &quot; European Space Agency touches down in UK &quot; BNSC press release, 22 July 2009 } The name of the ESA centre is the European Robotics and Climate Change Centre. In February 2009, BNSC, ESA and Reaction Engines Limited announced a public–private partnership funding scheme to demonstrate key technologies of the SABRE engine for the proposed Skylon spaceplane. { &quot; The rocket that thinks it&apos;s a jet &quot; BNSC press release, 19 February 2009 } [ Partners ] BNSC Partners: { BNSC website, &quot; BNSC Partners &quot;, retrieved on 31 October 2007. } Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Department for Transport Ministry of Defence Foreign and Commonwealth Office Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Department for Children, Schools and Families Technology Strategy Board Natural Environment Research Council Science and Technology Facilities Council Met Office [ See also ] British space programme Astronautical hygiene [ References ] [ 2 ] [ External links ] British National Space Centre UK Government Space IGS (Innovation and Growth Strategy) Douglas Millard, An Overview of United Kingdom Space Activity 1957-1987, ESA [ Video clips ] Interview with David Williams in 2008 UK in space: BNSC video 2009 [ 51.5672 -1.7855 title ] Category:British space programme Category:Organisations based in Swindon Category:Government agencies established in 1985 Category:Astronomy in the United Kingdom Category:Space agencies Category:Space centres Category:Winners of the Sir Arthur Clarke Award Category:Government agencies disestablished in 2010 Category:1985 establishments in the United Kingdom fr:UK Space Agency it:British National Space Centre he:המרכז הבריטי הלאומי לחלל mk:Национален британски вселенски центар ja:イギリス国立宇宙センター pt:British National Space Centre ru:Британский национальный космический центр fi:BNSC zh:英國國家太空中心
