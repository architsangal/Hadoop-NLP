The population was 26,801 as of the 2010 census. [ Geography ] Windsor is located on U.S. Route 101 in the Russian River valley, about [ 5 mi ] southeast of Healdsburg, California. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 7.3 sqmi km2 ], 99.66% of it land and 0.34% of it water. Windsor is [ 2 mi ] from the Russian River. [ History ] Although first settled by European Americans in 1851, Windsor was not incorporated until July 1, 1992. Pony Express Rider, Hiram Lewis, became the town&apos;s first postmaster in 1855. He named the town Windsor because it reminded him of the grounds around Windsor Castle. [ September 2010 ] In 1915, the Old Redwood Highway through Windsor was paved. Up until then, all roads in the area had been dirt. [ September 2010 ] During World War II, a United States Army Air Forces air base (now the Charles M. Schulz – Sonoma County Airport ) was built in southern Windsor, and it was typical to hear fighter aircraft and bombers flying over the town. In 1943, a camp for German prisoners-of-war was built [ 1 mi ] from downtown. [ September 2010 ] In 1965, the Windsor Volunteer Fire Department was organized, providing fire protection to the local area. Originally operated out of a small garage by an antique shop, using two 1940s-era fire engines, the department grew rapidly. In the early 1970s, the volunteer firefighters built a larger firehouse, by hand, at 444 Windsor Road. This was demoted to Station 2 in 1998 and was replaced in 2009 by a brand-new firehouse. Around that time the equipment roster grew from two pieces of equipment to two engines, a water tender, a rescue squad, and two utility vehicles, filling up the entire station. In 1992, the department was formed into the Windsor Fire Protection District and brought on two paid firefighters. By 2008, it had grown to four paid firefighters on duty at any given time. Today there are two fire stations protecting the town, one on each side of U.S. Route 101, and is now operated by the Central Sonoma County Fire Authority.
