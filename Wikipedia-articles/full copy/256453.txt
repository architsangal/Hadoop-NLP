Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, or Hierarchy of Demons first appears as an Appendix to Johann Weyer &apos;s De praestigiis daemonum (1577). The title of the book translates roughly to &quot; false monarchy of demons &quot;. A grimoire similar in nature to the Ars Goetia, the first book of The Lesser Key of Solomon, it contains a list of demons, and the appropriate hours and rituals to conjure them. The book was written before known copies of The Lesser Key of Solomon, and has some differences. There are sixty-nine demons listed (instead of seventy-two), and the order of the spirits varies, as well as some of their characteristics. The demons Vassago, Seere, Dantalion and Andromalius are not listed in this book, while Pruflas is not listed in The Lesser Key of Solomon. Pseudomonarchia Daemonum does not attribute seals to the demons, as The Lesser Key of Solomon does. Weyer referred to his source manuscript as Liber officiorum spirituum, seu Liber dictus Empto. Salomonis, de principibus et regibus daemoniorum. (Book of the offices of spirits, or the book called &apos;Empto&apos;. Solomon, concerning the princes and kings of demons). But in the entry for the demon Gaap or Tap, the text refuses Solomon as the originator of invocations, indicating Ham, son of Noah, instead: There were certain necromancers that offered sacrifices and burnt offerings unto him; and to call him up, they exercised an art, saying that Salomon the wise made it. Which is false: for it was rather Cham, the son of Noah, who after the flood began first to invocate wicked spirits. He invocated Bileth, and made an art in his name, and a book which is known to many mathematicians. It also mentions Purgatory, calling it &quot; Cartagra &quot;. [ The 69 demons ] 1. Bael 2.
