[ Geography ] Shimada is located in the Shida Plains of west-central Shizuoka Prefecture. It is located on both banks of the Ōi River. The area enjoys a warm maritime climate with hot, humid summers and mild, cool winters.

In the Edo period, Kanaya-juku and Shimada-juku developed as post town s on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. The area was mostly tenryō territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate with a daikansho based at a Jinya located within Shimada-juku. As the Tokugawa shogunate forbade the construction of any bridge or establishment of a ferry service on the Ōi River for defensive purposes, travellers were often detained at either Shimada or Kanaya for days, sometimes weeks, waiting for the river levels to fall to fordable levels. The first bridge (the Hōrai Bridge ) across the river connected these two towns in 1879, after the Meiji Restoration. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period in 1889, Kanaya Town was created within Haibara District, and Shimada Town within Shida District. On April 16, 1889, the two towns were connected by rail, with the opening of Shimada Station on the Tōkaidō Main Line. Shimada was elevated to city status on January 1, 1948. On January 1, 1955, it annexed neighboring Rokugo Village, Otsu Village, Daichō Village and a portion of Ikumi Village. On June 1, 1961 it further expanded through annexation of Hatsukura Village. In May 2005, Shimada and the town of Kanaya finally merged. On April 1, 2008 the new Shimada City further expanded with another merger to absorb the neighboring town of Kawane. On 15 March 2012, the city became the second municipality, after Tokyo, outside Tōhoku to accept debris from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami for disposal in the town&apos;s incinerators. Other cities had been reluctant to accept debris from the disaster, in spite of being asked to help recovery efforts, because of fears that the debris were contaminated by radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. { Kyodo News, &quot; City of Shimada to accept debris from Iwate to help reconstruction &quot;, } { Japan Times, 16 March 2012, p. 1. } [ Economy ] The economy of Shimada is primarily agricultural, with green tea as the main crop. By extension, Kenrico is a pharmaceutical company based in Shimada that largely focuses on natural remedies. Light industries include factories for the production of automobile components.
