It is one of the most important adipose derived hormones.

Hered. 41 12 317–8 1950 December 14824537 http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/12/317 ] These mice were massively obese and excessively voracious. Ultimately, several strains of laboratory mice have been found to be homozygous for single-gene mutations that cause them to become grossly obese, and they fall into two classes: &quot; ob/ob &quot;, those having mutations in the gene for the protein hormone leptin, and &quot; db/db &quot;, those having mutations in the gene that encodes the receptor for leptin. When ob/ob mice are treated with injections of leptin, they lose their excess fat and return to normal body weight. Leptin itself was discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman at the Rockefeller University and Douglas L. Coleman through the study of such mice.

It is manufactured primarily in the adipocytes of white adipose tissue, and the level of circulating leptin is directly proportional to the total amount of fat in the body. In addition to white adipose tissue —the major source of leptin —it can also be produced by brown adipose tissue, placenta (syncytiotrophoblasts), ovaries, skeletal muscle, stomach (lower part of fundic glands), mammary epithelial cells, bone marrow, pituitary and liver. [ Margetic S, Gazzola C, Pegg GG, Hill RA Leptin: a review of its peripheral actions and interactions Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 26 11 1407–1433 2002 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802142 12439643 ] Leptin has also been discovered to be synthesised from gastric chief cell s and P/D1 cell s in the stomach. [ Bado A, Levasseur S, Attoub S, Kermorgant S, Laigneau JP, Bortoluzzi MN, Moizo L, Lehy T, Guerre-Millo M, Le Marchand-Brustel Y, Lewin MJ The stomach is a source of leptin Nature 394 6695 790–793 1998 August 9723619 10.1038/29547 ] [ Function ] Leptin acts on receptors in the hypothalamus of the brain where it inhibits appetite by (1) counteracting the effects of neuropeptide Y (a potent feeding stimulant secreted by cells in the gut and in the hypothalamus); (2) counteracting the effects of anandamide (another potent feeding stimulant that binds to the same receptors as THC ), and (3) promoting the synthesis of α-MSH, an appetite suppressant. This appetite inhibition is long-term, in contrast to the rapid inhibition of eating by cholecystokinin (CCK) and the slower suppression of hunger between meals mediated by PYY3-36. The absence of leptin (or its receptor) leads to uncontrolled food intake and resulting obesity. Several studies have shown that fasting or following a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) lowers leptin levels. Studies include: [ Dubuc G, Phinney S, Stern J, Havel P Changes of serum leptin and endocrine and metabolic parameters after 7 days of energy restriction in men and women Metab. Clin.

Endocrinol. Metab. 82 2 561–565 1997 9024254 10.1210/jc.82.2.561 ] It might be that, in the short-term, leptin is an indicator of energy balance. This system is more sensitive to starvation than to overfeeding; leptin levels change more when food intake decreases than when it increases. [ Chin-Chance C, Polonsky K, Schoeller D Twenty-four-hour leptin levels respond to cumulative short-term energy imbalance and predict subsequent intake J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 85 8 2685–2691 2000 10946866 10.1210/jc.85.8.2685 ] It might be that the dynamics of leptin due to an acute change in energy balance are related to appetite and eventually to food intake. Although this is a new hypothesis, there are already some data that support it.

One research group suggested that increased levels of melatonin caused a downregulation of leptin.

It enters the central nervous system (CNS) in proportion to its plasma concentration. Its receptors are found in brain neurons involved in regulating energy intake and expenditure. It controls food intake and energy expenditure by acting on receptors in the mediobasal hypothalamus [ Interaction with amylin ] Co-administration of two neurohormones known to have a role in body weight control, amylin (produced by beta cells in the pancreas) and leptin (produced by fat cells), results in sustained, fat-specific weight loss in a leptin-resistant animal model of obesity.

Leptin signals to the brain that the body has had enough to eat, producing a feeling of satiety. A very small group of humans possess homozygous mutations for the leptin gene that leads to a constant desire for food, resulting in severe obesity. This condition can be treated somewhat successfully by the administration of recombinant human leptin. [ Gibson WT, Farooqi IS, Moreau M, DePaoli AM, Lawrence E, O&apos;Rahilly S, Trussell RA Congenital leptin deficiency due to homozygosity for the Delta133G mutation: report of another case and evaluation of response to four years of leptin therapy J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 89 10 4821–4826 2004 October 15472169 10.1210/jc.2004-0376 ] However, extensive clinical trials using recombinant human leptin as a therapeutic agent for treating obesity in humans have been inconclusive because only the most obese subjects who were given the highest doses of exogenous leptin produced statistically significant weight loss. It was concluded that large and frequent doses are needed to provide only modest benefit because of leptin’s low circulating half-life, low potency, and poor solubility. Furthermore, these injections caused some participants to drop out of the study due to inflammatory responses of the skin at the injection site. Some of these problems can be alleviated by a form of leptin called Fc-leptin, which takes the Fc fragment from the immunoglobulin gamma chain as the N-terminal fusion partner and follows it with leptin. This Fc-leptin fusion has been experimentally proven to be highly soluble, more biologically potent, and contain a much longer serum half-life. As a result, this Fc-leptin was successfully shown to treat obesity in both leptin-deficient and normal mice, although studies have not been undertaken on human subjects. This makes Fc-leptin a potential treatment for obesity in humans after more extensive testing.

Des. Sel. 18 1 1–10 2005 January 15790575 10.1093/protein/gzh102 ] Circulating leptin levels give the brain input regarding energy storage so it can regulate appetite and metabolism. Leptin works by inhibiting the activity of neurons that contain neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and by increasing the activity of neurons expressing α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). The NPY neurons are a key element in the regulation of appetite; small doses of NPY injected into the brains of experimental animals stimulates feeding, while selective destruction of the NPY neurons in mice causes them to become anorexic. On the converse, α-MSH is an important mediator of satiety, and differences in the gene for the receptor at which α-MSH acts in the brain are linked to obesity in humans. [ Circulatory system ] The role of leptin/leptin receptors in modulation of T cell activity in immune system was shown in experimentation with mice. It modulates the immune response to atherosclerosis, which is a predisposing factor in patients with obesity.

In some epidemiological studies, hyperleptinemia is considered as a risk factor. However, recently a handful of animal experiments demonstrated that systemic hyperleptinemia produced by infusion or adenoviral gene transfer decreases blood pressure in rats.

The leptin from the mesenchyme, in turn, acts back on the epithelium at the leptin receptor carried in the alveolar type II pneumocytes and induces surfactant expression, which is one of the main functions of these type II pneumocytes.

Leptin has a lesser effect in humans. In mammals such as humans, ovulatory cycles in females are linked to energy balance (positive or negative depending on whether a female is losing or gaining weight) and energy flux (how much energy is consumed and expended) much more than energy status (fat levels). When energy balance is highly negative (meaning that a woman is starving) or energy flux is very high (meaning that a woman is exercising at extreme levels, but still consuming enough calories), the ovarian cycle stops and females stop menstruating. Only if a female has an extremely low body fat percentage does energy status affect menstruation. Some studies have indicated that leptin levels outside an ideal range can have a negative effect on egg quality and outcome during IVF.

A number of theories have been put forward concerning the cortical-cancellous dichotomy including a recent theory suggesting that increased leptin during obesity may represent a mechanism for enlarging bone size and thus bone resistance to cope with increased body weight. [ Hamrick MW, Ferrari SL Leptin and the sympathetic connection of fat to bone Osteoporos Int 19 7 905–912 2008 July 17924050 10.1007/s00198-007-0487-9 ] Bone metabolism is under direct control of the brain and thus nerve fibres are present in bone tissue. [ Allison SJ, Herzog H NPY and bone EXS 95 171–82 2006 16383006 ] A number of brain signalling molecules ( neuropeptides and neurotransmitters ) have been found in bone including adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y.

Biochem. 88 4 706–712 2003 March 12577304 10.1002/jcb.10385 ] This evidence supports a direct signalling system between the brain and bone with accumulating evidence suggesting that these molecules are directly involved in the regulation of bone metabolism. Leptin, once released from fat tissue, can cross the blood–brain barrier and bind to its receptors in the brain where it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism. [ Takeda S, Elefteriou F, Levasseur R, Liu X, Zhao L, Parker KL, Armstrong D, Ducy P, Karsenty G Leptin regulates bone formation via the sympathetic nervous system Cell 111 3 305–317 2002 November 12419242 10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01049-8 ] It is also possible that, in addition to its effects through the brain, leptin may act directly on cells in the bone to regulate bone metabolism. In reality, leptin probably signals to bone on multiple levels, with local and systemic checks and balances impacting the final outcome. [ February 2012 ] As a result, the clinical utility of leptin for treatment of bone diseases remains open but ongoing research may yet provide much needed therapies for stimulating bone formation. [ Clinical significance ] Leptin has traditionally been regarded as a link between fat mass, food intake, and energy expenditure. This link originally arose from animal research findings, but its application to describing human systems has since been challenged.

In obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea, leptin level is increased, but decreased after the administration of continuous positive airway pressure. In non-obese individuals, however, restful sleep (i.e., 8–12 hours of unbroken sleep) can increase leptin to normal levels. Serum level of leptin is reduced by sleep deprivation. However, a recent study showed that sleep deprivation was linked with higher levels of leptin. Leptin level is increased by perceived emotional stress. Leptin level is decreased/increased by increase in testosterone / estrogen level respectively. Leptin level is chronically reduced by physical exercise training.

However, while leptin is associated with body fat mass, the size of individual fat cells, and the act of overeating, it is interesting that it is not affected by exercise (for comparison, IL-6 is released in response to muscular contractions ). Thus, it is speculated that leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammation.

FEBS Lett. 583(2):259-65 &gt; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19111549 } Taken as such, increases in leptin levels (in response to caloric intake) function as an acute pro-inflammatory response mechanism to prevent excessive cellular stress induced by overeating. When high caloric intake overtaxes fat cells&apos; ability to grow larger or increase in number in step with caloric intake, the ensuing stress response leads to inflammation at the cellular level and ectopic fat storage, i.e., the unhealthy storage of body fat within internal organs, arteries, and/or muscle. The insulin increase in response to the caloric load provokes a dose-dependent rise in leptin, an effect potentiated by high cortisol levels. [ Wabitsch M, Jensen PB, Blum WF, Christoffersen CT, Englaro P, Heinze E, Rascher W, Teller W, Tornqvist H, Hauner H Insulin and cortisol promote leptin production in cultured human fat cells Diabetes 45 10 1435–1438 1996 October 8826983 10.2337/diabetes.45.10.1435 ] (This insulin-leptin relationship is notably similar to insulin&apos;s effect on the increase of IL-6 gene expression and secretion from preadipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner.) [ LaPensee CR, Hugo ER, Ben-Jonathan N Insulin stimulates interleukin-6 expression and release in LS14 human adipocytes through multiple signaling pathways Endocrinology 149 11 5415–5422 2008 November 18617614 2584585 10.1210/en.2008-0549 ] Furthermore, plasma leptin concentrations have been observed to gradually increase when acipimox is administered to prevent lipolysis, concurrent hypocaloric dieting and weight loss notwithstanding. [ Worm D, Vinten J, Vaag A, Henriksen JE, Beck-Nielsen H The nicotinic acid analogue acipimox increases plasma leptin and decreases free fatty acids in type 2 diabetic patients Eur. J. Endocrinol. 143 3 389–395 2000 September 11022182 10.1530/eje.0.1430389 ] Such findings appear to demonstrate that high caloric loads in excess of fat cells&apos; storage rate capacities lead to stress responses that induce an increase in leptin, which then operates as an adipose-derived inflammation stopgap signaling for the cessation of food intake so as to prevent adipose-derived inflammation from reaching elevated levels. This response may then protect against the harmful process of ectopic fat storage, which perhaps explains the connection between chronically-elevated leptin levels and ectopic fat storage in obese individuals. [ Obesity and leptin resistance ] Although leptin is a circulating signal that reduces appetite, obese individuals generally exhibit an unusually high circulating concentration of leptin. [ Considine RV, Sinha MK, Heiman ML, Kriauciunas A, Stephens TW, Nyce MR, Ohannesian JP, Marco CC, McKee LJ, Bauer TL Serum immunoreactive-leptin concentrations in normal-weight and obese humans N.

The high sustained concentrations of leptin from the enlarged adipose stores result in leptin desensitization. The pathway of leptin control in obese people might be flawed at some point so the body does not adequately receive the satiety feeling subsequent to eating. Some researchers attempted to explain the failure of leptin to prevent obesity in modern humans as a metabolic disorder, possibly caused by a specific nutrient or a combination of nutrients that were not present or were not common in the prehistoric diet. Some proposed &quot; villain &quot; nutrients include lectin s [ http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6823/5/10 Tommy Jönsson 2005, 1 10.1186/1472-6823-5-10 Olsson Stefan Ahrén Bo Bøg-Hansen Thorkildc Dole Anita Lindeberg Staffan BMC Endocrine Disorders 5 10 16336696 Agrarian diet and diseases of affluence--do evolutionary novel dietary lectins cause leptin resistance? 1326203 ] and fructose.

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology ] A signal-to-noise ratio theory has been proposed to explain the phenomenon of leptin resistance. In healthy individuals, baseline leptin levels are between 1-5  ng/dl in men and 7-13  ng/dl in women. A large intake of calories triggers a leptin response that reduces hunger, thereby preventing an overload of the inflammatory response induced by caloric intake. It has been theorized that, in obese individuals, the leptin response to caloric intake is blunted due to chronic, low-grade hyperleptinemia depressing the signal-to-noise ratio such that acute leptin responses have less of a physiological effect on the body. Although leptin resistance is sometimes described as a metabolic disorder that contributes to obesity, similar to the way insulin resistance is sometimes described as a metabolic disorder that has the potential to progress into the type 2 diabetes, it is not certain that it is true in most cases. The mere fact that leptin resistance is extremely common in obese individuals suggests that it may simply be an adaptation to excess body weight. It has been suggested that the major physiological role of leptin is not as a “satiety signal” to prevent obesity in times of energy excess, but as a “starvation signal” to maintain adequate fat stores for survival during times of energy deficit, [ http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v18/n2/full/oby2009228a.html Leptin and the Control of Body Weight: A Review of Its Diverse Central Targets, Signaling Mechanisms, and Role in the Pathogenesis of Obesity Ashwini Oswal and Giles Yeo Obesity 2010 18 2 10.1038/oby.2009.228 221–229 19644451 ] [ http://www.leptinresearch.org/pdf/rsh_high_fat_diets_and_leptin.pdf The effects of high fat diets on the blood–brain barrier transport of leptin: Failure or adaptation? ] and that leptin resistance in overweight individuals is the standard feature of mammalian physiology, which possibly confers a survival advantage.

[ Interactions with fructose ] A study published suggests that the consumption of high amounts of fructose causes leptin resistance and elevated triglyceride s in rats. The rats consuming the high-fructose diet subsequently ate more and gained more weight than controls when fed a high-fat, high-calorie diet.

[ Mechanism of action ] Leptin interacts with six types of receptors (Ob-Ra –Ob-Rf, or LepRa-LepRf) that in turn are encoded by a single gene, LEPR. [ Wang MY, Zhou YT, Newgard CB, Unger RH A novel leptin receptor isoform in rat FEBS Lett. 392 2 87–90 1996 August 8772180 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00790-9 ] Ob-Rb is the only receptor isoform that can signal intracellular ly via the Jak-Stat and MAPK signal transduction pathways, [ Malendowicz W, Rucinski M, Macchi C, Spinazzi R, Ziolkowska A, Nussdorfer GG, Kwias Z Leptin and leptin receptors in the prostate and seminal vesicles of the adult rat Int.

It is generally thought that leptin might enter the brain at the choroid plexus, where there is intense expression of a form of leptin receptor molecule that could act as a transport mechanism. Once leptin has bound to the Ob-Rb receptor, it activates the stat3, which is phosphorylated and travels to the nucleus to, it is presumed, effect changes in gene expression. One of the main effects on gene expression is the down-regulation of the expression of endocannabinoids, responsible for increasing appetite [ October 2009 ]. There are other intracellular pathways activated by leptin, but less is known about how they function in this system. In response to leptin, receptor neurons have been shown to remodel themselves, changing the number and types of synapses that fire onto them. There is some recognition that leptin action is more decentralized than previously assumed. In addition to its endocrine action at a distance (from adipose tissue to brain), leptin also acts as a paracrine mediator. [ Metreleptin ] An analog of human leptin, metreleptin is under investigation for the treatment of diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia, in patients with rare forms of lipodystrophy, syndromes characterized by abnormalities in adipose tissue distribution, and severe metabolic abnormalities. Amylin Pharmaceuticals, the drug&apos;s developer, has received orphan drug designation for metreleptin from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development, as well as fast track designation for this indication. In a three-year-long study of metreleptin in patients with lipodystrophy organized by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), metreleptin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in blood glucose (A1c decrease from 9.4% at baseline to 7.0% at study end) and triglyceride concentration (from 500  mg/dL at baseline to 200  mg/dL at study end).
