[ Gameplay and features ] A battle screenshot In order to play, the player uses a toy sword as their game controller to walk (by pointing forward), to fight off monsters, defend with your shield, cast spells, and for every other input needed by the system. Slashing the sword in different directions (horizontal, diagonal, vertical) by the player will cause different effects and damage to enemies encountered in the game world. The game&apos;s ROM is located on an item that resembles a shield. To save a game in process, the person must use a memory card that looks like a book, which is inserted into the shield. This game is classified as Adventure, and not a traditional Role-playing game. This is because most of the game is set on a predetermined path that you can only travel in one direction, with few exceptions of side paths. Enemy encounters are set at predetermined locations and formations. This is in contrast to a Role-playing game focusing on dungeon crawling and open exploration.
