He briefly wrestled for WCW under the name Bruiser Mastino. Jacobs also worked a brief tour in the UWFI under his real name. [ January 2011 ] [ World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment ] [ Debut and early gimmicks (1995–1997) ] Jacobs made his first television appearance as a heel with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Dr. Isaac Yankem DDS, Jerry Lawler &apos;s private dentist, in a vignette on the June 26, 1995 episode of Raw. { 1995 results. The History of WWE. Retrieved December 21, 2011. } [ The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels Oliver Greg 2007 ECW Press 1-55022-759-9 227 ] Placing emphasis on Jacobs&apos; imposing height and weight, Yankem was portrayed as a monsterous figure whom Lawler had hired for the purpose of ridding the WWF of his longtime nemesis, Bret Hart. His in-ring debut occurred at a Superstars taping on August 15, where he lost to Hart by count-out. At SummerSlam, Jacobs was disqualified when he hung Hart by twisting him in the top and middle ropes by his neck. He lost to Hart in a steel cage match in the main event of the October 16 episode of Raw, and finally in a tag team match against Hart and Hakushi, in which he was partnered with Lawler, on the November 6 episode of the show. After his initial run with Hart, Jacobs&apos; push dwindled. His team was unsuccessful in an elimination match at Survivor Series. He participated in the 1996 Royal Rumble match, but spent the majority of the year as a jobber to the stars, including televised losses to The Undertaker, Jake &quot; The Snake &quot; Roberts, Marc Mero and The Ultimate Warrior. Jacobs sported the Yankem gimmick until September. { 1996 results. The History of WWE. Retrieved July 14, 2011. } Later that month, play-by-play announcer Jim Ross introduced Rick Bognar as &quot; Razor Ramon &quot; and Jacobs as &quot; Diesel &quot; as part of a storyline mocking the departure of former employees Scott Hall and Kevin Nash respectively, and also as an attempt to portray Ross as a villainous character. The idea proved unpopular and was dropped almost immediately, and despite receiving a WWF Tag Team Championship match against Owen Hart and The British Bulldog at the In Your House 12: It&apos;s Time pay-per-view, the gimmick&apos;s television lifespan lasted only until the 1997 Royal Rumble, where Jacobs was the second-to-last participant (with the exception of Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was previously eliminated by Bret Hart but the officials did not witness the elimination, so he re-entered the ring). He continued to work live events as &quot; Diesel &quot; through April, but would not make any WWF appearances from then until October, as the character of Kane was gradually introduced. { 1997 results.

On the May 12 episode of Raw, Foley reintroduced Bearer, whose face was heavily bandaged due to the burns The Undertaker had inflicted. Prompted by the injury, Bearer attempted to reunite with The Undertaker after a long period of mutual hostility, using the threat of revealing The Undertaker&apos;s &quot; biggest secret &quot;; during the cryptic interview, Bearer likened the fire that had burned his face at Revenge of the &apos;Taker to a fire that had occurred during The Undertaker&apos;s childhood. When The Undertaker continually refused to once again become aligned with Bearer week-after-week, Bearer began tormenting him by telling him that his long-lost brother, Kane (later revealed as Bearer&apos;s son, and the Undertaker&apos;s half-brother ), was coming to the WWF to challenge him. In the ensuing months, Bearer implied that The Undertaker had killed his family by starting a fire at their funeral home, with the exception of Kane, who was left physically and mentally scarred by the event; The Undertaker claimed that Kane, a pyromania c, was the one who started the fire, and could not possibly have survived. Six months after the angle began, Jacobs made his first appearance as Kane at Badd Blood: In Your House on October 5, costing The Undertaker the victory in the first-ever Hell in a Cell match with Shawn Michaels. In keeping with the notion that Kane had been scarred by the fire — and to conceal Jacobs&apos; identity — the character wore a mask, sported long hair, and wore red and black ring attire that almost covered his entire body. Kane and The Undertaker feuded with one over another the following year, during which time their history vis-à-vis one another was expounded. Jacobs won his first match as Kane against Mankind at Survivor Series. In weeks prior on Raw, Kane had randomly attacked other wrestlers including Ahmed Johnson, Road Warrior Hawk, the Hardy Boyz, Flash Funk, and Cactus Jack/Mankind&apos;s alter ego, Dude Love. The Undertaker initially refused to face him, saying he would not fight his own &quot; flesh and blood &quot;. After a brief partnership, Kane betrayed his brother when he cost him the WWF Championship; he made a run-in in The Undertaker&apos;s WWF Championship title match with Shawn Michaels at the Royal Rumble. After the match, Kane locked The Undertaker in a casket and set it on fire, though it was later revealed that Undertaker managed to escape the casket without being seen before Kane set it on fire. This provoked The Undertaker into returning to face Kane at WrestleMania XIV on March 29. Kane was defeated by The Undertaker after three Tombstone Piledriver s. After the match Kane and Paul Bearer attacked The Undertaker. [ http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#XIV WrestleMania XIV Results 2007-11-05 Pro Wrestling History ] They continued to feud until Unforgiven on April 26, when The Undertaker defeated Kane in an Inferno match. In this match, Paul Bearer tried to help Kane by attacking The Undertaker; however, at one point of the match, as Kane was retreating backstage, Vader forced Kane back towards the ring, and The Undertaker attacked them both by jumping over the ring ropes surrounded by fire. [ http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/april/1998.htm Unforgiven 1998 Results 2007-11-05 PWWEW.net ] On May 19, Bearer was revealed to be an employee at the funeral home in Death Valley owned by The Undertaker&apos;s parents. When Kane and The Undertaker were children, claimed Bearer, The Undertaker &quot; accidentally &quot; burned down the funeral home, killing their parents and leaving Kane with physical and mental scarring, although The Undertaker thought that Kane had perished in the fire also. During an episode of Raw taped in Long Island, Kane and Bearer ostensibly exhumed the parents&apos; bodies and brought them to the arena. Bearer, who survived the fire, hid Kane in a mental asylum as he grew up and went on to form an alliance with The Undertaker. After suffering mistreatment at the hands of The Undertaker, Bearer opted to bring Kane into the WWF in order to gain vengeance upon The Undertaker. Kane is portrayed as being psychotic, demented, extremely violent, twisted, disturbed, unstoppable, isolated and at peace with insanity. Like his half-brother, Kane is supposedly able to summon fire and bolts of lightning at will, which is displayed as pyrotechnics during shows. After defeating The Undertaker to win a WWF Championship title shot, Kane won the WWF Championship at the King of the Ring, defeating Stone Cold Steve Austin in a First Blood match after being helped by his brother. However, Kane lost the title back to Austin the next night on Raw.

As a result of this, The Corporation had Kane committed to an insane asylum. However, in 1999, Kane joined The Corporation to stay out of the insane asylum. He was later betrayed by The Corporation and thrown out of the alliance. Shortly afterward, Kane formed a tag team with X-Pac and acquired a girlfriend, Tori. While teaming with X-Pac, Kane evolved from being mute to aided speech through an electrolarynx to speaking unaided. He also became associated with D-Generation X, the faction of which X-Pac was a member. His first unaided words were the DX slogan &quot; suck it &quot;. { Degeneration X History. Kulasd.tripod.com.

Comics in 1999. The character only spoke once, in the Undertaker Halloween Special, which tied into the single issue Mankind comic book produced by the same company. Kane was also featured in a Chef Boyardee commercial where at the end of it, he was trying to eat it with his mask on. In an interview with Jacobs, he thought things had to change with his mask. Jacobs revealed &quot; I think it was time. We had gone as far as we could go with the character under the mask. I actually felt the mask was limiting my ability to do some things. For years, to portray emotion I had to do it with my body. I never could do it with my face as the other superstars were able to. So, it added another dimension. &quot; { *interview* Kane.

Retrieved on 2011-11-29. } In December 2011, the character once again began wearing a revised version of the red mask. In an interview with Jacobs, conducted in 2010, he revealed that he and Vince McMahon were the only ones that were one hundred percent behind the idea of the Kane character removing his mask. He added that he has no plans to retire soon. &quot; I&apos;m still having fun, &quot; Glenn said. &quot; I&apos;m really at the height of my career, and I don&apos;t have any plans of packing it in, at least not in the near future. &quot; { Ring Posts: Q &amp; A with Kane – WWE Raw, Smackdown and TNA pro wrestling news, analysis from Kevin Eck – baltimoresun.com.
