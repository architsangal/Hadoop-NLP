Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestogens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestogen. [ Chemistry ] Progesterone was independently discovered by four research groups.

Allen first determined its melting point, molecular weight, and partial molecular structure. He also gave it the name Progesterone derived from Progestational Steroidal ketone. [ Allen WM Progesterone: how did the name originate? South. Med.

Progesterone contains ketone and oxygenated functional groups, as well as two methyl branches. Like all steroid hormones, it is hydrophobic. [ Sources ] [ Animal ] Progesterone is produced in the ovaries (by the corpus luteum ), the adrenal gland s (near the kidney), and, during pregnancy, in the placenta. Progesterone is also stored in adipose (fat) tissue. In humans, increasing amounts of progesterone are produced during pregnancy: At first, the source is the corpus luteum that has been &quot; rescued &quot; by the presence of human chorionic gonadotropins ( hCG ) from the conceptus. However, after the 8th week, production of progesterone shifts to the placenta. The placenta utilizes maternal cholesterol as the initial substrate, and most of the produced progesterone enters the maternal circulation, but some is picked up by the fetal circulation and used as substrate for fetal corticosteroids. At term the placenta produces about 250  mg progesterone per day.

After consumption of milk products the level of bioavailable progesterone goes up. [ Plants ] In at least one plant, Juglans regia, progesterone has been detected.

Dioscorea mexicana is a plant that is part of the yam family native to Mexico. [ Applezweig N Steroids Chem Week 104 57–72 1969 May 12255132 ] It contains a steroid called diosgenin that is taken from the plant and is converted into progesterone.

Bull. 54 9 1312–4 2006 September 16946542 10.1248/cpb.54.1312 ] Diosgenin and progesterone are found in other Dioscorea species as well. Another plant that contains substances readily convertible to progesterone is Dioscorea pseudojaponica native to Taiwan. Research has shown that the Taiwanese yam contains saponin s — steroids that can be converted to diosgenin and thence to progesterone. [ Yang DJ, Lu TJ, Hwang LS Isolation and identification of steroidal saponins in Taiwanese yam cultivar (Dioscorea pseudojaponica Yamamoto) J. Agric. Food Chem. 51 22 6438–44 2003 October 14558759 10.1021/jf030390j ] Many other Dioscorea species of the yam family contain steroidal substances from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are Dioscorea villosa and Dioscorea polygonoides. One study showed that the Dioscorea villosa contains 3.5% diosgenin. [ Hooker E Final report of the amended safety assessment of Dioscorea Villosa (Wild Yam) root extract Int. J.

Cholesterol ( 1 ) undergoes double oxidation to produce 20,22-dihydroxycholesterol ( 2 ). This vicinal diol is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C-22 to produce pregnenolone ( 3 ). This reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome P450scc.The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3- hydroxyl group is oxidized to a keto group ( 4 ) and second, the double bond is moved to C-4, from C-5 through a keto/ enol tautomer ization reaction. [ Dewick, Paul M. Medicinal natural products: a biosynthetic approach Wiley New York 2002 244 0-471-49641-3 ] This reaction is catalyzed by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta(5)-delta(4)isomerase. Progesterone in turn (see lower half of figure to the right) is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and after conversion to 17-hydroxyprogesterone (another natural progestogen) of cortisol and androstenedione. Androstenedione can be converted to testosterone, estrone and estradiol. Pregenolone and progesterone can also be synthesized by yeast.

This synthesis is known as the Marker degradation. Additional semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids. For the example, cortisone can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in chloroform to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone.

A total synthesis of progesterone was reported in 1971 by W.S. Johnson (see figure to the right). [ Johnson WS, Gravestock MB, McCarry BE Acetylenic bond participation in biogenetic-like olefinic cyclizations. II. Synthesis of dl-progesterone J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93 17 4332–4 1971 August 5131151 10.1021/ja00746a062 ] The synthesis begins with reacting the phosphonium salt 7 with phenyl lithium to produce the phosphonium ylide 8. The ylide 8 is reacted with an aldehyde to produce the alkene 9. The ketal protecting group s of 9 are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone 10, which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone 11. The ketone of 11 is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol 12, which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation 13. The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of 13 in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce 14. This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as biomimetic. In the next step the enol orthoester is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone 15. The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce 16. Finally, the diketone 17 undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone. [ Levels ] In women, progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, rise after ovulation, and are elevated during the luteal phase, as shown in diagram below. Progesterone levels tend to be &lt; 2  ng/ml prior to ovulation, and &gt; 5  ng/ml after ovulation. If pregnancy occurs, human chorionic gonadotropin is released maintaining the corpus leuteum allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. At around 12 weeks the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus leuteum, this process is named the luteal-placental shift. After the luteal-placental shift progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100-200  ng/ml at term. Whether a decrease in proges terone levels is critical for the initiation of labor has been argued and may be species-specific. After delivery of the placenta and during lactation, progesterone levels are very low. Progesterone levels are relatively low in children and postmenopausal women.

It prevents MR activation by binding to this receptor with an affinity exceeding even those of aldosterone and other corticosteroids such as cortisol and corticosterone.

Estrogen through estrogen receptors upregulates the expression of progesterone receptors.

Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone.

Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs ( chemotaxis ). Hence substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in male contraception.

At the same time progesterone affects the vaginal epithelium and cervical mucus, making it thick and impenetrable to sperm. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels will decrease, leading, in the human, to menstruation. Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation does not occur and the corpus luteum does not develop, levels of progesterone may be low, leading to anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding. During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. In addition progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production. A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor. The fetus metabolize s placental progesterone in the production of adrenal steroids. [ Nervous system ] Progesterone, like pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone, belongs to the group of neurosteroid s. It can be synthesized within the central nervous system and also serves as a precursor to another major neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. Neurosteroids affect synaptic functioning, are neuroprotective, and affect myelin ation. [ Schumacher M, Guennoun R, Robert F, et al.

It increases core temperature (thermogenic function) during ovulation. It reduces spasm and relaxes smooth muscle. Bronchi are widened and mucus regulated. ( Progesterone receptor s are widely present in submucosal tissue.) It acts as an antiinflammatory agent and regulates the immune response. It reduces gall-bladder activity. It normalizes blood clotting and vascular tone, zinc and copper levels, cell oxygen levels, and use of fat stores for energy. It may affect gum health, increasing risk of gingivitis (gum inflammation) and tooth decay. It appears to prevent endometrial cancer (involving the uterine lining) by regulating the effects of estrogen. Progesterone plays an important role in the signaling of insulin release and pancreatic function, and may affect the susceptibility to diabetes or gestational diabetes.

While daily intramuscular injections of progesterone-in-oil (PIO) have been the standard route of administration, PIO injections are not FDA-approved for use in pregnancy. A recent meta-analysis showed that the intravaginal route with an appropriate dose and dosing frequency is equivalent to daily intramuscular injections. In addition, a recent case-matched study comparing vaginal progesterone with PIO injections showed that live birth rates were nearly identical with both methods. Khan N, Richter KS, Blake EJ, et al.

Presented at: 55th Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Reproductive Society; April 18–22, 2007; Rancho Mirage, CA. Progesterone is used to control persistent anovulatory bleeding. It is also used to prepare uterine lining in infertility therapy and to support early pregnancy. Patients with recurrent pregnancy loss due to inadequate progesterone production may receive progesterone. Progesterone is also used in nonpregnant women with a delayed menstruation of one or more weeks, in order to allow the thickened endometrial lining to slough off. This process is termed a progesterone withdrawal bleed. The progesterone is taken orally for a short time (usually one week), after which the progesterone is discontinued and bleeding should occur. Progesterone is being investigated as potentially beneficial in treating multiple sclerosis, since the characteristic deterioration of nerve myelin insulation halts during pregnancy, when progesterone levels are raised; deterioration commences again when the levels drop. Vaginally dosed progesterone is being investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women with a history of preterm birth. According to a recent study, women with a short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day during the second half of a pregnancy. A subsequent and larger study showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data in this trial showed that women with a short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care. In another trial, vaginal progesterone was shown to be better than placebo in reducing preterm birth prior to 34 weeks in women with an extremely short cervix at baseline. An editorial by Roberto Romero discusses the role of sonographic cervical length in identifying patients who may benefit from progesterone treatment. A meta-analysis published in 2011 found that vaginal progesterone cut the risk of premature births by 42 percent in women with short cervixes. The meta-analysis, which pooled published results of five large clinical trials, also found that the treatment cut the rate of breathing problems and reduced the need for placing a baby on a ventilator.

Progesterone receptor antagonist s, or selective progesterone receptor modulator s (SPRM)s, such as RU-486 ( Mifepristone ), can be used to prevent conception or induce medical abortion s (Note that methods of hormonal contraception do not contain progesterone but a progestin ). Progesterone may affect male behavior. Progesterone is starting to be used in the treatment of the skin condition hidradenitis suppurativa. [ Aging ] Since most progesterone in males is created during testicular production of testosterone, and most in females by the ovaries, the shutting down (whether by natural or chemical means), or removal, of those inevitably causes a considerable reduction in progesterone levels. Previous concentration upon the role of progestagen s (progesterone and molecules with similar effects) in female reproduction, when progesterone was simply considered a &quot; female hormone &quot;, obscured the significance of progesterone elsewhere in both sexes. The tendency for progesterone to have a regulatory effect, the presence of progesterone receptor s in many types of body tissue, and the pattern of deterioration (or tumor formation) in many of those increasing in later years when progesterone levels have dropped, is prompting widespread research into the potential value of maintaining progesterone levels in both males and females. [ Brain damage ] Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to traumatic brain injury and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone in females.

Neurotrauma 17 5 367–88 2000 May 10833057 10.1089/neu.2000.17.367 ] A number of additional animal studies have confirmed that progesterone has neuroprotective effects when administered shortly after traumatic brain injury.
