Brands, Inc. ( [ YUM ] ) or Yum! is a United States-based Fortune 500 corporation. Yum! operates or licenses Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and WingStreet restaurants worldwide. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it is the world&apos;s largest fast food restaurant company in terms of system units —nearly 38,000 restaurants around the world in more than 110 countries and territories. { About Yum! Brands - Yum! Brands, Inc } In 2010, Yum!&apos;s global sales totaled more than US$ 11 billion. [ History ] [ Tricon Global ] Yum! was created on October 7, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. an independent company, as a result of a spin-out from PepsiCo, which owned and franchised the KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell brands worldwide. Because of the company&apos;s previous relationship with Pepsi, Yum! Brands has a lifetime contract with PepsiCo, with notable exceptions being the contract of A &amp; W Restaurants with Dr Pepper Snapple Group to be the exclusive restaurant provider of A &amp; W Root Beer, and the contracts of franchisees such as HMSHost and college-operated locations with Coca-Cola which override Yum&apos;s lifetime PepsiCo contract, along with some scattered KFC franchises across the United States which continue to maintain Coke fountain rights. [ Expansion ] In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky -based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver&apos;s and A &amp; W All-American Food chains and its intention to change the company&apos;s name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company&apos;s annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!&apos;s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver&apos;s and A &amp; W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola ) switched to Pepsi products once their franchise contracts expired, with A &amp; W retaining A &amp; W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper Snapple Group. In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.

On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicized WingStreet&apos;s national launch. [ International growth ] In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver&apos;s and A &amp; W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company&apos;s announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside the US and Canada, the two chains no longer fit in the company&apos;s long-term growth plans.

Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A &amp; W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand LLC will buy A &amp; W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.

In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase mainland Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion. { http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/uncertaintysurf-8863/ } The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country&apos;s restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives. { http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinacorporaten-8897/ } By the 2011, Yum! was winding down Pizza Hut locations in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec, Canada with Kirkland, Quebec following suit the following year. In 2012, a KFC was the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; it opened in Ramallah; a Pizza Hut is also planned. { American fried chicken comes to the Palestinian territories, } { Los Angeles Times, 04-02-2012, access date 20-02-2012 } { San Francisco, California } { Burlington, North Carolina } [ Corporate ] The current chairman and chief executive officer of Yum!
