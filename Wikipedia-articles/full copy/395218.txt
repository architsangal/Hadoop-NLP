A complete list of introduced species for even quite small areas of the world would be dauntingly long. Humans have introduced more different species to new environments than any single document can hope to record. This list is generally for established species with truly wild populations —not kept domestically or on ranches —that have been seen numerous times, and have breeding populations. [ Australia ] [ Invasive species in Australia ] Australia has a huge range of introduced species, so sub-classifications are necessary: Invasive - species has a tendency to spread their range into new areas Feral s - defined as animals for domestic purposes (i.e., pet s or beasts of burden ) that have gone wild Pests - animals that have a direct effect on human standards of living or the environment/ecosystems, have a high rate of reproduction, and are difficult to control Feral animals that cause the most public concern, and economic and ecological damage include: [ http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/european-red-fox.pdf Invasive Species Fact Sheet: European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia) 2004 2010-05-10 ] [ http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/camel-factsheet.html Camel Fact Sheet Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (Australia) 2009 2010-05-10 ] [ http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/cat.pdf Invasive Species Fact Sheet: The feral cat (Felis catus) Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia) 2004 2010-05-10 ] [ http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/feral-horse.pdf Invasive Species Fact Sheet: Feral horse (Equus caballus) and feral donkey (Equus asinus) Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia) 2004 2010-05-10 ] [ http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/pig.pdf Invasive Species Fact Sheet: The feral pig (Sus scrofa) Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia) 2004 2010-12-06 ] Image Name Species Overview Introduced Reason Introduced from Distribution Feral Pest Threat level Est. pop.
