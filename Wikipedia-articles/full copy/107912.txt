As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 152,374, up from 124,966 at the 2000 census. The city of Norco and Riverside lie to the northeast, Chino Hills to the northwest, Yorba Linda, and the Cleveland National Forest to the southwest; unincorporated areas of Riverside County line all of its other borders. [ History ] Corona, founded at the height of the Southern California citrus boom in 1886, is advantageously situated at the upper end of the Santa Ana River Canyon, the only significant pass through the Santa Ana Mountains. The town of Corona once laid claim to the title &quot; Lemon Capital of the World. &quot; A museum there presents the lemon&apos;s former role in the local economy. The city derived its name (and its nickname, The Circle City) from the curious layout of its streets, with a standard grid enclosed by the circular Grand Boulevard, one mile in diameter. The street layout was designed by Hiram Clay Kellogg, a civil engineer from Anaheim who was an influential figure in the early development of Orange County. [ October 2009 ] The origin of the city was in May, 1886, when the South Riverside Land and Water Company was incorporated, its members including ex-Governor of Iowa, Samuel Merrill, R.B. Taylor, George L. Joy, A.S. Garretson, and Adolph Rimpau, as a citrus growers’ organization, it purchased the lands of Rancho La Sierra of Bernardo Yorba, and the Rancho Temescal grant and the colony of South Riverside was laid out. They also secured the water rights to Temescal Creek, its tributaries and Lee Lake. Dams and pipelines were built to carry the water to the colony. In 1889 the Temescal Water Company was incorporated, to supply water for the new colony. This company purchased all the water-bearing lands in the Temescal valley and began drilling artesian wells. { Ellerbe, History of Temescal Valley, pp. 18–19 } In 1896, South Riverside was renamed Corona for Grand Boulevard, a 3 mile circular drive that is around the central city and was the site of three international automobile races in 1913, 1914 and 1916. [ Hoover Mildred B. Hero &amp; Ethel Rensch, and William N. Abeloe Historic Spots in California 1966 Stanford University Press 978-0-8047-4482-9 ] The city of Corona has been popular among celebrities drawn to its upscale areas. Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball spent time at their ranch, located in south Corona, and played golf often at Cresta Verde Golf Course in the northeastern section of the city. { www.crestaverde.com } After their divorce, Mr. Arnaz continued to live in Corona. In recent years Corona has been known as the Gateway to the Inland Empire. Prior to the 1980s, the city was a largely agricultural community, dominated by citrus orchards, ranches, and dairy farms. High real estate prices in Los Angeles and Orange counties made the area&apos;s land desirable to developers and industrialists, and by the late 1990s Corona was considered a major suburb of Los Angeles. [ October 2009 ] Corona has become a bedroom community for Orange County and the larger cities of the Inland Empire. The development of commerce and industry in the city has been accelerated by access to the area via the Riverside Freeway, with many firms leaving northern Orange County to be closer to their employees&apos; homes in Corona and Riverside. The construction of the nearby Chino Valley Freeway has linked Corona to the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys. Once a largely white and (majority?) [ May 2012 ] Hispanic community, Corona was fast becoming home to what can be called a &quot; global village &quot; of multicultural diversity. By the 2010&apos;s, Corona became more culturally diverse in the rising numbers of Asian Americans adding to the mix of its large Hispanic population and an expanding African-American community. [ April 2012 ] [ Corona County proposal ] In 2002 the city government considered an initiative to secede from Riverside County and form an autonomous Corona County because the city government and some residents were dissatisfied with how services were handled in nearby areas. The effort was also considered by areas in other cities in the western part of the county including Murrieta. Whether nearby cities such as Norco, California would have been included in the new county are unknown. The proposed county would have been bordered by San Bernardino County to the northwest, and by Orange County to the west, but it never came to fruition. { Santa Barbara News Press article on the county split proposal there with a brief mention of the proposed Corona County. } [ 2008 Freeway Complex Fire ] The city was the first to be affected by the Freeway Complex Fire, but was in the Yorba Linda/Corona Line.

In recent years, there are talks to construct a proposed 10-mile automobile and fast-speed train tunnel under Santiago Peak to connect Interstate 15 in Corona with Interstate 5 and the 55 Freeway of Orange County, to cut down on commuter traffic on the already crowded or high-traffic 91 Freeway. Corona experiences a warm Mediterranean climate ( Köppen climate classification CSa) and has mild winters and hot summers.
