The film&apos;s budget climbed from an initial US$150  million to a record-breaking $207  million. The film was released on December  14, 2005 and made an opening of $50.1  million. While the film performed lower than expectations, King Kong made domestic and worldwide grosses that eventually added up to $550  million, [ King Kong BoxOfficeMojo.com http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id%3Dkingkong05.htm 2006-10-12 ] becoming the fourth-highest grossing movie in Universal Pictures history. Strong DVD sales also added over $100  million to the grosses. [ King Kong– DVD sales BlogCritics.org http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/04/04/122953.php 2007-03-04 ] Movie reviewers, who gave King Kong critical praise, consider it one of the all-round best movies of 2005, though it has been criticised for its 3 hour, 7 minute running time. It won Academy Award s for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing. [ Plot ] In 1933, at the height of the Great Depression in New York City, Ann Darrow ( Naomi Watts ) has lost her job as a vaudeville actress but is hired by troubled filmmaker Carl Denham ( Jack Black ) to act in his new motion picture. Ann signs on when she learns her favourite playwright Jack Driscoll ( Adrien Brody ) is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer SS  Venture sails to the mysterious Skull Island, they slowly fall in love. As for Carl, a warrant is out for his arrest and Captain Englehorn ( Thomas Kretschmann ) begins to have second thoughts, following the fears of his crew about Skull Island and its strange creatures that have evolved alone from the outside world. Despite his attempt to turn around, the ship is lost in fog and runs aground on the rocks encircling the island. Carl and his crew explore the island to film and are attacked by the vicious natives. Mike ( Craig Hall ), the sound technician, is speared, one of the sailors has his head bashed in, and Jack is knocked out. Ann screams as she is captured, and a roar beyond the wall responds. The matriarch of the tribe vows to sacrifice her to &quot; Kong &quot;, a 25  ft (8m) tall gorilla, and the last of its kind. Englehorn and his crew break up the attack and return to the stranded ship. They lighten their load to steer away, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped. On the island, Ann is hung from a balcony on the side of the wall. The crew comes armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann into the jungle. Captain Englehorn organizes a rescue party to find Ann and hunt down the beast. The rescue party is caught up in a Venatosaurus pack&apos;s hunt of Apatosaurus, and Herb ( John Sumner ), the cameraman, is killed along with three sailors. The rest of the rescue party come across a swamp where Bruce Baxter ( Kyle Chandler ) and two others leave the group. Meanwhile, Ann manages to entertain Kong with juggling and dancing. The survivors stumble across a log, where Kong arrives and attacks, shaking them off the log into a ravine. He returns to rescue Ann from three Vastatosaurus Rex, and takes her up to his mountain lair. Englehorn and the rest of the crew rescue what is left of the rescue party from the pit of giant insects, and as Jack decides to continue to search for Ann, Carl decides to capture Kong. Jack goes to Kong&apos;s lair, waking him. As Kong fights a swarm of flying Terapusmordax, Ann and Jack escape by grabbing the wing of one of the bats and then jumping into a river. They arrive at the village wall with the angry Kong following them, and Ann becomes distraught by what Carl plans to do. Kong bursts through the gate and struggles to get her back, but he is eventually knocked out by chloroform. In New York around Christmas, Carl presents a chained Kong  — the Eighth Wonder of the World on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann has become an anonymous chorus girl and a double of her is no replacement in Kong&apos;s eyes. Camera flashes from photographers enrage the gorilla. Kong breaks free from his chrome-steel chains and chases Jack across town, where he encounters Ann again. They share a quiet moment on a frozen lake in Central Park, before the army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto the Empire State Building, where he fights off planes sent to attack him, downing three of them. Ultimately, Kong is hit by several bursts of gunfire from the surviving planes, and gazes at a distraught Ann for the last time before falling off the building to his death. Ann is greeted by Jack, and the reporters gather around Kong&apos;s carcass. Carl takes one last look and says, &quot; It wasn&apos;t the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast. &quot; [ Cast ] [ Wloszczyna, Susan June 26, 2005 King Konggoes digital USA Today http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-06-26-king-kong_x.htm 2006-06-14 ] Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow: a struggling vaudeville actress who is desperate for work.

[ Production ] [ Development ] Peter Jackson was a nine-year-old in the New Zealand town of Pukerua Bay when he first saw the 1933  version of King Kong.

During this time Jackson had achieved the designs of the Brontosaurus and the Venatosaurus. No casting was ever done, but he had hoped to get George Clooney and Robert De Niro for the roles of Jack Driscoll and Carl Denham, respectively.

He described his first rough draft as a &quot; tongue-in-cheek comedic film with elements of Raiders of the Lost Ark and other films &quot;, and in retrospect he is glad that Universal pulled the plug on this version of the film, as he was able to rework the screenplay into something better. In Jackson&apos;s original 1996  draft of the script, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in Sumatra.

This would indicate that the island natives were the last remnants of a cult religion that had once thrived on the mainland of Asia. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-First World War fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. [ Stax April 8, 2003 The Stax Report: Script Review of King Kong IGN http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/392/392468p1.html 2006-06-14 ] Herb the camera-man is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three T.  rex also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the T.  rex jaws, where she becomes wedged, and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers. The rewriting of the script between 1996 and 2005 involved basing the characters more closely on the 1933 ones, but adding more detail (the screenplay takes no material from the 1976 version).

Jackson, alongside Christian Rivers and his team, created animatics for all the action sequences which wound up becoming the first stage in animation. The Empire State Building animatic in particular, was completely replicated in the final film. [ Pre-production ] { Andy Serkis in his Kong bodysuit } Jackson decided early on that he did not want Kong to behave like a human, and so he and his team studied hours of gorilla footage.

He ended up going to Rwanda to observe mountain gorillas in the wild with a company called Rainbow Tours. The resulting Kong is entirely a special effect, who acts and moves very much like a real gorilla.

Universal Pictures only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60  million. The film&apos;s length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.

The diaries started shortly after the DVD release of The Return of the King as a way to give Jackson&apos;s The Lord of the Rings fans a glimpse of his next project. These diaries are edited into broadband-friendly installments of three or four minutes each. They consist of features that would normally be seen in a making-of documentary: a tour of the set, a roving camera introducing key players behind the scene, a peek inside the sound booth during last-minute dubbing, or Andy Serkis doing his ape movements in a motion capture studio.

However, she died shortly after her meeting with Jackson. The line ultimately went to the character of Carl Denham, as in the original. An ad for Universal Pictures is visible while Kong is tearing up Times Square.

I might have known. &quot; Fay Wray starred in the 1933  film, which was directed by Merian C. Cooper and released by RKO. When Carl Denham calls Bruce Baxter and Ann Darrow to film a scene on the deck of the ship, the shot is essentially identical to a scene between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 version. In the original film, Merian C. Cooper made up an &quot; Arabian proverb &quot; about &quot; beauty and beast &quot;. The 2005 remake repeats the fake proverb. Kong&apos;s New York stage appearance looks very much like a re-enactment of the sacrifice scene of the 1933  film, including the posts the &apos;beauty&apos; is tied to and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is the original 1933  score by Max Steiner. The 1933 film featured an extended sequence in which several members of the party were devoured by massive spiders and insects after being shaken off a log into a ravine by Kong. This scene was pulled before release when Cooper decided it slowed the film down. Peter Jackson recreated the scene for the 2005  remake. He also paid homage to the spider pit sequence by recreating the scene using stop motion photography, which he included as an extra for the deluxe DVD release of the original 1933  film. The battle between Kong and the final T. rex is almost move-for-move like the last half of the fight between Kong and the T.  rex in the original 1933  film, right down to Kong playing with the dinosaur&apos;s broken jaw and then standing, beating his chest and roaring victoriously. After the crew captures Kong on the beach, Denham speaks a line from the 1933 film: &quot; The whole world will pay to see this! We&apos;re millionaires, boys! I&apos;ll share it with all of you. In a few months, his name will be up in lights on Broadway! KONG, THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD! &quot; In the original film, director and co-director Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B.
