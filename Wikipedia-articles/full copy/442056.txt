To distinguish himself from his father, he was widely known as Mulle within the family. Apparently his mother wanted to name him Samuel, but this was not thought of as a proper royal name. [ Marriage and loss of status ] When Prince Carl married countess Elsa von Rosen ( Stockholm, 7 February 1904 – Stockholm, 15 April 1991), daughter of count Eugén von Rosen and wife Eleonore Wijk, on 6 July 1937 at Kvillinge, Sweden, he had to relinquish his succession rights and his royal titles. His brother-in-law King Leopold III of Belgium conferred upon him the title Prince Bernadotte in the Belgian nobility on the same date, with the right to the title of Count or Countess for his male-line descendants. Carl had one daughter, who bears the title of Countess, and divorced Elsa in 1951. He married secondly to Ann Margareta Larsson ( Danderyd, 22 March 1921–3 September 1975) at Danderyd, Sweden, on 1 November 1954. They divorced in 1961, without issue. His third and final marriage was at Rabat, Morocco, on 8 June 1978 to Kristine Rivelsrud (b. Eidsfoss, Norway, 22 April 1932), without issue. Prince Carl died on 27 June 2003 in Málaga, Spain.

[ The Huseby scandal ] Carl Bernadotte was at the center of the Huseby scandal that occurred in the late 1950s in Sweden amidst a great deal of publicity. Bernadotte had gained the trust of Florence Stephens, a wealthy elderly heiress of a large estate near Växjö in southern Sweden. A complex set of criminal transactions led to the ruin of Stephens and to bring Bernadotte to court. Bernadotte was acquitted in spite of his full confession – he was not considered sane with regards to his actions and therefore not criminally culpable. Bernadotte left Sweden shortly after the trial and spent the rest of his life in Spain. [ Ancestry ] [ 1. Prince Carl, Duke of Östergötland 2. Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland 3.
