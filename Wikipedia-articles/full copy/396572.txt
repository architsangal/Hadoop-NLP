[ a list of television episodes titled &quot; Pilot &quot; Pilot (television episode) ] [ August 2011 ] A &quot; television pilot &quot; (also known as a &quot; pilot &quot;, &quot; pilot episode &quot;, and &quot; series premiere &quot; ) is a standalone episode of a television series that is used to sell the show to a television network. At the time of its inception, the pilot is meant to be the &quot; testing ground &quot; to see if a series will be possibly desired and successful and therefore a test episode of an intended television series. It is an early step in the development of a television series, much like pilot light s or pilot studies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity, or pilot hole s prepare the way for larger holes. Television network s use pilots to discover whether an entertaining concept can be successfully realized. After seeing this sample of the proposed product, networks will then determine whether the expense of additional episodes is justified. They are best thought of as prototype s of the show that is to follow, because elements often change from pilot to series. Variety estimates that only a little over a quarter of all pilots made for American television succeed to the series stage, { &apos;&apos;Variety&apos;&apos; defines &quot; busted pilot &quot; } although the figure may be even lower. { Plot programs at The Museum of Broadcast Communications } [ Pilot season ] Each summer, the major American broadcast television networks —including ABC, CBS, The CW, FOX, and NBC —receives about 500 brief elevator pitch es for new shows from writers and producers. That fall, each network requests scripts for about 70 pitches and, the following January, orders about 20 pilot episodes. [ chozick20110512 ] By spring, actors are cast and production crews assembled to produce the pilots.

For the 1994 pilot of Friends, casting director Ellie Kanner reviewed more than 1,000 actors&apos; head shot s for each of the six main roles. She summoned 75 actors for each role to audition, then chose some to audition again for the show&apos;s creators. Of this group, the creators chose some to audition again for Warner Bros. Television executives, who chose the final group of a few actors to audition for NBC executives; as they decide whether to purchase a pilot, network executives generally have ultimate authority over casting.

If it is not chosen, they have wasted their time and money and may have missed out on better career opportunities. [ lots2007 ] Once they have been produced, the pilots are presented to studio and network executives, and in some cases to test audiences; at this point, each pilot receives various degrees of feedback and is gauged on their potential to advance from one pilot to a full-fledged series. Using this feedback, and factoring in the current status and future potential of their existing series, each network chooses about 4 to 8 pilots for series status. [ chozick20110512 ] The new series are then presented at the networks&apos; annual upfront s in May, where they are added to network schedules for the following season (either for a fall or &quot; mid-season &quot; winter debut) and at the upfront presentation the shows are shown to potential advertisers and the networks sell the majority of the advertising for their new pilots. { Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) The Television Will Be Revolutionized. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 103-104 } The survival odds for these new series are low, as only one or two shows survive for more than one season.

Depending on the potential series&apos; nature, a pilot presentation is a one-day shoot that, when edited together, gives a general idea of the look and feel of the proposed show. Presentations are usually between seven to ten minutes, however, these pilot-presentations will not be shown on the air unless more material is subsequently added to them to make them at least 22 or 45 minutes in length, the actual duration of a nominally &quot; 30 minute &quot; or &quot; 60 minute &quot; television program (taking into account television commercial s ). Occasionally, more than one pilot is commissioned for a particular proposed television series to evaluate what the show would be like with modifications. Star Trek and All in the Family are famous examples of this presentation-to-pilot-to-series situation. An example of change between the making of a pilot and the making of a series is To Tell the Truth in 1956. The show&apos;s original title at pilot was Nothing But the Truth and was hosted by Mike Wallace; by the time it became a series, the title was changed and Bud Collyer was tapped as host. [ Broadcast ] Pilots usually run as the first episode of the series, and more often than not is used to introduce the characters and their world to the viewer. However, the post-pilot series may become so different that it would not make sense for the pilot to be aired. In this case, the pilot (or portions of it) is often re-shot, recast, or rewritten to fit the rest of the series. The pilot for Gilligan&apos;s Island, for instance, showed the castaways becoming stranded on the island. However, three roles were recast before going to series, with the characters either modified or completely altered to the point where the pilot could no longer be used as a regular episode. As a result, CBS aired Gilligan&apos;s second produced episode, which had the characters already stranded on the island, first; the story from the pilot was largely reworked into a flashback episode which aired later (with several key scenes re-shot). Even Gilligan&apos;s theme song, which was originally done as a calypso number, was rewritten and recomposed to be completely different. [ Demos ] Since the mid 1990s, television producers and networks have increasingly used presentation tapes called &quot; demos &quot; in lieu of full-length pilots. { Piot programs at The Museum of Broadcast Communications } These demos tend to be substantially shorter than a standard episode, and make limited use of original sets and post-production elements. The idea is merely to showcase the cast and the writing. These types of pilots are rarely broadcast, if ever, although the material is sometimes partially retrofitted onto a future episode of the resulting series. Some series sold using demos: One Tree Hill Saul of the Mole Men Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge Charmed Buffy the Vampire Slayer King of the Hill It&apos;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia Suits [ Backdoor pilots ] A backdoor pilot is defined by Variety as a &quot; pilot episode filmed as a standalone movie so it can be broadcast if not picked up as a series. &quot; { Backdoor pilot as defined by &apos;&apos;Variety&apos;&apos; } It is distinguished from a simple pilot in that it has a dual purpose: It has an inherent commercial value of its own while also being, as Alex Epstein describes it, &quot; proof of concept for the show, that&apos;s made to see if the series is worth bankrolling. &quot; { Alex Epstein on Backdoor Pilots } This definition also includes episodes of one show introducing a spin-off. Such &quot; backdoor pilots &quot; most commonly focus on an existing character from the parent series who is planned for their own spinoff show — for example, when Denise, an established character on The Cosby Show, was planned to be spun off to A Different World, a Cosby Show episode was devoted to Denise traveling to visit the college which would become the new show&apos;s setting, and meeting some of the new show&apos;s supporting characters. A less successful example was the final episode of One Day at a Time in May 1984, which was supposed to serve as a spinoff featuring Pat Harrington, Jr. &apos;s &quot; Dwayne Schneider &quot; character in a new setting; the network ultimately passed on the potential series. In other cases, however, an episode of the parent show may also focus on one or more guest characters who have not previously appeared in the show; for example, the backdoor pilot for the television sitcom Empty Nest was an episode of The Golden Girls, which relegated that show&apos;s regular stars to supporting characters in an episode devoted to new characters who were introduced in that episode as their neighbors. Feedback on the episode resulted in Empty Nest being extensively reworked before its debut; while the &quot; living next to the Golden Girls &quot; setting was retained, the series ended up featuring different characters than the original Golden Girls episode. A historically important venue for backdoor pilots has been the anthology series. They have variously been used as a place to show work still being actively considered for pickup, and as a venue for completed work already rejected by the network. With the decline of anthology series, backdoor pilots have increasingly been seen as episodes of existing series, { &quot; Tonight’s special guests? The cast of a whole new show!: 21 TV episodes that tried and failed to spawn spin-offs, &quot; from The AV Club } one-off television movie s, and mini-series. As backdoor pilots have either failed to sell or are awaiting audience reception from its one-time broadcast, networks will not advertise them as pilots, only promoting them as a &quot; special &quot; or &quot; movie. &quot; It is thus often unclear to initial viewers of backdoor pilots that they are seeing a pilot of any kind, unless they have been privy to knowledgeable media coverage of the piece. [ Unintentional pilots ] While, as listed above, there are many telemovies or episodes within series intended as pilots, there are often telemovies or episodes within other series which are so popular that they inspire later TV series. Popular examples are South Park, which began as a duo of shorts its creators made soon after meeting in film class at the University of Colorado (a second was later made as a video Christmas card for Fox ), and Family Guy, which began life as a short, entitled The Life of Larry, that Seth MacFarlane made when he was attending Rhode Island School of Design before he was commissioned to do a second short, titled Larry &amp; Steve, and later adapting the idea into a series. A two-part episode of The Six Million Dollar Man introduced the character of Jaime Sommers who, despite being killed off at the end of the story, was so popular that not only was she brought back to life a few months later, but a spinoff series, The Bionic Woman, was commissioned. The 2006 Doctor Who episode School Reunion was devised as a one-off reunion appearance by the character Sarah Jane Smith, but ended up leading to a spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures. [ Put pilot ] A put pilot is a pilot that the network has agreed to air. If the network does not air the pilot episode, the network will owe substantial monetary penalties to the studio. Generally, this guarantees that the pilot will be picked up by the network. { &quot; Put pilot &quot; as defined by &apos;&apos;Variety&apos;&apos;. } [ Unsold pilot ] Unsold television pilots are pilots developed by a company that is unable to sell it to a network for showing. [ As distinguished from &quot; first episode &quot; ] A pilot episode is generally the first episode of a new show, shown to the heads of the studio to whom it is marketed. The television industry uses the term differently from most viewers. Viewers frequently consider the first episode available for their viewing to be the pilot. They therefore assume that the first episode broadcast is also the episode that sold the series to the network. This is not always true. For instance, the episode &quot; Invasion of the Bane &quot; was not a pilot for The Sarah Jane Adventures because the BBC had committed to the first season before seeing any filmed content { Cook, Benjamin. &quot; Doing it for the Kids &quot;. Doctor Who Magazine (378) p. 37. } —yet it is routinely referred to as a pilot. { Criswell, Casey. &quot; TV Review: &apos;&apos;The Sarah Jane Adventures&apos;&apos; &quot;. &apos;&apos;Blog Critics Magazine&apos;&apos;. 8 January 2007. } { Various reviews of &apos;&apos;Invasion of the Bane&apos;&apos; at Behind the Sofa } Sometimes, too, viewers will assign the word &quot; pilot &quot; to a work that represented the first appearances of characters and situations later employed by a series—even if the work was not initially intended as a pilot for the series. A good example of this is &quot; Love and the Television Set &quot; (later retitled &quot; Love and the Happy Days &quot; for syndication), an episode of Love, American Style which featured a version of the Cunningham family. It was in fact a failed pilot for the proposed 1972 series, New Family in Town, not a successful pilot for 1974&apos;s Happy Days. { &quot; Love and the Happy Days &quot; at sitcomsonline.com } So firmly embedded is the notion of it as a Happy Days pilot, however, that even series actress Erin Moran views it as such, as well as its creator, Garry Marshall. { Pop Culture Addict interview with Erin Moran. } On other occasions, the pilot is never broadcast on television at all. Viewers of Temple Houston, for example, would likely have considered &quot; The Twisted Rope &quot; its pilot because &quot; The Man from Galveston &quot; was only publicly exhibited in cinemas four months later. Even then, &quot; The Man from Galveston &quot; had an almost completely different cast, and its main character was renamed to avoid confusion with the then-ongoing series.
