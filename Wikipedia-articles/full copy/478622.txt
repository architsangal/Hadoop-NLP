[ This article is about a meteorological phenomenon. For the 2008 film, see Pineapple Express (film). ] November 2006 satellite image showing clouds from near Hawaii to Washington, a Pineapple Express configuration Pineapple Express is a non-technical term for a meteorological phenomenon characterized by a strong and persistent flow of atmospheric moisture and associated heavy precipitation from the waters adjacent to the Hawaiian Islands and extending to any location along the Pacific coast of North America. A Pineapple Express is an example of an atmospheric river, which is a more general term for such narrow corridors of enhanced water vapor transport at mid-latitudes around the world. [ Causes and effects ] { Madden-Julian oscillation can induce a Pineapple Express. } A Pineapple Express is driven by a strong, southern branch of the Polar jetstream and is usually [ December 2010 ] marked by the presence of a surface frontal boundary which is typically either slow or stationary, with waves of low pressure traveling along its axis. Each of these low pressure systems brings enhanced rainfall. The conditions are often created by the Madden-Julian oscillation, an equatorial rainfall pattern which feeds its moisture into this pattern. They are also present during an El Niño episode. The composition of moisture-laden air, atmospheric dynamics, and orographic enhancement resulting from the passage of this air over the mountain ranges of the western coast of North America causes some of the most torrential rain s to occur in the region. Pineapple Express systems typically generate heavy snowfall in the mountains and Interior Plateau, which often melts rapidly because of the warming effect of the system. After being drained of their moisture, the tropical air masses reach the inland prairies as a Chinook wind or simply &quot; a Chinook &quot;, a term which is also synonymous on the Coast [ March 2012 ] with the Pineapple Express. [ March 2012 ] [ Extreme cases ] Many Pineapple Express events follow or occur simultaneously with major arctic troughs in the Northwestern United States, often leading to major snow-melt flooding with warm, tropical rains falling on frozen, snow laden ground.

[ Northern California, 1952 ] The San Francisco Bay Area is another locale along the Pacific Coast which is occasionally affected by a Pineapple Express. When it visits, the heavy, persistent rainfall typically causes flooding of local streams as well as urban flooding. In the decades before about 1980, the local term for a Pineapple Express was &quot; Hawaiian Storm &quot;. { Weather of the San Francisco Bay Region, by Harold Gilliam, published 1962, rev. 2002, University of California Press, Berkeley. } During the second week of January, 1952, a series of &quot; Hawaiian &quot; storms swept into Northern California, causing widespread flooding around the Bay Area. The same storms brought a blizzard of heavy, wet snow to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, notoriously stranding the streamliner City of San Francisco on January 13. The greatest flooding in Northern California since the 1800s occurred in 1955 as a result of a series of Hawaiian storms, with the greatest damage in the Sacramento Valley around Yuba City. [ Southern California, 2005 ] { Badwater Basin of } { Death Valley National Park, 2005. } A Pineapple Express battered Southern California from January 7 through January 11, 2005. This storm was the largest to hit Southern California since the El Niño of 1998. { News: Jet stream unleashed the rains - OCRegister.com } The storm caused mud slides and flooding, with one desert location just north of Morongo Valley receiving about [ 9 in ] of rain, and some locations on south and southwest-facing mountain slopes receiving spectacular totals: San Marcos Pass, in Santa Barbara County, received [ 24.57 in ], and Opids Camp (aka Camp Hi-Hill ) in the San Gabriel Mountains of Los Angeles County was deluged with [ 31.61 in cm ] of rain in the five day period.

[ Alaska, 2006 ] The unusually intense rainstorms that hit south-central Alaska in October 2006 were termed &quot; Pineapple Express &quot; rains locally. [ http://www.pooledfund.org/documents/TPF-5_145/Alaska_Scan_2007_Final_report.pdf 2007 WASHTO Subcommittee on Maintenance —Alaska Scanning Tour —Proceedings U.S. Dept. of Transportation August 14-18, 2007 PDF On October 10, 2006 an unusual weather formation forced some upper level moisture out of the Pacific Ocean into Alaska. This “Pineapple Express” produced over 5 inches of rain over a twenty-four hour period. 9–10 June 2, 2011 ] [ Pacific Northwest, 2006 ] { Stillaguamish River, Washington } The Puget Sound region from Olympia, Washington to Vancouver, BC received several inches of rain per day in November 2006 from a series of successive Pineapple Express storms that caused massive flooding in all major regional rivers and mudslides which closed the mountain passes. These storms included heavy winds which are not usually associated with the phenomenon. Regional dams opened their spillways to 100% as they had reached full capacity due to rain and snowmelt. Officials referred to the storm system as &quot; the worst in a decade &quot; on November 8, 2006. Portions of Oregon were also affected, including over 14  inches (350  mm) in one day at Lees Camp in the Coast Range, while the normally arid and sheltered Interior of British Columbia received heavy coastal-style rains. [ December 2010 ] [ Southern California, 2010 ] In 2010, a Pineapple Express system ravaged much of California from December 17 through December 22, bringing with it as much as [ 2 ft cm ] of rain to the San Gabriel Mountains and over [ 13 ft m ] of snow in the Sierra Nevada. Although the entire state was affected, the Southern California counties of San Bernardino, Orange, San Diego, and Los Angeles bore the brunt of the system of storms as coastal and hillside areas were impacted by mudslides and major flooding.
