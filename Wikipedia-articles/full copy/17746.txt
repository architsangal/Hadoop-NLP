{ LR } [ November 2009 ] [ ] [ lawrencium.ogg Lawrencium Common English pronunciation of lawrencium Ogg ] Lawrencium ( [ icon l ə ˈ r ɛ n s i ə m ] [ lə REN see-əm ] ) is a radioactive synthetic chemical element with the symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. In the periodic table of the elements, it is a period 7 d-block element and the last element of the actinide series. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as the heavier homologue to lutetium and is chemically similar to other actinides. Lawrencium was first synthesized by the nuclear-physics team led by Albert Ghiorso on February 14, 1961, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory of the University of California. The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three-milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron -10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator. The team suggested the name lawrencium, and the symbol &quot; Lw &quot;, but IUPAC changed the symbol to &quot; Lr &quot; in 1963. [ Nature&apos;s Building Blocks Emsley John John Emsley 2001 Oxford University Press Oxford 0-19-850340-7 459–460 http://www.google.ru/books?id%3Dj-Xu07p3cKwC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA459#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse February 17, 2012 ] It was the last element of the actinide series to be produced. All isotopes of lawrencium are radioactive; its most stable known isotope is lawrencium-262, with a half-life of approximately 3.6 hour s. All its isotopes except for lawrencium-260, -261 and -262 decay with a half-life of less than a minute. [ History ] [ Discovery ] Lawrencium was first synthesized by the nuclear-physics team of Albert Ghiorso, Torbjørn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, Robert M. Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961, at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now called the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ) at the University of California. The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three- milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron -10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC). [ Albert Ghiorso Albert Ghiorso Sikkeland, T.; Larsh, A. E.; Latimer, R. M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 6 473 1961 1961PhRvL...6..473G 10.1103/PhysRevLett.6.473 New Element, Lawrencium, Atomic Number 103 9 ] The Berkeley team reported that the isotope 257 Lr was detected in this manner, and that it decayed by emitting an 8.6 MeV alpha particle with a half-life of about eight seconds. This identification was later corrected to be 258 Lr.

[ G. N. Flerov et al. At. En. 106 476 1967 ] This isotope was later deduced to be 258 Lr. Instead, the Dubna team reported an isotope with a half-life of about 45 seconds as 256 Lr. [ E. D.

[ 2005 Theoretical chemistry and physics of heavy and superheavy elementpage = 57 Springer 1-4020-1371-X Kaldor, Uzi; Wilson, Stephen ] In 1971, the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260. [ Phys. Rev. C 4 2 632–642 1971 Studies of Lawrencium Isotopes with Mass Numbers 255 Through 260 Eskola, Kari; Eskola, Pirkko; Nurmia, Matti; Albert Ghiorso Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California 10.1103/PhysRevC.4.632 1971PhRvC...4..632E ] In 1992, the IUPAC Trans-fermium Working Group (TWG) officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium. [ Naming ] The origin of the name, ratified by the American Chemical Society, is in reference to the nuclear-physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, of the University of California, who invented the cyclotron particle accelerator. The symbol Lw was used originally, but the element was assigned the Lr symbol. [ Norman N. Greenwood Pure &amp; Appl. Chem 69 1 179–184 Recent developments concerning the discovery of elements 101–111 1997 10.1351/pac199769010179 ] In August 1997, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol Lr during a meeting in Geneva. [ Characteristics ] [ Electronic structure ] Lawrencium is element 103 in the periodic table. It is the first member of the 6d-block; in accordance with the Madelung rule, its electronic configuration should be [Rn]7s 2 5f 14 6d 1. However, results from quantum mechanical research have suggested that this configuration is incorrect, and is in fact [Rn] 7s 2 5f 14 7p 1. A direct measurement of this is not possible. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, [ Nugent L.J. Vander Sluis, K.L.; Fricke, Burhard; Mann, J.B. Electronic configuration in the ground state of atomic lawrencium https://kobra.bibliothek.uni-kassel.de/bitstream/urn%3Anbn%3Ade%3Ahebis%3A34-2008091523764/1/Fricke_electronic_1974.pdf Phys. Rev. A 9 6 2270–72 1974 10.1103/PhysRevA.9.2270 1974PhRvA...9.2270N ] more recent studies and calculations confirm the suggestion. [ Eliav E. Kaldor U.; Ishikawa Y. Transition energies of ytterbium, lutetium, and lawrencium by the relativistic coupled-cluster method Phys. Rev. A 52 291–296 1995 10.1103/PhysRevA.52.291 1995PhRvA..52..291E ] [ Zou Yu Froese Fischer C. Resonance Transition Energies and Oscillator Strengths in Lutetium and Lawrencium Phys. Rev.

However, lawrencium is classified as an actinide element according to the IUPAC recommendations. { IUPAC &quot; Provisional Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry (2004) &quot; } [ Experimental chemical properties ] Summary of all lawrencium compounds known Formula Names(s) LrCl 3 lawrencium trichloride; lawrencium(III) chloride [ Gaseous phase ] The first gaseous-phase studies of lawrencium were reported in 1969 by a nuclear physics team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in the Soviet Union. They used the nuclear reaction 243 Am+ 18 O to produce lawrencium nuclei, which they then exposed to a stream of chlorine gas, and a volatile chloride product was formed. This product was deduced to be 256 LrCl 3, and this confirmed that lawrencium is a typical actinide element. [ Chuburkov, Yu. T.; Belov, V. Z.; Tsaletka, R., Shalaevskiy, M. R.; Zvara, I. Experiments on Chemistry of Element 103: Absorption of the Chloride from a Gas Flux Radiokhimiya 11 394–399 1969 ] [ Aqueous phase ] The first aqueous-phase studies of lawrencium were reported in 1970 by a nuclear physics team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. This team used the nuclear reaction 249 Cf+ 11 B to produce lawrencium nuclei. They were able to show that lawrencium forms a trivalent ion, similar to those of the other actinide elements, but in contrast with that of nobelium.Further experiments in 1988 confirmed the formation of a trivalent lawrencium(III) ion using anion-exchange chromatography using α-hydroxyisobutyrate (α-HIB) complex. Comparison of the elution time with other actinides allowed a determination of 88.6 pico meter s for the ionic radius for Lr 3+.Attempts to reduce lawrencium in the lawrencium(III) ionization state to lawrencium(I) using the potent reducing agent hydroxylamine hydrochloride were unsuccessful. [ Nucleosynthesis ] [ Fusion ] 205 Tl( 50 Ti,xn) 255-x Lr (x=2?) This reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by Yuri Oganessian and his team at the FLNR. Evidence was provided for the formation of 253 Lr in the 2n exit channel. 203 Tl( 50 Ti,xn) 253-x Lr This reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by Yuri Oganessian and his team at the FLNR. 208 Pb( 48 Ti,pxn) 255-x Lr (x=1?) This reaction was reported in 1984 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR. The team was able to detect decays of 246 Cf, a descendant of 254 Lr. 208 Pb( 45 Sc,xn) 253-x Lr This reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by Yuri Oganessian and his team at the FLNR. Results are not readily available. 209 Bi( 48 Ca,xn) 257-x Lr (x=2) This reaction has been used to study the spectroscopic properties of 255 Lr. The team at GANIL used the reaction in 2003 and the team at the FLNR used it between 2004-2006 to provide further information for the decay scheme of 255 Lr. The work provided evidence for an isomeric level in 255 Lr. [ Hot fusion ] 243 Am( 18 O,xn) 261-x Lr (x=5) This reaction was first studied in 1965 by the team at the FLNR. They were able to detect activity with a characteristic decay of 45 seconds, which was assigned to 256 Lr or 257 Lr. Later work suggests an assignment to 256 Lr. Further studies in 1968 produced an 8.35–8.60 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of 35 seconds. This activity was also initially assigned to 256 Lr or 257 Lr and later to solely 256 Lr. 243 Am( 16 O,xn) 259-x Lr (x=4) This reaction was studied in 1970 by the team at the FLNR. They were able to detect an 8.38 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of 20s. This was assigned to 255 Lr. 248 Cm( 15 N,xn) 263-x Lr (x=3,4,5) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL in their large study of lawrencium isotopes. They were able to assign alpha activities to 260 Lr, 259 Lr and 258 Lr from the 3-5n exit channels. 248 Cm( 18 O,pxn) 265-x Lr (x=3,4) This reaction was studied in 1988 at the LBNL in order to assess the possibility of producing 262 Lr and 261 Lr without using the exotic 254 Es target. It was also used to attempt to measure an electron capture (EC) branch in 261m Rf from the 5n exit channel.After extraction of the Lr(III) component, they were able to measure the spontaneous fission of 261 Lr with an improved half-life of 44 minutes. The production cross-section was 700 pb. On this basis, a 14% electron capture branch was calculated if this isotope was produced via the 5n channel rather than the p4n channel.A lower bombarding energy (93 MeV c.f. 97 MeV) was then used to measure the production of 262 Lr in the p3n channel. The isotope was successfully detected and a yield of 240 pb was measured. The yield was lower than expected compared to the p4n channel. However, the results were judged to indicate that the 261 Lr was most likely produced by a p3n channel and an upper limit of 14% for the electron capture branch of 261m Rf was therefore suggested. 246 Cm( 14 N,xn) 260-x Lr (x=3?) This reaction was studied briefly in 1958 at the LBNL using an enriched 244 Cm target (5% 246 Cm). They observed a ~9 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of ~0.25 seconds. Later results suggest a tentative assignment to 257 Lr from the 3n channel 244 Cm( 14 N,xn) 258-x Lr This reaction was studied briefly in 1958 at the LBNL using an enriched 244 Cm target (5% 246 Cm). They observed a ~9 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of ~0.25s. Later results suggest a tentative assignment to 257 Lr from the 3n channel with the 246 Cm component. No activities assigned to reaction with the 244 Cm component have been reported. 249 Bk( 18 O,αxn) 263-x Lr (x=3) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL in their large study of lawrencium isotopes. They were able to detect an activity assigned to 260 Lr. The reaction was further studied in 1988 to study the aqueous chemistry of lawrencium. A total of 23 alpha decays were measured for 260 Lr, with a mean energy of 8.03 MeV and an improved half-life of 2.7 minutes. The calculated cross-section was 8.7 nb. 252 Cf( 11 B,xn) 263-x Lr (x=5,7??) This reaction was first studied in 1961 at the University of California by Albert Ghiorso by using a californium target (52% 252 Cf). They observed three alpha activities of 8.6, 8.4 and 8.2 MeV, with half-lives of about 8 and 15 seconds, respectively. The 8.6 MeV activity was tentatively assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 258 Lr, resulting from the 5n exit channel. The 8.4 MeV activity was also assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 256 Lr. This is most likely from the 33% 250 Cf component in the target rather than from the 7n channel. The 8.2 MeV was subsequently associated with nobelium. 252 Cf( 10 B,xn) 262-x Lr (x=4,6) This reaction was first studied in 1961 at the University of California by Albert Ghiorso by using a californium target (52% 252 Cf). They observed three alpha activities of 8.6, 8.4 and 8.2 MeV, with half-lives of about 8 and 15 seconds, respectively. The 8.6 MeV activity was tentatively assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 258 Lr. The 8.4 MeV activity was also assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 256 Lr. The 8.2 MeV was subsequently associated with nobelium. 250 Cf( 14 N,αxn) 260-x Lr (x=3) This reaction was studied in 1971 at the LBNL. They were able to identify a 0.7s alpha activity with two alpha lines at 8.87 and 8.82 MeV. This was assigned to 257 Lr. 249 Cf( 11 B,xn) 260-x Lr (x=4) This reaction was first studied in 1970 at the LBNL in an attempt to study the aqueous chemistry of lawrencium. They were able to measure a Lr 3+ activity. The reaction was repeated in 1976 at Oak Ridge and 26s 256 Lr was confirmed by measurement of coincident X-rays. 249 Cf( 12 C,pxn) 260-x Lr (x=2) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL. They were able to detect an activity assigned to 258 Lr from the p2n channel. 249 Cf( 15 N,αxn) 260-x Lr (x=2,3) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL. They were able to detect an activities assigned to 258 Lr and 257 Lr from the α2n and α3n and channels. The reaction was repeated in 1976 at Oak Ridge and the synthesis of 258 Lr was confirmed. 254 Es + 22 Ne – transfer This reaction was studied in 1987 at the LLNL. They were able to detect new spontaneous fission (SF) activities assigned to 261 Lr and 262 Lr, resulting from transfer from the 22 Ne nuclei to the 254 Es target. In addition, a 5 ms SF activity was detected in delayed coincidence with nobelium K-shell X-rays and was assigned to 262 No, resulting from the electron capture of 262 Lr.

[ Nuclear isomerism ] A study of the decay properties of 257 Db (see dubnium ) in 2001 by Hessberger et al. at the GSI provided some data for the decay of 253 Lr. Analysis of the data indicated the population of two isomeric levels in 253 Lr from the decay of the corresponding isomers in 257 Db. The ground state was assigned spin and parity of 7/2-, decaying by emission of an 8794 KeV alpha particle with a half-life of 0.57s. The isomeric level was assigned spin and parity of 1/2-, decaying by emission of an 8722 KeV alpha particle with a half-life of 1.49 s. Recent work on the spectroscopy of 255 Lr formed in the reaction 209 Bi( 48 Ca,2n) 255 Lr has provided evidence for an isomeric level.
