[ 1996 9 13 ] [ 2005 5 16 ] { 9 } { 210 } { List of Everybody Loves Raymond episodes } { The King of Queens } Everybody Loves Raymond is an American television sitcom, starring Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton. It originally ran on CBS from September 13, 1996 to May 16, 2005. Many of the situations from the show are based on the real-life experiences of Romano, creator/producer Phil Rosenthal and the show&apos;s writing staff. The main characters on the show are also loosely based on Romano&apos;s and Rosenthal&apos;s real-life family members. The show reruns in syndication on different channels such as TBS, TV Land, and in most TV markets on local stations. { Everybody Loves Raymond: Make Mine a Double Paramount Comedy. } From 2000 to 2007, KingWorld distributed the show for off-network syndication. In 2008, CBS Television Distribution took over King World&apos;s distribution, although its logo is retained on TBS. CBS only owns American syndication rights; ancillary rights are controlled by HBO and Warner Bros. Television (WBTV distributes the series outside the US in conjunction with HBO; while HBO Home Entertainment and Warner Home Video own DVD rights worldwide). [ Show background ] The show revolves around the life of Italian-American Raymond Barone, a newspaper sportswriter for Newsday living with his family in Lynbrook, Long Island, New York. Whiny and flippant, Raymond does not take many things seriously, making jokes in nearly every situation, no matter how troubling or problematic, and constantly avoiding any sort of real responsibility. Raymond and his wife Debra live with Ally and their identical twin sons Michael and Geoffrey (originally Gregory and Matthew in the pilot). The Barone children, played by real-life siblings, are regular characters but not a major focus. Raymond&apos;s parents, Marie and Frank, and brother Robert live across the street, and frequently make their presence known to the frustration of Raymond and Debra. Debra&apos;s frequent complaints about Raymond&apos;s family are a running joke. Out of the three unwanted visitors, Debra is particularly put off by Marie — an insulting, controlling and manipulative, though loving, woman who constantly criticizes and antagonizes Debra and coddles Ray, clearly favoring him over Robert, whose impending birth (as was established in the episode &quot; Good Girls &quot; ) drove her into marriage. Raymond often finds himself in the middle of all the problems and arguments and proves himself incapable of taking any sort of stand, especially if there is the chance that it will bring down the wrath of his mother on him. His biggest nemesis is his brother Robert, who is insecure and jealous of Raymond for being the favorite son, as well as Raymond&apos;s relative success in both his professional and family life. Robert and Raymond are frequently seen fighting like children and picking on each other. Raymond and Robert&apos;s father, Frank, is a very crass and obnoxious person, constantly making insulting and sarcastic remarks to everyone with whom he comes into contact. Largely an absentee father when the boys were growing up, Frank does not like to show his feelings, although, in an effort to make the character a bit more sympathetic, throughout the years several episodes were crafted to show that he actually does love his family. Frank is the only one who has the nerve to criticize Marie and often comes to Debra&apos;s defense from Marie&apos;s jibes. Raymond and Debra constantly have marital disagreements, with Raymond preferring to watch sports television instead of talking with Debra about important matters. Like his father, Raymond works full time, leaving all the child-rearing responsibilities to Debra, and he has to be bullied into helping with any work around the house. A recurring theme on the show has them having a long interaction each night while in bed before going to sleep. The Barones are established to be an amoral family of liars, as according to Marie in the episode &quot; The Ball &quot;, &quot; that&apos;s what holds us all together. &quot; [ Cast and characters ] [ Characters ] [ List of Everybody Loves Raymond characters ] The five principal characters during an argument. Episode: &quot; The Can Opener &quot; Actor Role Years Seasons Episodes Ray Romano Ray Barone 1996–2005 1–9 210 Patricia Heaton Debra Barone 209 Brad Garrett Robert Barone Doris Roberts Marie Barone 210 Peter Boyle Frank Barone 206 Madylin Sweeten Ally Barone 146 Sullivan and Sawyer Sweeten Michael and Geoffrey Barone 136 Monica Horan Amy MacDougall-Barone 1997–2005 64 Raymond &quot; Ray &quot; Barone ( Ray Romano ) is a sportswriter for Newsday. He lives in Lynbrook, Long Island with his wife, Debra, and their three children Alexandra ( &quot; Ally &quot; ), Geoffrey, and Michael. His parents Frank and Marie and brother Robert live across the street. Raymond&apos;s character is loosely based on the real-life Romano, as he is the father of twin boys and a girl. Ray is emotionally unable to take any sort of stand on anything, especially if it brings him to any sort of conflict with his mother—the exception is when he protests about sex or some trivial matter. Raymond&apos;s mother favors him over Robert. Debra Barone ( Patricia Heaton ) is Raymond&apos;s wife, and the mother of Ally, Michael and Geoffrey. As a housewife, Debra claims she is frequently overworked, under-appreciated and stressed out; major reasons for this are not only because she has to deal with all the housework and her three rambunctious children with almost no assistance or support from Raymond—especially where his mother is concerned—but also because she must constantly put up with Raymond&apos;s intrusive family members. However on frequent occasions this frustration boils over and vented, primarily towards Raymond. Robert Barone ( Brad Garrett ) is Raymond&apos;s older brother and the son of Frank and Marie. Standing at 6&apos; 8 &quot; 1/2, he is the tallest Barone, and has several quirks, the biggest being a nervous habit of touching food to his chin before eating it, once referred to as &quot; crazy chin. &quot; Robert is a very caring uncle and still cares for Raymond, but is often jealous of the attention that Raymond receives from their mother, to the exclusion of his every achievement. Robert has been a New York City police officer for over 20 years, and attains the rank of lieutenant by the end of the series. His height, appearance and demeanor are the source of much humor. However, despite his huge size, Robert is a very skilled dancer. Marie Barone ( Doris Roberts ) is Raymond&apos;s mother, the wife of Frank, and the matriarch of the Barone family. Intrusive, controlling, manipulative and over-nurturing (at least with Raymond), she is a housewife who excels in cooking, cleaning, and other things dealing with keeping a good home and family. Marie and Frank live across the street from Raymond and Debra in Lynbrook, Long Island, New York which often irritates the latter couple. Francis &quot; Frank &quot; Barone ( Peter Boyle ) is Raymond&apos;s father and Marie&apos;s husband, a retired bookkeeper, and registered real estate agent, with a stubborn masculine personality. A war veteran, Frank served in the Korean War, which he frequently brings up, to the annoyance of everyone, especially his sons. He is a member of the Order of the Caribou Lodge, and was named Man of the Year by his lodge. Amy McDougall/Barone ( Monica Horan ) becomes Robert Barone&apos;s second wife (in season 7), and is the best friend of Debra, who introduces her to Robert. A recurring character for the first six seasons of the series, Amy became a main character (and Monica Horan was added to the main cast introductions) in season seven. Many issues cause Amy and Robert to break up in the first six seasons, with one being caused by Raymond. Quite often, Amy apologizes to someone even if she did not do anything wrong. She was born to very religious parents who, according to Amy, &quot; wouldn&apos;t yell if they were on fire. &quot; (In real life, Horan is the wife of creator/executive producer Philip Rosenthal.) Alexandra &quot; Ally &quot; Barone ( Madylin Sweeten ), is the daughter of Raymond and Debra. She is the oldest of the Barone children. She is not seen much, even though she is credited as the main cast. She is said to be a better cook than her mother, and maybe someday her grandmother. (In real life Sawyer and Sullivan are real brothers to Madylin Sweeten.) Geoffrey Barone ( Sawyer Sweeten ) and Michael Barone ( Sullivan Sweeten ) are twin sons of Raymond and Debra. Their original names (in the pilot) were Gregory and Matthew. (In real life Sawyer and Sullivan are real brothers to Madylin Sweeten.)
