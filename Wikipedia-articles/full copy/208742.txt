[ Herschel W. Account of the Discovery of a Sixth and Seventh Satellite of the Planet Saturn; With Remarks on the Construction of Its Ring, Its Atmosphere, Its Rotation on an Axis, and Its Spheroidical Figure Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 1790 80 0 1–20 10.1098/rstl.1790.0001 ] It is named after Mimas, a son of Gaia in Greek mythology, and is also designated Saturn I. With a diameter of [ 396 km ] it is the twentieth-largest moon in the Solar System and is the smallest known astronomical body that is rounded in shape due to self-gravitation. [ Discovery ] Mimas was discovered by the astronomer William Herschel on 17 September 1789. He recorded his discovery as follows: &quot; The great light of my forty-foot telescope was so useful that on the 17th of September, 1789, I remarked the seventh satellite, then situated at its greatest western elongation. &quot; { Herschel, William Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 80, reported by } [ Arago M. Herschel Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution 1871 198–223 http://laplaza.org/~tom/People/Herschel.htm 2006-11-26 ] [ Name ] Mimas is named after one of the Titan s in Greek mythology, Mimas. The names of all seven then-known satellites of Saturn, including Mimas, were suggested by William Herschel&apos;s son John in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. { As reported by } { William Lassell, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 42–43 (January 14, 1848) } [ Lassell William Satellites of Saturn: Observations of Mimas, the closest and most interior Satellite of Saturn http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/MNRAS/0008//0000042.000.html Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 1848 8 42 2006-11-26 1848MNRAS...8...42L ] He named them after Titans specifically because Saturn (the Roman equivalent of Kronos in Greek mythology), was the leader of the Titans and ruler of the world for some time. The adjectival form of Mimas is Mimantean or Mimantian, { Jane Ellen Harrison (1908) Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion‎ } { The nt comes from the Latin } { genitive case Mimantis, from Greek Μῑμάντος; the old form of the name had been Mimans Μίμανς (Liddell and Scott&apos;s } { Greek-English Lexicon ) } and this is accepted by the Cassini mission at JPL. [ http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/mimas/ Cassini Equinox Mission: Mimas Saturn.jpl.nasa.gov 2005-08-02 2012-02-26 ] [ Physical characteristics ] [ List of geological features on Mimas ] &apos;&apos;Cassini&apos;&apos; view of Mimas&apos;s trailing hemisphere, showing craters up to 6 km deep and 1-km-deep chasmata (grooves). The large crater near center is Morgan; Arthur is close to the lower right limb. Pelion Chasma is faintly visible as a horizontal trough left of Arthur and below Morgan. The low density of Mimas, 1.15 g/cm³, indicates that it is composed mostly of water ice with only a small amount of rock. Due to the tidal forces acting on it, the moon is not perfectly spherical; its longest axis is about 10% longer than the shortest. The ellipsoid shape of Mimas is especially noticeable in recent images from the Cassini probe. Mimas&apos;s most distinctive feature is a colossal impact crater [ 130 km ] across, named Herschel after the moon&apos;s discoverer. Herschel&apos;s diameter is almost a third of the moon&apos;s own diameter; its walls are approximately [ 5 km ] high, parts of its floor measure [ 10 km ] deep, and its central peak rises [ 6 km ] above the crater floor. If there were a crater of an equivalent scale on Earth it would be over [ 4000 km ] in diameter, wider than Australia. The impact that made this crater must have nearly shattered Mimas: fractures can be seen on the opposite side of Mimas that may have been created by shock waves from the impact travelling through the moon&apos;s body. [ Jupiter and Saturn Elkins-Tanton Linda E. 144 Infobase Publishing 2006 9781438107257 ] The Mimantean surface is saturated with smaller impact craters, but no others are anywhere near the size of Herschel. Although Mimas is heavily cratered, the cratering is not uniform. Most of the surface is covered with craters greater than [ 40 km ] in diameter, but in the south polar region, craters greater than [ 20 km ] are generally lacking. Map of Mimas Three types of geological features are officially recognized on Mimas: crater s, chasmata (chasms) and catenae (crater chains). [ Orbital resonances ] A number of features in Saturn&apos;s rings are related to resonances with Mimas. Mimas is responsible for clearing the material from the Cassini Division, the gap between Saturn&apos;s two widest rings, the A Ring and B Ring. Particles in the Huygens Gap at the inner edge of the Cassini division are in a 2:1 resonance with Mimas. They orbit twice for each orbit of Mimas. The repeated pulls by Mimas on the Cassini division particles, always in the same direction in space, force them into new orbits outside the gap. The boundary between the C and B ring is in a 3:1 resonance with Mimas. Recently, the G Ring was found to be in a 7:6 co-rotation eccentricity resonance with Mimas; the ring&apos;s inner edge is about [ 15000 km ] inside Mimas&apos;s orbit. [ November 2011 ] Mimas is also in a 2:1 mean motion resonance with the larger moon Tethys, and in a 2:3 resonance with the outer F Ring shepherd moonlet, Pandora. [ Exploration ] Pioneer 11 flew by Saturn in 1979, and its closest approach to Mimas was 104,263  km on September 1, 1979. [ http://www.dmuller.net/spaceflight/mission.php?mission%3Dpioneer11%26amp%3Bappear%3Dblack%26amp%3Bmtype%3Dscet%26amp%3Bshowimg%3Dyes%26amp%3Bdispwide%3Dno Pioneer 11 Full Mission Timeline Dmuller.net 2012-02-26 ] Voyager 1 flew by in 1980, and Voyager 2 in 1981. Mimas has been imaged several times by the Cassini orbiter, which entered into orbit around Saturn in 2004. A close flyby occurred on February 13, 2010, when Cassini passed by Mimas at [ 9500 km mi on ]. [ Unusual resemblances ] When seen from certain angles, Mimas closely resembles the Death Star, a fictional space station known from the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, which is said to be roughly 140 kilometres in diameter. This resemblance stems from the fact that Herschel can appear in Mimas&apos;s northern hemisphere, much like the concave disc of the Death Star&apos;s &quot; superlaser &quot;. This is purely coincidental, as the first film was made three years before the first close-up photographs of Mimas were taken. [ http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id%3Ddn6999 Saturn&apos;s moon is Death Star&apos;s twin 2005-02-11 2008-08-21 New Scientist Kelly Young Saturn&apos;s diminutive moon, Mimas, poses as the Death Star  – the planet-destroying space station from the movie Star Wars  – in an image recently captured by NASA&apos;s Cassini spacecraft. ] In 2010, NASA revealed a temperature map of Mimas, using images obtained by Cassini. The warmest regions, which are along one edge of the moon, create a shape similar to the video game character Pac-Man, with Herschel Crater assuming the role of an &quot; edible dot &quot; known from Pac-Man gameplay.
