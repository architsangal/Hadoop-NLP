Closely related to human existence, the folkloric costume reflected over time, as reflected nowadays, mentality and artistic conception of the people. The folkloric costume has been developed with history, being a genuine expression of coherent tradition s throughout centuries. Distinct clothing ornamentation, traditional methods used for sewing and tailoring the pieces of clothing, and wide variety of costumes from one region to another customize the defining spirit of the Romanian people. For women, one of the most important parts of the celebration costume is a kerchief called maramă. A maramă is made from a special fabric called borangic, which resembles silk, so the texture of the material is really nice and soft. An important aspect is its transparency, given by the weaver in which it&apos;s made. The borangic is obtained from silkworms&apos; cocoons. Every woman grows the silkworms in her own yard, feeding them with mullberry leaves. After approximately 6 weeks, the worms would hide in their cocoons and the person who&apos;s in charge of them should move the cocoons into the sun so the worms die and the silk filament can be extracted. Once all the filaments are extracted, they&apos;re put into a weaver and one woman starts making the maramă. { http://www.unibuc.ro/uploads_ro/48384/1328/CIVILIZATIA_TRADITIONALA.pdf } Also, the folklore of Romania is defined by its mythology, branch of folk literature that integrates a variety of ancestral habits, tale s, fable s and ballad s, whose authors are anonymous.

Doina, characteristic only Romanian literary folklore, represents the lyric creation that Romanian expresses the most varied and complex range of feelings, strongly rooted in his spiritual structure. In the Romanian folkloric tradition, &quot; doina &quot; was played mainly orally or accompanied by a single instrument, being the song of elegy, played for self comforting and not intended for festive events because of its sober nature.
