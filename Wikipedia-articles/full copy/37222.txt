The first book of His Dark Materials has been turned into the film The Golden Compass and the first two books from his &apos;&apos;Sally Lockhart&apos;&apos; series as well as his children&apos;s novel I was a Rat! or The Scarlet Slippers have been adapted for television. In 2008, The Times named Pullman in its list of &quot; The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 &quot;. { The 50 greatest British writers since 1945. 5 January 2008. } { The Times. Retrieved on 2010-02-05. } [ Life and career ] Philip Pullman was born in Norwich, England, the son of Audrey Evelyn Pullman (née Merrifield) and Royal Air Force pilot Alfred Outram Pullman. The family travelled with his father&apos;s job, including to Southern Rhodesia where he spent time at school. His father was killed in a plane crash in 1953 when Pullman was seven, being awarded posthumously the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Pullman said at the beginning of a 2008 exchange that to him as a boy, his father &quot; was a hero, steeped in glamour, killed in action defending his country &quot; and had been &quot; training pilots, I think. &quot; Pullman was then presented with a report from The London Gazette of 1954 &quot; which carried the official RAF news of the day [and] said that the medal was given for &apos;gallant and distinguished service&apos; during the Mau Mau uprising. &apos;The main task of the Harvards [the squadron of planes led by his father] has been bombing and machine-gunning Mau Mau and their hideouts in densely wooded and difficult country.&apos; This included &apos;diving steeply into the gorges of [various] rivers, often in conditions of low cloud and driving rain.&apos; Testing conditions, yes, but not much opposition from the enemy, the journalist in the exchange continued. Very few of the Mau Mau had guns that could land a blow on an aircraft. &quot; Pullman responded to this new information, writing &quot; my father probably doesn&apos;t come out of this with very much credit, judged by the standards of modern liberal progressive thought &quot; and accepted the new information as &quot; a serious challenge to his childhood memory. &quot; { Moreton, Cole, &quot; Philip Pullman: His dark materials: The death and absence of his father has informed so much of the fiction written by this highly acclaimed author over the years, but he has never known – or wanted to know – the truth about what really happened. Until now... &quot;, } { The Independent, 25 May 2008.

From 1957 he was educated at Ysgol Ardudwy in Harlech, Gwynedd, and spent time in Norfolk with his grandfather, a clergyman. Around this time Pullman discovered John Milton &apos;s Paradise Lost, which would become a major influence for His Dark Materials. From 1963, Pullman attended Exeter College, Oxford, receiving a Third class BA in 1968. [ http://www.cherwell.org/content/8873 University of Oxford, Cherwell newspaper Interviews: Philip Pullman 2009-08-02 2 September 2009 Cherwell ] In an interview with the Oxford Student he stated that he &quot; did not really enjoy the English course &quot; and that &quot; I thought I was doing quite well until I came out with my third class degree and then I realised that I wasn’t — it was the year they stopped giving fourth class degrees otherwise I’d have got one of those &quot;. { Growing Pains – Features – The Oxford Student – Official Student Newspaper } He discovered William Blake &apos;s illustrations around 1970, which would also later influence him greatly. Pullman married Judith Speller in 1970 and began teaching middle school children ages 9 to 13 at Bishop Kirk Middle School in Summertown, North Oxford and writing school plays. His first published work was The Haunted Storm, which joint-won the New English Library&apos;s Young Writer&apos;s Award in 1972. He nevertheless refuses to discuss it. Galatea, an adult fantasy-fiction novel, followed in 1978, but it was his school plays which inspired his first children&apos;s book, Count Karlstein, in 1982. He stopped teaching around the publication of The Ruby in the Smoke (1986), his second children&apos;s book, whose Victorian setting is indicative of Pullman&apos;s interest in that era. Pullman taught part-time at Westminster College, Oxford, between 1988 and 1996, continuing to write children&apos;s stories. He began His Dark Materials in about 1993. Northern Lights (published as The Golden Compass in the US) was published in 1995 and won the Carnegie Medal, one of the most prestigious British children&apos;s fiction awards, and the Guardian Children&apos;s Fiction Award. Pullman has been writing full-time since 1996, but continues to deliver talks and writes occasionally for The Guardian. He was awarded a CBE in the New Year&apos;s Honours list in 2004.
