Trading began on June 1, 1878. In 1943, the exchange was combined with ten other stock exchanges in major Japanese cities to form a single [ Japanese Stock Exchange :ja:日本証券取引所 Nippon Shōken Torihikisho ]. The combined exchange was shut down and reorganized shortly after the bombing of Nagasaki. [ Postwar history ] Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1950 The Tokyo Stock Exchange reopened under its current Japanese name on May 16, 1949, pursuant to the new Securities Exchange Act.

[ Technology problems ] The exchange was only able to operate for 90 minutes on November 1, 2005, due to bugs with a newly installed transactions system, developed by Fujitsu, which was supposed to help cope with higher trading volumes. The interruption in trading was the worst in the history of the exchange. { Fujitsu execs take pay cut after Tokyo exchange crash, 25th November 2005 } Trading was suspended for four-and-a-half hours. During the initial public offering of advertising giant Dentsu, in December 2001, a trader at UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, sent an order to sell 610,000 shares in this company at ¥1 each, while he intended to sell 1 share at ¥610,000. The bank lost £71 million. { Fat fingered typing costs a trader’s bosses £128m } During yet another initial public offering, that of J-Com, on December 8, 2005, an employee at Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. mistakenly typed an order to sell 600,000 shares at ¥1, instead of an order to sell 1 share at ¥600,000. Mizuho failed to catch the error; the Tokyo Stock Exchange initially blocked attempts to cancel the order, resulting in a net loss of US$347 million to be shared between the exchange and Mizuho. Both companies are now trying to deal with their troubles: lack of error checking, lack of safeguards, lack of reliability, lack of transparency, lack of testing, loss of confidence, and loss of profits. On 11 December, the TSE acknowledged that its system was at fault in the Mizuho trade. On 21 December, Takuo Tsurushima, chief executive of the TSE, and two other senior executives resigned over the Mizuho affair. { Tokyo Exchange Struggles With Snarls in Electronics NY Times,December 13, 2005 } [ http://japan.seekingalpha.com/article/5077 What&apos;s Going on at the Tokyo Stock Exchange - Seeking Alpha Japan.seekingalpha.com 2010-07-10 ] { Tokyo Stock Exchange admits error in Mizuho trade botch-up, 12 December 2005 } { Mizuho Says Trader Error to Cost It at Least $224 Mln (Update5), Bloomberg, December 9, 2005 } [ http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/worldbiz/archives/2005/12/10/2003283851 archives Taipei Times 2005-12-10 2010-07-31 ] [ http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/12/11/afx2383299.html Tokyo Stock Exchange plans cash settlement in Mizuho fiasco - report Forbes.com November 12, 2005 2010-07-10 ] [ http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10394551/ Botched stock trade costs Japan firm $225M - Business - World business - msnbc.com MSNBC 2005-12-14 2010-07-10 ] [ Heavy selling leads to shortened session at Tokyo stock exchange ] On January 17, 2006, the Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%, its fastest drop in nine months, as investors sold stocks across the board in the wake of a raid by prosecutors on internet company livedoor.

The TSE has already acquired a 5% stake in the SGX as of June 2007, deemed to be only the beginning of greater participation.
