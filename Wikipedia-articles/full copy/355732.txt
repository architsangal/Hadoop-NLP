[ January 2012 several citations need in History section; no citations at all in Notable Members section ] The International Socialist Organization (ISO) is a revolutionary socialist organization in the United States that identifies with the politics of proletarian internationalism, a current of Trotskyism, and the Marxist political tradition that American socialist writer and activist Hal Draper called &quot; socialism from below. &quot;. { Hal Draper: The Two Souls of Socialism, 1966. } [ Ideology ] The ISO advocates replacing the capitalist system with socialism, which it identifies as a system in which society&apos;s collective wealth and resources are democratically controlled to meet human need. To achieve socialism, the ISO argues that the working class must lead a revolutionary transformation of society.Â Because capitalism is a global system, the ISO argues that the struggle for socialism must be international in scope. The ISO holds that the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, as well as China and Cuba, are examples of bureaucratic state capitalism rather than socialism. While the ISO supports struggles for economic, political, and social reforms, it also maintains that exploitation, oppression, war, and environmental destruction cannot be eliminated until capitalism is replaced by socialism. { Where We Stand, SocialistWorker.org } [ Strategy ] The ISO identifies itself as a Marxist organization, and advocates the emancipation of the working class led by a revolutionary workers&apos; party. While it supports existing trade unions as essential components of workers&apos; struggles, it maintains that workers need to organize themselves independently of the trade union officialdom. The ISO also maintains that racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression are perpetuated by the capitalist system to keep the working class divided against itself, and therefore supports a range of social movements and struggles for social equality and civil rights. The ISO also identifies itself as a Leninist organization because it calls for the formation of a revolutionary party by the most militant workers, and states that it is committed to playing a role in helping to build the foundations for such a party. [ History ] The ISO originated in 1976 among a number of groups in the International Socialists (IS) that were growing increasingly critical of the organization&apos;s leadership. Among them was the self-identified Left Faction, which was led by Cal and Barbara Winslow and supported by the IS&apos;s Canadian and British members. The Left Faction and its international supporters maintained that the IS&apos;s leadership had acquired a top-down style of operating that depoliticized the organization and placed too much emphasis on sending student activists into working class employment (a tactic referred to as &quot; industrialization &quot; ). These disputes followed the disagreements over the 1974 revolution in Portugal. In 1977, the Left Faction was expelled from the IS, and immediately formed the International Socialist Organization. [ http://www.marxists.de/trotism/fisk/ch7.htm Socialism From Below in the US: Origins of the ISO Milton Fisk 1977 Hera Press 2008-02-12 ] The ISO began publication of its paper, Socialist Worker, shortly after its formation, and continues to produce a monthly print version, as well as a daily updated web site, Socialistworker.org. [ Celebrating our 500th http://www.socialistworker.org/2004-2/500Supp/500Supp_Celebrating.shtml Socialist Worker 2002-02-01 2008-02-23 ] Some of the political theories adopted by the ISO had been developed in the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP), including that of state capitalism. State capitalist theory identifies the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc as exploitative class societies driven by military competition with private Western capitalism, rather than as the deformed workers&apos; states that Trotsky maintained they were in The Revolution Betrayed.

[ December 2009 ] From the early 1980s, the group began organizing and recruiting on university campuses. [ December 2009 ] The decision to focus primarily on students was regarded as a necessary retreat, given the conservative nature of the Reagan era.

This dispute was framed by the SWP as a critique of the ISO&apos;s conservative approach to the anti-corporate/anti-capitalist movement. { Ted Crawford, &quot; Split in the IST &quot;, What Next?, No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26) } The ISO disputed this claim and criticized the SWP for maintaining what the ISO viewed as an exaggerated perspective for the 1990s, { &quot; The ISO (US) and the International Socialist Tendency &quot;, What Next?, No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2012-2-12) } which the SWP characterized as &apos;the 1930s in slow motion.&apos; { SWP Central committee, &quot; Statement on Relations Between the SWP (GB) and the ISO (US) &quot;, What Next?, No. 19, 2001. (accessed 2008-06-26) } After some years with very little contact between the ISO and the British SWP, relations seem to be improving. Ahmed Shawki, a leading member of the ISO, was invited in 2010 to speak at the SWP&apos;s Marxism festival while SWP National Secretary Martin Smith spoke at the ISO&apos;s Socialism 2010 conference, an invitation which had not been made for a number of years. [ January 2012 ] The ISO also maintains friendly relations with the Fourth International, currently holding permanent observer status in the FI. [ January 2012 ] [ Publications ] The organization publishes a daily online and monthly print newspaper, &quot; Socialist Worker, &quot; with a bi-monthly Spanish language supplement, Obrero Socialista.. { &quot; A new era for &apos;&apos;Socialist Worker&apos;&apos; &quot; } The ISO also distributes the International Socialist Review and titles from the publishing house Haymarket Books, both of which are run by the Center for Economic Research and Social Change. { Consortium Book Sales &amp; Distribution | Publisher Information.

The ISO does not support the Republican party or Democratic party, both of which it views as political representatives of corporate power. The group has, however, campaigned for the Green Party in various races and assisted Ralph Nader &apos;s presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004. { &quot; The Green Party: offering a real challenge to business as usual, or just Capitalism Lite? &quot;, Freedom Socialist, Volume 27, Issue 6, December 2006 - January 2007. } In California in 2006, ISO member Todd Chretien challenged Diane Feinstein for a seat in the United States Senate on the Green Party ticket, receiving 139,425 votes (1.8 percent). { California Secretary of State, Supplement to Statement of Vote - United States Senator - Statewide Summary &quot;, Statement of Vote, 2006 General Election, at www.sos.ca.gov website.
