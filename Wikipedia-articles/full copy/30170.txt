Map of Trinidad and Tobago Topography of Trindad and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago is an archipelagic republic in the southern Caribbean between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela. They are southeasterly islands of the Lesser Antille, Monos, Huevos, Gaspar Grande (or Gasparee), Little Tobago, and St. Giles Island. Trinidad is [ 11 km mi 1 on ] off the northeast coast of Venezuela and [ 130 km mi 0 on ] south of the Grenadines. The island measures [ 4768 km2 sqmi 0 on ] in area (comprising 93.0% of the country&apos;s total area) with an average length of [ 80 km mi 0 on ] and an average width of [ 59 km mi 0 on ]. The island appears rectangular in shape with three projecting peninsular corners. Tobago is [ 30 km mi 0 on ] northeast of Trinidad and measures about [ 298 km2 sqmi 0 on ] in area, or 5.8% of the country&apos;s area, [ 41 km mi 1 on ] in length and [ 12 km mi 1 on ] at its greatest width. The island is cigar-shaped in appearance, with a northeast-southwest alignment. Geologically, the islands are not part of the Antillean arc. Rather, Trinidad was once part of the South American mainland and is situated on its continental shelf, and Tobago is part of a sunken island arc chain related to the Pacific-derived Caribbean Plate. The islands are separated from the continent of South America by the Gulf of Paria; Dragon&apos;s Mouth, a [ 19 km mi 1 on ] -wide northern passage; and Serpent&apos;s Mouth, a [ 14 km mi 1 on ] -wide southern passage. Trinidad is traversed by three distinct mountain ranges that are a continuation of the Venezuelan coastal cordillera. The Northern Range, an outlier of the Andes Mountains of Venezuela, consists of rugged hills that parallel the coast. This range rises into two peaks. The highest, El Cerro del Aripo, is [ 940 m ft 0 ] high; the other, El Tucuche, reaches 936 meters. The Central Range extends diagonally across the island and is a low-lying range with swampy areas rising to rolling hills; its maximum elevation is [ 325 m ft 0 ]. The Caroni Plain, composed of alluvial sediment, extends southward, separating the Northern Range and Central Range. The Southern Range consists of a broken line of hills with a maximum elevation of [ 305 m ft 0 ]. There are numerous rivers and streams on the island of Trinidad; the most significant are the Ortoire River, [ 50 km mi 1 ] long, which extends eastward into the Atlantic, and the [ 40 km mi 1 on ] -long Caroni River, reaching westward into the Gulf of Paria. Most of the soils of Trinidad are fertile, with the exception of the sandy and unstable terrain found in the southern part of the island. Tobago is mountainous and dominated by the Main Ridge, which is [ 29 km mi 0 ] long with elevations up to 640 meters. There are deep, fertile valleys running north and south of the Main Ridge. The southwestern tip of the island has a coral platform. Although Tobago is volcanic in origin, there are no active volcanoes. Forestation covers 43 % of the island. There are numerous rivers and streams, but flooding and erosion are less severe than in Trinidad. The coastline is indented with numerous bays, beaches, and narrow coastal plains. Tobago has several small satellite islands. The largest of these, Little Tobago, is starfish shaped, hilly, and consists of [ 1.2 km² sqmi on ] of impenetrable vegetation. Because it was once part of South America, Trinidad has an assortment of tropical vegetation and wildlife considerably more varied than that of most West Indian islands. Tobago has a generally similar but less varied assortment.

Natural hazards:outside usual path of hurricanes and other tropical storms [ Climate ] Trinidad and Tobago well within the tropics, both enjoy a generally pleasant maritime tropical climate influenced by the northeast trade winds. In Trinidad the annual mean temperature is [ 26 °C 1 ], and the average maximum temperature is [ 34 °C 1 ]. The humidity is high, particularly during the rainy season, when it averages 85 to 87%. The island receives an average of [ 2110 mm in 1 us ] of rainfall per year, usually concentrated in the months of June through December, when brief, intense showers frequently occur. Precipitation is highest in the Northern Range, which may receive as much as [ 3810 mm in us ]. During the dry season, drought plagues the island&apos;s central interior. Tobago&apos;s climate is similar to Trinidad&apos;s but slightly cooler. Its rainy season extends from June to December; the annual rainfall is [ 2500 mm in 1 us ]. The islands lie outside the hurricane belt; despite this, Hurricane Flora damaged Tobago in 1963, and Tropical Storm Alma hit Trinidad in 1974, causing damage before obtaining full strength.
