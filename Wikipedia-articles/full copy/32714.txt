His death was ruled a suicide by multiple official investigations, but remains a subject of interest among conspiracy theorists.

His father wanted him to go into the family real estate business, but he chose law instead. After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War. In order to be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law, where he was managing editor of the law review { &quot; Tribute to Vincent Foster, Jr. &quot;, } { Congressional Record, July 29, 1993. } and received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1971, graduating first in his class.

He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients. Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate (and later partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman. { Carl Bernstein, A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton, } { Knopf, ISBN 0-375-40766-9. pp. 128–131. } Hillary Rodham Clinton&apos;s memoirs call Foster &quot; one of the best lawyers I&apos;ve ever known, &quot; and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck &apos;s Atticus Finch role in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.

He found his involvement in vetting new presidential appointments during the transition period to be causing him depression and anxiety, and he blamed himself for the failed Zoe Baird nomination. The failed Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also within his purview. His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his junior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock.

You will be judged by your judgment.... There is no victory, no advantage, no fee, no favor, which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity.... Dents to [your] reputation are irreparable. &quot; ] Days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted. Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993, with titles such as &quot; Who is Vincent Foster? &quot; He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing at which he may have been called to testify. Disliking the public spotlight and suffering from weight loss and insomnia, he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.

The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. He was found with a gun in his hand and gunshot residue on that hand. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.

[ Subsequent investigations ] [ Suicide of Vince Foster ] There have been three official investigations into Foster&apos;s death, all of which concluded that he committed suicide. { Office of the Independent Counsel. &quot; Report on the Death of Vincent W. Foster, Jr. &quot; October 10, 1997 } The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell. Due to Foster&apos;s position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released in 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide. Theories of a cover-up still persisted, some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr { Full text of the report on the 1993 death of White House counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., compiled by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr. mirror } { Report: Starr Rules Out Foul Play In Foster Death CNN February 23, 1997 } released a report in 1997 also concluding that the death was a suicide. In addition, two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide. { Gerald S.

It clearly had a tremendous impact. &quot; Fellow White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum felt that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint Independent Counsels, and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and the Clintons for the rest of their terms, might not have happened. As it happened, how Hillary Clinton&apos;s chief of staff, Margaret Williams in particular handled Foster&apos;s files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself. { &quot; Memo Links First Lady To Handling Of Suicide Note &quot;, } { CNN.com, August 27, 1996. } [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Books ] Clinton, Bill (2005).
