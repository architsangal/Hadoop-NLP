On its western side, the peninsula encloses Sandy Hook Bay, a triangular arm of Raritan Bay. The [ 1665 acre km2 on ] peninsula was discovered by Henry Hudson, { Rounds, Kate. &quot; The Shore Next Door &quot; Palisade magazine; Summer 2010; Pages 38-39 } and, historically, Sandy Hook has been a convenient anchorage for ships before proceeding into Upper New York Harbor. Sandy Hook is part of Middletown Township, New Jersey, although not contiguous with the rest of the Township. Because the peninsula is a federal reservation, this technicality is essentially moot. The community of Highlands overlooks the southern part of the hook. [ true ] { Sandy Hook Light } { Lightship #51 at Sandy Hook as it appeared in the 1890s. Photo by } { J. S.

The eastern shoreline consists of public beaches: North Beach, Gunnison Beach, and South Beach. The southern part of the spit consists of public beaches, fishing areas, and the SeaGull&apos;s Nest, a seafood restaurant operated by a concessionaire. The peninsula&apos;s ocean-facing beaches are considered among the finest in New Jersey and are a popular destination for recreation in summer when seasonal ferries { Sea Streak } bring beachgoers. Gunnison Beach is one of the largest clothing optional beaches on the East Coast.

The clothing-optional part is called Gunnison Beach and there&apos;s even a picture showing people of varying shapes and sizes frolicking in their birthday suits. &quot; } The defunct U.S. Army post Fort Hancock at the north end of the peninsula is open to the public. The Sandy Hook Proving Ground was used by for many years – beginning after the Civil War until 1919, when the facility was moved to Aberdeen, Maryland – and was later the site of a Nike missile defense installation. The Sandy Hook Nike station is one of a very few stations that are still intact. Almost all of the fort&apos;s gun batteries are off limits to the public due to their hazardous condition. The exception to this is Battery Gunnison which is being restored by volunteers and has two M-1900 six-inch (152 mm) cannon installed; the weapons were placed there in 1976. Guided tours give visitors a look at an actual Nike missile, the missile firing platforms, and a radar station, complete with 1960&apos;s-era computers. Sandy Hook Lighthouse is located within the fort grounds, as is the Marine Academy of Science and Technology (MAST), a magnet high school, part of the Monmouth County Vocational School District. At the entrance to Fort Hancock is Guardian Park, a plaza dominated by two Nike missiles. Some of the buildings of Fort Hancock are off-limits because their structural integrity is dubious. A controversial proposal was recently accepted to allow adaptive reuse of some of the buildings in Fort Hancock for private profit, however the developer was removed for inability to obtain financing. North of Fort Hancock on the western part of the &quot; hook &quot; is an active station of the United States Coast Guard. This is one of the original Life Saving Stations built in 1848 at a site &quot; on bay side, one-half mile south of point of Hook. &quot; The site was changed several times through the years due to a change in land or at the request of the War Department, which owned the land { http://www.uscg.mil/history/stations/SANDYHOOK.pdf }. This area is administered by the Department of Homeland Security and is off-limits to the general public. [ Tourism and recreation ] { Gunnison Beach is } { clothing optional } The beaches along the Atlantic shore of Sandy Hook – North Beach, Gunnison Beach and South Beach – feature parking lots, life guards, rest rooms and snack bars, and do not permit animals until after La bor Day.

These stretches are favored by cyclist s and kite surfer s, and leashed dogs are permitted. Accommodations on Sandy Hook include Bed and breakfast s such as the Sandy Hook Cottage and Seascape Manor, as well as Grand Lady by the Sea, and Nauvoo at Sandy Hook, which are all located in Highlands. Dining options include Sea Gulls&apos; Nest Deck Restaurant, as well as the landmark Bahr&apos;s Landing, Moby&apos;s and Something Fishy, which are all located outside the park. Local activities include the Sandy Hook All Woman Lifeguard Tournament in July, boat rentals for fishing, parties and tours, and trails for biking, rollerblading, and walking. The Henry Hudson Trail, which stretches nine miles (14 km) from Aberdeen to Atlantic Highlands, accommodates horseback riding and cross country skiing, and is wheelchair accessible. Sandy Hook is open year-round, though parking fees are levied during the summer months. [ Transportation ] The only road that connects to Sandy Hook is Route 36. A road through the peninsula branches from Route 36 at the northern end of Sea Bright. The Highlands-Sea Bright Bridge crosses the Shrewsbury River and carries the road traffic of Route 36 from Highlands in the west to Sea Bright in the east, at the entrance to Sandy Hook. Route 36 is accessible from the Garden State Parkway at Exits 105 in Tinton Falls and 117 in Hazlet Township (near Keyport ). Exit 117 is closer, and will be more direct from the north. Another possibility is to take the Garden State Parkway to Exit 109, in Middletown Township, for County Route 520, and take 520 through Red Bank to its eastern terminus at Route 36 in Sea Bright. Another alternative is to take the New Jersey Turnpike to Exit 8A (in Monroe Township ) to Route 32 east, to County Route 612 east, which then becomes County Route 520 east. Take CR 520 to its end in Sea Bright. A bicycle path parallels the motor road, SeaStreak and American Princess Cruises ferries serve Sandy Hook from Manhattan in summertime. { Sea Streak } { American Princess Cruises } { Sandy Hook Proving Ground } { mortar battery installation near } { Sandy Hook Light } [ See also ] Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey Fort Hancock, New Jersey Gateway National Recreation Area Sandy Hook Light Sandy Hook Proving Ground [ References ] Notes [ External links ] [ Sandy Hook, New Jersey ] Sandy Hook Visitor Information National Park Service Gateway National Recreation Area Nike Missile Site NY-56 [ Beaches of New Jersey Northernmost Highlands ] [ collapsed ] Category:Barrier islands of New Jersey Category:Populated places in Monmouth County, New Jersey Category:Peninsulas of New Jersey Category:Spits of the United States Category:Raritan Bayshore Category:Sandy Hook, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in New Jersey da:Sandy Hook (New Jersey) fr:Sandy Hook (New Jersey) it:Sandy Hook pl:Sandy Hook pt:Sandy Hook (Nova Jérsei) ru:Санди-Хук
