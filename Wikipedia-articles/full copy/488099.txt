He received a two-year athletics ban and a life-time Olympic ban in 2003 after testing positive for THG, a banned performance enhancing drug. Chambers was a promising young athlete, setting a junior world record of 10.06  s in the 100  m in 1997. He was the bronze medallist in the 1999 World Championships and made his first Olympic appearance at the Sydney 2000 Games; he turned in the best 100  m performance by a European at both events. By 2001, he had become the top British sprinter, breaking the 10-second barrier twice at the Edmonton World Championships. He became the 100  m European champion and record holder in 2002, but was then banned. Chambers returned to the track and field circuit in June 2006, and won gold with his teammates in the 4×100  m at the 2006 European Championships. He tried other sports, including a spell with the Hamburg Sea Devils of the NFL Europa league and a rugby league trial with the Castleford Tigers. Sprinting success came over 60  m when he won silver at the 2008 World Indoor Championships, gold at the 2009 European Indoors and became world champion at the 2010 World Indoor Championships. He was barred from the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, and much of the European racing circuit, from 2006 to 2012. In 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned his life-time Olympic ban, as it was deemed non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. { London 2012: Wada accuses BOA of making &apos;hysterical statements&apos;.
