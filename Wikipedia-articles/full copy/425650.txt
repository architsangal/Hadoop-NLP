[ 206862 ] The Soil Association is a charity based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1946, it has over 27,000 members today. Its activities include campaign work on issues including opposition to intensive farming, support for local purchasing and public education on nutrition; as well the certification of organic food. It developedthe world’s first organic certification system in 1967 - standards which have since widened to encompass agriculture, aquaculture, ethical trade, food processing, forestry, health &amp; beauty, horticulture and textiles. Today it certifies over 80% of organic produce in the UK. [ Our history http://www.soilassociation.org/aboutus/ourhistory Soil Association 11 April 2012 ] [ History ] [ November 2009 ] The Soil Association was formally registered on May 3, 1946 [ Paull John 2009 The Living Soil Association: Pioneering Organic Farming and Innovating Social Inclusion http://orgprints.org/16429/1/16429.pdf Journal of Organic Systems 4 1 15–33 ], and in the next decade grew from a few hundred to over four thousand members. The founding members comprised notable figures from various fields, including doctors, dentists, farmers, journalists, engineers and horticulturalists.

The book presented the case for an alternative, sustainable approach to agriculture that has since become known as organic farming. &quot; The Soil Association was founded in part due to concerns over intensive agriculture and in particular the use of herbicides. A comparison between the two forms of farming in 1939 was called the Haughley Experiment. The headquarters of the Soil Association used to be at the nearby Haughley Green in Suffolk. One of the founders of the Soil Association was Jorian Jenks, a former member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), closely associated with Oswald Mosley. Jenks was for years the editorial secretary of the Association&apos;s journal &quot; Mother Earth &quot;. During the late 40s the Association involved far-right and even antisemitic elements, remnants of the defunct BUF, and was driven by far-right political ideas as much as ecological concerns. Following Jenks’ death in 1963, the Association tilted towards the left of the political spectrum, especially under the new president of the Association, Barry Commoner. [ I.B.Tauris 978-1-84511-284-4 Macklin Graham Very deeply dyed in black: Sir Oswald Mosley and the resurrection of British fascism after 1945 2007 ] The Soil Association was one of five like-minded associations that founded the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) in 1972 in Versailles, France, to act as the umbrella organisation to advocate for the global uptake of organic farming. [ Paull John 2010 From France to the World: The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy 1 2 93–102 http://orgprints.org/18808/1/Paull2010IfoamJSRP.pdf ] [ Activities ] [ May 2012 ] The Soil Association carries out work certifying products as organic in the following areas: Organic farming Organic food processing Organic restaurants and catering Organic fisheries Organic textiles and leather Organic health and beauty The Soil Association played a leading role in the development of the Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS) and is a quarter owner of Global Standard GmbH. The GOTS standard was designed to make trading more efficient for operators and provide clarity for consumers on organic textiles. The Soil Association Certification has been certifying organic textile businesses to the GOTS standard since 2006. There are several other certification bodies now working to GOTS globally, with around 3000 businesses in 55 countries certified to GOTS. [ Campaigns ] The Association&apos;s campaign priorities are to promote organic food and farming, promote food security, and to lobby against genetic modification and use of antibiotics and pesticides. Many campaigns are led by reports produced by the policy department. Currently, the organisation is campaigning to save the honeybee and to promote community supported agriculture. [ Policy Reports ] The Soil Association&apos;s policy department carries out research and releases reports to further its aims. Recent major themes include: Climate-friendly farming Ten recent reports, including: &apos;An inconvenient truth about food - neither secure, nor resilient&apos; (2008) A report on Britain&apos;s food security summarising how UK food self-sufficiency has declined over the past decade and that there is no overall, future-proofed &apos;Food Plan for Britain&apos;. &apos;Organic works&apos; (2006) The world&apos;s first report examining employment on organic farms and how organic farming is providing more jobs through organic farming and local food supply. Welfare and wildlife Eight recent reports, including: &apos;MRSA in farm animals and meat&apos; (2007) This report focuses on a major new antibiotic-resistance problem in farming, which may have serious consequences for human health. In some countries MRSA has been found in a large number of farm animals and in retail meat. &apos;Batteries not included - organic farming and animal health&apos; (2003) This report looks at the major animal-welfare benefits provided by organic farms, and the opportunities to further improve welfare for organic farm animals. Health Ten recent reports, including: &apos;Georgie porgie pudding and pie&apos; (2008) The first detailed investigation into the state of food fed to young children attending nurseries in England and Wales. &apos;Not what the doctor ordered&apos; (2007) This report, sponsored by Organix, uncovers a glaring contradiction between the Government&apos;s policy on healthy eating and the dominance of junk food on sale in many hospitals and leisure facilities. &apos;A fresh approach to hospital food&apos; (2006) This report sets out the Cornwall Food Programme, which pioneers tasty, healthier and environmentally friendly hospital meals. &apos;The real meal deal&apos; (2006) This report from the Soil Association and Organix takes a look at what&apos;s on the menu for children at 10 popular family restaurant chains and 14 major visitor attractions. Genetic Modification Four recent reports, including: &apos;Telling porkies: The big fat lie about doubling food production&apos; (2010); This report challenges the claim that we need to increase global food production by 50% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. &apos;Land of the GM-free&apos; (2008) A briefing on the launch of a major new non-GM labelling initiative in the US, the latest on US farmers rejection of new GM crops, and the staggering collapse in the market for Monsanto&apos;s GM milk hormone. &apos;Silent invasion - the hidden use of GM crops in livestock feed&apos; (2007) An investigation into the use of GM animal feed which finds that large quantities are being used in the UK to produce our food. This means that most of the non-organic milk, other dairy products and pork sold in the UK is from GM-fed animals. [ Education ] The Soil Association also runs a number of schemes designed to educate people and reconnect them with the land and where their food comes from: &apos;The Food for Life Partnership&apos; www.foodforlife.org.uk is a £16.9m lottery-funded programme involving four charities - the Soil Association, Focus on Food Campaign, Health Education Trust and Garden Organic. It aims to transform school and community food culture across England by giving schools and communities access to seasonal, local and organic food and the skills they need to cook and grow fresh food for themselves; &apos;Organic Farm School&apos; is a series of over 300 hands-on courses in growing your own food, rearing animals, cooking and rural crafts; &apos;Organic Apprenticeship Scheme&apos; is a two-year course involving a work-based placement with an organic farmer or grower and eight structured seminars per year. [ Quality of food ] Soil Association standards { Soil Association organic standards online } are recognised to exceed statutory organic standards, such as those set by the European Union, and the UK government. Compassion In World Farming regards Soil Association standards to offer the best guarantee of high animal welfare standards in the UK. { http://www.ciwf.org.uk/what_we_do/pigs/state_of_eu_pigs/consumer_information.aspx } In July 2009 the Food Standards Agency published a report { http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2009/jul/organic Organic review published, accessed 13/09/09 } which concluded that there were &quot; no important differences in the nutrition content, or any additional health benefits, of organic food when compared with conventionally produced food. &quot; The Soil Association issued a statement { http://www.soilassociation.org/News/NewsItem/tabid/91/smid/463/ArticleID/97/reftab/57/t/Soil-Association-response-to-the-Food-Standards-Agency-s-Organic-Review/Default.aspx, Soil Association response to the Food Standards Agency&apos;s Organic Review, accessed 13/09/09 } criticising the report for not taking into account existing studies on the subject and noting reasons other than nutrition for consumers to choose organic food, such as environmental and animal welfare concerns. [ Farmers &amp; amp; Growers ] [ Standards ] Soil Association standards set strict benchmarks for organic food production, packaging, animal welfare, wildlife conservation, residues and additives in order to reassure the buying public over the quality of products labeled organic. Its standards often go beyond the ‘baseline’ legal requirements for organic farming in the EU, particularly for animal welfare and use of pesticides and fertilizers. Compassion In World Farming regards Soil Association standards to offer the best guarantee of high animal welfare standards in the UK. [ September 2011 ] Standards are regularly reviewed by independent committees and go through a rigorous consultation and approval process to ensure they are kept high, but attainable. The Soil Association also works at European and international levels to help achieve consistently high organic standards across all bodies and authorities. It is one of the first organic standard setting bodies to exclude nanomaterials from its organic production standards. { Paull, John (2011) &quot; Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming &quot;, Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of ISOFAR (International Society of Organic Agriculture Research), 28 September - 1 October, Namyangju, Korea., 2:96-99. } Standards cover: [ Agriculture standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Agriculture/tabid/250/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Aquaculture standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Aquaculture/tabid/251/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Ethical trade standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Ethicaltrade/tabid/252/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Food processing standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Foodprocessing/tabid/254/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Forestry standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Forestry/tabid/253/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Health products standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Healthproducts/tabid/255/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Horticulture standards committee http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Horticulture/tabid/256/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] [ Textiles standards &amp; trade group http://www.soilassociation.org/Whatwedo/Organicstandards/Standardscommittees/Textiles/tabid/257/Default.aspx Soil Association 27 October 2010 ] Agriculture Aquaculture Ethical Trade Food Processing Forestry Health &amp; Beauty products Horticulture Textiles [ Certification ] Soil Association Certification Ltd (SACL) is a not-for-profit subsidiary of the Soil Association charity, independently providing organic certification services and advisory support on all aspects of organic certification. SACL is one of ten approved organic certification bodies in the UK. SACL inspects and awards organic certification to over 4,500 farms and businesses around the world. It inspects each licensee at least once a year and carries out random, unannounced spot inspections and inspections in response to complaints or concerns. [ Business support ] The association provides general, legal, trading, marketing and training advice and support to existing businesses and those considering going organic. This includes tailored support for livestock, arable, horticulture, processing and forestry. The Soil Association has been at the forefront of establishing alternative routes to market for organic produce. Projects have included creating producer groups to optimise trade in conventional market systems, nurturing UK farmers’ markets and box schemes, promoting community-supported agriculture schemes and better public catering, and encouraging visits to a network of over 100 farms. The Soil Association provides a host of financial and economic information, including yearly [www.soilassociation.org/Businesses/Marketinformation/tabid/116/Default.aspx market reports] and monthly agricultural price data. It created Organic Marketplace, the UK’s largest searchable directory of organic livestock, feedstuff, forage and grazing, a free online service available to all. Data and organic action plans are available for each UK region. The Soil Association is a major supporter of the Organic Trade Board, a commercially-focused body, representing about 100 organic businesses and acting as an industry voice. The Soil Association complements the board by acting as the voice of the organic campaign movement.
