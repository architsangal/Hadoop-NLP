{ Portland, Oregon } A Hooverville was the popular name for shanty town s built by homeless people during the Great Depression. They were named after the President of the United States at the time, Herbert Hoover, because he allegedly let the nation slide into depression. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee. { Hans Kaltenborn, It Seems Like Yesterday (1956) p. 88 } [ Background ] Homelessness was present before the Great Depression, and hobo s and tramp s were common sights in the 1920s, but the economic downturn increased their numbers and concentrated them in urban settlements close to soup kitchen s run by charities. These settlements were often formed on empty land and generally consisted of tents and small shack s. Authorities did not officially recognize these Hoovervilles and occasionally removed the occupants for trespass ing on private lands, but they were frequently tolerated or ignored out of necessity. The New Deal enacted special relief programs aimed at the homeless under the Federal Transient Service (FTS), which operated from 1933-35. Some of the men who were forced to live in these conditions possessed construction skills and were able to build their houses out of stone. Most people, however, resorted to building their residences out of wood from crates, cardboard, scraps of metal, or whatever materials were available to them. They usually had a small stove, bedding and a couple of simple cooking implements. Most of these unemployed residents of the Hoovervilles used public charities or begged for food from those who had housing during this era. Democrats coined other terms, { John Morton Blum, The National Experience: A History of the United States Since 1865 (1993) p 678 } such as &quot; Hoover blanket &quot; (old newspaper used as blanketing) and &quot; Hoover flag &quot; (an empty pocket turned inside out). &quot; Hoover leather &quot; was cardboard used to line a shoe when the sole wore through. A &quot; Hoover wagon &quot; was an automobile with horses hitched to it because the owner could not afford fuel; in Canada, these were known as Bennett buggies, after the Prime Minister at the time. After 1940 the economy recovered, unemployment fell, and shanty eradication programs destroyed all the Hoovervilles. { Steven L.
