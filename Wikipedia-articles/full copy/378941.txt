Four species are currently recognized. The largest extant member of this group, B. constrictor, has been reported to grow to a maximum of 14 feet (4.3  m) in length. { Mehrtens JM. 1987.

[ Taxonomy ] Kluge (1991) moved the genera Sanzinia and Acrantophis into Boa, based on a phylogeny derived from morphological characters. { Kluge AG. 1991. Boine Snake Phylogeny and Research Cycles. Misc. Pub. Museum of Zoology, Univ. of Michigan No. 178. 58 pp. } However, it was later found that the Malagasy boids and Boa constrictor do not form a monophyletic group, so that the lumping of Sanzinia, Acrantophis and Boa were probably in error, and most recent authors have reverted to the use of Sanzinia and Acrantophis as the genus name for the Malagasy boas. { Vences, M., Glaw, F., Kosuch, J., Boehme, W., Veith, M.

Also, more than a few subspecies of B. constrictor are recognized, several of which have distinct common names.
