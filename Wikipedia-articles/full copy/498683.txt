Related to the nightjar s, they are nocturnal and are found in forest habitats. The plumage resembled that of dried leaves and the birds roost on branches, sitting still and appearing like a dry branch, making them extremely difficult to locate except. They however have favourite roosts that they use regularly unless disturbed. They have a distinctive call that is usually heard at dawn and dusk. The sexes differ slightly in plumage. [ Description ] Male facing right (female in background) Like all frogmouths, this [ 23 cm in ] long species has a wide and hooked bill with slit-like nostrils and the large head has the eyes facing forward to provide a wide field of binocular vision. Within the genus it has a somewhat small wing and is distinguished by the wing coverts ending in veltety black spots tipped in white.

Some males are browner and look more similar to females. The female is more rufous or chestnut brown. Indian specimens have black spots on the crown but Sri Lankan populations have no such markings.

Volume 2 249–250 Smithsonian Institution and Lynx Edicions Washington DC &amp; Barcelona ] Formerly considered monotypic, the Western Ghats population have been named as B. m. roonwali. This population has the males with a brownish-gray wing mirror and yellowish spots on the underside (gray or white in the nominate Sri Lankan form). Females have a bright reddish-brown wing mirror and are unspotted below.

Its habitat is dense tropical forest usually with dense undergrowth [ Sugathan, R 1981 A survey of the Ceylon Frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger) habitat in the Western Ghats of India J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 78 2 309–316 ] but sometimes found in more disturbed habitats including plantations.

Soc. 2006 103 1 100 ] [ Behaviour ] Frogmouths are rarely seen during the day except at roost sites or when flushed. They regularly use the same roost spots for months.

Soc. 91 3 454–455 ] When alarmed at their perch, they slowly move the head to point up their bill and can easily be mistaken for a jagged broken branch. They rely on their crypsis and will often allow close approach before flushing or will sometimes open their mouth wide in a threatening display. They are sometimes mobbed at their day roost by small songbirds. They are vocal at dusk, the call of the female being a loud screechy &quot; shkeerauuw &quot; which drops in loudness and ends is a series of hiccups. Another call is a series of rapid &quot; skwar-skwar-skwar &quot; which is produced by both males and females. The breeding season in southern India is January to April and February to March in Sri Lanka. The nest is a small pad made of moss lined with down and covered on the outside with lichen and bark. A single white egg is laid and the incubating bird covers it entirely and holds the tail flush with the tree to avoid breaking the outline and appears like a lichen covered snag. The male appears to incubate during the day. [ A Note on the Nesting of the Ceylon Frogmouth, Batrachostomus moniligerBlyth 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1947.tb04373.x Phillips, W. W.
