In 1802, all of what is now Portage County was organized under the name of Franklin Township with other townships being formed later. On February 10, 1807 the Ohio state legislature passed the act to create Portage County from Trumbull County and it took effect June 7, 1807. Portage County remained attached to Trumbull County until June 8, 1808, when the first elections were held. Initially, the county included a large area of the Western Reserve that encompassed most of present-day Summit County, all of Medina and Huron counties, and parts of Lorain and Ashland counties. There were six organized townships in 1808: Franklin, Deerfield, Aurora, Hiram, Springfield, and Hudson with new townships organized later, reaching a maximum of 30. The present-day boundaries of Portage County were established in 1840 following the 1812 creation of Medina County, a slight boundary adjustment in 1827 with Cuyahoga County, and finally the creation of Summit County in 1840, which took 10 townships from Portage County along with 3 townships from Medina County and two from Stark County. { Brown and Norris, p. 192–196 } [ Geography ] Gazebo at Towner&apos;s Woods Park in Franklin Township, part of the county park system Map of Portage County municipal and township labels Portage County courthouse in downtown Ravenna According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of [ 504.06 sqmi ], of which [ 487.38 sqmi ] (or 96.69%) is land and [ 16.68 sqmi ] (or 3.31%) is water.
