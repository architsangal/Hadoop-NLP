It tells the story of a police officer who infiltrates the triads, and a police officer secretly working for the same gang. The Chinese title means &quot; the non-stop way &quot;, a reference to Avici, the lowest level of hell in Buddhism. The English title is a word play combining the law enforcement term &quot; internal affairs &quot; with the adjective infernal. Due to its commercial and critical success, Infernal Affairs was followed by a prequel, Infernal Affairs II, and a sequel, Infernal Affairs III, both released in 2003, as well as a 2006 American remake by Martin Scorsese entitled The Departed. Pre-release publicity for Infernal Affairs focused on its star-studded cast ( Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Anthony Wong, Eric Tsang, Kelly Chen and Sammi Cheng ), but it later received critical acclaim for its original plot and its concise and swift storytelling style. The film did exceptionally well in Hong Kong, where it was considered &quot; a box office miracle &quot; and heralded as a revival of Hong Kong cinema which at the time was considered to be direly lacking in creativity. The film features all the members of the Hong Kong Cantopop group EO2, playing triad boss Hon Sam&apos;s men. One member of this group subsequently became a lead actor ( Osman Hung ). Miramax Films acquired the United States distribution rights of this film and gave it a limited U.S. theatrical release in 2004. The Infernal Affairs series was then remade { &quot; Infernal Affairs vs. the remake, The Departed &quot;. Film.com. Retrieved 23 July 2011. } by Martin Scorsese in 2006 as The Departed, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. [ Plot ] Infernal Affairs focuses on a police officer named Chan Wing-yan (Tony Leung), who goes undercover into a triad, and triad member Lau Kin-ming (Andy Lau), who infiltrates the police department. Each mole was planted by the rival organisation to gain an advantage in intelligence over the other side. The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with. The prologue opens with the introduction of triad boss Hon Sam (Eric Tsang), who sends a number of young gangsters to the police academy as moles, among whom include a young Lau (Edison Chen). Concurrently, a young Chan (Shawn Yue) joins the police force but is expelled from the academy even though he manages to impress Superintendent Wong Chi-shing and Principal Yip. In reality, Chan has become an undercover agent reporting directly only to Wong and Yip. Over time, Chan experiences great stress from work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department. The film begins with a meeting between Chan and Lau in a hi-fi store without either of them knowing the other&apos;s identity. Soon after, Chan attends the funeral of Yip, who had died recently, leaving Wong as the only person who can identify Chan as a cop. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chan using Morse code, but Lau alerted Hon, giving Hon enough time to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine, eliminating solid evidence of the drug deal. After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole in within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole. Later, Chan sees Hon conversing with Lau at a cinema but does not see Lau&apos;s face clearly. He attempts to follow Lau secretly as they leave, but loses his target when his phone rings suddenly at the crucial moment. By this time, both Chan and Lau are struggling with their double identities – Chan starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and he wants to erase his criminal background. When Chan meets Wong again on the same rooftop, Wong intends to pull Chan out of undercover work for fear of his safety. They are unaware that Lau has his subordinate, CIB Inspector B, and his team tracking him. Meanwhile, Hon sends Tsui Wai-keung, Del Piero, and a gang of henchmen to confront them after receiving intel from Lau. Inspector B informs Lau and sends an OCTB squad to save Wong. Chan flees from the building using a crane while Wong sacrifices himself to save Chan by distracting the thugs. Wong is recognised by the gangsters, who beat him up severely before throwing him off the roof. As the police close in, a shootout breaks out, resulting in three gangsters being killed, one of whom is Piero. In the aftermath of the gunfight, the OCTB squad arrives with Lau and Wong&apos;s second-in-command, Inspector Cheung, on the scene. Lau retrieves Wong&apos;s cellphone and contacts Chan, with both of them reaching an agreement to foil a drug deal by Hon. The plan succeeds and many of Hon&apos;s men are arrested, while Lau betrays Hon and kills him. Everything seems to have returned to normal – Chan can revert to his true identity as a cop, while Lau has erased his criminal connections by eliminating Hon&apos;s triad. However, back at the police station, Chan discovers that Lau was the mole and he leaves immediately. Lau, realising what has happened, erases Chan&apos;s records as a cop from the police database. Chan spends an evening with his therapist Lee (Kelly Chen), whom he was falling in love with. He sends to Lau a compact disc with a recording that Hon kept between himself and Lau, but the disc is inadvertently intercepted by Lau&apos;s girlfriend Mary (Sammi Cheng). Chan and Lau meet on the same rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau without resistance and hold his Glock 17 to Lau&apos;s head, as a rebuke to Lau&apos;s plea for forgiveness and request to remain as a cop. Inspector B arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan enters an elevator backwards while holding Lau as a hostage at gunpoint, but is suddenly shot in the head by Inspector B when he moved his head from behind Lau. Inspector B then reveals that he is also actually a mole planted by Hon. As they take the elevator down to the lobby, Lau kills B, most likely out of his desire to eradicate traces of his past and become a &quot; good guy &quot; cop and end the hunt for a mole. The original ending climaxes with Lau identifying himself to the police as one of them. Dr. Lee Sum-yee discovers Yip&apos;s records at the academy which reveals Chan as the undercover officer; B is given the blame of the mole and the case is closed. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral, with Cheung and Lee present as well. A flashback reaffirms the point that Lau wished he had taken a different route in life. In Mainland China, an alternate ending for the film was created. In this ending, Lau exits the elevator and is informed by Cheung that the police have found evidence that he was a mole. Lau hands them his badge and is arrested without protest. The sequel, Infernal Affairs III, uses the original ending instead of the alternate one.

The Departed was released on 6 October 2006 and went to critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Andy Lau, Eric Tsang and Jacky Cheung parodied the cinema scene to promote the Hong Kong Film Awards. Lau and Tsang, in their respective characters, go through the scene where they meet to gather info on the undercover cop amongst Hon Sam&apos;s gang. Lau Kin-ming asks Hon &quot; why do we always meet in a cinema? &quot; to which Hon answers &quot; It&apos;s quiet. No one comes to movies &quot;. Jacky Cheung comes out from the shadows behind them and says &quot; I don&apos;t know...quite a few people watch movies &quot; and we see a slew of Hong Kong celebrities watching various clips of Hong Kong films on the screen. Originally Tony Leung was going to appear but scheduling conflicts led to the recasting. Infernal Affairs was incorrectly called &quot; a Japanese film &quot; during the 79th Academy Awards, at which The Departed won four Oscars. No known apologies has been made on behalf of Warner Brothers or Academy Awards to Media Asia. { http://www.fortheretarded.com/?p=392 } The 2003 TVB spoof celebrating the Chinese New Year called Mo Ba To (吐氣羊眉賀新春之無霸道) and the 2004 comedy film Love is a many stupid thing (精裝追女仔2004) by Wong Jing were rewritings based on the plot of the film. In Taiwan SHODA (劉裕銘) and a secondary school student Blanka (布蘭卡) cut and rearranged the original film and inserted new sound tracks to produce their videos Infernal Affairs CD pro2 and Infernal Affairs iPod on the web. The videos had many views and both producers removed their videos after receiving cease and desist letters from the Group Power Workshop Limited (群體工作室), the Taiwan distributor of the film. { 陳俍任：電影「無間道」搞怪版始作俑者「CD-PRO2版」作者，接獲在台發行商的警告信，《聯合報》。2004-06-06 } Media Asia released a limited edition of 8 DVD set of the Infernal Affairs trilogy in an Ultimate Collectible Boxset (無間道終極珍藏DVD系列(8DVD套裝)) on 20 December 2004.
