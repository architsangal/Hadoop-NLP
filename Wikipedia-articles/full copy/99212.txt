A supervillain or supervillainess is a variant of the villain character type, commonly found in comic books, action movie s and science fiction in various media. They are sometimes used as foils to superhero es and other fictional hero es. Whereas superheroes often wield fantastic powers, the supervillain possesses commensurate powers and abilities so that he can present a daunting challenge to the hero. Even without actual physical mystical, superhuman or superalien powers, the supervillain often possesses a genius intellect that allows him to draft complex schemes or create fantastic devices. Another common trait is possession of considerable resources to help further his aims. Many supervillains share some typical characteristics of real world dictator s, mobster s, and terrorists and often have aspirations of world domination or universal leadership. { Bags and Boards: &quot; The Supervillain Book &quot; : A good tome on bad guys } [ May 2012 ] [ http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb%3Dget_topic%3Bf%3D36%3Bt%3D006131%3Bp%3D0 Eury &amp; Misiroglu On The Supervillain Book Comicon.Com 2012-05-09 ] Superheroes and supervillains often mirror each other in their powers, abilities, or origins. In some cases, the only difference between the two is that the hero uses his extraordinary powers to help others, while the villain uses his powers for selfish, destructive or ruthless purposes. [ Origins ] [ March 2007 ] The definition of a supervillain is a villain who can defeat other villains. By some definitions, the first supervillain was John Devil, a proto- Fantômas, created by Paul Féval, père in his eponymous 1860 novel, or Féval&apos;s nearly-immortal, machiavellian Colonel Bozzo-Corona, leader of Les Habits Noirs introduced in 1863. Professor Moriarty, the archenemy of Arthur Conan Doyle &apos;s detective Sherlock Holmes, was introduced in 1893. Dr. Fu Manchu, the antagonist of several popular novels of Sax Rohmer, is credited with popularizing many of the typical characteristics of the modern supervillain, including his sadistic personality, his desire for world domination, and his use of sinister lairs and themed crimes and henchmen. Rohmer&apos;s work had a strong influence on Ian Fleming, whose James Bond novels and their film adaptations further popularized the image in popular culture, like Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The first supervillain who wore a bizarre costume was the Lightning, from the 1938 film The Fighting Devil Dogs.The first supervillain to regularly battle a superhero was the Ultra-Humanite, who first appeared in Action Comics #13 (1939). In contrast to the super-strong Superman, he was a crippled and bald genius, and could be seen as one of the first examples of the evil genius archetype, due to his deformed body and baldness.
