[ March 2010 ] [ March 2010 ] [ Rex the Runt 300px The main characters. (Left to right)Vince, Wendy, Bad Bob and Rex Animated comedy 16:9 10 minutes (approx.) United Kingdom BBC Two 21 December 1998 16 December 2001 Richard Goleszowski see below 26 http://www.rextherunt.com/ ] Rex the Runt is an animated claymation television show produced by Aardman Animations for BBC Bristol in association with EVA Entertainment and Egmont Imagination. Its main characters are four plasticine dogs : Rex, Wendy, Bad Bob and Vince. The series began with a short, Ident, in 1989 directed by Richard Goleszowski. After a long gestation period this developed into two unaired shorts and then thirteen ten-minute episodes that first aired over two weeks on BBC2 from December 1998. A second thirteen episode series aired from September 2001 on the same channel. As well as the core cast guest voices included Paul Merton, Morwenna Banks, Judith Chalmers, Antoine de Caunes, Bob Holness, Bob Monkhouse, Jonathan Ross, Graham Norton, Arthur Smith, June Whitfield, Kathy Burke, Pam Ayres and Eddie Izzard. The animation is unusual in that the models are almost two-dimensional and are animated to exaggerate this - they are flattened in appearance and animated on a sheet of glass with the backgrounds behind the sheet. [ Main characters ] Rex, the protagonist â€” a timid, irritable runt. He is quick-witted and usually comes up with plans to get out of the scrapes the gang finds themselves in. His favourite superhero is Rocket Raymond. Bad Bob is a &quot; big, fat slob &quot;, interested in food and TV. His friends, and occasionally even himself, describe him as a &quot; Big, fat, jelly-wobbly, fat bast- &quot;, usually getting cut off towards the end. He is distinguishable by his eye patch, which changes from eye to eye, and often carries around a revolver almost the size of himself. However grumpy he might be, he is intelligent and loyal. Wendy is the only female housemate, distinguishable by her eyelashes, pink colour, noticeably hemispheric breasts, and wears a pink bow on her head. She is cynical, sarcastic, and fiercely independent. Wendy provides solutions to problems albeit in a distant or non-caring way. Vince is the pet of the household, although all four are dogs. He is distinguished by his prominent buckteeth and mismatched eyes. He speaks in single words or short disjointed phrases, his favorites being &quot; Tuesday &quot;, &quot; jam &quot;, and &quot; trousers &quot;. Vince suffers from Random Pavarotti Disease, causing him to randomly blurt out snatches of opera. While he appears to be unintelligent, he occasionally shows great ingenuity, for example by building an elaborate Heath Robinson machine designed to kill a mouse. Doctor Dogg is a medical doctor who does not live in the same house as the others. Moustachioed, complacent and greedy, he&apos;s an opportunistic money-grabber, whose habitual charge for any treatment is &quot; ten quid &quot; - regardless of whether the cure works or does more harm than good. He isn&apos;t above using the main characters in medical research. Arthur Dustcart, another semi-regular character, who first makes an appearance in the last episode of the first series, but appears quite frequently in the second. He is an ugly but experienced dustman, sporting sleepy mismatched eyes, a neckerchief, a pair of dirty underpants and a large nose with prominent nasal hair. Despite his grotesque appearance and smell, he and Wendy get on rather well, much to the annoyance of Rex. He becomes a friend of the household when he helps find Rex after he was turned into spaghetti. [ Other characters ] Many one-off characters in Rex The Runt are voiced by various well-known UK celebrities. These include: Mr Chittock Angry neighbour to Rex, after the gang went into his house and drank his beer. Voiced by Steven Frost, of &apos; Whose Line Is It Anyway? &apos; fame. Stinky Basil Smarmy French talent-spotter. Voiced by Antoine De Caunes, known best in the UK for presenting the Channel 4 late-night adult entertainment show &apos; Eurotrash &apos;. [ References to other Aardman productions ] Several episodes of Rex the Runt contain inside references to other television programmes created by Aardman Animations: In the episode &quot; Adventures on Telly Part I &quot;, Wallace (from the Wallace and Gromit series) is washing the windows on Rex&apos;s house, until Bad Bob pushes his ladder over (in the film A Close Shave, Wallace operates a window washing business). Pib and Pog, two of Aardman&apos;s lesser known creations, are present in the spectator gallery during the courtroom scene from &quot; The Trials of Wendy &quot; and are also present in the audience watching Rex&apos;s band in &quot; Stinky&apos;s Search for a Star &quot; In the episode &quot; Johnny Saveloy&apos;s Undoing &quot;, two of the jars containing the chemical essences of various stars are labelled &quot; Wallace &quot; and &quot; Gromit &quot;. Another jar on the top shelf reads &quot; Nick Park &quot;. The exorcist called upon in &quot; Patio &quot; is actually Morph, a character from an Aardman children&apos;s show, wearing a trench coat, hat, and large moustache. There are two references in the episode &quot; Wayne the Zebra &quot; : A Chicken Run -style chicken is rejected during the auditions (with Bad Bob making a comment regarding the recent popularity of chickens, referring to the film&apos;s success), and Bad Bob consults the Aardman book Cracking Animation (ISBN 0-500-28168-8, published in the US as Creating 3-D Animation). The episode entitled &quot; A Crap Day Out &quot; may be a pun on the Wallace and Gromit short film A Grand Day Out. Whereas Wallace and Gromit live on &quot; West Wallaby Street &quot;, it can be seen from the various post that arrives for the household that Rex and company live at &quot; 7, Marsupial Way, Rexford &quot; [ Episode list ] [ Series One ] Title Summary Airdate 1 Holiday in Vince The Runts try to cure Vince of his Random Pavarotti Disease (a Tourette syndrome -like singing of phrases of opera ) by miniaturising a submarine to go on a journey though Vince&apos;s brain. 21/12/1998 2 Stinky&apos;s Search for a Star The Runts enter a talent contest hoping to win enough money to pay the gas bill. 21/12/1998 3 Easter Island The Runts&apos; helicopter lands on Easter Island, where they meet visiting aliens who resemble the local statues. 22/12/1998 4 Too Many Dogs After Rex&apos;s house is stolen, the Runts go back in time to recover it, and meet parallel versions of themselves. 22/12/1998 5 The City Shrinkers The Runts win Birmingham in the lottery.
