[ History ] La Plagne was created in 1961, as with many resorts in the Alps, to save the valleys from becoming deserted. The agriculture and mining industries were in crisis, which led to young people leaving the valley in search of work. In 1960, four towns (Aime, Bellentre, Longefoy and Macôt) created an association to defend their interests, with an initiative of Dr. Borrionne, mayor of Aime. On 24 December 1961, La Plagne opened, with its two drag lift s and its four slopes. Emile Allais, great ski-champion, has helped La Plagne to grow. Immediately, La Plagne generated a great deal of success, and in 1966, Guy Lux, a French TV, presented &quot; Interneiges &quot;, a live competition between two French resorts. { Complete history of La Plagne (in French) www.PERSo-LAPLAGNE.fr } [ Eleven resorts ] [ Plagne Centre (1,970 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] The first of the resorts of La Plagne opened in December 1961. The name of &quot; Plagne Centre &quot; dates from 1982, before which the resort was before simply called La Plagne. Plagne Centre has an urban, but functional architecture, and was created by Michel Bezançon. Plagne Centre is a model of the &quot; station intégrée &quot;, where cars and skiers are separated [ Aime-La Plagne (2,100 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] Located in the commune of Aime, the building of Aime-La Plagne began in 1968, but the resort itself opened in December 1969. Called the &quot; Steamer of the snow &quot;, the main building (picture on the right) of Aime-La Plagne was created by Michel Bezançon. In 1990, the &quot; Club Med &quot; was built, with a design inspired by Tibet an temples. [ Champagny-en-Vanoise (1,250 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] Champagny in May 2005 At the end of the &apos;60s, this little village, located in the valley of Bozel, wanted to grow. The Vanoise National Park gave Champagny possibility to develop its summer activities. In 1969, Champagny became attached to the La Plagne resort, rather than to nearby Courchevel. Champagny is on a south-facing slope, unlike the other parts of La Plagne, meaning it gets more sunshine, therefore less snow. [ Montchavin (1,250 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] Montchavin in February 2003 Montchavin is found in the commune of Bellentre. There are 3 chairlifts serving the village of Montchavin, with one linking to Les Coches. [ Plagne Villages (2,050 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] Opened in 1972. [ Plagne Bellecôte (1,930 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] Plagne Bellecôte in February 2003 Created in 1974, this resort was in project since 1968. It was to be called &quot; Les Ours &quot;, but it is the summit of Bellecôte which gave its name to the new resort. Michel Bezançon drew the resort like a hydroelectric dam to close the valley. In 1975, a gondola linked Bellecôte with Roche de Mio, and three years later with the summit of Bellecôte, in 40 minutes. In December 2005, the first 8-seater chairlift in La Plagne (Arpette Chairlift) is built in Bellecôte. [ Les Coches (1,450 &amp; amp;nbsp;m) ] Opened in 1980.
