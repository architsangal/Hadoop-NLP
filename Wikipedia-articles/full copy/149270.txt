[ Hakim Joy A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz Oxford University Press 1995 New York 0-19-509514-6 ] [ History ] On March 23, 1942 Führer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall. After the St. Nazaire Raid, on April 13, 1942 Adolf Hitler ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended. Fortifications remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943 when defences were increased in other areas. { Kaufmann JE, Kaufmann HW: &quot; Fortress third Reich &quot;, page 196–197. DA Capo Press, 2003. } Organisation Todt, which had designed the Siegfried Line (Westwall) along the Franco -German border, was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the wall&apos;s major fortifications. Thousands of forced laborers were impressed to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts facing the English Channel. Early in 1944, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was assigned to improve the Wall&apos;s defences. Rommel believed the existing coastal fortification s were entirely inadequate and he immediately began strengthening them. Under his direction, a string of reinforced concrete pillbox es was built along the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine gun s, antitank guns and light artillery. Mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves and underwater obstacles and mine s were placed in waters just off shore.

By the time of the invasion, the Germans had laid almost six million mines in northern France. More gun emplacements and minefields extended inland, along roads leading away from the beaches. In likely landing spots for glider s and parachutists, the Germans emplaced slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called Rommelspargel ( &quot; Rommel&apos;s asparagus &quot; ). Low-lying river and estuarine areas were permanently flooded, as well. Rommel firmly believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped at the beach. Although the defensive wall was never completed the Wall&apos;s existence has served to explain away concerns of the Soviet Union for why the Second Front was not opened until June 6, 1944 (less than a year before the end of the war ). The Wall primarily consisted of batteries, bunker s, and minefields, which during 1942–1944, stretched from the French- Spanish border to Norway ( Festung Norwegen ). Many bunkers still exist, for example near Scheveningen, Den Haag, Katwijk and in Normandy. In Oostende, Belgium the public may visit a well-preserved part of the defences. That section consists of emplacements of the &quot; Saltzwedel neu battery &quot; and the &quot; Stützpunkt Bensberg &quot;, consisting of several men’s quarters and the necessary facilities. These constructions were used by a unit of German military engineers (Pionierstab) who were in charge of bunker construction. The Channel Islands were heavily fortified, particularly the island of Alderney which is closest to Britain. Hitler had decreed that 10% of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall go to the Channel Islands, because of the propaganda value of controlling British territory. [ November 2007 ] The Channel Islands were some of the most densley fortified areas in Europe with a host of Hohlgangsanlage tunnels, Casemates and Coastal artillery postitions. Mountbatten commented: &quot; Each island is a veritable fortress, the assault against which cannot be contemplated unless the defences are neutralised, or reduced to a very considerable extent by prior action. &quot; Despite the mooting of Operation Constellation et al., the Allies bypassed the islands and did not try to liberate them when they invaded Normandy. The islands&apos; German garrisons did not surrender until 9 May 1945 – one day after the German armed forces on the mainland. The German garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May. Walcheren Island was considered to be the &quot; strongest concentration of defences the Nazis had ever constructed. &quot; [ Williams Jeffery The Long Left Flank Leo Cooper London 1988 0-85052-880-1 ] [ Atlantic Wall commands ] The Atlantic Wall was not a single organisation except in the administration of its building. Militarily it was divided into eight commands: { Vanderweel.info } { 2012-01-26 } Norway Army Command Forces Commander in Danmark Deutschen Bucht Command Wehrmacht Netherlands Command Armee Oberkommando 15 (15th Army zone) Armee Oberkommando 7 (7th Army zone) Armee Oberkommando 1 (1st Army zone) Armee Oberkommando 19 (19th Army zone) [ Atlantic Wall fortresses ] Many major ports and positions were made part of the Atlantic Wall and received heavy fortifications. Hitler ordered them all to fight to the end { Whitaker, W.

Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarine after being surrounded by Allied forces. The defenders of these positions included Slavic soldiers and SS troops. { Kaufmann JE, Kaufmann HW: &quot; Fortress Third Reich &quot;, page 352.
