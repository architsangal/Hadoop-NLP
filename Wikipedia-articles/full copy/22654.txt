The Ohio class is a class of nuclear-powered submarines used by the United States Navy. The Navy has a total of 18 Ohio-class submarines: 14 nuclear-powered SSBN s ( fleet ballistic missile submarine s (FBM)), each armed with up to 24 Trident II SLBM s; they are also known as &quot; Trident &quot; submarines, and provide the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad of the U.S. strategic nuclear weapons arsenal Four nuclear-powered SSGNs ( cruise missile submarine s ), each capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles with either conventional or nuclear warheads, plus a complement of Harpoon missile s to be fired through their torpedo tube s The Ohio class is named after the lead submarine of this class, the [ Ohio SSGN-726 ] formerly designated SSBN-726. The 14 Trident II SSBNs together carry approximately fifty percent of the total American active inventory of strategic thermonuclear warheads. The exact number of warheads deployed in the oceans of the world varies in an unpredictable and classified manner, always at or below a maximum number set by various Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties. Although the Trident missiles have no preset targets when the submarines go on patrol, the warship s, when required, are capable of quickly being assigned targets by using secure and constant radio communications links at sea, including VLF systems. The Ohio-class submarines are the largest submarines ever built for the U.S. Navy. Two classes of Russian Navy submarines have larger total displacements: the Soviet -designed [ Typhoon submarine 2 ] s have more than twice the total displacements, and the Russian Federation &apos;s [ Borei submarine 2 ] s have roughly 25 percent greater displacements, but the Ohio-class warships carry more missiles and warheads than either of the other designs. The Ohio-class submarines were designed specifically for extended war-deterrence patrols. Each of these submarines are provided with two complete crews, called the Blue crew and the Gold crew, with each crew serving typically on 70 to 90 day deterrent patrols. To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment, three large logistics hatches have been installed to provide high-diameter resupply and repair access. These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets, equipment replacement modules, and machinery components, significantly reducing the time required for replenishment and maintenance of the submarines. The design of the Ohio class allows the warship to operate for about fifteen years between major overhauls. These submarines are reported to be as quiet at their cruising speed of [ 20 kn km/h mph ] or more than the previous Lafayette-class submarines were at [ 6 kn km/h mph ], although exact information remains classified. [ still needs cite even though from unclassified source October 2011 ] The Ohio-class submarines were constructed from sections of hull, with each four-deck section being [ 42 ft on ] in diameter. The sections were produced at the Quonset Point, Rhode Island facility of General Dynamics Electric Boat, and then assembled at their Groton, Connecticut shipyard. Fire control for their Mark 48 torpedo es is carried out by Mark 118 Mod 2 system, while the Missile Fire Control (MFC) system is a Mark 98. Except for the [ Henry M. Jackson SSBN-730 ], the Ohio class submarines are named for States of the United States. [ History ] The first eight Ohio-class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 submarine-launched ballistic missile s. Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine, the [ Tennessee SSBN-734 ], the remaining warships were equipped with the larger, three-stage Trident II D5 missile. The Trident II missile carries eight multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle s ( MIRV s ), in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy. Starting with the [ Alaska SSBN-732 ] in 2000, the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles. This task was completed in mid-2008. The first eight submarines had their home ports at Bangor, Washington, to replace the submarines carrying the Polaris A3 missile that were then being decommissioned. The remaining ten submarines originally had their home ports at Kings Bay, Georgia, replacing the Poseidon and Trident Backfit submarines of the Atlantic Fleet. During the conversion of the first four submarines to SSGNs (see below), five of the submarines, the [ Pennsylvania SSBN-735 2 ], [ Kentucky SSBN-737 2 ], [ Nebraska SSBN-739 2 ], [ Maine SSBN-741 2 ], and [ Louisiana SSBN-743 2 ], were transferred from Kings Bay to Bangor. Further transfers occur as the strategic weapons goals of the United States change. [ SSBN/SSGN conversions ] alt=Black submarine with orange paint from cheatline down in drydock at nightfall. After the end of the Cold War, plans called for [ Ohio SSBN-726 2 ] to be retired in 2002, followed by three of her sister boats. However, the Ohio, [ Michigan SSBN-727 2 ], [ Florida SSBN-728 2 ], and [ Georgia SSBN-729 2 ] instead were slated for modification, to remain in service carrying conventionally-armed guided missiles, and were designated as SSGN s. Beginning in 2002 through 2010, 22 of the 24 [ 88 in m ] diameter Trident missile tubes were modified to contain large vertical launch systems (VLS), one configuration of which may be a cluster of seven Tomahawk cruise missiles. In this configuration, the number of cruise missiles carried could be a maximum of 154, the equivalent of what is typically deployed in a surface battle group. Other payload possibilities include new generations of supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles, and Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (SLIRBM), [ http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/slirbm.htm Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile GlobalSecurity.org 2011-09-27 ] unmanned air vehicle s (UAVs), the ADM-160 MALD, sensors for anti-submarine warfare or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, countermine warfare payloads such as the AN/BLQ-11 Long Term Mine Reconnaissance System (LMRS), and the broaching universal buoyant launcher (BUBL) and stealthy affordable capsule system (SACS) specialized payload canisters. The missile tubes also have room for stowage canisters that can extend the forward deployment time for special forces. The other two Trident tubes are converted to swimmer lockout chambers. For special operations, the Advanced SEAL Delivery System and the Dry Deck Shelter can be mounted on the lockout chamber and the boat will be able to host up to 66 special operations sailors or Marines, such as Navy SEAL s, or MARSOC teams of the USMC. Improved communications equipment installed during the upgrade allows the SSGNs to serve as a forward-deployed, clandestine Small Combatant Joint Command Center. [ http://www.gdeb.com/news/ebnews/ebnews0206.pdf Electric Boat News General Dynamics Electric Boat February 2006 ] [ July 2011 ] On 26 September 2002, the Navy awarded the Electric Boat company a US$442.9 million contract to begin the first phase of the SSGN submarine conversion program. Those funds covered only the initial phase of conversion for the first two boats on the schedule. Advanced procurement was funded at $355 million in fiscal year 2002, $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and, through the five-year defense budget plan, at $936 million in FY 2004, $505 million in FY 2005, and $170 million in FY 2006. Thus, the total cost to refit the four boats is just under $700 million per vessel. In November 2002, the USS Ohio entered a drydock, beginning her 36-month refueling and missile conversion overhaul. Electric Boat announced on 9 January 2006 that the conversion had been completed. The converted Ohio rejoined the fleet in February 2006, followed by the USS Florida in April 2006. The converted USS Michigan was delivered in November 2006. The converted Ohio went to sea for the first time in October 2007. The Georgia returned to the fleet in March 2008 at Kings Bay.

[ http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/ssbn-x.htm Global Security information on Ohio class replacement 2011-09-27 ] The first of the current Ohio SSBNs are expected to be retired by 2029, meaning that a platform must already be seaworthy by that time. A replacement may cost over $4 billion per unit compared to Ohio s $2 billion. The Navy is exploring two options. The first is a variant of the [ Virginia submarine 0 ] nuclear attack submarines. The second is a dedicated SSBN, either with a new hull or based on an overhaul of the current Ohio. [ March 2010 ] Cross-section diagram of the submarines of the class With the cooperation of both Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding, in 2007 the Navy had already begun a cost control study. Then in December 2008 the Navy awarded Electric Boat a contract for the missile compartment design of the Ohio class replacement, worth up to $592 million. Newport News is expected to receive close to 4% of that project. Though the Navy has yet to confirm an Ohio class replacement program, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, as of April 2009, confirms that the Navy should begin such a program in 2010. The new vessel is scheduled to enter the design phase by 2014. It is anticipated that if a new hull design is used the program must be initiated by 2016 in order to meet the 2029 deadline. Rep. Gene Taylor of Mississippi had threatened to block the project unless the Navy shares with the Congress an internal Analysis of Alternatives.

The sinking of the fictional USS Montana is the inciting incident in James Cameron &apos;s 1989 film The Abyss. In Tom Clancy&apos;s novels, these missile submarines play important roles. For example, the fictional &apos;&apos;Akula&apos;&apos;-class submarine Admiral Lunin attacks the near the end of The Sum of All Fears. Also, in Debt of Honor, five Ohios of the U.S. Pacific fleet (specifically those named after battleships damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack) are used as attack submarines due to their availability from nuclear disarmament. One is also deployed as an Army special operations support platform.
