In his view, Judaism today is pluriform in nature: no longer is there an overarching authority which can determine correct belief and practice. As a consequence, the Jewish community has splintered into a variety of subgroups, ranging from the strictly Orthodox to the most liberal; in addition, some groups have syncretistically borrowed from other religious traditions.
