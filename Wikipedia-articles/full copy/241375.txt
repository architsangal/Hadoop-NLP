LaSalle, along with Windsor, is the oldest French settlement area in Southwestern Ontario, and the oldest continually inhabited Europe an settlement in Canada west of the Quebec border.

One of LaSalle&apos;s biggest events is the annual Strawberry Festival, which takes place on the first weekend in June. In LaSalle, most teenagers attend either Sandwich Secondary School or St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic Secondary School. The attendance to both is relatively close in numbers. LaSalle also has its own small but growing bicycle trail network, named the &quot; LaSalle Trail &quot;, which links up to neighbouring Windsor, Ontario &apos;s own &quot; Windsor Trail &quot; network, allowing people to ride from Sandwich Secondary School all the way to Windsor&apos;s Riverfront Trail. The town has also expressed interest and intentions to connect LaSalle (and indirectly, Windsor) to the Chrysler Canada Greenway by wanting to construct a link to the Trans-Canada Trail near Oldcastle, Ontario.
