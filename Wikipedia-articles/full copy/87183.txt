[ July 2011 ] [ July 2011 ] [ February 2011 ] [ Liberty X LibertyXAberUni.JPG Peforming in 2005 group_or_band London, England Vocals Pop, urban, R &amp; B, electronic 2001–2007, 2008 V2 (2001–2005), Virgin Records / Unique Corp (2005-2007) Michelle Heaton Tony Lundon Kevin Simm Jessica Taylor Kelli Young Sugababes Richard X Myleene Klass ] Liberty X (originally called Liberty) were a British pop vocal group formed by the five members who were eliminated from the final ten qualifiers of the 2001 season of the ITV show Popstars. The group consisted of Tony Lundon, Kevin Simm, Michelle Heaton, Kelli Young and Jessica Taylor. The group went on to achieve ten consecutive UK Top 20 singles, and various charting singles worldwide, leading to greater commercial success than the winners of the 2001 series, Hear&apos;Say. Liberty X disbanded in early 2007, but re-formed a year later in 2008, for a one-off appearance in Belfast, performing their greatest hits. [ History ] [ 2001–02: Popstars and Formation ] While the five winning contestants of Popstars formed Hear&apos;Say, the five runner-up contestants formed the group Liberty. The name Liberty was chosen to reflect the freedom the members experienced following their participation in Popstars. Amidst pejorative media commentary (including the term &quot; Flopstars &quot; ), the act proceeded to sign a multi-million-pound record contract with Richard Branson &apos;s independent record label, V2 records. [ April 2012 ] Shortly after forming, Liberty received a legal challenge in the UK High Court from a funk R &amp; B band, also called &quot; Liberty &quot;, who achieved success in the 1990s, including being awarded Capital Radio Band of the Year, playing Wembley Arena, European tours and the release of albums in the USA, Europe and UK. The original Liberty claimed that the newly-formed Liberty was taking advantage of the goodwill that had been created by the former&apos;s success (known in English law as the &quot; tort of passing off &quot; ). The final judgment was in favour of the funk R &amp; B band and the ex-Popstars then asked readers of UK tabloid newspaper, The Sun to suggest a new name. The winning name was &quot; X Liberty &quot;, [ November 2007 ] but the group used the entry as the basis for the official title, &quot; Liberty X &quot;. [ 2002–03: Thinking It Over ] The group&apos;s first two singles, &quot; Thinking It Over &quot; and &quot; Doin&apos; It &quot; (both released whilst the group were known as Liberty), were successful, with the former placing in 5th position on the UK Top 40 singles chart; the single&apos;s physical release featured remixes by the Wideboys and Boy George. The follow-up single, &quot; Doin&apos; It &quot;, released in December 2001, placed in 14th position on the UK Top 40 singles chart. Following a 5-month gap, in which the band was involved with the High Court dispute regarding its original name, the third single, &quot; Just a Little &quot; was released. That song reached the number one position on the UK charts and became the 9th best-selling single of 2002. &quot; Just a Little &quot; was also a chart success internationally, reaching the Top 5 and Top 10 music charts in several countries. The third single is the song Liberty X is best known for, both inside and outside the UK. [ April 2012 ] During the 5-month court case, the band recorded both &quot; Just a Little &quot; and the next single, &quot; Got to Have Your Love &quot; (the original third single, &quot; Wanting Me Tonight &quot; was cancelled during this period). The release of the fourth single was preceded by Liberty X&apos;s debut album, Thinking It Over (originally called &quot; To Those Who Wait &quot; ). The album placed at number 3 on the UK charts, eventually selling over 1 million copies worldwide. [ April 2012 ] Two further Top 5 singles were released from the album, the first being a cover of the 1990 track by electro funk group Mantronix, &quot; Got To Have Your Love &quot; (produced by UK Producer Rod Gammons ( Mark Morrison, Beverley Knight ). Mantronix&apos;s founding member, Kurtis Mantronik, remixed the Liberty X version for the single release which peaked at number 2 in the UK. The final Top 5 single to be taken from the album was &quot; Holding On for You &quot;, released in December 2002. The single debuted and peaked at number 5 before falling to number 14 the following week. [ April 2012 ] [ 2003–05: Being Somebody ] Following a short break, the group released &quot; Being Nobody &quot;, a mash-up of Chaka Khan &apos;s &quot; Ain&apos;t Nobody &quot; and The Human League &apos;s &quot; Being Boiled &quot;. The single was produced by Richard X and released under the name of &quot; Richard X &quot; vs Liberty X. The track followed the momentum caused by Richard X&apos;s other mainstream production, &quot; Freak Like Me &quot; for the Sugababes, which topped the charts the previous year. Both tracks featured on Richard X&apos;s album Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1. Despite the band&apos;s love for &quot; Freak Like Me &quot; the guys never thought of finding the mastermind behind the track, but they were approached by Richard X, who asked if they wanted to collaborate. The band had just finished a sell-out tour when the single was to be released. &quot; Being Nobody &quot; reached number three in the UK singles chart. Proceeding their second album, Being Somebody, the group released &quot; Jumpin &quot;, which managed to peak at number 6 and spent just 4 weeks on the UK Top 40 chart. &quot; Jumpin &quot; was co-written by UK singer-songwriter, Lucie Silvas and ms J Ugono. Being Somebody was released on 3 November 2003, debuting at number 12 on the UK album chart, but fell to number 27 the following week. The album sold around 200,000 copies, significantly lower than sales of their debut. The album received a lot of criticism from fans for containing too many emotional ballads, distancing themselves from their initial R &amp; B sound. The group released the albums final single &quot; Everybody Cries &quot; in January 2004. The music video saw the group walking along disused railway lines, which they were criticized for by safety organizations. The single missed the UK Top 10, reaching a disappointing number 13, and spent just 3 weeks on the UK Top 40. The group took a hiatus following record-label issues, and each member decided to work on different individual projects. Kevin Simm appeared on Channel 4 &apos;s The Games, competing in a series of sporting events (in which he placed second overall, behind Philip Olivier ). Michelle Heaton appeared on ITV &apos;s ill-fated Celebrity Wrestling. Jessica Taylor appeared on the ITV &apos;s Dancing on Ice. Tony Lundon and Kelli Young took the time to work on new tracks for the band&apos;s third album, whilst both contributing on other artists album in both producing and writing. Tony featured on D-Side &apos;s debut album, writing and featuring on a song entitled &quot; Fix You &quot; and Kelli collaborated with Billy Crawford on a track on his album Big City, called &quot; Go, Go &quot;. This track has now gone on to be sampled by Jamelia for a song that was not used for her latest album Walk With Me. During this period, The Sun newspaper reported that the group were to re-release Being Somebody, and was to feature a cover of the 1990 hit &quot; Back To Life &quot;, however this failed to materialise. They also released a cover version of the Kool &amp; The Gang song &quot; Fresh &quot; which was released in a selection of European countries, but not the United Kingdom. It peaked at number 35 on the French music charts. [ 2005–06: X and split speculations ] In mid-2005 it was announced that Liberty X had left V2 Records, and had signed to independent label Unique Corp records. Their third album was announced as being titled [[X (Liberty X album)| &quot; X &quot; ] to be released in October 2005. The first single, &quot; Song 4 Lovers &quot; however, had been recorded when they were signed to V2 Records back in 2004. They re-recorded it because V2 never saw the fit for them and the song. It was finally released in September 2005, and it features Rev Run of Run DMC, who also co-wrote the track. The single was well-received, achieving a large amount of airplay on British music channels, as well as radio. During its first week of release, midweek figures showed that the single was to debut at either number 2 or 3, but finished the week at number 5, their first Top 10 hit in nearly two years in the United Kingdom. It spent 4 consecutive weeks inside the Top 10. The video for the song, directed by Bill Schacht for Aestheticom, reached broadcast airplay chart positions of #2 Box UK and #4 MTV UK, as well as heavy rotation on other music channels. Their third album, X was released in October 2005, but to a lukewarm reception, despite the top 5 success of the single which preceded the album. It peaked at number 27, leaving the top 40 after just one week. People were unimpressed with the content of the album, as it contained four previous singles ( &quot; Just a Little &quot;, &quot; Got to Have Your Love &quot;, &quot; Being Nobody &quot; and &quot; Holding On for You &quot; ), plus the current single ( &quot; Song 4 Lovers &quot; ), and a track ( &quot; Yo DJ &quot; ) which was the latter&apos;s B-side. X went on to sell just 10,000 copies in the UK, and saw a limited release around the world. In late October, following the top 5 success of their single, the group announced they had been asked to record the official 2005 Children in Need single, so they teamed up with producer Rod Gammons again to record &quot; A Night to Remember &quot;, a cover of the Shalamar classic, backed with another disco/soul classic, &quot; Everybody Dance &quot;. The group performed both singles live on the night, 18 November 2005. The double A-side single entered and peaked at number 6 in the official British singles chart; it also peaked at number 16 in France, their biggest hit there since &quot; Just a Little &quot;. Liberty X at Aberystwyth University May Ball 2006 On 7 May 2006, the band were featured in the line up of Aberystwyth University May ball, alongside Chesney Hawkes and BodyRockers. However their set was cut short when a smoke bomb was set off during the first two minutes, filling the room with smoke. Firefighters gave the all-clear after 50 minutes, but Liberty X failed to reappear. Students were told the band were not returning to finish their set, met by jeers from the crowd, as students had paid £37 for the evening. { Smoke alert ruins Liberty X show http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/4750529.stm } Liberty X returned in June 2006, with a slightly remixed new single &quot; X &quot;. The song was a fan favourite, but due to a lack of promotion and lack of airplay, the song failed to hit the Top 40, peaking at a low number 47. The re-release of the album, which contained the new version of &quot; X &quot; and &quot; A Night to Remember &quot; which was planned, still went ahead but failed to attract attention. &quot; X &quot; also peaked at number 89 in France, their second-lowest chart-placing there, just ahead of &quot; Holding On for You &quot; which reached number 109. Despite rumours of splitting, members leaving and being dropped by their label, Liberty X announced in 2006 that they were still together, but each doing separate things. Michelle posted on the group&apos;s official site, stating they were still together and would be releasing a new single in the new year (of 2007) with a song from a forthcoming film. However, this failed to materialise. Michelle Heaton since then has married her lover of four years, Andy Scott-Lee who is best known for making the final seven in the second series of Pop Idol (although now they are separated). Jessica Taylor got engaged to cricket star Kevin Pietersen, while Kevin Simm has appeared on Channel 4 &apos;s The Games : Champion of Champions (competing for his team), and Tony Lundon was busy writing tracks for what would have been the band&apos;s fourth album. [ 2007–08: Split and one-off appearances ] On 20 May 2007, Liberty X posted a message on their website, noting they would no longer record together after the tour. They said, &quot; We want to let the fans know that Liberty X won&apos;t be doing any more recording together &quot;. [ All of us have separate projects we&apos;re working on and are excited about. We&apos;re still the best of friends and we&apos;ll still be doing all the dates on the current club tour. Also, we still intend to come together sometimes as Liberty X, for one-off events. &quot; ] The group performed their last gig on 2 September 2007, alongside Liz McClarnon, Lisa Scott-Lee and Stonefoxx at the Wiltshire Crime Stoppers charity event held in the grounds of Bowood House, near Chippenham in Wiltshire. The Wiltshire Times newspaper was granted the last-ever on-camera interview with the five band members, before they took to the stage. Footage of their performance and the interview is featured on its website. The band reunited in August 2008 to play at Belfast &apos;s gay-pride celebrations, singing their main hits, the first time they had been on stage together in over a year. [ August 2008 ] [ Solo careers ] Michelle Heaton has been on several reality shows, one of them being Come Dine With Me in 2009, alongside ex-rival boy-band member Lee Ryan. She appeared in the sixth series of &apos;&apos;Celebrity Big Brother&apos;&apos; in 2009, where she was the third celebrity to be evicted. Heaton has appeared frequently in best friend Katie Price&apos;s TV shows on ITV2. In July 2010, she married for the second time to her partner of 2 years, Hugh Hanley. In July 2011 it was announced that Michelle was expecting the couple&apos;s first child. On 12 January 2012, Heaton gave birth to Faith Michelle Hanley. Tony Lundon has presented the &quot; TOAST &quot; quiz series on &apos;&apos;The Den&apos;&apos; on Irish Television Network RTÉ Two on Sunday mornings. Kevin Simm, focusing on his solo career, created his own Myspace music profile, uploading demo tracks for his fans to hear his progress as a solo artist. In a March 2008 interview with Gordon McCully, he stated, &quot; I&apos;ve been very busy in the studio recording new solo tracks which I&apos;ll hopefully be able to share with people very soon. &quot; Simm has signed to JamDown Music, where his track &quot; Brand New &quot; is featured on their official website&apos;s music player. On 3 October 2008, Kevin&apos;s debut album, titled Brand New, was released in Japan. The album has since appeared for purchase on iTunes.
