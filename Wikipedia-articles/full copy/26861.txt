[ Shaman ] { Nicolaes Witsen, who authored an account of his travels among Samoyedic- and Tungusic-speaking peoples in 1692. Witsen labelled the illustration as a &quot; Priest of the Devil &quot; and gave this figure clawed feet to highlight what Witsen perceived as demonic qualities. } { Hutton 2001. p. 32. } Shamanism ( [ icon ˈ ʃ ɑː m ə n ] [ SHAH mən ] or [ ˈ ʃ eɪ m ə n ] [ SHAY mən ] ) is a term used in a variety of anthropological, historical and popular contexts to refer to certain magico-religious practices that involve a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to encounter and interact with the spirit world. { Hoppál 1987. p. 76. } A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing. { Oxford Dictionary Online. } The exact definition and use of the term &quot; shamanism &quot; has been highly debated by scholars, with no clear consensus on the issue. The term &quot; shamanism &quot; originates from the Tungusic languages of eastern Siberia, and was originally used by western scholars to describe the practices of certain types of magico-religious specialist within Central and Northern Asia. Upon learning more about religious traditions across the world, western scholars also used the term &quot; shamanism &quot; in reference to similar magico-religious practices found within the indigenous religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. Various historians have argued that shamanism also played a role in many of the pre-Christian religions of Europe, and that shamanistic elements may have survived in popular culture right through to the Early Modern period. Various archaeologists and historians of religion have also suggested that shamanism may have been a dominant religious practice for humanity during the Palaeolithic. Mircea Eliade writes, &quot; A first definition of this complex phenomenon, and perhaps the least hazardous, will be: shamanism = &quot; technique of religious ecstasy &quot;. { Mircea Eliade, Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstacy, Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7. } Shamanism encompasses the belief that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment. Shamanic beliefs and practices have attracted the interest of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, religious studies scholars and psychologists. Hundreds of books and academic paper s on the subject have been produced, with a peer-reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanisms. In the 20th century, many westerners involved in the counter-cultural movement adopted magico-religious practices influenced by indigenous shamanisms from across the world, creating the Neoshamanic movement. [ Terminology ] [ Etymology ] The word &quot; shaman &quot; is based upon the Tungusic word &quot; šamán &quot;, which was used to refer to certain magico-religious specialists by the Tungusic-speakers of eastern Siberia. { Eliade 2004 [1951 ]. p. 04. } The Tungusic term was subsequently adopted by Russians interacting with the indigenous peoples in Siberia, first appearing in print in 1672, in the published memoirs of the exiled Russian churchman Avvakum. { Hutton 2001. p. vii. } This word was then introduced to the English-speaking world by the Dutch traveler Nicolaes Witsen in his 1692 book Noord en Oost Tataryen, which detailed his travels among the Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking indigenous peoples of Siberia. { Hutton 2001. p. 32. } [ Definitions ] There is no single agreed upon definition for the word &quot; shamanism &quot; among anthropologists. The English historian Ronald Hutton noted that by the dawn of the 21st century, there were four separate definitions of the term which appeared to be in use. The first of these uses the term to refer to &quot; anybody who contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness. &quot; The second definition limits the term to refer to those who contact a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness at the behest of others. The third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magico-religious specialists who are believed to contact spirits, such as &quot; mediums &quot;, &quot; witch doctor s &quot;, &quot; spiritual healers &quot; or &quot; prophets &quot;, by claiming that they undertake a particular technique not used by the others. Problematically, scholars advocating this position have failed to agree on what this defining technique should be. The fourth definition identified by Hutton uses &quot; shamanism &quot; to refer to the indigenous religions of Siberia and neighbouring parts of Asia. { Hutton 2001. pp. vii –viii. } { Khakas ethnicity. } [ Invalid length. ] { pp. 77, 287; } [ Znamensky Andrei A. Az ősiség szépsége: altáji török sámánok a szibériai regionális gondolkodásban (1860–1920) 117–134 Molnár, Ádám Csodaszarvas. Őstörténet, vallás és néphagyomány. Vol. I Molnár Kiadó Budapest 2005 963-218-200-6 Hungarian ] {, p. 128 } [ Initiation and learning ] Shamans are normally &quot; called &quot; by dreams or signs which require lengthy training, however, shamanic powers may be inherited. Turner and colleagues { Turner et al., page 440 } mention a phenomenon called shamanistic initiatory crisis. A rite of passage for shamans-to-be, commonly involving physical illness and/or psychological crisis. The significant role of initiatory illnesses in the calling of a shaman can be found in the detailed case history of Chuonnasuan, the last master shaman among the Tungus peoples in Northeast China. { Noll &amp; Shi 2004 (see online ) } The wounded healer is an archetype for a shamanizing journey. This process is important to the young shaman. S/he undergoes a type of sickness that pushes her or him to the brink of death. This happens for two reasons: [ Halifax Joan Joan Halifax Shaman: The Wounder Healer Thames &amp; Hudson 1982 London 9780500810293 8800269 ] The shaman crosses over to the under world. This happens so the shaman can venture to its depths to bring back vital information for the sick, and the tribe. The shaman must become sick to understand sickness. When the shaman overcomes her or his own sickness s/he will hold the cure to heal all that suffer. This is the uncanny mark of the wounded healer. [ Roles ] { Nez Perce medicine man, performing his mysteries over a dying man, 1832 by } { George Catlin, } { Smithsonian American Art Museum. } The shaman&apos;s social role is usually defined by the obligations, actions and responsibilities expected of them within their individual cultures. { South Moluccan Shaman exorcising evil spirits occupying children, } { Buru. 1920. } Shamans gain knowledge and the power to heal by entering into the spiritual world or dimension. Most shamans have dreams or visions that tell them certain things. The shaman may have or acquire many spirit guides, who often guide and direct the shaman in his/her travels in the spirit world. These spirit guides are always present within the shaman though others only encounter them when the shaman is in a trance. The spirit guide energizes the shaman, enabling him/her to enter the spiritual dimension. The shaman heals within the spiritual dimension by returning &apos;lost&apos; parts of the human soul from wherever they have gone. The shaman also cleanses excess negative energies which confuse or pollute the soul. [ August 2009 ] Shamans act as mediators in their culture. { Hoppál 2005: 45 } { Boglár 2001: 24 } The shaman communicates with the spirits on behalf of the community, including the spirits of the deceased. The shaman communicates with both living and dead to alleviate unrest, unsettled issues, and to deliver gifts to the spirits. Shamans assist in soul retrieval. In shamanism it is believed that part of the human soul is free to leave the body. The soul is the axis mundi, the center of the shamanic healing arts. Shamans change their state of consciousness allowing their free soul to travel and retrieve ancient wisdom and lost power. [ May 2012 ] Because a portion of the soul is free to leave the body it will do so when dreaming, or it will leave the body to protect itself from potentially damaging situations, be they emotional or physical. In situations of trauma the soul piece may not return to the body on its own, and a shaman must intervene and return the soul essence. [ May 2012 ] Among the Selkups, the sea duck is a spirit animal because ducks fly in the air and dive in the water. Thus ducks belong to both the upper world and the world below. { Hoppál 2005: 94 } Among other Siberian peoples these characteristics are attributed to water fowl in general. { Vitebsky 1996: 46 } Among many Native Americans, the jaguar is a spirit animal because jaguars walk on earth, swim in water, and climb in trees. Thus jaguars belong to all three worlds, Sky, Earth, and Underworld. Shamans perform a variety of functions depending upon their respective cultures; { Hoppál 2005: 25 } healing, [ Sem Tatyana http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/changing/journey/healing.html Shamanic Healing Rituals Russian Museum of Ethnography ] { Hoppál 2005: 27–28 } leading a sacrifice, { Hoppál 2005: 28–33 } preserving the tradition by storytelling and songs, { Hoppál 2005: 37 } fortune-telling, { Hoppál 2005: 34–35 } and acting as a psychopomp (literal meaning, &quot; guide of souls &quot; ). { Hoppál 2005: 36 } A single shaman may fulfill several of these functions. The functions of a shaman may include either guiding to their proper abode the souls of the dead (which may be guided either one-at-a-time or in a cumulative group, depending on culture), and/or curing (healing) of ailments. The ailments may be either purely physical afflictions—such as disease, which may be cured by gifting, flattering, threatening, or wrestling the disease-spirit (sometimes trying all these, sequentially), and which may be completed by displaying a supposedly extracted token of the disease-spirit (displaying this, even if &quot; fraudulent &quot;, is supposed to impress the disease-spirit that it has been, or is in the process of being, defeated, so that it will retreat and stay out of the patient&apos;s body) --, or else mental (including psychosomatic) afflictions—such as persistent terror (on account of a frightening experience), which may be likewise cured by similar methods. Usually in most languages a different term other than the one translated &quot; shaman &quot; is applied to a religious official leading sacrificial rites ( &quot; priest &quot; ), or to a raconteur ( &quot; sage &quot; ) of traditional lore; there may be more of an overlap in functions (with that of a shaman), however, in the case of an interpreter of omens or of dreams. There are distinct types of shaman who perform more specialized functions. For example, among the Nani people, a distinct kind of shaman acts as a psychopomp. { Hoppál 2005:36164 } Other specialized shamans may be distinguished according to the type of spirits, or realms of the spirit world, with which the shaman most commonly interacts. These roles vary among the Nenets, Enets, and Selkup shaman (paper; { Hoppál 2005:87–95 } online { Czaplicka 1914 } ). Among the Huichol, [ http://www.kirasalak.com/Peyote.html Lost souls of the Peyote Trail Salak Kira National Geographic Adventure ] there are two categories of shaman. This demonstrates the differences among shamans within a single tribe. Among the Hmong people, the shaman or the Ntxiv Neej (Tee-Neng), acts as healer. The Ntxiv Neej also performs rituals/ceremonies designed to call the soul back from its many travels to the physical human body. A Ntxiv Neej may use several shamanistic tools such as swords, divinity horns, a gong (drum), or finger bells/jingles. All tools serve to protect the spirits from the eyes of the unknown, thus enabling the Ntxiv Neej to deliver souls back to their proper owner. The Ntxiv Neej may wear a white, red, or black veil to disguise the soul from its attackers in the spiritual dimension. Boundaries between the shaman and laity are not always clearly defined. Among the Barasana of Brazil, there is no absolute difference between those men recognized as shamans and those who are not [ May 2012 ]. At the lowest level, most adult men have abilities as shamans and will carry out the same functions as those men who have a widespread reputation for their powers and knowledge. The Barasana shaman knows more myth s and understands their meaning better, nonetheless the majority of adult men also know many myths. { Stephen Hugh-Jones 1980: 32 } Among Eskimo peoples the laity have experiences which are commonly attributed to the shamans of those Eskimo groups. Daydream, reverie, and trance are not restricted to shamans. Control over helping spirits is the primary characteristic attributed to shamans. The laity usually employ amulet s, spells, formulas, songs. { Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 8–10 } Among the Greenland Inuit, the laity have greater capacity to relate with spiritual beings. These people are often apprentice shamans who failed to complete their initiations. The assistant of an Oroqen shaman (called jardalanin, or &quot; second spirit &quot; ) knows many things about the associated beliefs. He or she accompanies the rituals and interprets the behavior of the shaman. { Noll &amp; Shi 2004 : 10, footnote 10 (see online ) } Despite these functions, the jardalanin is not a shaman. For this interpretative assistant, it would be unwelcome to fall into trance. { Noll &amp; Shi 2004 : 8–9 (see online ) } [ Gender and sexuality ] Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest known shamans—dating to the Upper Paleolithic era in what is now the Czech Republic —were women. { Tedlock, Barbara. 2005. The Woman in the Shaman&apos;s Body: Reclaiming the Feminine in Religion and Medicine. New York: Bantam. } Shamans may exhibit a two-spirit identity, assuming the dress, attributes, role or function of the opposite sex, gender fluidity and/or same-sex sexual orientation. This practice is common, and found among the Chukchi, Sea Dayak, Patagonians, Araucanians, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Navajo, Pawnee, Lakota, and Ute, as well as many other Native American tribes. Indeed, these two-spirited shamans were so widespread as to suggest a very ancient origin of the practice. See, for example, Joseph Campbell &apos;s map in his The Historical Atlas of World Mythology [Vol I: The Way of the Animal Powers: Part 2: p.  174] Such two-spirit shamans are thought to be especially powerful, and Shamanism so important to ancestral populations that it may have contributed to the maintenance of genes for transgendered individuals in breeding populations over evolutionary time through the mechanism of &quot; kin selection &quot;. [see final chapter of E.O. Wilson&apos;s &quot; Sociobiology: The New Synthesis] They are highly respected and sought out in their tribes, as they will bring high status to their mates. Duality and bisexuality are also found in the shamans of Burkina Faso (Africa). References to this can be found in several works of Malidoma Somé, a writer who was born and initiated there. [ Ecological aspect ] Resources for human consumption are easily depletable in tropical rainforests. Among the Tucano people, a sophisticated system exists for environmental resources management and for avoiding resource depletion through overhunting. This system is conceptualized mythologically and symbolically by the belief that breaking hunting restrictions may cause illness. As the primary teacher of tribal symbolism, the shaman may have a leading role in this ecological management, actively restricting hunting and fishing. The shaman is able to &quot; release &quot; game animals, or their souls, from their hidden abodes. { Reichel-Dolmatoff 1997 } { Vitebsky 1996:107 } The Piaroa people have ecological concerns related to shamanism. Among the Eskimo, shamans fetch the souls of game from remote places, { Merkur 1985: 5 } { Vitebsky 1996:108 } or soul travel to ask for game from mythological beings like the Sea Woman. { Kleivan &amp; Sonne: 27–28 } [ Economics ] The way shamans get sustenance and take part in everyday life varies among cultures. In many Inuit groups, they provide services for the community and get a &quot; due payment &quot; (cultures [ February 2012 ] believe the payment is given to the helping spirits ), but these goods are only &quot; welcome addenda. &quot; They are not enough to enable shamanizing as a full-time activity. Shamans live like any other member of the group, as hunter or housewife. { Merkur 1985: 3 } { Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 24 } [ Beliefs ] There are many variations of shamanism throughout the world, but several common beliefs are shared by all forms of shamanism. Common beliefs identified by Eliade (1972) are the following: Spirits exist and they play important roles both in individual lives and in human society. The shaman can communicate with the spirit world. Spirits can be benevolent or malevolent. The shaman can treat sickness caused by malevolent spirits. The shaman can employ trance inducing techniques to incite visionary ecstasy and go on vision quest s. The shaman&apos;s spirit can leave the body to enter the supernatural world to search for answers. The shaman evokes animal images as spirit guides, omen s, and message-bearers. The shaman can tell the future, scry, throw bones/ runes, and perform other varied forms of divination Shamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits which affect the lives of the living. [ http://www.kirasalak.com/Peru.html Hell and Back Salak Kira National Geographic Adventure ] Although the causes of disease lie in the spiritual realm, inspired by malicious spirits or witchcraft, both spiritual and physical methods are used to heal. Commonly, a shaman &quot; enters the body &quot; of the patient to confront the spiritual infirmity and heals by banishing the infectious spirit. Many shamans have expert knowledge of medicinal plants native to their area, and an herbal treatment is often prescribed. In many places shamans learn directly from the plants, harnessing their effects and healing properties, after obtaining permission from the indwelling or patron spirits. In the Peruvian Amazon Basin, shamans and curandero s use medicine songs called icaro s to evoke spirits. Before a spirit can be summoned it must teach the shaman its song. The use of totem ic items such as rocks with special powers and an animating spirit is common. Such practices are presumably very ancient. Plato wrote in his Phaedrus that the &quot; first prophecies were the words of an oak &quot;, and that those who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to &quot; listen to an oak or a stone, so long as it was telling the truth &quot;. Belief in witchcraft and sorcery, known as brujería in Latin America, exists in many societies. These distinguish shamans who cure from sorcerer s who harm. Other societies assert all shamans have the power to both cure and kill. Shamanic knowledge usually enjoys great power and prestige in the community, [ August 2009 ] but it may also be regarded suspiciously or fearfully as potentially harmful to others. By engaging in their work, a shaman is exposed to significant personal risk, from the spirit world, from enemy shamans, or from the means employed to alter the shaman&apos;s state of consciousness. Shamanic plant materials can be toxic or fatal if misused. Failure to return from an out-of-body journey can lead to death [ May 2012 ]. Spell s are commonly used to protect against these dangers, and the use of more dangerous plants is often very highly ritualized. [ Soul and spirit concepts ] The variety of functions described above may seem like distinct tasks, but they may be united by underlying soul and spirit concepts. Soul This concept can generally explain more, seemingly unassociated phenomena in shamanism: Merkur 1985 : 4 Vitebsky 1996 : 11, 12–14, 107 Hoppál 2005 :27, 30, 36 Healing This concept may be based closely on the soul concepts of the belief system of the people served by the shaman (online ). It may consist of retrieving the lost soul of the ill person. Hoppál 2005: 27 See also the soul dualism concept. Scarcity of hunted game This problem can be solved by &quot; releasing &quot; the souls of the animals from their hidden abodes. Besides that, many taboo s may prescribe the behavior of people towards game, so that the souls of the animals do not feel angry or hurt, or the pleased soul of the already killed prey can tell the other, still living animals, that they can allow themselves to be caught and killed. Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 7, 19–21 Gabus, Jean: A karibu eszkimók. Gondolat Kiadó, Budapest, 1970. (Hungarian translation of the original: Vie et coutumes des Esquimaux Caribous, Libraire Payot Lausanne, 1944.) It describes the life of Caribou Eskimo groups. For the ecological aspects of shamanistic practice, and related beliefs, see below. Infertility of women This problem can be cured by obtaining the soul of the expected child. Spirit s Beliefs related to spirit s can explain many different phenomena. Hoppál 2007c : 18 For example, the importance of storytelling, or acting as a singer, can be understood better if we examine the whole belief system. A person who can memorize long texts or songs, and play an instrument, may be regarded as the beneficiary of contact with the spirits (eg. Khanty people ). Hoppál 2005: 99 [ Practice ] Generally, the shaman traverses the axis mundi and enters the spirit world by effecting a transition of consciousness, entering into an ecstatic trance, either autohypnotically or through the use of entheogen s. The methods employed are diverse, and are often used together. Methods for effecting such trances are: Psilocybin mushrooms &apos;&apos; Cannabis Tobacco San Pedro cactus Peyote Ayahuasca Cedar Datura Deadly nightshade Fly agaric Iboga Morning glory Sage Salvia divinorum Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Dancing Singing Music Icaro s / Medicine Songs Vigil s Fasting Sweat lodge Vision quests Mariri Swordfighting / Bladesmithing Plants (often psychoactive ) Other Shamans will often observe dietary or customary restrictions particular to their tradition. These restrictions are more than just cultural. For example, the diet followed by shamans and apprentices prior to participating in an ayahuasca ceremony includes foods rich in tryptophan (a biosynthetic precursor to serotonin ) as well as avoiding foods rich in tyramine, which could induce hypertensive crisis if ingested with MAOI s such as are found in ayahuasca brews. [ Music, songs ] [ Shamanic music Imitation of sounds in shamanism ] Just like shamanism itself, music and songs related to it in various cultures are diverse, far from being alike. In several instances, songs related to shamanism are intended to imitate natural sounds, via onomatopoeia. { Hoppál 2006c: 143 } Sound mimesis in various cultures may serve other functions not necessarily related to shamanism: practical goals as luring game in the hunt; or entertainment ( Inuit throat singing ). { Nattiez: 5 } { Deschênes 2002 } [ Paraphernalia ] Shamans may have various kinds of paraphernalia in different cultures. { Goldes shaman priest in his regalia } { drum with a three-world cosmology. } [ http://www.neweurasia.net/cross-regional-and-blogosphere/in-the-beginning-was-tengri-part-1-grace-is-the-heart-of-belief/ In the Beginning was Tengri, Part 1 H.B.

Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 25 The beating of the drum allows the shaman to achieve an altered state of consciousness or to travel on a journey between the physical and spiritual worlds. Maxfield, Melinda. &quot; The journey of the drum. &quot; ReVision 16.4 (1994): 157. Much fascination surrounds the role that the acoustics of the drum play to the shaman. Shaman drums are generally constructed of an animal-skin stretched over a bent wooden hoop, with a handle across the hoop. Feathers – In numerous North and South American cultures, as well as in Europe and Asia, birds are seen as messengers of the spirits. Feathers are often used in ceremonies and in individual healing rituals. Rattle – Found mostly among South American Vitebsky 1996: 49 and African peoples. Also used in ceremonies among the Navajo and in traditional ways in their blessings and ceremonies. Gong – Often found through South East Asia, Far Eastern peoples. Pipe – Used for smoking various tobaccos and psychoactive herbs (e.g. tobacco in North and South America, cannabis in India). Sword – In the Hmong culture, a holy sword will always be used in the practice to protect the shaman from wandering &quot; evil &quot; spirits as he travels to the spirit world. Shake – Found mostly in the Hmong culture, the shaman begins his practice by rattling, which turns into a shake. It is the process of communicating with his shamanistic spirits to guide him to the spirit world. Long Table – A flexible wooden table, approximately nine by two feet, is used in the Hmong culture; the table transforms into a &quot; flying horse &quot; in the spirit world. Rooster – A rooster is often used in the Hmong culture. A shaman uses a rooster when he journeys to the unknown. It is said that the rooster shields the shaman from wandering &quot; evil &quot; spirits by making him invisible; thus, the evil spirits only see the rooster&apos;s spirit. [ Academic study ] { Sami shaman with his drum } [ Cognitive, semiotic, hermeneutic approaches ] As mentioned, a (debated) approach explains the etymology of word &quot; shaman &quot; as meaning &quot; one who knows &quot;. { Diószegi 1962:13 } { Hoppál 2005:14 } Really, the shaman is a person who is an expert in keeping together the multiple code s of the society. Accordingly, the society&apos;s codes are the manifestation of the society&apos;s underlying complex belief system. Thus to be effective, shamans maintain a comprehensive view in their mind which gives them certainty of knowledge. { Hoppál 2005:15 } The shaman uses (and the audience understands) multiple code s. Shamans express meanings in many ways: verbally, musically, artistically, and in dance. Meanings may be manifested in objects such as amulet s. The shaman knows the culture of his or her community well, { Pentikäinen 1995 : 270 } { Hoppál 2005:25–26,43 } and acts accordingly. Thus, their audience knows the used symbol s and meanings—that is why shamanism can be efficient: people in the audience trust it. For example, the shaman&apos;s drum ming can appear to its members as certainty of knowledge —this explains the above described etymology for the word &quot; shaman &quot; as meaning &quot; one who knows. &quot; { Hoppál 2004:14 } There are semiotic theoretical approaches to shamanism, { Hoppál 2005: 13–15, 58, 197 } { Hoppál 2006a: 11 } { Hoppál 2006b: 175 } ( &quot; ethnosemiotics &quot; ). The symbols on the shaman&apos;s costume and drum can refer to Power animal s, or to the rank of the shaman. There are also examples of &quot; mutually opposing symbols &quot;, distinguishing a &quot; white &quot; shaman who contacts sky spirits for good aims by day, from a &quot; black &quot; shaman who contacts evil spirits for bad aims by night. { Hoppál 2007c : 24–25 } (Series of such opposing symbols referred to a world-view behind them. Analogously to the way grammar arranges words to express meanings and convey a world, also this formed a cognitive map?). { Hoppál, Mihály: Nature worship in Siberian shamanism } Shaman&apos;s lore is rooted in the folklore of the community, which provides a &quot; mythological mental map &quot;. { Hoppál 2007b : 12–13 } { Hoppál 2007c : 25 } Juha Pentikäinen uses the concept &quot; grammar of mind &quot;. { Pentikäinen 1995 : 270–271 } Linking to a Sami example, Kathleen Osgood Dana writes: [ Juha Pentikäinen, in his introduction to Shamanism and Northern Ecology, explains how the Sámi drum embodies Sámi worldviews. He considers shamanism to be a ‘grammar of mind’ (10), because shamans need to be experts in the folklore of their cultures (11). Dana 2004 : 18 (see online ) ] Armin Geertz coined and introduced the hermeneutics, { Merkur 1985:v } &quot; ethnohermeneutics &quot;, approaches to the practice of interpretation. Hoppál extended the term to include not only the interpretation of oral and written texts, but that of &quot; visual texts as well (including motions, gestures and more complex ritual, and ceremonies performed for instance by shamans) &quot;. { Hoppál 2007b : 13 } It not only reveals the animistic views hiding behind shamanism, but also conveys their relevance for the contemporary world, where ecological problems have validated paradigms about balance and protection. [ Ecological approaches, systems theory ] Other fieldwork s use systems theory concepts and ecological considerations to understand the shaman&apos;s lore. Desana and Tucano Indians have developed a sophisticated symbolism and concepts of &quot; energy &quot; flowing between people and animals in cyclic paths. Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff relates these concepts to developments in the ways that modern science (systems theory, ecology, new approaches in anthropology and archeology) treats causality in a less linear fashion. He also suggests a cooperation of modern science and indigenous lore (online { Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff : A View from the Headwaters. The Ecologist, Vol. 29 No. 4, July 1999. } ). [ Hypotheses on origins ] Shamanic practices may originate as early as the Paleolithic, predating all organized religions, [ http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php Shamanism in Prehistory Jean Clottes 2008-03-11 Bradshaw foundation ] [ http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId%3D109434%26amp%3BfullArticle%3Dtrue%26amp%3BtocId%3D52333 Karl J. Narr Prehistoric religion 2008-03-28 Britannica online encyclopedia 2008 ] and certainly as early as the Neolithic period. Early anthropologist theorize that shamanism develop as a magic to ensure a successful hunt or gathering of food.Evidence in caves and rock with drawings support indications that shamanism started during the Paleolithic era. One such picture featured half-animal, with face and legs a man, with antlers and a tail of a stag. { Winkelman, Michael. Shamanism: a Biopsychosocial Paradigm of Consciousness and Healing. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2010. Print. } Archaeological evidence exists for Mesolithic shamanism. In November 2008, researchers announced the discovery of a 12,000-year-old site in Israel that they regard as one of the earliest known shaman burials. The elderly woman had been arranged on her side, with her legs apart and folded inward at the knee. Ten large stones were placed on the head, pelvis and arms. Among her unusual grave goods were 50 complete tortoise shells, a human foot, and certain body parts from animals such as a cow tail and eagle wings. Other animal remains came from a boar, leopard, and two martens. &quot; It seems that the woman … was perceived as being in a close relationship with these animal spirits &quot;, researchers noted. The grave was one of at least 28 at the site, located in a cave in lower Galilee and belonging to the Natufian culture, but is said to be unlike any other among the Natufians or in the Paleolithic period. { &quot; Earliest known shaman grave site found: study &quot;, reported by } { Reuters via } { Yahoo! News, November 4, 2008, archived. see.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. } [ Clinical trial ] The Kaiser Permanente Center For Health Research in Portland, Oregon conducted a phase I study into the effectiveness of shamanic healing as a treatment for chronic face and jaw pain. Twenty-three women who were diagnosed with Temporomandibular Joint Disorder s (TMDs) participated in the study. At the end of treatment only four were clinically diagnosed with the TMDs present at the beginning of the study. { TMD Clinical study } [ Historical-Anthropological School of Folkloristics ] Folklorists have evaluated the presence of remnants of shamanism and shamanic practice in folktales from around the world. Michael Berman identified the genre of the shamanic story, examples of which are only produced by folk groups with shamanic cosmology or a shamanic world view. Kultkrantz points out that, “in areas where shamanism has long been a thing of the past, many tales contain only vague, piecemeal or inaccurate recollections of shamans and their like.” { 1993, p.51 } The presence of distinctive characteristics and features of shamanic stories help folklorists and anthropologists reconstruct a culture’s practice of shamanism. { Berman, Shamanic Journeys Through Daghestan, 2008, p.22 } [ Decline and revitalization / tradition-preserving movements ] Shamanism is believed to be declining around the world. Possibly due to other religious influences, like Christianity, that want people who practice shamanism to convert to their own religion. Another reason is western views of shamanism as primitive and superstitious. Whalers who frequently interact with Inuit tribes are one source of this decline in that region. [ Oosten Jarich Frederic Laugrand, and Cornelius Remie Perceptions of Decline: Inuit Shamanism in the Canadian Arctic American Society for Ethnohistory 2006 445–477 10.1215/00141801 –2006-001 harv ] { Kyzyl, 2005. (Details missing). Attempts are being made to preserve and revitalize } { Tuvan shamanism: Hoppál 2005: 117 } { former authentic shamans have begun to practice again, and young apprentices are being educated in an organized way. Hoppál 2005: 259 } In many areas, former shamans ceased to fill the functions in the community they used to, as they felt mocked by their own community, { Boglár 2001: 19–20 } or regarded their own past as a deprecated thing, and are unwilling to talk about it to an ethnographer. { Diószegi 1960: 37–39 } Moreover, besides personal communications of former shamans, folklore texts may narrate directly about a deterioration process. For example, a Buryat epic text details the wonderful deeds of the ancient &quot; first shaman &quot; Kara-Gürgän: { Eliade 2001 : 76 (= Chpt 3 about obtaining shamanic capabilities) } he could even compete with God, create life, steal back the soul of the sick from God without his consent. A subsequent text laments that shamans of older times were stronger, possessing capabilities like omnividence, { Omnividence: A word created by Edwin A. Abbott in his book titled } { Flatland } fortune-telling even for decades in the future, moving as fast as bullet; the texts contrast them to the recent heartless, unknowing, greedy shamans. { Diószegi 1960: 88–89 } In most affected areas, shamanistic practices ceased to exist, with authentic shamans dying and their personal experiences following. The loss of memories is not always lessened by the fact the shaman is not always the only person in a community who knows the beliefs and motifs related to the local shaman-hood (laics know myths as well, among Barasana, even though less; there are former shaman apprentices unable to complete the learning among Greenlandic Inuit peoples, moreover, even laics can have trance-like experiences among Eskimos; the assistant of a shaman can be extremely knowledgeable among Dagara ). Although the shaman is often believed and trusted exactly because he/she &quot; accommodates &quot; to the &quot; grammar &quot; of the beliefs of the community, but several parts of the knowledge related to the local shamanhood consist of personal experiences of the shaman (illness), or root in his/her family life (the interpretation of the symbolics of his/her drum), { Hoppál 2005: 224 } thus, those are lost with his/her death. Besides that, in many cultures, the entire traditional belief system has become endangered (often together with a partial or total language shift ), the other people of the community remembering the associated beliefs and practices (or the language at all) became old or died, many folklore memories (songs, texts) went forgotten—this may threaten even such peoples which could preserve their isolation until the middle of the 20th century, like the Nganasan. { Nagy 1998: 232 } Some areas could enjoy a prolonged resistance due to their remoteness. Variants of shamanism among Eskimo peoples were once a widespread (and very diverse) phenomenon, but today are rarely practiced, and they were already in the decline among many groups even in the times when the first major ethnological researches were done, Merkur 1985:132 e.g. among Polar Eskimos, in the end of 19th century, Sagloq died, the last shaman who was believed to be able to travel to the sky and under the sea—and many other former shamanic capacities were lost in that time as well, like ventriloquism and sleight-of-hand. Merkur 1985:134 The isolated location of Nganasan people allowed shamanism to be a living phenomenon among them even in the beginning of 20th century, Hoppál 2005: 92 the last notable Nganasan shaman&apos;s séances could be recorded on film in the 1970s. Hoppál 1994: 62 After exemplifying the general decline even in the most remote areas, let us [ February 2012 ] mention that there are revitalization or tradition-preserving efforts as a response. Besides collecting the memories, { Hoppál 2005: 88 } there are also tradition-preserving { Hoppál 2005: 93 } and even revitalization efforts, { Hoppál 2005: 111, 117–119, 128, 132, 133–134, 252-263 } led by authentic former shamans (for example among Sakha people { Hoppál 2005: 257–258 } and Tuvans ). However, according to Richard L. Allen, Research &amp; Policy Analyst for the Cherokee Nation, they are overwhelmed with fraudulent Shaman. &quot; One may assume that anyone claiming to be a Cherokee &quot; shaman, spiritual healer, or pipe-carrier &quot;, is equivalent to a modern day medicine show and snake-oil vendor. &quot; [ Pseudo Shamans Cherokee Statement http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/Articles2001/RLAllen-CherokeeStatement-Shamans.htm 2008-06-23 ] In fact, there is no Cherokee word for Shaman or Medicine Man. The Cherokee word for &quot; medicine &quot; is Nvowti which means &quot; power &quot;. Besides tradition-preserving efforts, there are also neoshamanistic movements, these may differ from many tradtitional shamanistic practice and beliefs in several points. { Vitebsky 1996: 150–153 } Admittedly, [ February 2012 ] several traditional beliefs systems indeed have ecological considerations (for example, many Eskimo peoples), and among Tukano people, the shaman indeed has directly resource-protecting roles, see details in section Ecological aspect. Today, shamanism survives primarily among indigenous people s. Shamanic practices continue today in the tundras, jungles, deserts, and other rural areas, and even in cities, towns, suburbs, and shantytowns all over the world. This is especially true for Africa and South America, where &quot; mestizo shamanism &quot; is widespread. [ Regional variations ] [ Asia ] [ Mongolia ] [ Böö (shaman) ] Mongolian shamanism has the longest recorded history in the world. [ February 2012 ] The word Böö &quot; shaman; spirit medium; healer &quot; first appeared on oracle bones from the late Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BCE). Mongolian classics from the Hunnu Dynasty (1045-256 BCE) provide details about male and female shamans serving as exorcists, healers, rainmakers, oneiromancers, soothsayers, and officials. Shamanic practices continue in present day Mongolia culture. { http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/shamanism.htm } { http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/bender4/eall131/EAHReadings/module03/local_beliefs.html } { http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/5288 } { http://www.yale.edu/seacrn/asia_members.htm } In the 1990s, a form of Mongolian neo-shamanism was created which has given a more modern approach to shamanism. Mongolian shamans are now making a business out of their profession and even have offices in the larger towns. At these businesses, a shaman generally heads the organization and performs services such as healing, fortunetelling, and solving all kinds of problems. { Balogh, Matyas. &quot; Contemporary Shamanisms in Mongolia. &quot; Asian Ethnicity 11.2 (2010): 229-38. } [ Hmong shamanism ] [ Hmong_customs_and_culture#Shamanism ] The Hmong people, { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people } as an ancient people of China with a 5,000 years of history, continue to maintain and practice its form of shamanism known as &quot; Ua Neeb &quot; in mainland Asia. At the end of the Vietnam War, some 300,000 Hmong have been settled across the globe. They have continued to practice Ua Neeb in various countries in the North and South America, Europe and Australia. In the USA, the Hmong shaman practitioner is known as &quot; Txiv Neeb &quot; has been license by many hospitals in California as being part of the medical health team to treat patients in hospital. This revival of Ua Neeb in the West has been brought great success and has been hailed in the media as &quot; Doctor for the disease, shaman for the soul &quot;. Being a Hmong shaman represents a true vocation, chosen by the shaman God &quot; Sivyis &quot; { http://www.lexicon.net/drpao/shaman/sivyis/ }.A shaman main job is to bring harmony to the individual, his family and his community within his environment by performing various rituals (trance). Animal sacrifice has been part of the Hmong shamanic practice for the past 5,000 years. Contrary to the belief of many Westerners, the Hmong practice of using animal in shamanic practice has been done with great respect. After the Vietnam War, over 200,000 Hmong were resettled in the USA and shamanism is still part of the Hmong culture. But due the colluding of culture and the law, as Professor Alison Dundes Renteln, a political science professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Cultural Defense, a book that examines the influence of such cases on U.S. courts, once said, &quot; We say that as a society we welcome diversity, and in fact that we embrace it...In practice, it&apos;s not that easy. &quot;. { http://www.usatoday.com/educate/firstamendment/religion_052504.html } The Hmong believe that all things on Earth has a soul(s) and those souls are treated as equal and can be considered interchangeable. When a person is sick due to his soul being loss or captured by wild spirit, it is necessary to ask and get permission of that animal, whether it is a chicken, pig, dog, goat or any other animals is required, to use its soul for an exchange with that person&apos;s soul for period of 12 months. At the end of that 12 months period, during the Hmong New Year, the shaman performed a special ritual to release the soul of that animal and send it off to the world beyond. As part of his service to mankind, the animal soul is sent off to be re-incarnated into a higher form of animal or even to become a member of a god&apos;s family (ua Fuab Tais Ntuj tus tub, tus ntxhais) to live a life of luxury, free of the suffering as an animal. Hence, being asked to perform this duty (what Westerner called &quot; animal sacrifice) is one of the a greatest honor for that animal to be able to serve mankind. The Hmong of Southeast Guizhou will cover the cock with a piece of red cloth and then hold it up to worship and sacrifice to the Heaven and the Earth before the cockfight. { Southeast Guizhou Travel Tips - China Highlights, a division of CITS Guilin, a full service China travel agency providing China Tours } In a 2010 trial of a Sheboygan Wisconsin Hmong that was charged with staging a cockfight, it was stated that the roosters were “kept for both food and religious purposes” { Cockfight Trial UnderwayWHBL News April 08, 2010 } followed by an acquittal. { Not Guilty Verdict In Cockfighting Trial WHBL News April 09, 2010 } In addition to the spiritual dimension, Hmong shaman can treat many physical illness by using text of sacred words (khawv koob). [ Korea ] [ Korean shamanism ] Shamanism is still practiced in South Korea, where the role of a shaman is most frequently taken by women known as mudangs, while male shamans (rare) are called baksoo mudangs. Korean shamans are considered to be from a low class. A person can become a shaman through hereditary title or through natural ability. Shamans are consulted in contemporary society for financial and marital decisions. [ Japan ] [ Shinto ] Shamanism is part of the native Japanese religion of Shinto.The distinction is that Shinto is Shamanism for agricultural society. Today Shinto has morphed with Buddhism and other Japanese folk culture. The book &quot; Occult Japan: Shinto, Shamanism and the Way of the Gods &quot; by Percival Lowell delves further into researching Japanese Shamanism or Shintoism. { Percival Lowell, Occult Japan: Shinto, Shamanism and the Way of the Gods, Inner Traditions International (April 1990), Rochester Vt } It is generally accepted that the vast majority of Japanese people take part in Shinto rituals. The book Japan Through the Looking Glass: Shaman to Shinto uncovers the extraordinary aspects of Japanese beliefs. { Alan Mcfarlane, Japan Through the Looking Glass: Shaman to Shinto, Profile Books Ltd, Aug 2007, London England } { Japantimes.co.jp } [ Siberia ] [ Shamanism in Siberia ] { Ainu bear sacrifice. Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870. } Among the Siberian Chukchis peoples, a shaman is interpreted as someone who is possessed by a spirit who demands that someone assume the shamanic role for their people. Among the Buryat, there is a ritual known as &quot; shanar &quot; { Shanar Buryat } whereby a candidate is consecrated as shaman by another, already-established shaman. Siberia is regarded as the locus classicus of shamanism. { Hoppál 2005:13 } It is inhabited by many different ethnic groups. Many of its peoples observe shamanistic practices even in modern times. Many classical ethnographic sources of &quot; shamanism &quot; were recorded among Siberian peoples. Among several Samoyedic peoples shamanism was a living tradition also in modern times, especially at groups living in isolation until recent times ( Nganasan s ). { Hoppál 2005:92–93 } The last notable Nganasan shaman&apos;s seances could be recorded on film in the 1970s. When the People&apos;s Republic of China was formed in 1949 and the border with Russian Siberia was formally sealed, many nomadic Tungus groups that practiced shamanism were confined in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. These include the Evenki. The last shaman of the Oroqen, Chuonnasuan (Meng Jin Fu), died in October 2000. In many other cases, shamanism was in decline even at the beginning of 20th century ( Gypsies ). [ Central Asia ] [ Geographic influences on Central Asian shamanism ] Geographical factors heavily influence the character and development of the religion, myths, rituals and epics of Central Asia. While in other parts of the world, religious rituals are primarily used to promote agricultural prosperity, here they were used to ensure success in hunting and breeding livestock. Animals are one of the most important elements of indigenous religion in Central Asia because of the role they play in the survival of the nomadic civilizations of the steeps as well as sedentary populations living on land not conducive to agriculture. Shamans wore animal skins and feathers and underwent transformations into animals during spiritual journeys. In addition, animals served as humans&apos; guides, rescuers, ancestors, totems and sacrificial victims. { Julian Baldick, Animal and Shaman: Ancient Religions of Central Asia (New York: University Press, 2000), 3-35 } As a religion of nature, shamanism throughout Central Asia held particular reverence for the relations between sky, earth and water and believed in the mystical importance of trees and mountains. Shamanism in Central Asia also places a strong emphasis on the opposition between summer and winter, corresponding to the huge differences in temperature common in the region. The harsh conditions and poverty caused by the extreme temperatures drove Central Asian nomads throughout history to pursue militaristic goals against their sedentary neighbors. This military background can be seen in the reverence for horses and warriors within many indigenous religions. { Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer, Shamanism: Soviet Studies of Traditional Religion in Siberia and Central Asia (New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1990), 113 } [ Common shamanic practices and beliefs shared among Central Asians ] Central Asian shamans served as sacred intermediaries between the human and spirit world. In this role they took on tasks such as healing, divination, appealing to ancestors, manipulating the elements, leading lost souls and officiating public religious rituals. The shamanic séance served as a public display of the shaman&apos;s journey to the spirit world and usually involved intense trances, drumming, dancing, chanting, elaborate costumes, miraculous displays of physical strength, and audience involvement. The goal of these séances ranged from recovering the lost soul of a sick patient and divining the future to controlling the weather and finding a lost person or thing. The use of sleight-of-hand tricks, ventriloquism, and hypnosis were common in these rituals but did not explain the more impressive feats and actual cures accomplished by shamans. { Nora K. Chadwick, &quot; Shamanism among the Tatars of Central Asia, &quot; The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 66, (Jan.-Jun., 1936): 97-99 } Shamans perform in a &quot; state of ecstasy &quot; deliberately induced by an effort of will. Reaching this altered state of consciousness required great mental exertion, concentration and strict self-discipline. Mental and physical preparation included long periods of silent meditation, fasting, and smoking. In this state, skilled shamans employ capabilities that the human organism cannot accomplish in the ordinary state. Shamans in ecstasy displayed unusual physical strength, the ability to withstand extreme temperatures, the bearing of stabbing and cutting without pain, and the heightened receptivity of the sense organs. Shamans made use of intoxicating substances and hallucinogens, especially mukhomor mushrooms and alcohol, as a means of hastening the attainment of ecstasy. { Balzer, Shamanism, 12-21 } The use of purification by fire is an important element of the shamanic tradition dating back as early as the 6th century. People and things connected with the dead had to be purified by passing between fires. These purifications were complex exorcisms while others simply involved the act of literally walking between two fires while being blessed by the Shaman. Shamans in literature and practice were also responsible for using special stones to manipulate weather. Rituals are performed with these stones to attract rain or repel snow, cold or wind. This &quot; rain-stone &quot; was used for many occasions including bringing an end to drought as well as producing hailstorms as a means of warfare. { John Andrew Boyle, &quot; Turkish and Mongol Shamanism in the Middle Ages, &quot; Folklore Vol. 83 (1972): 183-185 } Despite distinctions between various types of shamans and specific traditions, there is a uniformity throughout the region manifested in the personal beliefs, objectives, rituals, symbols and the appearance of shamans. [ Shamanic rituals as artistic performance ] The shamanic séance is both a religious ceremony and an artistic performance. The fundamental purpose of the dramatic displays seen during shamanic ceremonies is not to draw attention or to create a spectacle for the audience as many Westerners have interpreted, but to lead the tribe in a solemn religious function. In general, all performances consist of four elements: dance, music, poetry and dramatic or mimetic action. The use of these elements serves the purpose of outwardly expressing his mystical communion with nature and the spirits for the rest of the tribe. The true shaman can make the journey to the spirit world at any time and any place, but shamanic ceremonies provide a way for the rest of the tribe to share in this religious experience. The shaman changes his voice mimetically to represent different persons, gods, and animals while his music and dance change to show his progress in the spirit world and his different spiritual interactions. Many shamans practice ventriloquism and make use of their ability to accurately imitate the sounds of animals, nature, humans and other noises in order to provide the audience with the ambiance of the journey. Elaborate dances and recitations of songs and poetry are used to make the shamans spiritual adventures into a matter of living reality to his audience. { Chadwick, Shamanism among the Tatars of Central Asia: 93-101 } [ Costume and accessories ] The shaman&apos;s costume varies throughout the region but his chief accessories are his coat, cap, and tambourine or drum. The transformation into an animal is an important aspect of the journey into the spirit world undertaken during shamanic ceremonies so the coat is often decorated with birds feathers and representations of animals, colored handkerchiefs, bells and metal ornaments. The cap is usually made from the skin of a bird with the feathers and sometimes head, still attached. The drum or tambourine is the essential means of communicating with spirits and transporting the shaman on supernatural journeys. The drum, representing the universe in epitome, is often divided into equal halves to represent the earth and lower regions. Symbols and natural objects are added to the drum representing natural forces and heavenly bodies. { Chadwick, Shamanism among the Tatars of Central Asia,: 85-87 } [ Shamanism in Tsarist and Soviet Russia ] In Soviet Central Asia, the Soviet government persecuted and denounced shamans as practitioners of fraudulent medicine and perpetuators of outdated religious beliefs in the new age of science and logic. The radical transformations occurring after the October Socialist Revolution led to a sharp decrease in the activity of shamans. Shamans represented an important component in the traditional culture of Central Asians and because of their important role in society, Soviet organizations and campaigns targeted shamans in their attempt to eradicate traditional influences in the lives of the indigenous peoples. Along with persecution under the tsarist and Soviet regimes, the spread of Christianity and Islam had a role in the disintegration of native faith throughout central Asia. Poverty, political instability and foreign influence are also detrimental to a religion that requires publicity and patronage to flourish. By the 1980s most shamans were discredited in the eyes of their people by Soviet officials and physicians. { Balzer, Shamanism, 42-49 } [ Other Asian traditions ] [ section October 2009 ] There is a strong shamanistic influence in the Bön religion in Central Asian, and in Tibetan Buddhism. Buddhism became popular with shamanic peoples such as the Tibetans, Mongols, and Manchu beginning in the eighth century. Forms of shamanistic ritual combined with Tibetan Buddhism became institutionalized as a major religion under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty and the Manchurian Qing dynasty. However, in the shamanic cultures still practiced by various ethnic groups in areas such as Nepal and northern India, shamans are not necessarily considered enlightened, and often are even feared for their ability to use their power to carry out malicious intent. [ October 2009 ] { Pontic steppes. The nomadic } { Kipchaks followed a Shamanist religion. } In Tibet, the Nyingma schools in particular, had a Tantric tradition that had married &quot; priests &quot; known as Ngakpas or Ngakmas/mos (fem.). The Ngakpas were often employed or commissioned to rid the villages of demons or disease, creations of protective amulets, the carrying out of religious rites etc. The Ngakpas should however, have been grounded in Buddhist philosophy and not simply another form of shaman, but sadly, [ May 2010 ] this was most often not the case. There have always been, however, highly realised and accomplished ngakpas. They were in their own right great lamas who were of equal status as lamas with monastic backgrounds. The monasteries, as in many conventional religious institutions, wished to preserve their own traditions. The monasteries depended upon the excesses of patrons for support. This situation often led to a clash between the more grassroots and shamanic character of the travelling Chöd pa and Ngakpa culture and the more conservative religious monastic system. { Economy of Excess. George Bataille. } [ October 2009 ] &quot; Jhakri &quot; is the common name used for shamans in Sikkim, India. They exist in the Limbu, Sunuwar, Rai, Sherpa, Kami, Tamang, Gurung and Lepcha communities. [ Gulia 2005 153–4 ] They are inflluenced by Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, Mun and Bön rites. [ Gulia 2005 168 ] Shamanism is still widely practiced in the Ryukyu Islands ( Okinawa, Japan ), where shamans are known as &apos;Noro&apos; (all women) and &apos;Yuta&apos;. &apos;Noro&apos; generally administer public or communal ceremonies while &apos;Yuta&apos; focus on civil and private matters. Shamanism is also practiced in a few rural areas in Japan proper. It is commonly believed that the Shinto religion is the result of the transformation of a shamanistic tradition into a religion.Forms of practice vary somewhat in the several Ryukyu islands, so that there is, e.g., a distinct &apos;&apos;&apos;Miyako&apos;&apos;&apos; shamanism. Shamanism practices seem to have been preserved in the Catholic religious traditions of aborigines in Taiwan. { O. Lardenois, Shamanism and Catholic Indigenous Communities in Taiwan } In Vietnam, shamans conduct rituals in many of the religious traditions that co-mingle in the majority and minority populations. In their rituals, music, dance, special garments and offerings are part of the performance that surround the spirit journey.

Shamanism in Scandinavia may be represented in rock art dating to the Neolithic era { Bolin 2000: 157 } and was practiced throughout the Iron Age by the various Teutonic tribes and the Baltic-Finnic peoples. { A. Asbjorn Jon, Shamanism and the Image of the Teutonic Deity, Óðinn } People which used to live in Siberia, have wandered to their present locations since then. For example, many Uralic peoples live now outside Siberia, however the original location of the Proto-Uralic peoples (and its extent) is debated. Combined phytogeographical and linguistic considerations (distribution of various tree species and the presence of their names in various Uralic languages) suggest that this area was north of Central Ural Mountains and on lower and middle parts of Ob River. { Hajdú 1975:35 } The ancestors of Hungarian people or Magyars have wandered from their ancestral proto-Uralic area to the Pannonian Basin. Shamanism played an important role in Turko-Mongol mythology. Tengriism, the major belief among Xiongnu or Mongol and Turkic peoples, Magyars and Bulgars in ancient times incorporates elements of shamanism. Shamanism is no more a living practice among Hungarians, but remnants have been reserved as fragments of folklore, in folktales, customs. { Diószegi 1998 } Various scholars have also argued that shamanism was once widespread across Europe prior to Christianisation. Some historians of the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period have argued that traces of shamanistic traditions can be seen in the popular folk belief of this period. Most prominent among these was the Italian Carlo Ginzburg, who claimed shamanistic elements in the benandanti custom of 16th century Italy, { Ginzburg 1983 [1966 ]. } the Hungarian Éva Pócs, who identified them in the táltos tradition of Hungary, { Pócs 1999. } and the Frenchman Claude Lecouteux, who has argued that Medieval traditions regarding the soul are based on earlier shamanic ideas. { Lecouteux 2003. } Ginzburg in particular has argued that some of these shamanistic traditions influenced the conception of witchcraft in Christendom, in particular ideas regarding the witches&apos; sabbath, leading to the events of the witch trials in the Early Modern period. { Ginzburg 1990. } [ Circumpolar shamanism ] [ Inuit and Yupik cultures ] { Nushagak, Alaska, 1890s.

Shamanistic practice and beliefs have been recorded at several parts of this vast area crosscutting continental borders. { Merkur 1985 } { Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985 } When speaking of &quot; shamanism &quot; in various Eskimo groups, we must remember that (as mentioned above) the term &quot; shamanism &quot; can cover certain characteristics of various different cultures. Mediation is regarded often as an important aspect of shamanism in general. { Hoppál 2005:45–50 } Also in most Eskimo groups, the role of mediator is known well: { Menovščikov 1996:442 } the person filling it in is actually believed to be able to contact the beings who populate the belief system. Term &quot; shaman &quot; is used in several English-language publications also in relation to Eskimos. { Vitebsky 1996 } { Freuchen 1961: 32 } Also the [ aˈliɣnalʁi ] of the Asian Eskimos is translated as &quot; shaman &quot; in the Russian { Рубцова 1954: 203, 209 } and English literature. The belief system assumes specific links between the living people, the souls of hunted animals, and those of dead people. { Both death of a person and successfully hunted game require that cutting, sewing etc. be tabooed, so that the invisible soul does not get hurt accidentally (Kleivan &amp; Sonne, pp. 18–21). In Greenland, the transgression of death tabu could turn the soul of the dead into a tupilak, a restless ghost which scared game away (Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985, p. 23). Animals fled from hunter in case of taboo breaches, e.g. birth taboo, death taboo (Kleivan &amp; Sonne, pp. 12–13) } The soul concepts of several groups are specific examples of soul dualism (showing variability in details in the various cultures). Unlike the majority of shamanisms the careers of most Eskimo shamans lack the motivation of force: becoming a shaman is usually a result of deliberate consideration, not a necessity forced by the spirits. [ Diversity, with similarities ] Another possible concern: do the belief systems of various Eskimo groups have such common features at all, that would justify any mentioning them together? There was no political structure above the groups, their languages were relative, but differed more or less, often forming language continuum s (online { Lawrence Kaplan: Comparative Yupik and Inuit (found on the site of Alaska Native Language Center ) } ). There are similarities in the cultures of the Eskimo groups { Kleivan 1985:8 } { Rasmussen 1965:366 (ch. XXIII) } { Rasmussen 1965:166 (ch. XIII) } { Rasmussen 1965:110 (ch. VIII) } { Mauss 1979 } together with diversity, far from homogeneity. { Kleivan 1985:26 } The Russian linguist Menovshikov (Меновщиков), an expert of Siberian Yupik and Sireniki Eskimo language s (while admitting that he is not a specialist in ethnology { Menovščikov 1996 [1968]:433 } ) mentions, that the shamanistic seances of those Siberian Yupik and Sireniki groups he has seen have many similarities to those of Greenland Inuit groups described by Fridtjof Nansen, { Menovščikov 1996 [1968]:442 } although a large distance separates Siberia and Greenland. There may be certain similarities also in Asiatic groups with North American ones. { Vitebsky 1996:42 (ch. North America) } Also the usage of a specific shaman&apos;s language is documented among several Eskimo groups, used mostly for talking to spirits. { Merkur 1985:7 } { Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985:14 } Also the Ungazighmiit (belonging to Siberian Yupik s ) had a special allegoric usage of some expressions. { Rubcova 1954:128 } The local cultures showed great diversity. The myths concerning the role of shaman had several variants, and also the name of their protagonists varied from culture to culture. For example, a mythological figure, usually referred to in the literature by the collective term Sea Woman, has factually many local names: Nerrivik &quot; meat dish &quot; among Polar Inuit, Nuliayuk &quot; lubricous &quot; among Netsilingmiut, Sedna &quot; the nether one &quot; among Baffin Land Inuit. { Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 27 } Also the soul conceptions, e.g. the details of the soul dualism showed great variability, ranging from guardianship to a kind of reincarnation. Conceptions of spirits or other beings had also many variants (see e.g. the tupilaq concept). { Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 30–31 } [ Africa ] [ African traditional religion Witch doctor Sangoma ] Sangoma/Inyanga performing a traditional baptism on a baby in order to protect the spirit of the baby, Johannesburg, South Africa In central Mali, Dogon sorcerers (both male and female) claim to have communication with a head deity named Amma, who advises them on healing and divination practices. In the early 19th century traditional healers in parts of Africa were often referred to in a derogatory manner as &quot; witch doctors &quot; practicing Juju by early European settlers and explorers. Contemporary ethnology records that the Bushmen, or their ancestors distributed throughout Southern Africa before the 20th century, practiced shamanism. In the semi-desert Northern Cape region, the shamans of the /Xam people were known by the compound word &apos;!gi:ten&apos;, where &apos;!gi&apos; is &apos;power&apos; and &apos;ten&apos; indicated possession. The word is phonetically identical to the Xhosa word for &apos;doctor&apos;. In areas in Eastern Free State and Lesotho, where they co-existed with the early Sotho tribes, local folklore describes them to have lived in caves where they drew pictures on cave walls during a trance and were also reputed to be good rainmakers. The classical meaning of shaman as a person who, after recovering from a mental illness (or insanity) takes up the professional calling of socially recognized religious practitioner, is exemplified among the Sisala (of northern Gold Coast) : &quot; the fairies &quot; seized &quot; him and made him insane for several months. Eventually, though, he learned to control their power, which he now uses to divine. &quot; { Eugene L. Mendonsa : The Politics of Divination : a Processual View of Reactions to Illness and Deviance among the Sisala. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1982. p. 112 } The term sangoma, as employed in Zulu and congeneric languages, is effectively equivalent to shaman. Sangomas are highly revered and respected in their society, where illness is thought to be caused by witchcraft { David M Cumes &quot; Africa in my bones &quot; pp.14 }, pollution (contact with impure objects or occurrences) or by the ancestors themselves { Susan Schuster Campbell &quot; Called to Heal &quot; pp.38 }, either malevolently, or through neglect if they are not respected, or to show an individual her calling to become a sangoma (thwasa) { Susan Schuster Campbell &quot; Called to Heal &quot; pp.79 }. For harmony between the living and the dead, vital for a trouble-free life, the ancestors must be shown respect through ritual and animal sacrifice. { David M Cumes &quot; Africa in my bones &quot; pp.10 } The term inyanga also employed by the Nguni cultures is equivalent to &apos;herbalist&apos; as used by the Zulu people and a variation used by the Karanga, { http://texts.00.gs/Karanga_shamanism.htm Karanga_shamanism } among whom remedies (locally known as muti ) for ailments are discovered by the inyanga being informed in a dream, of the herb able to effect the cure and also of where that herb is to be found. The majority of the herbal knowledge base is passed down from one inyanga to the next, often within a particular family circle in any one village. Shamanism is known among the Nuba of Kordofan in Sudan. { Nadel, S.F. &quot; A Shaman Cult in the Nuba Mountains &quot;. Sudan Notes and Records 1941; 24(l): 85-112 } { Nadel, S.F. &quot; A Study of Shamanism in the Nuba Mountains &quot;.

[ September 2009 ] { Native American &quot; conjuror &quot; in a 1590 engraving } { Hamatsa ritualist, 1914 } Native American and First Nations cultures have diverse religious beliefs. There was never one universal Native American religion or spiritual system. Though many Native American cultures have traditional healers, ritualists, singers, mystics, lore-keepers and &quot; Medicine People &quot;, none of them ever used, or use, the term &quot; shaman &quot; to describe these religious leaders. Rather, like other indigenous cultures the world over, their spiritual functionaries are described by words in their own languages, and in many cases are not taught to outsiders. Many of these indigenous religions have been grossly misrepresented by outside observers and anthropologists, even to the extent of superficial or seriously mistaken anthropological accounts being taken as more authentic than the accounts of actual members of the cultures and religions in question. Often these accounts suffer from &quot; Noble Savage &quot; -type romanticism and racism. Some contribute to the fallacy that Native American cultures and religions are something that only existed in the past, and which can be mined for data despite the opinions of Native communities. { Jones, Peter N. 2008 Shamans and Shamanism: A Comprehensive Bibliography of the Terms Use in North America. Boulder, Colorado: Bauu Press. } Not all Indigenous communities have roles for specific individuals who mediate with the spirit world on behalf of the community. Among those that do have this sort of religious structure, spiritual methods and beliefs may have some commonalities, though many of these commonalities are due to some nations being closely related, from the same region, or through post-Colonial governmental policies leading to the combining of formerly independent nations on reservations. This can sometimes lead to the impression that there is more unity among belief systems than there was in antiquity. Navajo medicine men and women, known as &quot; Hatałii &quot;, use several methods to diagnose the patient&apos;s ailments. These may include using special tools such as crystal rocks, and abilities such as hand-trembling and trances, sometimes accompanied by chanting. The Hatałii will select a specific healing chant for that type of ailment. Navajo healers must be able to correctly perform a healing ceremony from beginning to end. If they do not, the ceremony will not work. Training a Hatałii to perform ceremonies is extensive, arduous, and takes many years. The apprentice learns everything by watching his teacher, and memorizes the words to all the chants. Many times, a medicine man or woman cannot learn all sixty of the traditional ceremonies, so will opt to specialize in a select few. [ Extirpation in North America ] [ November 2011 ] With the arrival of European settler s and colonial administration, the practice of Native American traditional beliefs was discouraged and Christianity was imposed upon the indigenous people. About 1888, a mass movement known as the Ghost Dance started among the Paviotso (a branch of the Pah-Utes in Nevada) and swept through many tribes of Native Americans. The belief was that through practicing the Ghost Dance, a messiah would come with rituals that would make the white man disappear and bring back game and dead native Americans. { History of the American Indian, page 222. Oliver Lafarge 1956 } This spread to the Plains tribes, who were starving due to the depletion of the buffalo. Some Sioux, the Arapahos, Cheyennes and Kiowas accepted the doctrine. This form of shamanism was brutally suppressed by the United States military with the death of 128 Sioux at the massacre of Wounded Knee. { lib of congress 56-11375 page 224 } During the last hundred years, thousands of surviving Native Americans, First Nations youngsters from many cultures were sent into Indian boarding school s to destroy any tribal, shamanic or totemic faith. [ Mesoamerica ] [ Maya ] [ Maya priesthood ] [ Mayan astrology Maya religion ] { Maya priest performing a healing ritual at } { Tikal. } The Maya people of Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico practice a highly sophisticated form of shamanism based upon astrology and a form of divination known as &quot; the blood speaking &quot;, in which the shaman is guided in divination and healing by pulses in the veins of his arms and legs. [ Aztec ] [ Aztec astrology Aztec religion ] In contemporary Nahuatl, shamanism is known as cualli ohtli ( &quot; the good path &quot; ) leading during dreaming by &quot; friends of the night &quot; to &apos;&apos;Tlalocán&apos;&apos;. [ South America ] [ Invalid length. ] Shamanic healing is found among the indigenous Kuna people of Panama, who rely on sacred talisman s. As such, they enjoy a popular position among local peoples. The Urarina of the Peruvian Amazonia have an elaborate cosmological system predicated on the ritual consumption of ayahuasca. Urarina ayahuasca shamanism is a key feature of this poorly documented society. Dean, Bartholomew 2009 Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia, Gainesville: University Press of Florida ISBN 978081303378 Among the Brazilian Tapirapé people shamans are called to serve in their dreams. The Shuar people, seeking the power to defend their family against enemies, would apprentice themselves to become shamans. Santo Daime and União do Vegetal ( abbreviated to UDV ) are syncretic religions with elements of shamanism. They use an entheogen called ayahuasca to connect with the spirit realm and receive divine guidance. [ Amazonia ] { Amazonian forest, June 2006 } { Urarina } { shaman, 1988 } In the Peruvian Amazon Basin and north coastal regions of the country, the healer shamans are known as curandero s. Ayahuasqueros are Peruvian shamans, such as among the Urarina people, who specialize in the use of ayahuasca, a psychedelic herbal potion used for physical and psychological healing, divine revelation, and for the very reproduction of society itself. Ayahuasqueros have become popular among Western spiritual seekers, who claim that the shamans and their ayahuasca brews have cured them of everything from depression to addiction to cancer. In addition to curanderos use of ayahuasca and their ritualized ingestion of mescaline -bearing San Pedro cactus es (Trichocereus pachanoi) for the divination and diagnosis of sorcery, north-coastal shamans are famous throughout the region for their intricately complex and symbolically dense healing altar s called mesas (tables). Sharon (1993) has argued that the mesas symbolize the dualistic ideology underpinning the practice and experience of north-coastal shamanism. { Joralemen, D and D Sharon 1993 Sorcery and Shamanism: Curanderos and Clients in Northern Peru. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press. } For Sharon, the mesas are the, &quot; physical embodiment of the supernatural opposition between benevolent and malevolent energies &quot; (Dean 1998:61). { Dean, Bartholomew 1998 &quot; Review of Sorcery and Shamanism: Curanderos and Clients in Northern Peru &quot; American Ethnologist. 25(1): 61-62. } In the Amazon rainforest, at several Indian groups the shaman acts also as a manager of scarce ecological resources (paper; { Boglár 2001:26 } online ). The rich symbolism behind Tukano shamanism has been documented in some in-depth field work s { Christine Hugh-Jones 1980 } { Stephen Hugh-Jones 1980 } even in the last decades of the 20th century. The yaskomo of the Waiwai is believed to be able to perform a soul flight. The soul flight can serve several functions: healing flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the moon or the brother of the moon) to get a name for a newborn baby flying to the cave of peccaries&apos; mountains to ask the father of peccaries for abundance of game flying deep down in a river, to achieve the help of other beings. Thus, a yaskomo is believed to be able to reach sky, earth, water, in short, every element. { Fock 1963: 16 } Shamanism among the Yąnomamö (of the Venezolano Amazonas and the Brazilian Roraima) is described in Tales of the Yanomami by Jacques Lizot. [ Mapuche ] Among the Mapuche people of Chile, the community shaman, usually a woman, is known as the Machi, and serves the community by performing ceremonies to cure diseases, ward off evil, influence the weather and harvest, and by practicing other forms of healing such as herbalism. [ Aymara ] For the Aymara people of South America the Yatiri is a healer who heals the body and the soul, they serve the community and do the rituals for Pachamama. [ Fuegians ] Although Fuegians (the indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego ) were all hunter-gatherer s, { Gusinde 1966, pp. 6–7 } they did not share a common culture. The material culture was not homogenous, either: the big island and the archipelago made two different adaptations possible. Some of the cultures were coast-dwelling, others were land-oriented. { Service, Elman: The Hunter. Prentice-Hall, 1966. } { Extinct Ancient Societies Tierra del Fuegians } Both Selk&apos;nam and Yámana had persons filling in shaman -like roles.The Selk&apos;nams believed their [ /xon/ ] s to have supernatural capabilities, e.g. to control weather. { Gusinde 1966:175 } { About the Ona Indian Culture in Tierra del Fuego } The figure of [ /xon/ ] appeared in myths, too. { Gusinde 1966:15 } The Yámana [ /jekamuʃ/ ] { Gusinde 1966:156 } corresponds to the Selknam [ /xon/ ]. { Gusinde 1966:186 } [ Oceania ] [ Umbarra Tunggal panaluan ] On the island of Papua New Guinea, indigenous tribes believe that illness and calamity are caused by dark spirits, or masalai, which cling to a person&apos;s body and poison them. Shamans are summoned in order to purge the unwholesome spirits from a person. [ http://www.amazon.com/Four-Corners-Journey-Heart-Guinea/dp/0792274172/ref%3Dpd_bxgy_b_img_b Amazon.com listing for the &quot; Four Corners: A Journey into the Heart of Papua New Guinea &quot; ] [ http://www.kirasalak.com/FourCorners.html Kira Salak&apos;s official webpage on &quot; Four Corners &quot; Salak Kira ] Shamans also perform rainmaking ceremonies and can allegedly improve a hunter&apos;s ability to catch animals. [ http://www.kirasalak.com/MakingRain.html MAKING RAIN--from Four Corners Salak Kira ] In Australia various aboriginal groups refer to their shamans as &quot; clever men &quot; and &quot; clever women &quot; also as kadji. These aboriginal shamans use maban or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers. Besides healing, contact with spiritual beings, involvement in initiation and other secret ceremonies, they are also enforcers of tribal laws, keepers of special knowledge and may &quot; hex &quot; to death one who breaks a social taboo by singing a song only known to the &quot; clever men &quot;. [ Contemporary Western shamanism ] [ Neoshamanism Core shamanism ] There is an endeavor in some contemporary occult and esoteric circles to reinvent shamanism in a modern form, often drawing from core shamanism —a set of beliefs and practices synthesized by Michael Harner —centered use of ritual drumming and dance, and Harner&apos;s interpretations of various indigenous religions. Harner has faced criticism for taking pieces of diverse religions out of their cultural contexts and synthesising a set of universal shamanic techniques. Some neoshamans focus on the ritual use of entheogens [ April 2012 ], as well as embrace the philosophies of chaos magic [ April 2012 ] while others (such as Jan Fries { Visual Magic:A Manual of Freestyle Shamanism:Jan Fries ISBN 1-869928-57-1 } ) have created their own forms of shamanism. European-based neoshamanic traditions are focused upon the researched or imagined traditions of ancient Europe, where many mystical practices and belief systems were suppressed by the Christian church. Some of these practitioners express a desire to practice a system that is based upon their own ancestral traditions. Some anthropologists and practitioners have discussed the impact of such neoshamanism as &quot; giving extra pay &quot; (Harvey, 1997 and elsewhere) to indigenous American traditions, particularly as many pagan or heathen shamanic practitioners do not call themselves shamans, but instead use specific names derived from the European traditions -they work within such as völva or seidkona ( seid-woman ) of the sagas (see Blain 2002, Wallis 2003). Many New Age spiritual seekers travel to Peru to work with ayahuasqueros, shamans who engage in the ritual use of ayahuasca, a psychedelic tea which has been documented to cure everything from depression to addiction. When taking ayahuasca, participants frequently report meeting spirits and receiving divine revelations. Shamanistic techniques have also been used in New Age therapies which use enactment and association with other realities as an intervention. { ULL – Universidad de La Laguna } { Encyclopedia of NLP } [ Criticism of the term ] A tableau presenting figures of various cultures filling in mediator-like roles, often being termed as &quot; shaman &quot; in the literature. The tableau presents the diversity of this concept. Certain anthropologists, most notably Alice Kehoe in her book Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking, are highly critical of the term &quot; shaman &quot;. Part of this criticism involves the notion of cultural appropriation. [ July 2007 ] This includes criticism of New Age and modern Western forms of shamanism, which may not only misrepresent or dilute genuine indigenous practices but do so in a way that, according to Kehoe, reinforces racist ideas such as the Noble Savage. Kehoe is highly critical of Mircea Eliade &apos;s work on shamanism as an invention synthesized from various sources unsupported by more direct research. To Kehoe, what some scholars of shamanism treat as being definitive of shamanism (most notably drumming, trance, chanting, entheogens and hallucinogens, spirit communication and healing) are practices that exist outside of what is defined as shamanism and play similar roles even in non-shamanic cultures (such as the role of chanting in Judeo-Christian and Islamic rituals) and that in their expression are unique to each culture that uses them and cannot be generalized easily, accurately or usefully into a global religion of shamanism. Because of this, Kehoe is also highly critical of the notion that shamanism is an ancient, unchanged, and surviving religion from the Paleolithic period. Mihály Hoppál also discusses whether the term &quot; shamanism &quot; is appropriate. He recommends using the term &quot; shamanhood &quot; or &quot; shamanship &quot; { Hoppál &amp; Szathmári &amp; Takács 2006: 14 } (a term used in old Russian and German ethnographic reports at the beginning of the 20th century) for stressing the diversity and the specific features of the discussed cultures. He believes that this places more stress on the local variations and emphasizes that shamanism is not a religion of sacred dogma s, but linked to the everyday life in a practical way. { Hoppál 1998:40 } Following similar thoughts, he also conjectures a contemporary paradigm shift. { ISSR, 2001 Summer, abstract online in 2nd half of 2nd paragraph) } Piers Vitebsky also mentions that, despite really astonishing similarities, there is no unity in shamanism. The various, fragmented shamanistic practices and beliefs coexist with other beliefs everywhere. There is no record of pure shamanistic societies (although, as for the past, their existence is not impossible). { Vitebsky 1996:11 } [ See also ] [ 3 ] Alberto Villoldo Astral spirits Animism Carlos Castaneda Cultural imperialism Curandero Heaven worship Inuit Itako Mana Machi (Shaman) Munay-ki Nature worship Neuroanthropology Neurotheology Ovoo Paganism Panentheism Peyote Plastic shaman Power animal Prehistoric medicine Religion in China Sacred Hoop Magazine Seið Shaman&apos;s Drum Journal Shapeshifting Shintō Shramana Soul catcher Spirit spouse (in dreams) Technoshamanism Tengri Terence McKenna Thoughtform Turkic people Witch doctor Yatiri Zduhać [ Notes ] [ 30em ] [ References ] [ Barüske Heinz Eskimo Märchen Die Märchen der Weltliteratur Eugen Diederichs Verlag Düsseldorf • Köln 1969 German ] [ Boglár Lajos A kultúra arcai.
