There&apos;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom is the title of a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959. [ http://metamodern.com/2009/12/29/theres-plenty-of-room-at-the-bottom%E2%80%9D-feynman-1959/ There&apos;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom Eric Drexler ] Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual atom s as a more powerful form of synthetic chemistry than those used at the time. The talk is considered to be a seminal event in the history of nanotechnology, as it inspired the conceptual beginnings of the field decades later. [ Conception ] Feynman considered a number of interesting ramifications of a general ability to manipulate matter on an atomic scale. He was particularly interested in the possibilities of denser computer circuitry, and microscope s which could see things much smaller than is possible with scanning electron microscope s. These ideas were later realized by the use of the scanning tunneling microscope, the atomic force microscope and other examples of probe microscopy and storage systems such as Millipede, created by researchers at IBM. Feynman also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make nanoscale machines that &quot; arrange the atoms the way we want &quot;, and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation. He also presented the &quot; weird possibility &quot; of &quot; swallowing the doctor, &quot; an idea which he credited in the essay to his friend and graduate student Albert Hibbs. This concept involved building a tiny, swallowable surgical robot by developing a set of one-quarter-scale manipulator hands slaved to the operator&apos;s hands to build one-quarter scale machine tools analogous to those found in any machine shop. This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve massively parallel operations. He uses the analogy of a pantograph as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1942 story Waldo. { Colin Milburn. Nanovision: Engineering the Future. Duke University Press, 2008. ISBN 0-8223-4265-0 } { Ed Regis. Nano. Bantam, 1997. ISBN 0-553-50476-2 } As the sizes got smaller, one would have to redesign some tools, because the relative strength of various forces would change. Although gravity would become unimportant, surface tension would become more important, Van der Waals attraction would become important, etc. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment, although it has been noted that some types of biological enzymes and enzyme complexes (especially ribosomes ) function chemically in a way close to Feynman&apos;s vision. [ Challenges ] At the meeting, Feynman concluded his talk with two challenges, and he offered a prize of $1000 for the first individuals to solve each one. The first challenge involved the construction of a tiny motor, which, to Feynman&apos;s surprise, was achieved by November 1960 by William McLellan, a meticulous craftsman, using conventional tools. The motor met the conditions, but did not advance the art. The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire Encyclopædia Britannica on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale. In 1985, Tom Newman, a Stanford graduate student, successfully reduced the first paragraph of A Tale of Two Cities by 1/25,000, and collected the second Feynman prize.

Eric Drexler later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology. After Feynman&apos;s death, scholars studying the historical development of nanotechnology have concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman’s talk, along with the record of citations to “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature. { Chris Toumey. “Apostolic Succession.” Engineering &amp; Science 1/2 (2005): 16-23. } { Chris Toumey. &quot; Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science &quot; } [ November 2011 ] {. Techné 13.3 (2008):133-168. } In Toumey&apos;s 2008 article, &quot; Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology &quot;, he found 11 versions of the publication of “Plenty of Room &quot;, plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, “Infinitesimal Machinery,” which Feynman called “Plenty of Room, Revisited.” Also in Toumey’s references are videotapes of that second talk. Toumey found that the published versions of Feynman’s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981. Subsequently, interest in “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s. This is probably because the term “nanotechnology” gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, &apos;&apos;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology&apos;&apos;, which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined &quot; Nanotechnology &quot;, published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, &apos;&apos;OMNI&apos;&apos;. [ Fred Hapgood 1986 November &quot; Nanotechnology &quot; / &quot; Tinytech &quot; 56 Omni ] [ Eric Drexler The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/ Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology 13 May 2011 15 December 2009 ] The journal Nanotechnology was launched in 1989; the famous Eigler-Schweizer experiment, precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in Nature in April 1990; and Science had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991. These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman’s “Plenty of Room” gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman. Toumey’s analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that “Plenty of Room” did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date. Feynman&apos;s stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past. More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President Clinton January 2000 speech calling for a Federal program: [ My budget supports a major new National Nanotechnology Initiative, worth $500 million. Caltech is no stranger to the idea of nanotechnology ­ the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular level. Over 40 years ago, Caltech&apos;s own Richard Feynman asked, &quot; What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them? &quot; Remarks at the California Institute of Technology, January 21, 2000, Public Papers of William J. Clinton, January 1-June 26, 2000, p. 96 ] [ Feynman the teacher ] There was also a version of this talk, with the same name, that Feynman gave to high school students. [ August 2008 ] One place that it was given was Los Angeles High School, in about 1960, to a group of fifty selected high school physics students. [ December 2011 ] Feynman was also known for his talks in low level science classes. He would ask to teach these classes, which would then be attended by graduate students, or even professors. His unique teaching style allowed him to take incredibly complicated subjects and transform them into a series of lectures that even his rudimentary physics students were capable of comprehending and applying.
