[ March 2012 ] Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and the closely related resting metabolic rate (RMR), is the amount of daily energy expended by humans and other animals at rest. Rest is defined as existing in a neutrally temperate environment while in the post- absorptive state. In plants, different considerations apply. The release, and using, of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs, the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin. [ Description ] The body&apos;s generation of heat is known as thermogenesis and it can be measured to determine the amount of energy expended.BMR decreases with age generally (as people usually don&apos;t maintain lean body mass) and with the loss of lean body mass. Increasing muscle mass increases BMR. Aerobic fitness level, a product of cardiovascular exercise, while previously thought to have effect on BMR, has been shown in the 1990s not to correlate with BMR, when fat-free body mass was adjusted for. [ June 2011 ] New research [ April 2009 ] has, however, come to light that suggests anaerobic exercise does increase resting energy consumption (see &quot; Aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise &quot; ). Illness, previously consumed food and beverages, environmental temperature, and stress levels can affect one&apos;s overall energy expenditure as well as one&apos;s BMR. Indirect calorimetry laboratory with canopy hood (dilution technique) BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances when a person is awake. An accurate BMR measurement requires that the person&apos;s sympathetic nervous system not be stimulated, a condition which requires complete rest. A more common and closely related measurement, used under less strict conditions, is resting metabolic rate (RMR). [ CaloriesPerHour.com Diet and Weight Loss Tutorial Calculating BMR and RMR http://www.caloriesperhour.com/tutorial_BMR.php 2008-01-26 ] BMR and RMR are measured by gas analysis through either direct or indirect calorimetry, though a rough estimation can be acquired through an equation using age, sex, height, and weight. Studies of energy metabolism using both methods provide convincing evidence for the validity of the respiratory quotient (R.Q.), which measures the inherent composition and utilization of carbohydrate s, fat s and protein s as they are converted to energy substrate units that can be used by the body as energy. Studies conducted by Spennewyn in 1990 found strong correlations between lean mass and metabolism based on indirect calorimetry measurements. Spennewyn discovered that lean tissue in men and women required approximately 16 calories per pound per day. [ June 2011 ] Thus, once a lean mass was known it could be multiplied by 16 to reveal daily caloric needs based on the activity level of the individual. This method has been used in many health club environments to determine daily caloric needs. [ Nutrition and dietary considerations ] Basal metabolism is usually by far the largest component of total caloric expenditure. However, the Harris-Benedict equation s are only approximate and variation in BMR (reflecting varying body composition), in physical activity levels, and in energy expended in thermogenesis make it difficult to estimate the dietary consumption any particular individual needs in order to maintain body weight. [ Physiology ] Both basal metabolic rate and resting metabolic rate are usually expressed in terms of daily rates of energy expenditure. The early work of the scientists J. Arthur Harris and Francis G. Benedict showed that approximate values could be derived using body surface area (computed from height and weight), age, and sex, along with the oxygen and carbon dioxide measures taken from calorimetry. Studies also showed that by eliminating the sex differences that occur with the accumulation of adipose tissue by expressing metabolic rate per unit of &quot; fat-free &quot; or lean body weight, the values between sexes for basal metabolism are essentially the same. [ May 2008 ] Exercise physiology textbooks have tables to show the conversion of height and body surface area as they relate to weight and basal metabolic values. The primary organ responsible for regulating metabolism is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is located on the diencephalon and forms the floor and part of the lateral walls of the third ventricle of the cerebrum. The chief functions of the hypothalamus are: The ANS regulates contraction of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, along with secretions of many endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland (associated with many metabolic disorders). Through the ANS, the hypothalamus is the main regulator of visceral activities, such as heart rate, movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract, and contraction of the urinary bladder. { production and regulation of feelings of rage and aggression } { regulation of body temperature } { regulation of food intake, through two centers: } The feeding center or hunger center is responsible for the sensations that cause us to seek food. When sufficient food or substrates have been received and leptin is high, then the satiety center is stimulated and sends impulses that inhibit the feeding center. When insufficient food is present in the stomach and ghrelin levels are high, receptors in the hypothalamus initiate the sense of hunger. The thirst center operates similarly when certain cells in the hypothalamus are stimulated by the rising osmotic pressure of the extracellular fluid. If thirst is satisfied, osmotic pressure decreases. All of these functions taken together form a survival mechanism that causes us to sustain the body processes that BMR and RMR measure. [ BMR estimation formulas ] Several prediction equations exist. Historically most notable was Harris-Benedict equation, which was created in 1919. The original equations from Harris and Benedict are: for men, P = \left ( \frac {13.7516 m} {1 ~ \mbox {kg}} + \frac {5.0033 h} {1 ~ \mbox {cm}} - \frac {6.7550 a} {1 ~ \mbox {year}} + 66.4730 \right ) \frac {\mbox {kcal}} {\mbox {day}} for women, P = \left ( \frac {9.5634 m} {1 ~ \mbox {kg}} + \frac {1.8496 h} {1 ~ \mbox {cm}} - \frac {4.6756 a} {1 ~ \mbox {year}} + 655.0955 \right ) \frac {\mbox {kcal}} {\mbox {day}} where P is total heat production at complete rest, m is the weight, h is the height, and a is the age, and with the difference in BMR for men and women being mainly due to differences in body weight. [ Harris J, Benedict F A Biometric Study of Human Basal Metabolism PNAS 4 12 370–3 1918 16576330 10.1073/pnas.4.12.370 1091498 1918PNAS....4..370H ] For example, a 55 year old woman weighing 130  lb (59  kg) and 5 feet 6  inches (168  cm) tall would have a BMR of 1272  kcal per day or 53  kcal/h (61.3 watts). It was the best prediction equation until 1990, when Mifflin et al. [ 2305711 1990 Mifflin MD St Jeor ST Hill LA Scott BJ Daugherty SA Koh YO A new predictive equation for resting energy expenditure in healthy individuals 51 2 241–7 The American journal of clinical nutrition ] [ January 2012 ] introduced the equation: P = \left ( \frac {10.0 m} {1 ~ \mbox {kg}} + \frac {6.25 h} {1 ~ \mbox {cm}} - \frac {5.0 a} {1 ~ \mbox {year}} + s \right ) \frac {\mbox {kcal}} {\mbox {day}}, where s is +5 for males and &amp; minus;161 for females. According to this formula, the woman in the example above has a BMR of 1204  kcal per day.During the last 100 years, lifestyles have changed and Frankenfield et al. [ 775–89 10.1016/j.jada.2005.02.005 Comparison of Predictive Equations for Resting Metabolic Rate in Healthy Nonobese and Obese Adults: A Systematic Review 2005 Frankenfield David Roth-Yousey Lori Compher Charlene Journal of the American Dietetic Association 105 5 15883556 ] showed it to be about 5% more accurate. These formulas are based on body weight, which does not take into account the difference in metabolic activity between lean body mass and body fat. Other formulas exist which take into account lean body mass, two of which are the Katch-McArdle formula, and Cunningham formula. It should be noted, however, that the Cunningham formula is used to predict RMR instead of BMR. [ March 2012 ] The Katch-McArdle Formula (BMR): [ Tom Venuto Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle 2003 0-9724132-0-0 ] [ March 2012 ] P = 370 + \left( {21.6 \cdot LBM} \right), where LBM is the lean body mass in kg. According to this formula, if the woman in the example has a body fat percentage of 30%, her BMR would be 1263  kcal per day. The Cunningham Formula (RMR): P = 500 + \left( {22 \cdot LBM} \right), where LBM is the lean body mass in kg Since lean body mass is metabolically active vs. fat cells which need very few calories to be sustained, these formula tend to be more accurate, especially with athletes who have above average lean mass and little body fat. To calculate daily calorie needs, the BMR value is multiplied by a factor with a value between 1.2 and 1.9, depending on the person&apos;s activity level. [ Causes of individual differences in BMR ] The basal metabolic rate varies between individuals. One study of 150 adults representative of the population in Scotland reported basal metabolic rates from as low as 1027 kcal per day (4301 kJ) to as high as 2499 kcal (10455 kJ); with a mean BMR of 1500 kcal (6279 kJ). Statistically, the researchers calculated that 62.3 % of this variation was explained by differences in fat free mass. Other factors explaining the variation included fat mass (6.7 %), age (1.7%), and experimental error including within-subject difference (2 %). The rest of the variation (26.7 %) was unexplained. This remaining difference was not explained by sex nor by differing tissue sized of highly energetic organs such as the brain. [ 2305711 2005 Johnstone Alexandra M Murison Sandra D Duncan Jackie S Rance Kellie A Speakman John R Factors influencing variation in basal metabolic rate include fat-free mass, fat mass, age, and circulating thyroxine but not sex, circulating leptin, or triiodothyronine 82 5 941–948 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition Koh YO ] Thus there are differences in BMR even when comparing two subjects with the same lean body mass. The top 5% of people are metabolizing energy 28-32% faster than individuals with the lowest 5% BMR. [ 15674765 2004 Speakman John R. Król Elzbieta Johnson Maria S. The Functional Signiﬁcance of Individual Variation in Basal Metabolic Rate 77 6 900–915 Physiological and Biochemical Zoolog 10.1086/427059 ] For instance, one study reported an extreme case where two individuals with the same lean body mass of 43 kg had BMRs of 1075 kcal/day (4.5 MJ) and 1790 kcal/day (7.5 MJ). This difference of 715 kcal (67%) is equivalent to one of the individuals completing a 10 kilometer run every day. [ Animal BMR ] Kleiber&apos;s law relates the BMR for animals of different sizes and the observations indicate that the BMR is proportional to the 3/4 power of body mass. Warm blooded, cold blooded and unicellular organisms fit on different curves. [ Biochemistry ] Energy expenditure breakdown Liver 27% Brain 19% Heart 7% Kidneys 10% Skeletal muscle 18% Other organs 19% &apos;&apos;Postprandial thermogenesis&apos;&apos; increases in basal metabolic rate occur at different degrees depending on consumed food composition. About 70% of a human&apos;s total energy expenditure is due to the basal life processes within the organs of the body (see table). About 20% of one&apos;s energy expenditure comes from physical activity and another 10% from thermogenesis, or digestion of food (postprandial thermogenesis). [ Exercise Physiology 2nd William D. McArdle 1986 Lea &amp; Febigier Philadelphia ] [ January 2012 ] All of these processes require an intake of oxygen along with coenzymes to provide energy for survival (usually from macronutrients like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and expel carbon dioxide, due to processing by the Krebs cycle. For the BMR, most of the energy is consumed in maintaining fluid levels in tissues through osmosis, and only about one-tenth is consumed for mechanical work, such as digestion, heartbeat, and breathing. [ Lisa Gordon-Davis Hospitality Industry Handbook on Nutrition and Menu Planning 2004 112 Juta and Company Ltd 978-0-7021-5578-9 http://books.google.com/?id%3DqhJNdB5Vw6AC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA112%26amp%3Bdq%3DBMR%2Bfactors#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3DBMR%20factors%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse ] What enables the Krebs cycle to perform metabolic changes to fats, carbohydrates, and proteins is energy, which can be defined as the ability or capacity to do work. The breakdown of large molecules into smaller molecules — associated with release of energy — is catabolism. The building up process is termed anabolism. The breakdown of proteins into amino acids is an example of catabolism, while the formation of proteins from amino acids is an anabolic process. Exergonic reaction s are energy-releasing reactions and are generally catabolic. Endergonic reactions require energy and include anabolic reactions and the contraction of muscle. Metabolism is the total of all catabolic, exergonic, anabolic, endergonic reactions. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the intermediate molecule that drives the exergonic transfer of energy to switch to endergonic anabolic reactions used in muscle contraction. This is what causes muscles to work which can require a breakdown, and also to build in the rest period, which occurs during the strengthening phase associated with muscular contraction. ATP is composed of adenine, a nitrogen containing base, ribose, a five carbon sugar (collectively called adenosine), and three phosphate groups. ATP is a high energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups. The breaking of these chemical bonds in the Krebs Cycle provides the energy needed for muscular contraction. [ Glucose ] Because the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms in all carbohydrates is always the same as that in water — that is, 2 to 1 — all of the oxygen consumed by the cells is used to oxidize the carbon in the carbohydrate molecule to form carbon dioxide. Consequently, during the complete oxidation of a glucose molecule, six molecules of carbon dioxide are produced and six molecules of oxygen are consumed. The overall equation for this reaction is: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2 → 6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O Because the gas exchange in this reaction is equal, the respiratory quotient for carbohydrate is unity or 1.0: R.Q. = 6 CO 2 / 6 O 2 [ Fats ] The chemical composition for fats differs from that of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, dietary cholesterol, and trans fatty acid. From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated fatty acid than an unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acid molecule is broken down and categorized based on the number of carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated fatty acid molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids. Palmitic acid is a commonly studied example of the saturated fatty acid molecule. The overall equation for the substrate utilization of palmitic acid is: C 16 H 32 O 2 + 23 O 2 → 16 CO 2 + 16 H 2 O Thus the R.Q. for palmitic acid is 0.696: R.Q. = 16 CO 2 / 23 O 2 = 0.696 [ Proteins ] Proteins are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen arranged in a variety of ways to form a large combination of amino acids. Unlike fat the body has no storage deposits of protein. All of it is contained in the body as important parts of tissues, blood hormones, and enzymes. The structural components of the body that contain these amino acids are continually undergoing a process of breakdown and replacement. The respiratory quotient for protein metabolism can be demonstrated by the chemical equation for oxidation of albumin: C 72 H 112 N 18 O 22 S + 77 O 2 → 63 CO 2 + 38 H 2 O + SO 3 + 9 CO(NH 2 ) 2 The R.Q. for albumin is 63 CO 2 / 77 O 2 = 0.818 The reason this is important in the process of understanding protein metabolism is that the body can blend the three macronutrients and based on the mitochondrial density, a preferred ratio can be established which determines how much fuel is utilized in which packets for work accomplished by the muscles. Protein catabolism (breakdown) has been estimated to supply 10% to 15% of the total energy requirement during a two hour training session. However, if a person&apos;s muscle glycogen supplies are low from previous exercise sessions, the amount of energy derived from protein catabolism could increase from 15% to 45%. This process could severely degrade the protein structures needed to maintain survival such as contractile properties of proteins in the heart, cellular mitochondria, myoglobin storage, and metabolic enzymes within muscles. The oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein is not normally metabolized significantly, except during long term starvation and long bouts of exercise (greater than 90 minutes.) At rest approximately 70% of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from carbohydrates. Following the onset of activity, as the intensity of the exercise increases, there is a shift in substrate preference from fats to carbohydrates. During high intensity aerobic exercise, almost 100% of the energy is derived from carbohydrates, if an adequate supply is available. [ Aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise ] Studies published in 1992 [ 1550061 1992 Broeder CE Burrhus KA Svanevik LS Wilmore JH The effects of aerobic fitness on resting metabolic rate 55 4 795–801 The American journal of clinical nutrition ] and 1997 [ 9029211 1997 Smith DA Dollman J Withers RT Brinkman M Keeves JP Clark DG Relationship between maximum aerobic power and resting metabolic rate in young adult women 82 1 156–63 Journal of applied physiology ] indicate that the level of aerobic fitness of an individual does not have any correlation with the level of resting metabolism. Both studies find that aerobic fitness levels do not improve the predictive power of fat free mass for resting metabolic rate. Anaerobic exercise — such as weight lifting — builds additional muscle mass. Muscle contributes to the fat-free mass of an individual and therefore effective results from anaerobic exercise will increase BMR. [ 1986 Ravussin E Lillioja S Christin L Bogardus C Determinants of 24-hour energy expenditure in man. Methods and results using a respiratory chamber 78 6 1568–1578 The Journal of Clinical Invertigation 10.1172/JCI112749 Bogardus C ] It should be noted however, that the actual effect on BMR is controversial and difficult to enumerate. Various studies [ 1994 Campbell W Crim M Young V Evans W Increased energy requirements and changes in body composition with resistance training in older adults 60 167–175 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 8030593 2 ] [ 1994 Pratley R Nicklas B Rubin M Miller J Strength training increases resting metabolic rate and norepinephrine levels in healthy 50- to 65-year-old men 76 133–137 Journal of Applied Physiology 8175496 Smith A Smith M Hurley B Goldberg A 1 ] suggest that the resting metabolic rate of trained muscle is around 55kJ per kilogram, per day. Even a substantial increase in muscle mass, say 5kg, would make only a minor impact on BMR. Some studies [ January 2012 ] suggest that a minimum of 20 to 25 minutes of cardiovascular training per day can temporarily increase the basal metabolic rate by around 10%, owing to an increase in the metabolism of the working muscles required for recovery as well as storage of glycogen and other fuel sources used by the body like ATP and Creatine. [ Longevity ] [ heartbeat hypothesis ] In 1926 Raymond Pearl proposed that longevity varies inversely with basal metabolic rate (the &quot; rate of living hypothesis &quot; ). Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that mammals with larger body size have longer maximum life span s and the fact that the longevity of fruit flies varies inversely with ambient temperature. [ 347–70 10.1016/0047-6374(76)90034-8 Effects of temperature on the lifespan, vitality and fine structure of Drosophila melanogaster 1976 Miquel Jaime Lundgren Paul R. Bensch Klaus G.

Animals also vary in the degree of coupling between oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, the amount of saturated fat in mitochondrial membrane s, the amount of DNA repair, and many other factors that affect maximum life span.

The link between aging and energetics 132 6 Suppl 2 1583S–97S The Journal of nutrition ] [ Organism longevity and basal metabolic rate ] In allometric scaling, maximum potential life span (MPLS) is directly related to metabolic rate (MR), where MR is the recharge rate of a biomass made up of covalent bonds. That biomass (W) is subjected to deterioration over time from thermodynamic, entropic pressure. Metabolism is essentially understood as redox coupling, and has nothing to do with thermogenesis. Metabolic efficiency (ME) is then expressed as the efficiency of this coupling, a ratio of ampere s [ December 2010 Why electric charge appears here out of a sudden? ] captured and used by biomass, to the amperes available for that purpose. MR is measured in watts, W is measured in grams. These factors are combined in a power law, an elaboration on Kleiber&apos;s law relating MR to W and MPLS, that appears as MR = W^ (4ME-1)/4ME. [ December 2010 Where is MPLS in this equation? Why MR is not in watts as described one sentence earlier? ] When ME is 100%, MR = W^3/4, what is known popularly as quarter power scaling, a version of allometric scaling premised upon unreal estimations of biological efficiency. The equation reveals that as ME drops below 20%, for W &lt; one gram, MR/MPLS increases so dramatically as to endow W with virtual immortality by 16%. The smaller W is to begin with, the more dramatic is the increase in MR as ME diminishes. All of the cells of an organism fit into this range, i.e., less than one gram, and so this MR will be referred to as BMR. But the equation reveals that as ME increases over 25%, BMR approaches zero. The equation also shows that for all W &gt; one gram, where W is the organization of all of the BMRs of the organism&apos;s structure, but also includes the activity of the structure, as ME increases over 25%, MR/MPLS increases rather than decreases, as it does for BMR. An MR made up of an organization of BMRs will be referred to as an FMR. [ December 2010 What FMR stands for? ] As ME decreases below 25%, FMR diminishes rather than increases as it does for BMR. The antagonism between FMR and BMR is what marks the process of aging of biomass W in energetic terms. The ME for the organism is the same as that for the cells, such that the success of the organism&apos;s ability to find food (and lower its ME), is key to maintaining the BMR of the cells driven, otherwise, by starvation, to approaching zero; while at the same time a lower ME diminishes the FMR/MPLS of the organism. [ February 2009 ] [ Medical considerations ] A person&apos;s metabolism varies with their physical condition and activity. Weight training can have a longer impact on metabolism than aerobic training, but there are no known mathematical formulas that can exactly predict the length and duration of a raised metabolism from trophic changes with anabolic neuromuscular training. A decrease in food intake can lower the metabolic rate as the body tries to conserve energy. Researcher Gary Foster, Ph.D., estimates that a very low calorie diet of fewer than 800 calories a day would reduce the metabolic rate by more than 10 percent. { Whitman, Stacy &quot; The Truth about Metabolism. &quot; Shape. September 2003. } The metabolic rate can be affected by some drugs, such as antidepressant s, which may produce weight gain. Antithyroid agent s, drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism, such as propylthiouracil and methimazole, bring the metabolic rate down to normal and restore euthyroid ism. Some research has focused on developing antiobesity drugs to raise the metabolic rate, such as drugs to stimulate thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Studies of humans with 100+ year life spans have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, their resulting lowered metabolic rate is thought to attribute to their increased life expectancy. The metabolic rate may be elevated in stress, illness, and diabetes. Menopause may also affect metabolism. [ Cardiovascular implications ] Heart rate is determined by the medulla oblongata and part of the pons, two organs located inferior to the hypothalamus on the brain stem. Heart rate is important for basal metabolic rate and resting metabolic rate because it drives the blood supply, stimulating the Krebs cycle. [ April 2011 ] During exercise that achieves the anaerobic threshold, it is possible to deliver substrates that are desired for optimal energy utilization. The anaerobic threshold is defined as the energy utilization level of heart rate exertion that occurs without oxygen during a standardized test with a specific protocol for accuracy of measurement, [ April 2011 ] such as the Bruce Treadmill protocol (see Metabolic equivalent ). With four to six weeks of targeted training the body systems can adapt to a higher perfusion of mitochondrial density for increased oxygen availability for the Krebs cycle, or tricarboxylic cycle, or the glycolitic cycle. [ April 2011 ] This in turn leads to a lower resting heart rate, lower blood pressure, and increased resting or basal metabolic rate. [ April 2011 ] By measuring heart rate we can then derive estimations of what level of substrate utilization is actually causing biochemical metabolism in our bodies at rest or in activity. [ April 2011 ] This in turn can help a person to maintain an appropriate level of consumption and utilization by studying a graphical representation of the anaerobic threshold. This can be confirmed by blood tests and gas analysis using either direct or indirect calorimetry to show the effect of substrate utilization. [ April 2011 ] The measures of basal metabolic rate and resting metabolic rate are becoming essential tools for maintaining a healthy body weight.
