[ This article is about the overall graph theory concept of a Hamiltonian path. For the specific problem of determining whether a Hamiltonian path or cycle exists in a given graph, see Hamiltonian path problem. ] { dodecahedron. Like all } { platonic solid s, the dodecahedron is Hamiltonian. } { Herschel graph is the smallest possible } { polyhedral graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. } In the mathematical field of graph theory, a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete. Hamiltonian paths and cycles are named after William Rowan Hamilton who invented the Icosian game, now also known as Hamilton&apos;s puzzle, which involves finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron. Hamilton solved this problem using the Icosian Calculus, an algebraic structure based on roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternion s (also invented by Hamilton). This solution does not generalize to arbitrary graphs. However, despite being named after Hamilton, Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra had also been studied a year earlier by Thomas Kirkman. [ Biggs N. L. 10.1112/blms/13.2.97 2 The Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society 608093 97–120 T. P. Kirkman, mathematician 13 1981 ] {. } [ Definitions ] A Hamiltonian path or traceable path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. A graph is Hamiltonian-connected if for every pair of vertices there is a Hamiltonian path between the two vertices. A Hamiltonian cycle, Hamiltonian circuit, vertex tour or graph cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once(except the vertex that is both the start and end, and so is visited twice). A graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle is called a Hamiltonian graph. Similar notions may be defined for directed graph s, where each edge (arc) of a path or cycle can only be traced in a single direction (i.e., the vertices are connected with arrows and the edges traced &quot; tail-to-head &quot; ). A Hamiltonian decomposition is an edge decomposition of a graph into Hamiltonian circuits. This is one of the known but unsolved problems. [ May 2011 ] [ Examples ] [ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] a complete graph with more than two vertices is Hamiltonian every cycle graph is Hamiltonian every tournament has an odd number of Hamiltonian paths every platonic solid, considered as a graph, is Hamiltonian every prism is Hamiltonian The Deltoidal hexecontahedron is the only non-hamiltonian Archimedean dual Every antiprism is Hamiltonian A maximal planar graph with no separating triangles is Hamiltonian. [ Properties ] Any Hamiltonian cycle can be converted to a Hamiltonian path by removing one of its edges, but a Hamiltonian path can be extended to Hamiltonian cycle only if its endpoints are adjacent. The line graph of a Hamiltonian graph is Hamiltonian. The line graph of an Eulerian graph is Hamiltonian [ May 2011 ]. A tournament (with more than 2 vertices) is Hamiltonian if and only if it is strongly connected. The problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle may be used as the basis of a zero-knowledge proof. The number of different Hamiltonian cycles in a complete undirected graph on n vertices is [ (n- 1)! / 2 ] and in a complete directed graph on n vertices is [ (n- 1)! ]. [ Bondy–Chvátal theorem ] The best vertex degree characterization of Hamiltonian graphs was provided in 1972 by the Bondy – Chvátal theorem, which generalizes earlier results by G. A. Dirac (1952) and Øystein Ore. In fact, both Dirac&apos;s and Ore&apos;s theorems are less powerful than what can be derived from Pósa &apos;s theorem (1962). Dirac and Ore&apos;s theorems basically state that a graph is Hamiltonian if it has enough edges. First we have to define the closure of a graph. Given a graph G with n vertices, the closure cl(G) is uniquely constructed from G by repeatedly adding a new edge uv connecting a nonadjacent pair of vertices u and v with [ degree(v) + degree(u) ≥ n ] until no more pairs with this property can be found. Bondy–Chvátal theorem A graph is Hamiltonian if and only if its closure is Hamiltonian. As complete graphs are Hamiltonian, all graphs whose closure is complete are Hamiltonian, which is the content of the following earlier theorems by Dirac and Ore. Dirac (1952) [ n≥ 3 ] [ n/ 2 ] A simple graph with n vertices ( ) is Hamiltonian if each vertex has degree or greater. Graham, p. 20. Ore (1960) A graph with n vertices (n ≥ 3) is Hamiltonian if, for each pair of non-adjacent vertices, the sum of their degrees is n or greater (see Ore&apos;s theorem ). The following theorems can be regarded as directed versions: Ghouila-Houiri (1960) A strongly connected simple directed graph with n vertices is Hamiltonian if some vertex has a full degree smaller than n. Meyniel (1973) [ 2n− 1 ] A strongly connected simple directed graph with n vertices is Hamiltonian if the sum of full degrees of some two distinct non-adjacent vertices is smaller than. The number of vertices must be doubled because each undirected edge corresponds to two directed arcs and thus the degree of a vertex in the directed graph is twice the degree in the undirected graph.
