[ History ] The town was the home of the Tyson Buggy Company, a predominant cart and buggy manufacturer in the 1800s. After the closing of the Tyson Buggy Company, Henry Ford was interested in buying the old plant and converting it into a car assembly line; however, the owners refused to let Ford buy the plant and so he moved on to build a plant in Detroit. A few years afterwards the Tyson Buggy plant burned down. The town was also originally to be the home of the University of North Carolina; however, city leaders determined that they didn&apos;t want the university built there. City leaders told the State that Carthage was on too steep of a hill for locomotives to climb and that access to the University would be limited if built there. The town now has an annual event that takes place every spring called the Buggy Festival. This event is used to showcase the history of the town as well as show off music, hot rods, old tractors, old buggies made by the Tyson Buggy Company, and crafts from potteries in the surrounding areas. This event takes place in the town square around the Old Court House, considered to be a historic landmark.
