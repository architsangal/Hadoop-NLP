On April 20, 2007 a Cessna 182 crashed after its left wing struck the tether anchoring &quot; Fat Albert &quot;. The aerostat is marked on air navigation charts inside a restricted area that contains the warning, &quot; Caution: Unmarked balloon on cable to 14,000 [feet]. &quot; Possibly named for the Joewood tree ( Jacquinia keyensis ), a native species which is also known as cudjoewood. A more likely derivation for the name is offered by writer John Viele of Summerland Key. He believes that Cudjoe, a very common West Africa n name, was the name of a fugitive slave or free negro who lived on the island at some point prior to Gerdes&apos; survey in 1849. { http://keys.fiu.edu/gazetteer/00000216.htm &quot; Key Names &quot; Florida Keys Gazetteer } [ Geography ] Cudjoe Key is located at [ 24 39 51 N 81 28 56 W type:city ] (24.664298, -81.482339) [ 1 ].
