[ 6 ] The population was 1,461 at the 2010 census. In contrast to the Shoshone Native American tribe for which it is named, the city&apos;s name is correctly pronounced &quot; Show-shown, &quot; with a silent &apos;e&apos;. [ History ] Shoshone has long been considered the main railroad station in Idaho&apos;s Magic Valley region. The much larger community of Twin Falls [ 26 mi km ] to the south never developed a strong railroad presence due to the logistical issues presented by its location south of the Snake River Canyon. For many years Shoshone was the only Amtrak stop in south central Idaho. A few miles north of Shoshone are the Shoshone Ice Caves, hollow subterranean lava tubes that stay cool enough for the ice inside them to remain frozen throughout the summer. In the days before refrigeration, this feature, coupled with the railroad, made Shoshone popular with travelers as &quot; the only place for hundreds of miles where one could get a cold beer. &quot; [ Economy ] Today, Shoshone still has one bar, but also boasts a cafe, a movie theater, and a grocery store—unusual for such a small town. While limited retail jobs exist, Shoshone is primarily a farming and dairy community. Shoshone is home to a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) facility with a helipad. The town also has a small medical clinic, and recently built a new K-12 school building. In recent years Shoshone has become a bedroom community for people working in neighboring Blaine County due to an often dramatic difference in cost of living between the two locales. The resort cities of Ketchum and Sun Valley are [ 55 mi km ] north on Highway 75. This commuting phenomenon has contributed greatly to recent growth in the Shoshone area. Shoshone also has a few historical buildings. [ Culture ] Shoshone hosts the Mannie Shaw&apos;s Old Time Fiddler&apos;s Jamboree in the city park each year on the second Sunday in July.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 1.0 sqmi km2 ], all land, though the Little Wood River runs through the town. Much of the land around Shoshone is lava rock, which can make excavation for building problematic, and limits the amount of useful farmland.

There has been a small amount of new construction and Shoshone has experienced slow growth since the year 2000, due in part to commuters who work in Sun Valley but choose to live in Shoshone because of the comparatively lower cost of living.
