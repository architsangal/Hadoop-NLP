He belongs to Al-Bedairya Al-Dahmashya a religious clan of the larger ja&apos;alin tribe, an Arab tribe of hashimite origin in middle north of Sudan, then part of the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan. He received his primary education there, and his family later moved to Khartoum where he completed his secondary education. Al-Bashir is married to his cousin Fatima Khalid. He also has a second wife named Widad Babiker Omer, who had a number of children with her first husband Ibrahim Shamsaddin, a member of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation who had died in a helicopter crash.

He was later elected president (with a five-year term) in the 1996 national election, where he was the only candidate by law to run for election { New York Times, } [ 16 March ] { 1996, p.4 } and Hassan al-Turabi was elected to a seat in the National Assembly where he served as speaker of the National Assembly &quot; during the 1990s. &quot; { The Appendix of the } { 9/11 Commission Report } In 1998, al-Bashir and the Presidential Committee put into effect a new constitution, allowing limited political associations in opposition to al-Bashir&apos;s National Congress Party and his supporters to be formed, although these groups failed to gain any significant access to governmental power until the Darfur conflict became a subject. On [ 12 December ] 1999, al-Bashir sent troops and tanks against parliament and ousted Hassan al-Turabi, the speaker of parliament, in a palace coup. { Stefano Bellucci, &quot; Islam and Democracy: The 1999 Palace Coup, &quot; Middle East Policy 7, no. 3 (June 2000):168 } However, despite receiving international criticism regarding internal conflicts, Omar al-Bashir has managed to achieve economic growth in Sudan.

[ 24 October ] { 2006 } [ 20 May ] { 2010 } [ Tensions with al-Turabi ] In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi&apos;s links to Islamic fundamentalist groups, as well as allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting Osama bin Laden to the country.

However the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in the New York Times: &quot; Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.&apos;s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak. &quot; { Risen, James (October 27, 1999). &quot; To Bomb Sudan Plant, or Not: A Year Later, Debates Rankle &quot; } After being re-elected President of Sudan with a five-year-term in the 1996 election with 75.7 percent of the votes, { Profile: Sudan&apos;s President Bashir } al-Bashir issued the registration of legalised political parties in 1999 after being influenced by al-Turabi. Rival parties such as the Liberal Democrats of Sudan and the Alliance of the Peoples&apos; Working Forces, headed by former Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry, were established and were allowed to run for election against al-Bashir&apos;s National Congress Party, however, they failed to achieve significant support, and al-Bashir was re-elected President, receiving 86.5 percent of the vote in the 2000 presidential election. At the legislative elections that same year, al-Bashir&apos;s National Congress Party won 355 out of 360 seats, with al-Turabi as its chairman. However, after al-Turabi introduced a bill to reduce the president&apos;s powers, prompting al-Bashir to dissolve parliament and declare a state of emergency, tensions began to rise between al-Bashir and al-Turabi. Reportedly, al-Turabi was suspended as Chairman of National Congress Party, after he urged a boycott of the President&apos;s re-election campaign. Then, a splinter-faction led by al-Turabi, the Popular National Congress Party (PNC) signed an agreement with Sudan People&apos;s Liberation Army, which led al-Bashir to believe that they were plotting to overthrow him and the government. Further on, al-Turabi&apos;s influence and that of his party&apos;s &quot; &apos;internationalist&apos; and ideological wing &quot; waned &quot; in favor of the &apos;nationalist&apos; or more pragmatic leaders who focus on trying to recover from Sudan&apos;s disastrous international isolation and economic damage that resulted from ideological adventurism. &quot; { Fuller, The Future of Political Islam, (2003), p.111 } At the same time Sudan worked to appease the United States and other international critics by expelling members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad and encouraging bin Laden to leave. { Wright, The Looming Tower, (2006), pp.221–3 } On al-Bashir&apos;s orders, al-Turabi was imprisoned based on allegations of conspiracy in 2000 before being released in October 2003. { Wasil Ali, &quot; Sudanese Islamist opposition leader denies link with Darfur rebels &quot;, Sudan Tribune, } [ 13 May ] { 2008. } He was again imprisoned in the Kober (Cooper) prison in Khartoum in March 2004.

On appeal, the lower court was found by appellate judge Erkki Kourula to have erred in law and was ordered to reexamine the evidence for genocide. Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo anticipated that the reexamination could lead to charges within four to twelve months. Then, on February 3, 2010, the judges at the International Criminal Court held that the Pre-Trial Chamber had improperly dismissed the genocide charges against al-Bashir and ordered the Pre-Trial Chamber to reconsider them. { Mike Pflanz.

RTT News 2010, accessed 2010 The ICC released a further statement saying that al-Bashir&apos;s charges now include &quot; genocide by killing, genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm and genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group&apos;s physical destruction &quot; in three separate counts. The new warrant will act as a supplement to the first, whereby the charges initially brought against al-Bashir will all remain in place, but will now include the crime of genocide which was ruled out initially, pending appeal. On 28 August 2010 in Nairobi, Kenya chose not to arrest Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on International Criminal Court (ICC) charges of genocide when he arrived on Friday for a ceremony for the East African nation&apos;s new constitution.
