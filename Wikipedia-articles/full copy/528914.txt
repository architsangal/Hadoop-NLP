[ BKIR ], [ IRE ] ) is a commercial bank operation in Ireland, which is one of the traditional &apos; Big Four &apos; Irish banks. Historically the premier banking organisation in Ireland, the Bank occupies a unique position in Irish banking history. At the core of the modern-day group is the old Bank of Ireland, the ancient institution established by Royal Charter in 1783. In March 2011 during the Irish banking crisis the bank was found to be in need of an external €5.2  billion bailout. [ http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0331/banks-business.html Banks need fresh €24 billion – Central Bank 31 March 2011 RTE News 31 March 2011 ] [ History ] Bank of Ireland is the oldest bank in continuous operation (apart from 4 closures due to bank strikes, 1950, 1966, 1970, 1976) in Ireland. [ Chronology of history to 1990 ] 1719 – Abortive attempt to establish a bank to be called &quot; Bank of Ireland &quot;. Another abortive attempt 2 years later. 1782 – The bank was formed by an Act of the Irish Parliament in 1782 to support public and commercial finances in Ireland. 1783 – 25 June 1783, the Bank of Ireland opened for business at Mary&apos;s Abbey (Off Capel St., Dublin) in a private house previously owned by one Charles Blakeney. 12,700 banknotes were issued with a total value of £882,500. 1785 – First forgeries of Bank of Ireland notes identified. Forgery became extensive in subsequent years. 1787 – 2 March 1787, the bank suspended cash payouts during a banking crisis. 1808 – 6 June 1808, Bank of Ireland moved to 2 College Green. This building had been the parliament building until the Act of Union 1800 abolished the Irish Parliament. The Irish House of Commons had been damaged in a fire, and considerable modifications were made to this area before opening as a bank. (The Irish House of Lords was preserved, and remains to the present day, despite the fact that a statue of Queen Victoria was removed.) 1820 – Bank of Ireland weathered one more of many banking crises – but many other banks fail. 1825 – Bank of Ireland opened its first branch – in Cork. Six other branches were opened later in that year. 1835 – Bank of Ireland introduced the overdraft – previously, all lending was by discounting of bills. 1847 – Major banking crisis following the Great Irish Famine. 1857 – Another banking crisis. 1864 – Bank of Ireland first pays interest on deposits. 1886 – Bank of Ireland first disclosed its accounts and balance sheet.

T. Cosgrave. 1926 – The Bank of Ireland Crest, originally applied for in 1783, was eventually granted. The Bank of Ireland took control of the National Land Bank – a friendly society.

Hall was published jointly by Hodges Figgis (Dublin) and Blackwell&apos;s (Oxford). 1950 – Irish banks closed for 7 weeks due to a strike by members of the Irish Bank Officials Association. Other total closures in 1966, 1971, and 1976. 1956 – The Bank was authorised to operate the Prize Bond scheme, on behalf of the government, and continued to do so until 1989. 1958 – The Bank took over the Hibernian Bank Limited. 1965 – The National Bank Ltd, a bank founded by Daniel O&apos;Connell in 1835 had branches in Ireland and Britain.

The British branches were acquired by Williams &amp; Glyn&apos;s Bank. 1983 – Bank of Ireland Bi-Centenary. A commemorative stamp was issued. The Bank commissioned the publication of &quot; An Irish Florolegium &quot;. From the beginning, it was connected closely with the leading banking family in Dublin, the Huguenot La Touche family. A member of that family – David La Touche – was the first Governor. [ Role as government banker ] The Bank of Ireland is not, and was never, the Irish central bank. However, as well as being a commercial bank – a deposit-taker and a credit institution – it performed many central bank functions, much like the earlier-established Bank of Scotland and Bank of England. The Bank of Ireland operated the Exchequer Account and during the nineteenth century acted as something of a banker of last resort. Even the titles of the chairman of the board of directors (the Governor) and the title of the board itself (the Court of Directors) suggest a central bank status. From the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 until 31 December 1971, the Bank of Ireland was the banker of the Irish Government, but was not the central bank. This function was fulfilled by the Currency Commission, which was later superseded by the Central Bank of Ireland in 1942. [ Headquarters ] Facade of the bank on Westmoreland Street, Dublin The headquarters of the bank until the 1970s was the impressive Bank of Ireland building on College Green, Dublin. This building was originally designed by Edward Lovett Pearce in 1729 to host the Irish Parliament, and it was the world&apos;s first purpose-built two-chamber parliament building. [ http://buildings.multiply.com/journal/item/63 Architecture Group – Irish Parliament Building 24 May 2011 Bank of Ireland, College Green... is the world&apos;s first purpose-built two-chamber parliament house. ] The bank had planned to commission a building designed by Sir John Soane to be constructed on the site bounded by Westmoreland Street, Fleet Street, College Street and D&apos;Olier Street (now occupied by the Westin Hotel). However the project was cancelled following the Act of Union 1800, when the newly defunct Parliament building was bought by Bank of Ireland in 1803. [ The House of Lord&apos;s Dublin http://anchorhousedublin.com/dublin_guide/the-house-of-lords-dublin 24 May 2011 The Parliament House was purchased by “The Bank of Ireland” in 1803. ] The old Bank of Ireland building continues today as a working branch. Today, visitors can still view the impressive Irish House of Lords chamber within the old headquarters building. The modern Irish Parliament is now housed in Leinster House in Dublin. In 2011, the Irish Government set out proposals to acquire the building as a venue for the state to use as a cultural venue. [ Government wants to repossess landmark College Green bank Paul Cullen http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0514/1224296946151.html Irish Times 14 May 2011 14 May 2011 ] In the 1970s the bank moved its headquarters to a modern building on Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2. As Frank McDonald notes in his book &quot; Destruction of Dublin &quot;, when these headquarters were built, it caused the world price of copper to rise – such was the usage in the building. The main building is on the site of the former car assembly plant of Lincoln &amp; Nolan, where Austin cars were assembled. Historically, the site was associated with the Battle of Rathmines in 1649, and it is said that the last skirmishes of that battle took place here. In addition to some Georgian houses, the site also included a pub (Laurence Ryans). The bank retained the pub licence for some years. Built amidst a blazing row where Bank of Ireland was responsible for a weekend demolition of these Georgian houses, the bank as stands today is now regarded as an excellent example of Miesian architecture, and among the purest contemporary corporate architectural forms built in Dublin. headquarters on Mespil Road In 2010 the bank moved to a new, smaller headquarters on Mespil Road. { TV3 News. 11 August 2010 } [ Recent history ] 19 December: Bank of Ireland merge First New Hampshire Bank with Royal Bank of Scotland &apos;s Citizens Financial Group { 1996 } 16 April: Bank of Ireland buys the Bristol and West building society for €882m, which keeps its own brand. { 1999 } 22 May: It is announced Alliance &amp; Leicester is in merger talks with the Bank of Ireland. 17 June: It is announced that merger talks with Alliance &amp; Leicester have been called off. { 2000 } 31 July: It is announced that Bank of Ireland is to acquire Chase de Vere. { 2002 } 17 May: Bank of Ireland acquires Iridian, the US investment manager, which doubles the size of its asset management business. { 2005 } 21 September: Bank of Ireland completes the sale of the Bristol and West branch and Direct Savings (Contact Centre) to Britannia Building Society.
