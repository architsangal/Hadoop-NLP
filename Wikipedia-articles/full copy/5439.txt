Its name is Latin for &quot; horned male goat &quot; or &quot; goat horn &quot;, and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half fish. Its symbol is 20px (Unicode ♑). Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by Aquila, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus and Aquarius. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the Sea or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus. It is the second faintest constellation in the zodiac after Cancer.

Messier 30 is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907. One galaxy group located in Capricornus is HCG 87, a group of at least three galaxies located 400 million light-years from Earth ( redshift 0.0296). It contains a large elliptical galaxy, a face-on spiral galaxy, and an edge-on spiral galaxy. The face-on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormally high rates of star formation, indicating that it is interacting with one or both members of the group. Furthermore, the large elliptical galaxy and the edge-on spiral galaxy, both of which have active nuclei, are connected by a stream of stars and dust, indicating that they too are interacting. Astronomers predict that the three galaxies may merge millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy.

First attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal from around the 21st century BC, { Master&apos;s Thesis of Peeter Espak, 2006 page 104 &quot; &quot; } it was explicitly recorded in the Babylonian star catalogues as [ sux-Latn MUL SUḪUR.MAŠ ] &quot; The Goat-Fish &quot; before 1000 BC. The constellation was a symbol of the god Ea and in the Early Bronze Age marked the winter solstice. { John H. Rogers, &quot; Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions &quot;, Journal of the British Astronomical Association 108 (1998) 9–28. } Due to the precession of the equinoxes the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus, but the astrological sign called Capricorn begins with the solstice. The sun&apos;s most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere&apos;s winter solstice, is now called the Tropic of Capricorn, a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice. In Greek mythology, the constellation is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother Rhea saved him from being devoured by his father Cronos (in Greek mythology ). The goat&apos;s broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or horn of plenty. [ November 2011 ] The planet Neptune was discovered in Capricornus by German astronomer Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is appropriate as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September. [ Visualizations ] Early nineteenth century rendition of Capricornus as a sea-goat. Capricornus&apos;s brighter stars are found on a triangle whose vertices are α 2 Capricorni (Giedi), δ Capricorni (Deneb Algiedi), and ω Capricorni. Ptolemy&apos;s method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.

Rey&apos;s alternative way to connect the stars of the Capricornus constellation. H. A. Rey has suggested an alternative visualization, which graphically shows a goat. [ Rey H. A. The Stars — A New Way To See Them Enlarged World-Wide Edition 1997 Houghton Mifflin Boston 0-395-24830-2 ] The goat&apos;s head is formed by the triangle of stars ι Cap, θ Cap, and ζ Cap. The goat&apos;s horn sticks out with stars γ Cap and δ Cap. Star δ Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat&apos;s tail consists of stars β Cap and α 2 Cap : star β Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat&apos;s hind foot consists of stars ψ Cap and ω Cap. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. [ Equivalents ] In Chinese astronomy, constellation Capricornus lies in The Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ).
