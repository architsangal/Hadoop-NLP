[ June 2010 ] Translated from French Cœur d&apos;Alêne literally means &quot; heart of the awl &quot; which might mean &quot; sharp-hearted &quot; or &quot; shrewd. &quot; Others interpret &quot; Heart of the Awl &quot; to translate to &quot; Eye of the Needle &quot;, perhaps referring to the narrow passage through which the lake empties into the Spokane River on its way to the Columbia. The area was extensively explored by David Thompson of the North West Company starting in 1807. The Oregon boundary dispute (or Oregon question) arose as a result of competing British and American claims to the Pacific Northwest of North America in the first half of the 19th century.

Sherman ordered a fort constructed on the lake in the 1870s, he gave it the name Fort Coeur d&apos;Alene; hence the name of the city that grew around it. The name of the fort was later changed to Fort Sherman to honor the general. { An Illustrated History of North Idaho, Western Historical Publishing Company, Spokane, Washington (1903). } North Idaho College, a junior college, now occupies the site.

Years later Harry Orchard, who owned a share of the Hercules Mine in the nearby mountains before it began producing, and who later confessed to dynamiting a $250,000 mill belonging to the Bunker Hill Mining Company near Wardner during another miners&apos; uprising in 1899, would also confess to a secret, brutal and little understood role in the Colorado Labor Wars before returning to Idaho to assassinate former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg. { Roughneck —The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 91–92. } [ Economy ] The city is the healthcare, educational, media, manufacturing, retail and recreation center for northern Idaho.
