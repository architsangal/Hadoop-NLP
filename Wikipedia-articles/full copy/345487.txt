Because of her powerful voice and petite stature of only five-foot-two, she is sometimes referred to as &quot; the little lady with the big voice. &quot; [ Biography ] [ Glass House ] Prior to her tenure with The Supremes, Scherrie Payne was the lead singer for a group known as The Glass House. Other group members included Ty Hunter (later with The Originals ), Pearl Jones, and Larry Mitchell. This was a group signed to the Invictus Label, formed by former Motown songwriters Eddie and Brian Holland, and Lamont Dozier. Signed to the label in 1969, they were signed among other popular acts of the early 1970s, including Freda Payne (Scherrie&apos;s older sister who saw a #1 hit in 1970 with &quot; Band Of Gold &quot; ), and The Honey Cone who saw a #1 hit with &quot; Want Ads &quot; In an ironic twist of fate, &apos;Want Ads&apos; was originally recorded by Glass House with Scherrie on lead vocals. Scherrie, Edna and Freda all had a similar vocal sound. Unfortunately, The Glass House did not meet this same success. The group saw their biggest hit in 1969 with the Payne-led track &quot; Crumbs Off The Table &quot; which managed the Billboard top 10. Between the years of 1969 and 1972, The Glass House released 2 albums and 9 singles, including Scherrie&apos;s solo track, &quot; V.I.P. &quot; However, they never really repeated the success of their first single release. They quietly disbanded in 1972, after the release of their album, &quot; Thanks, I Needed That &quot;. [ The Supremes (1973-1977) ] [ The Supremes ] As a new Supreme in an era when their popularity was waning, Payne often remained quiet during interviews with the group; mainly because four years later, reporters were still asking about Diana Ross. When she arrived, original Supreme Mary Wilson and 1960s Supreme Cindy Birdsong were the other two members of the group. Payne contributed powerful vocals and attitude to the group, with Birdsong and Wilson backing her up very well. Payne gained recognition for her vocals in &quot; He&apos;s My Man &quot; taken from the album The Supremes. An accomplished songwriter, Payne was never able to write any special material for The Supremes, which reportedly disappointed her. Payne began to realize that Motown didn&apos;t really care as much about The Supremes as they had in the past, due to the changing musical tastes of the era and due to the fact that they were working to further the solo career of Diana Ross. Payne&apos;s contributions did enable The Supremes to enter the disco era, however, with such dance hits as &quot; I&apos;m Gonna Let My Heart Do The Walking &quot; from the High Energy, &quot; You&apos;re My Driving Wheel &quot;, &quot; Let Yourself Go &quot;, and &quot; Love I Never Knew You Could Feel So Good &quot;. While each of these disco gems landed in the Billboard Dance Top Five, they didn&apos;t perform as well on the pop and R &amp; B charts. The single &quot; I&apos;m Gonna Let My Heart Do hhe Walking &quot; was a #1 hit on the Disco charts, rose in the Billboard Top 40 to #25 on the R &amp; B chart, and #40 on the Pop chart. The final three Supremes (Scherrie, Mary, and Susaye) officially disbanded in 1977 with a farewell concert in London, with Supremes founding member Mary Wilson announcing that she would embark on a solo career. Motown decided to officially retire The Supremes so Payne and Greene recorded an album together on the Motown label, Partners, under the name &quot; Scherrie and Susaye &quot; in 1979. The album received mixed reviews and the two decided to part in order to embark on solo projects. Prior to the release of Partners, Payne released a solo single for Motown called &quot; Fly &quot; b/w &quot; When I Look at Your Face &quot; in late 1977. [ Former Ladies of the Supremes ] [ Former Ladies of the Supremes ] In 1986, Payne joined former Supremes Jean Terrell and briefly, Cindy Birdsong, to form The Former Ladies Of The Supremes or FLOS. When Cindy left to pursue an acting career, Lynda Laurence took her place and they renamed themselves &quot; Jean, Scherrie, &amp; Lynda of the Supremes &quot;, recording the excellent single &quot; We&apos;re Back&apos;, featuring Ali-Ollie Woodson from The Temptations. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, they traveled the world upholding The Supremes&apos; legacy. When Terrell departed, the group continued with Laurence&apos;s sister Sundray Tucker, who like Lynda was a former member of Stevie Wonder &apos;s back-up group, Wonder Love, and this lineup worked prolifically with British record producer Steve Weaver, resulting in a catalogue of 40 new recordings, some of them re-recordings of the Supremes&apos; original hits. Payne and Laurence continue to tour under the FLOS name with third new member Freddi Poole, who joined the group in 1996 replacing Sundray Tucker. In 2000, Payne and Laurence backed Diana Ross on the Return To Love Supremes reunion tour, in which Diana allowed each of them to lead one of the classic Supremes songs. The FLOS celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2006 (with Birdsong, Tucker and Susaye Greene in the audience),[58] In September 2009, Joyce Vincent, formerly of Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn, Joined Scherrie and Lynda replacing Freddi Poole. [ Solo work ] As a solo artist, in addition to &quot; V.I.P. &quot;, which she recorded as a member of the group Glass House and was featured on their second album, Payne has had club hits, such as &quot; I&apos;m Not In Love &quot; (featuring sister Freda Payne and former Supreme Mary Wilson on backing vocals) in 1982, followed two years later by &quot; One Night Only &quot;, a song from Act II of the play and movie &quot; Dreamgirls &quot;, which, interestingly, is a show based loosely on the history of the Supremes and the advancing of the Motown sound into the Disco era. The 12 &quot; Megatone Label Disco Single also featured former Supreme Cindy Birdsong on background vocals. In 1986 Payne recorded a solo album for Superstar International Records which contained several duets with Phillip Ingram. The following year, Payne signed with British producer Ian Levine for his Motown reunion project, Motorcity Records. While with this label, Payne released two solo singles &quot; Chasing Me Into Somebody Else&apos;s Arms &quot; and &quot; Pure Energy &quot; (co-written by Payne), as well as covers of two Diana Ross tunes, &quot; Ain&apos;t No Mountain High Enough &quot; and &quot; I&apos;m Still Waiting &quot;. Other product recorded for Motorcity included &quot; Who&apos;s Wrong, Who&apos;s Right &quot; and &quot; One More Time &quot;. In August 2001 Scherrie was invited to perform at the annual prestigious open-air festival Sunset Junction Street Fair in Los Angeles. Scherrie performed a dynamic and versatile set showcasing her talents perfectly. Scherrie performed Supremes&apos; classics like &apos;Stoned Love&apos; and &apos;My World Is Empty Without You&apos; as well as a couple of her own solo hits &apos;I&apos;m Not In Love&apos; and &apos;Another Life From Now&apos;. Scherrie made a return visit to Sunset Junction the following year, performing a similar set. On January 14, 2007, Scherrie was the special guest star at the &apos;If My Friends Could See Me Now&apos; fund-raiser in Los Angeles, California. Scherrie performed a high energy version of her own hit &apos;One Night Only&apos;, from the musical Dreamgirls. Backing Scherrie up were long-time friends Pam Vincent and Joyce Vincent Wilson, both formerly of Tony Orlando and Dawn. 2009 Scherrie continues to perform with fellow former Supremes member Lynda Laurence as the FLOS (Formerly of The Supremes) and third member Joyce Vincent. Scherrie and Lynda&apos;s trio perform all over the world to audiences performing the classic Supremes&apos; hits.
