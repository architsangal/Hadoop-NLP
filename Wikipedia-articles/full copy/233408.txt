[ June 2011 ] This is a list of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom. In Canada and Australia, some of the American terms listed are widespread, however in some cases another usage is preferred. Words with specific American meanings that have different meanings in British English and/or additional meanings common to both dialects (e.g., pants, crib) are to be found at List of words having different meanings in British and American English. When such words are herein used or referenced, they are marked with the flag [DM]. Asterisks (*) denote words and meanings having appreciable (that is, not occasional) currency in British English, but nonetheless distinctive of American English for their relatively greater frequency in American speech and writing. Americanisms are increasingly common in British English, and many that were not widely used some decades ago, are now so (e.g., regular in the sense of &quot; regular coffee &quot; ). American spelling is consistently used throughout the article, except when explicitly referencing British terms.
