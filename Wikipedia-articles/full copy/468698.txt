The region is formed of mountains, plains, hills, valleys and desert stretches. The al-Baḥah region is situated in Hijaz of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between longitudes 41/42 E and latitudes 19/20 N. occupying a middle position among the beautiful tourist areas of the kingdom.

To the west is a coastal plain, Tihama. East is the mountain range of al-Sarawat,known as al-Sarat, with an elevation of 1,500 to 2,450 m above see level. } [ Population ] A genealogist [ December 2010 ] has confirmed that the majority of the population of Al-Baḥah are descended from the Azad Shenou`a tribe which emigrated from the south of the Arabian peninsula following some historical natural events. Al-Azad is an Arab tribe which divided into 24 tribes derived from four stocks: Azad Shenou`a, Azad Al Sarat, Azad Ghassan and Azad Aman. Al-Azad (or al-Assad the Lion) was the title given to Darda`e bin al-Ghot bin Nabt bin Malik bin Nassr al-Azad. Kaab bin al-Harith had seven children including Ghamed, who is Amr bin Abdullah bin Kaab. Zahran bin al-Harith had six children, including Abdullah bin Zahran who is the great grandfather of the Zahran tribe. The population of the region now is about 500,000. Many have moved to major metropolitan areas for better living and education. [ Climate ] The variation in topography influences the climate of the region. The al-Sarat area is exposed to the formation of clouds and fog, and this often happens in winter because of air masses coming from the Red Sea, accompanied by thunderstorms. In spring and summer the climate is mild and pleasant. The climate in the Tihama area is different from that in al-Sarat although they are separated by no more than 25  km. Tihama is an undulating coastal plain, hot in summer, warm in spring and mild in winter. The climate in general falls in the arid zone. Relative humidity varies between 52% and 67% with maximum temperatures of 23°C and minimum temperatures of 12°C. [ Social structure ] The social life of the inhabitants of the al-Baḥah region is based on Sunni Islam, the roots of which go back to the year 10 AH, in addition to the well established Arab customs and tradition. Each tribe division or subdivision has its own head (sheikh).
