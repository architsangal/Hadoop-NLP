Iceland as seen from space, with Vatnajökull appearing as the largest white area to the lower right Vatnajökull [ ˈvaʰdnaˌjœːkʏtl̥ ] ( [ Glacier of Rivers ] ) is the largest glacier in Iceland. It is located in the south-east of the island, covering more than 8% of the country. [ Size ] With an area of 8,100  km², Vatnajökull is the largest ice cap in Europe by volume (3,100  km³) and the second largest (after Austfonna on Nordaustlandet, Norway ) in area (not counting the still larger Severny Island ice cap of Novaya Zemlya, Russia, which may be regarded as located in the extreme northeast of Europe). On 7 June 2008, it became a part of the Vatnajökull National Park. [ Vatnajokull National Park http://www2.hi.is/page/www.hi.is/haskolasetur_hornafirdi/vatnajokull_nationalpark Háskóli Íslands hi.is 9 July 2010 ] The average thickness of the ice is thus [ 400 m on ], with a maximum thickness of [ 1,000 m on ]. Iceland &apos;s highest peak, Hvannadalshnúkur ( [ 2,109.6 m on ] ), is located in the southern periphery of Vatnajökull, near Skaftafell National Park. An iceberg with Vatnajökull in the background. The icebergs in Jökulsárlón, as well as this iceberg, are icebergs that have broken off Vatnajökull&apos;s outlet glaciers. [ Volcanoes ] Under the ice cap, as under many of the glaciers of Iceland, there are several volcano es. The volcanic lakes, Grímsvötn for example, were the sources of a large jökulhlaup (glacial lake outburst flood ) in 1996. There was also a considerable but short-time eruption of the volcano under these lakes at the beginning of November 2004. In May 21, 2011 a volcanic eruption started í Grímsvötn in Vatnajökull National Park at around 7 p.m. The plume reached as high as 20 kilometers. During the last ice age, numerous volcanic eruptions occurred under Vatnajökull, creating many subglacial eruption s. [ Sight line ] According to Guinness World Records, Vatnajökull is the object of the world&apos;s longest sight line, [ 550 km on ] from Slættaratindur, the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands. GWR state that &quot; owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction, Vatnajökull (2,109.6 m), Iceland, can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands, [ 340 mi ] away &quot;. This may be based on a claimed sighting by a British sailor in 1939. The validity of this record is analysed/undermined in mathematical and atmospheric detail by J.C. Ferranti. { &apos;&apos;Longlines&apos;&apos; page at viewfinderpanoaramas.org by J.C. de Ferranti } [ In culture ] In 1950, a Douglas DC-4 operated by the private airline Loftleiðir crash-landed on the Vatnajökull glacier and never flew again. Its abandoned fuselage is visible in the 2007 film Heima, a documentary about a tour performed by the band Sigur Rós. [ http://www.dc3history.org/collisionsbombscrashes.html COLLISIONS AND BOMBS! dc3history.org 2010-04-12 2010-05-16 ] The glacier was used as the setting for the opening sequence (set in Siberia ) of the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill, in which Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore ) eliminated a host of armed villains before escaping in a submarine to Alaska. Several other films, including another in the Bond franchise, have been filmed on or using Jökulsárlón, the terminal lake of the Breiðamerkurjökull outlet from Vatnajökull. In November 2011, the glacier was used as a shooting location for the second season of the HBO fantasy TV series Game of Thrones.
