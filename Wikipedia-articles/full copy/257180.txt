The population is 13,787 as of 2010. A former summer resort on Massachusetts Bay, Swampscott is today an affluent residential community, the 16th wealthiest in the state, which includes the village of Beach Bluff, as well as part of the neighborhood of Clifton. It is known for its quiet suburban character and beaches. The town is home to Marian Court College. [ History ] Swampscott was first settled in 1629 as the eastern part (Ward One) of Lynn, and was set off and officially incorporated in 1852. A beach town north of Boston, measuring [ 3 sqmi km2 ], and abutting Salem, Marblehead and Lynn, Swampscott was an important destination for the wealthy at the beginning of the 20th century; while Revere Beach, which lies just several miles down the road, has the honour of technically being America&apos;s first public beach, Swampscott was the de facto first resort town. Lynn was the divider between the poor beach and the rich resort town. The name &apos;Swampscott&apos; comes from the language of a local native American tribe. The following is verbatim from the official Swampscott web page: &quot; History of Swampscott. &quot; { Swampscott, Massachusetts - About Swampscott } Early historical accounts of Swampscott indicated that the Native Americans, referred to Swampscott as M’sqiompsk meaning red rock. It then became M’squompskut, for the phrase “at Red Rock” because of the red granite outcroppings that were visible to those offshore. Originally part of the large Saugus land grant and later the eastern part of Lynn&apos;s Ward One, Swampscott was settled and established in 1629 when Francis Ingalls came and built the first Massachusetts Bay Colony tannery on Humphrey&apos;s Brook. Long known as a seafaring fishing village, Swampscott hosted a large commercial fishing fleet which sailed daily from our protected bay. Early accounts of Swampscott considered it a &quot; community of modest means &quot; and indicated that one man in three was a fisherman. Of the rest, a goodly number were shoemakers (also known as &quot; cordwainer s &quot; ), shoe cutters (known as &quot; clickers &quot; ), yeomen or farmers and merchants. In the late 18th century, Ebenezer Phillips learned the dry fish process from the Naumkeags and set up a processing facility for cod whereby the cod was dried, put in barrels and shipped all over the world. Phillips’ business was a success and he became one of this country&apos;s first millionaires. From its fishing interests, Swampscott reached worldwide status as the place where Ebenezer Thorndike invented the lobster pot in 1808 to revolutionize lobster harvesting. Lobstering today is still extremely popular. The yacht club in Swampscott makes it easy for people to be able to access their boats and begin lobstering. Also, The Swampscott Dory, a fishing boat still in use throughout the world today, was invented in 1840 by Ralfus Brackett to row and to pull lobster pots. The dory was considered the best seaworthy boat for fishermen due to its unique flat-bottomed design. &apos;&apos;Whale Beach&apos;&apos; in 1909 A few large resorts were built in the 19th century which attracted wealthy patrons, families and businessmen from across the country. Many stayed and built grand homes in the area which played a vital role in the town&apos;s diverse history. Swampscott separated from Lynn when a group of 97 petitioners told the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that: 1. They are situated somewhat remote from the central portion of Lynn; and 2. That their business is different from that of the principal part of Lynn; and 3. That their convenience and interests would be promoted by a separate government, especially after the citizens of Lynn opted to switch from a town to a city form of government. Lynn offered no substantial opposition, so the legislature passed an enabling act which authorized the organization of a separate town government under the date of May 21, 1852. On October 9, 1852 Lynn was paid $5,450.00 for the land it lost to the new community now known as the &quot; Town of Swampscott. &quot; In 1857, land at the far western edge of Salem known as the &quot; Salem Finger &quot; was annexed to Swampscott, bringing the total land area to [ 3.05 sqmi km2 ]. &apos;&apos;The Boulevard&apos;&apos; in 1910 Alongside Swampscott&apos;s fishing heritage came the advent of large hotels and homes as the community attracted summer residents from every corner of the world. There were also homes of specific historical significance. For example, John Humphreys, the first deputy governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, lived in an attractive saltbox home in 1637 which is now home to the Swampscott Historical Society at 99 Paradise Road and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Stately homes which evolved in Swampscott include Professor Elihu Thomson &apos;s Georgian revival mansion with its unique and ornate interior carvings. Professor Thomson founded the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, which became the General Electric Company via a merger with Thomas Edison &apos;s company. The building, designed by James T. Kelley, now serves as the Town Hall, and is also listed on the National Historic Register. The Swampscott Fish House, at Humphrey Street on Fisherman&apos;s Beach, is the only municipal fish house on the East Coast. Built in 1896 on land taken by eminent domain, the Fish House was built to consolidate the many fishing structures that stretched along the oceanfront obscuring views of the ocean and subtracting from the area&apos;s appeal. The Fish House is an historic building and part of the National Register of historic places. It is also home to the Swampscott Yacht Club and the Swampscott Sailing Program. Andrew Preston, founder of the United Fruit Company, had one of the major summer estates in Swampscott. The Preston estate covered over [ 100 acre km2 ] and included its own golf course. Architect Arthur Little built several of the first shingle-styled homes in Swampscott, all expansive summer homes with ocean views and most with ballrooms. &apos;&apos;The New Ocean House Hotel&apos;&apos; circa 1920 The hotel and boarding house business flourished to serve the influx of summer visitors with the Ocean House, the Hotel Preston, the Lincoln House Hotel, the Hotel Bellevue and the New Ocean House Hotel. Notable summer guests, including President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, and Woolworth heiress Ethel Donahue, frequented the town&apos;s lavish accommodations. None of the large hotels remain standing today, most having been destroyed by fire or savage coastal storms, and most of the large estates have been subdivided into single family homes although some still remain to this day. Home prices vary from a few hundred thousand dollars to more than five million depending upon ocean view, desirable view of the Boston skyline, and size as some homes can be quite large. Swampscott&apos;s quiet suburban character, many beaches, good school system, and easy access to Boston make it a very desirable town to live and raise a family in. Nevertheless, Swampscott has retained the essence of a quiet setting along the north shore of the Atlantic Ocean with the soothing sounds of the ocean lapping along the seashore. Swampscott&apos;s public school system includes four elementary schools, Hadley School, Clarke School, Machon School and Stanley School, one middle school, Swampscott Middle School, and one high school, Swampscott High School. A new building was completed in 2007 for Swampscott High School. In 2011, The Town of Swampscott is working out the details of installing a massive wind turbine, with the approximate height of a 30 story building on the property of the Swampscott Middle School. When installed it is expected to generate a little more than half of the power for the middle school. [ Geography and transportation ] Swampscott is located at [ 42 28 27 N 70 54 21 W type:city ] (42.474409, -70.905883).

Located beside Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Swampscott lies along a mostly rocky shoreline, though there is enough clear shore for five beaches; Phillips which stretches into Preston and is by far the largest beach in town, Eisman&apos;s and Whales, Fishermans, and a part of King&apos;s Beach, which extends into Lynn. There are several small parks, along with the small Harold King Forest in the northwest corner of town and the Tedesco Country Club which bisects part of the town. The town also has two small ponds, Foster Pond and Palmer Pond. Swampscott is mostly suburban, with most of the clear land in the swampy northwest corner of town. There are three villages within town, Beach Bluff to the east, Phillips Point to the south, and Phillips Beach inland between the two. The town is centered around Monument Square, designed by Franklin Law Olmsted { http://www.essexheritage.org/visiting/thingstodo/walksandtours/olmstedmap.pdf }; which is four miles south of Salem, twelve miles northeast of Boston, and twenty miles southwest of Cape Ann. The town is twenty three miles to the nearest point in New Hampshire, in the town of Salem. Swampscott is bordered by Marblehead to the northeast, Salem to the northwest, and Lynn to the west. The water rights of the town extend into Massachusetts Bay, bordered by those of Marblehead and Lynn. Swampscott is located along Route 1A and Route 129. Both routes enter from Lynn, with Route 1A passing north of the town center towards Salem, and Route 129 following the coast for a half mile before going inland north of Phillips Point and returning to the coast before heading into Marblehead. There is no highway within town, which lies well south of Massachusetts Route 128 and Interstate 95. The town is served by MBTA bus routes which lead into the surrounding towns. Swampscott has a station along the Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail, with service from the North Shore to Boston&apos;s North Station. Another abandoned spur rail line crosses through the town towards Marblehead, where it has been converted into a bicycle path. The nearest air service can be reached at Beverly Municipal Airport, and the nearest national and international air service can be found at Boston&apos;s Logan International Airport.
