[ Lime (disambiguation) ] [ Lemon ] [ November 2009 ] Unripened Key limes Lime (from Arabic and French lim [ A dictionary of true etymologies Adrian Room Taylor &amp; Francis 1986 101 ] ) is a term referring to a number of different citrus fruits, both species and hybrids, which are typically round, green to yellow in colour, 3–6  cm in diameter, and containing sour and acidic pulp. Limes are a good source of vitamin C. Limes are often used to accent the flavours of foods and beverages. Limes are grown all year round and are usually smaller and more sour than lemons. [ History ] Limes were first grown on a large scale in southern Iraq [ Raichlen Steven Small citruses yield tart juice, aromatic oils, big, fresh taste http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-08-02/features/1992215249_1_persian-limes-key-limes-lime-pie 30 March 2012 The Baltimore Sun August 02, 1992 ] and Persia, and the fruit was first grown commercially in what is today southern Iraq ( Babylonia ).

It is a very common ingredient in authentic Mexican, Vietnamese and Thai dishes. It is also used for its pickling properties in ceviche. The use of dried limes (called black lime or loomi) as a flavouring is typical of Persian cuisine and Iraqi cuisine, as well as in Gulf -style baharat (a spice mix ture that is also called kabsa or kebsa).

Lime is frequently used to add flavour to cold and hot drinks, including water, tonic and other cocktails. [ Other uses ] To prevent scurvy during the 19th century, British sailors were issued a daily allowance of citrus, such as lemon, and later switched to lime, { State of knowledge about scurvy } which was not as effective at preventing scurvy but was easier to obtain on Britain&apos;s Caribbean colonies. It was later discovered that the greater effectiveness of lemons derived from the 4-fold higher quantities of vitamin C lemon juice contains compared to the West Indian limes used by the British. This was initially a closely guarded military secret, as scurvy was a common enemy of various nation&apos;s navies, and being able to be at sea for lengthy periods without contracting scurvy was a huge military benefit. The British sailor acquired the nickname of being a Limey because of their usage of limes. Lime juice is the juice of limes ( citrus ). It may be squeezed from fresh limes, or purchased in bottles in both unsweetened and sweetened varieties. Lime juice is used to make limeade, and as an ingredient (typically as sour mix ) in many cocktail s. Lime extracts and essential oils are frequently used in perfume s, cleaning products, and aromatherapy. In India, the lime is used in Tantra for removing evil spirits. It is also combined with Indian chillies to make a protective charm to repel the evil eye. { http://mumbaidailyphotoblog.blogspot.com/2006/12/nimbu-mirchi.html } Furthermore, it was believed that hanging limes over sick people cured them of the illness by repelling evil spirits lurking inside the body. [ Health effects ] When the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light after lime juice contact, a reaction known as phytophotodermatitis can occur, which can cause darkening of the skin, swelling or blistering. The agent responsible for this is psoralen. Lime contains 24 milligrams less vitamin C per 100 grams than the lemon. [ Production trends ] India, with about 16% of the world&apos;s overall lemon and lime output, tops the production list, followed by Mexico (~14.5%), Argentina (~10%), Brazil (~8%), and Spain (~7%).
