Recorded and self-released in May 1999, later that year, the band forged its name to Linkin Park and Hybrid Theory was re-mixed and remastered for another limited release in 2001, with minor changes in the credits and artwork for members of Linkin Park&apos;s fan club. Only about 1,000 copies were made and released. Original versions of the EP are hard to find and because of this, many bootleg or fake versions of it have been made. [ Background ] The financing for the original pressing was obtained through a publishing deal with Zomba Music Publishing after one of its representatives, Jeff Blue, heard the band playing at the Whisky a Go Go. Initial sales were merely a handful but the band persisted. They began plugging the album in chatrooms and sending free copies to anyone who expressed interest. An informal &apos;street team&apos; developed from the on-line community to spread the music.
