Waikīkī aerial photo Waikīkī ( [ icon w aɪ k iː ˈ k iː ]; Hawaiian : [ vɐiˈkiːˈkiː ] or [ wɐiˈkiːˈkiː ] ) is a neighborhood of Honolulu, in the City and County of Honolulu, on the south shore of the island of O ahu, in Hawaii, United States. Waikīkī Beach is the shoreline fronting Waikīkī. Waikīkī is home to public places including Kapi olani Park, Fort de Russy Military Reservation, Kahanamoku Lagoon, Kūhiō Beach Park, and Ala Wai Harbor. [ Etymology ] The name Waikīkī means spouting fresh water in the Hawaiian language, for springs and streams that fed wetlands that once separated Waikīkī from the interior. [ waikiki HASH835ff9bba55d4820b22304 hpn December 13, 2010 ] [ Geography ] [ March 2012 ] { Diamond Head } Closer aerial of Waikīkī beach The neighborhood extends from the Ala Wai Canal (a channel dug to drain former wetlands) on the west and north, to Diamond Head (Lē ahi) on the east. Waikīkī Beach is noted for its views of the Diamond Head tuff cone, its usually warm and cloud-free climate and its surf break. The Waikīkī skyline is now dotted with an abundance of both high-rises and resort hotels. The beach is actually fairly short, with half of it marked off for surfers. For some distance into the ocean the water is quite shallow, although there are numerous rocks on the bottom. As with most ocean beaches the waves can have some force, particularly on windy days. The surf at Waikīkī is known for its long rolling break, making it ideal for long boarding, tandem surfing and beginners. [ History ] The area was a retreat for Hawaiian royalty in the 1800s who enjoyed surfing there on early forms of longboard s. { http://www.hawaii-post.com/2008-05AUG.html Longboards used by royalty } A few small hotels opened in the 1880s. In 1893, Greek-American George Lycurgus leased the guest house of Allen Herbert and renamed it the &quot; Sans Souci &quot; (French for &quot; without worries &quot; ) creating one of the first beach resorts. Later that year Robert Louis Stevenson stayed at the resort; subsequently it became a popular destination for tourists from the mainland.

The beach hosts many events a year, including surf competitions, outdoor performance s, hula dancing and outrigger canoe races. [ Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues ] Waikīkī&apos;s main thoroughfare is Kalakaua Avenue, named after King Kalakaua, which houses most of the high-end hotels ( Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton, Hyatt, Moana Surfrider Hotel ), most of the luxury designer brand stores ( Apple Store, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Burberry, Dior, Tiffany &amp; Co., Fendi, Cartier, Gucci &amp; Coach ) and popular surf clothing brand stores ( Quiksilver, Billabong, Volcom ). Waikīkī&apos;s other main thoroughfare, Kuhio Avenue, named after [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole|Prince Kuhio]], is better known for its restaurants, cafe&apos;s and grocers, along with its clubs, nightlife and prostitution. { City to beautify Kuhio Avenue | The Honolulu Advertiser } { Prostitution shifts from Waikiki | The Honolulu Advertiser } [ Beach erosion ] Over time, Waikīkī beach has had problems with erosion, leading to the construction of groins and beach replenishment projects. For example, in the 1920s and 1930s sand was imported from Manhattan Beach, California, via ship and barge to Waikīkī. [ Bonnie Beckerson City of Manhattan Beach History http://manhattanbeachhistorical.org/history 2010-04-26 2001 ] Importing stopped in the 1970s. Officials are looking for ways to sustain the existing sand by eliminating loss due to tide flow. { http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/07/05/waikiki.sand.ap/index.html Where&apos;s Waikiki&apos;s sand? Experts believe Hawaii&apos;s most famous beach is eroding July 5, 2003 } Subject to permits, a partial restoration is going right now (from March 12th 2012 until April, 2012). The proposed project would import sand from nearby shoal s and would widen the [ 1700 ft m ] long beach by about [ 37 ft m ] between the Royal Hawaiian Hotel concrete groin and the Kūhiō Beach crib wall. The project will restore the beach to its 1985 shoreline. { Beach to be rebuilt with recovered sand - Hawaii News - Staradvertiser.com } [ Economy ] { Diamond Head, 1958 } China Airlines operates its Honolulu Branch Office in Waikīkī. { &quot; Branch Offices North America. &quot; } { China Airlines.
