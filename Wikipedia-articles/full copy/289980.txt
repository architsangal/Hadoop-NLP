It also has the exclusive United States publishing rights to both the Harry Potter and The Hunger Games book series. [ http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s%3DSCHL SCHL Profile &amp; #124; Scholastic Corporation Stock Yahoo! Finance 2012 [last update] May 8, 2012 ] [ May 2012 ] Scholastic Inc. is the world&apos;s largest publisher and distributor of children&apos;s books. In the 1970s, Scholastic Press was well-known mainly through their Scholastic Book Clubs, a mail-order service dealing in children&apos;s books, and their magazine publications aimed at youths: Wow (preschoolers and elementary schoolers), Dynamite (pre-teens) and Bananas (teens). The company&apos;s official mascot is Clifford the Big Red Dog. Scholastic has grown its business most recently by acquiring other media companies, including Klutz, the animated television production company Soup2Nuts, the K–12 educational software publisher Tom Snyder Productions, and most significantly the reference publisher Grolier, which publishes the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia and The New Book of Knowledge. [ History ] In 1920, Maurice R. &quot; Robbie &quot; Robinson founded the business he named Scholastic Publishing Company in his hometown of Wilkinsburg, right outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a publisher of youth magazines, the first publication was The Western Pennsylvania Scholastic. It covered high school sports and social activities and debuted on October 22, 1920. { About Scholastic People And History } In 1926, Scholastic published its first book, Saplings, which was a collection of selected student writings by the winners of the Scholastic Writing Awards. For many years the company continued its focus on serving the youth market through the relatively low cost of magazine publication. So, even with the later transition into paperback books, the company continued under the name Scholastic Magazines, Inc., through the 1970s. After World War II, cheap paperback books became available. In 1948, Scholastic entered the school book club business with its division T.A.B., or Teen Age Book Club with classic titles priced at 25 cents. In 1957, Scholastic established its first international subsidiary, Scholastic Canada, in Toronto. The company published paperback books under its division Scholastic Book Services. These were offered to school students via classroom mail order catalogs, known as the Scholastic Book Club. Along with the New York and Toronto publishing locations, the division also expanded further internationally to operate in London, Auckland, and Sydney by the 1960s. By 1974, the paperback book division had expanded into Tokyo as well. In 1974, Richard &quot; Dick &quot; Robinson, the son of founder M. R. Robinson, became President of Scholastic Inc. He was named Chief Executive Officer in 1975 and Chairman in 1982, and still remains in those positions as of May 2012. Although his son Joel C. J. Craig and Richard&apos;s first wife, Gail Craig, reside in the neighboring state of Pennsylvania. One day Joel may become CEO of Scholastic, but it has not been confirmed. In 1996, Scholastic acquired Weston Woods Studios. { &quot; Scholastic—About Us &quot;, Retrieved on 25 October 2008. } In 1997, Scholastic (through Arthur A. Levine Books ) purchased the U.S. publication rights to the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone, it was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone in order to appeal to American children. It has continued publishing the Harry Potter books, all of which have been record best sellers. In June 2000, Scholastic acquired Grolier. { &quot; French Plan to Sell Grolier, &quot; PublishersWeekly.com, November 29, 1999; &quot; Scholastic to Acquire Grolier, &quot; press release, Scholastic Inc., April 13, 2000. } The book club division (most notably the book club license for the Dr. Seuss books by arrangement with Random House ), as well as its imprint Children&apos;s Press, were consolidated into its new parent, Scholastic. In 2012, the New Video Group became the new video distributor to distribute the home entertainment business of Scholastic, including the Weston Woods Studios library, Scholastic Storybook Treasures, and most recently, their home entertainment rights to the 2002 movie adaptation of the book Stellaluna from MGM. [ The Scholastic Art &amp; amp; Writing Awards ] Founded in 1923 by Maurice R. Robinson, The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards, administered by the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers, have encouraged over 13 million students, recognized more than 9 million young artists and writers, and made available more than $25 million in awards and scholarships. The Awards continue to be the largest source of scholarship funding for teenage artists and writers and the longest-running, most prestigious art and writing awards program in the U.S. Each year, more than 77,000 students in grades 7–12 participate in The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Awards are structured to identify and recognize students through regional award designations (including Gold Key, Silver Key and Honorable Mention) and then national designations (Gold Medal, Silver Medal). Works submitted at the regional level may also receive an American Visions or Voices Award, which are pieces of art or writing that forwarded to national offices as &quot; best in show. &quot; In the U.S.A, the process begins as young artists and writers submit more than 140,000 creative works to the Alliance&apos;s regional affiliates. The most outstanding works of art and writing (Gold Key and Silver Key winners) from each region are forwarded to the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers in New York City to be reviewed on a national level. Panels of professional jurors review approximately 8,000 works of art and 2,000 manuscripts to select the 1,200 national award recipients. The regional awards are administered by a network of nearly 100 affiliates that include school systems and school boards, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, foundations, arts agencies, businesses, libraries, museums, teacher councils and institutions of higher education that share a commitment to identifying emerging artists and writers in their communities. The Awards recognize written and artistic works in 30 categories, including Architecture, Comic Art, Ceramics &amp; Glass, Digital Art, Design, Drawing, Fashion, Film &amp; Animation, Jewelry, Mixed Media, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, Video Games, Art Portfolio, Photography Portfolio, Dramatic Script, Humor, Journalism, Personal Essay/Memoir, Persuasive Writing, Poetry, Novel Writing, Science Fiction/Fantasy, Short Story, Short, Short Story, General Writing Portfolio, Nonfiction Portfolio, and Creativity &amp; Citizenship. An early, undated, statement of purpose articulates the founding vision of The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards as: &quot; To give those students who demonstrate superior talent and achievement in things of the spirit and of the mind at least a fraction of the honors and rewards accorded to their athletic classmates for demonstrating their bodily skills. &quot; [ May 2012 ] In the last 87 years, The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards have recognized some of the most remarkable minds of the 20th century, including Richard Anuskiewicz, Richard Avedon, Harry Bertoia, Mel Bochner, Truman Capote, Paul Davis, Frances Farmer, Red Grooms, Robert Indiana, Bernard Malamud, Joyce Maynard, Joyce Carol Oates, Phillip Pearlstein, Peter S. Beagle, Sylvia Plath, Robert Redford, Jean Stafford, Mozelle Thompson, Ned Vizzini, Kay WalkingStick, Andy Warhol, and Charles White.

Typically, teachers administer the program to the students in their own classes, but in some cases, the program is administered by a central contact for the entire school. Within Scholastic, Book Clubs is a separate unit (compared to, e.g., Education). Book clubs are arranged by age/grade: Honeybee – 2- to 4-year-olds Firefly – Preschool Seesaw – Kindergarten and Grade 1 Lucky – Grades 2 &amp; 3 Arrow – Grades 4, 5, &amp; 6 TAB – Grades 7 and up Specials: other, often irregular, clubs that may be handed out to students together with the &quot; core &quot; clubs&apos; flyers. In Canada: Elf – preschool SeeSaw – K–1 Lucky – 2–3 Arrow – 4–6 TRC (Teen Reading Club) – 7+ Click! (software) – Pre K to 8 Specials – K to 6 Club de lecture (French) – Pre K to 8 And Australia: Wombat – Preschool and Kindergarten Lucky – K–2 Arrow – 2–4 Star – 5+ Scholastic also offers a host of specialty book club fliers including Club Leo (Spanish language for grades K–8), and Click (Computer games and media for all ages). Scholastic typically offers participating schools and classrooms 1 &quot; point &quot; for every dollar (or local unit of currency) of products ordered. Additional points may be earned during special promotion times, such as the beginning of the school year. Points may then be redeemed for books and school supplies at a rate of approximately 20 points to the dollar. At minimum, schools earn 5% of book orders in free products. With special promotions, return rate can be higher (15–100%). [ Going green ] [ July 2009 ] Under the guidance of the Rainforest Alliance and other environmental groups, 30 percent of the publication paper Scholastic buys will be Forest Stewardship Council-certified within five years. A quarter of the paper it uses also will be recycled, with 75 percent being post-consumer waste. The company bought 95,000 tons of paper in fiscal year 2007. Only 4 percent of that was FSC-certified, and 11 percent contained post-consumer waste fiber. Scholastic&apos;s new website geared toward children is called Scholastic ACT GREEN! It includes interactive features to allow children to create e-cards, &quot; green &quot; plans and earn &quot; green &quot; points. &quot; Our five-year goals for FSC-certified and recycled paper purchases are ambitious but achievable and important, &quot; said Maureen O&apos;Connell, Scholastic&apos;s chief financial officer and chief administrative officer. O&apos;Connell added that Scholastic set records last year with the printing of the seventh Harry Potter book on environmentally sound paper. The company also practices green building principles in the construction and maintenance in its headquarters and other buildings. [ Scholastic Parents Media ] Scholastic Parents Media is a division of Scholastic Corporation. In addition to publishing Scholastic Parent &amp; Child Magazine, the group also specializes in online advertising sales and custom programs designed for parents and children ages 0–6. { Parent &amp; Child Magazine | Scholastic.com } [ Online learning tools ] In recent years, Scholastic has launched an online learning tool for grades 3–6. Study Jams was created with the intention of making learning easier and more entertaining for children in these grades. It can be used by parents, teachers, schools, and libraries. With the use of real world math and science examples, Scholastic has successfully branched into the cyber world. [ Criticism ] Scholastic has been criticized for inappropriately marketing to children. A significant number of titles carried have strong media tie-ins and are considered relatively short in literary and artistic merit by some critics. { &apos;&apos;Boston Globe&apos;&apos; } Consumer groups have also attacked Scholastic for selling too many toys and video games to children, rather than focusing on just books.
