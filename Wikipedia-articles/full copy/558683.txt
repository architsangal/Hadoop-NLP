[ the card game the night club Fluxx (nightclub) ] [ Fluxx Fluxx Comparison of cards from English and German versions. 2–6 8 and up 1 minute 20 minutes on average, varying greatly Low Medium High Adaptability 258 t ] Fluxx is a card game, played with a specially designed deck. It is different from most other card games, in that the rules and the conditions for winning are altered throughout the game, via cards played by the players. [ History ] Fluxx was created by Andrew Looney and first published by Looney Labs in 1996. The game was successful and was licensed a year later to Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) for wider distribution. ICE went bankrupt two years later and Looney Labs has resumed publication and distribution. Looney Labs produced a revised version of the original game in 2002. Amigo Spiele, a German game company, licensed a German language version of Fluxx in 2003. Similarly, Hobby Japan licensed a Japanese language version in 2005. [ Rules and gameplay ] The game starts out with just two basic rules, presented on a card placed in the play area at the start of the game: each player draws one card, and plays one card during his turn. In addition to this Basic Rules card, there are five types of cards in the core game: New Rule, Action, Keeper, Creeper, and Goal cards: [ http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/PromoCards/Index.html The Official Guide to Looney Labs Promo Cards Wunderland.com 2010-03-22 ] New Rule cards can be played to change the rules or add other rules. Examples are Draw 2, Play 3, Reverse Order or even Inflation (formerly X=X+1), which increases numerals on other cards played (so Draw 2 becomes Draw 3). In versions 2.0 and 2.1 of the game there is also a card Final Card Random. When this rule is in effect, players must allow an adjacent player to choose the last card played on each turn. Since version 3.0, there is a similar card, First Play Random. (Final Card Random is now one of many orderable &quot; promo cards &quot;.) Action cards, which allow the player to do one-time things like steal cards or eliminate rules. Examples are Draw 2 and use &apos;em, Jackpot! to draw three cards instantly, Let&apos;s Do That Again, allowing the player to search the trash pile and replay a card, and Rules Reset, which removes all new rules in play. Keeper cards, which are used to meet the Goals below. Examples are Bread, Dreams, and Peace. Creeper cards are included in version 4.0, the Zombie Fluxx, Monty Python Fluxx, Martian Fluxx and Stoner Fluxx 2.0 variants, and as certain promotional cards. When a Creeper card is drawn, it is immediately played and a replacement is drawn. Creeper cards don&apos;t count towards the per-turn limits. These include assorted zombies in Zombie Fluxx, as well as the promotional Radioactive Potato. Certain cards that were Keepers in previous versions of Fluxx are now Creepers, such as Death and War. Creeper cards prevent the player from winning unless a Goal or New Rule specifically states otherwise. Goal cards, which define what is required to win. Most Goals require pairs of Keeper cards: for example, Appliances requires the Toaster and Television Keepers, and Squishy Chocolate requires Chocolate and The Sun. A few Goals are different: for example All You Need Is Love requires the Love as the player&apos;s only Keeper in play, 10 Cards In Hand requires the player&apos;s hand to be the largest one and at least 10 cards, and some Goals require specific Creepers. In standard play, only one Goal can be in play at a time (though the New Rule card Double Agenda allows two Goals to be in play at once, with a win being made by satisfying either Goal&apos;s requirements).

The company compares Meta cards to &quot; house rules &quot;. Their playing is agreed upon by all players before the game starts and last until it ends. [ http://www.looneylabs.com/Newsletter/110125.html Notes From The Lab LooneyLabs.com 2011-01-25 2011-04-28 ] Surprise cards, included in Pirate Fluxx and Star Fluxx, are cards that can be played out of turn and cancel one of the four basic rules (New Rule, Keeper, Action, or Goal). They can prevent the opposing person to win automatically. Fluxx Blanxx are semi-blank cards used to create custom cards to change gameplay further, and are sold in packs of five. Older Fluxx Blanxx booster packs included one booster card for Chrononauts (titled Beatles Reunion Album), a cover card, and a &quot; microcatalog &quot; card advertising other Looney Labs products. Current packs include only the cover card, but also include a new Creeper blank card in addition to one each of the other four card types. The most recent edition of Fluxx, version 4.0, contains 100 cards, as compared to 84 cards in version 3.1 and 81 in the promotional deck.

[ September 2007 ] Even though there was no significant controversy over the game, the company has decided on some changes for the release of the game&apos;s second printing. In 2009, Stoner Fluxx was updated and reprinted, featuring standard Fluxx card backs, several additional cards, and all new color artwork.
