{ Shark Bay, Western Australia } Stromatolites or stromatoliths ( [ s t r ɵ ˈ m æ t oʊ l aɪ t s ]; from Greek στρώμα, strōma, mattress, bed, stratum, and λιθος, lithos, rock) are layered accretion ary structure s formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by biofilm s of microorganism s, especially cyanobacteria (commonly known as blue-green algae ). [ 10.1111/j.1502-3931.1999.tb00550.x ] Stromatolites provide some of the most ancient records of life on Earth. [ Morphology ] A variety of stromatolite morphologies exist including conical, stratiform, branching, domal, [ http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080704122847.htm Two-ton, 500 Million-year-old Fossil Of Stromatolite Discovered In Virginia, U.S. 2011-12-08 ] and columnar types. Stromatolites occur widely in the fossil record of the Precambrian, but are rare today. Very few ancient stromatolites contain fossil ized microbe s. While features of some stromatolites are suggestive of biological activity, others possess features that are more consistent with abiotic (non-organic) precipitation. Finding reliable ways to distinguish between biologically-formed and abiotic (non-biological) stromatolites is an active area of research in geology.

While older, Archean fossil remains are presumed to be colonies of cyanobacteria, younger (that is, Proterozoic ) fossils may be primordial forms of the eukaryote chlorophytes (that is, green algae ). One genus of stromatolite very common in the geologic record is Collenia. The earliest stromatolite of confirmed microbial origin dates to 2.724 billion years ago.

They subsequently declined in abundance and diversity, [ 1982 Precambrian conical stromatolites from California and Sonora McMenamin, M. A. S.

The most widely-supported explanation is that stromatolite builders fell victims to grazing creatures (the Cambrian substrate revolution ), implying that sufficiently complex organisms were common over 1 billion years ago.

Cyanobacteria are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval earth&apos;s atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria use water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to create their food. A layer of mucus often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented together by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of limestone. These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed oncolite s are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the fossil record. Thrombolite s are poorly-laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria common in the fossil record and in modern sediments. The Zebra River Canyon area of the Kubis platform in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of south western Namibia provides an extremely well exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the Proterozoic period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.
