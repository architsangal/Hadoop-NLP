[ the Doctor Who novel System Shock (Doctor Who) ] [ Alan Marriott Scott http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id%3D705 System Shock allgame 2012-02-09 ] { Single-player } { ESRB : M } { DOS, } { Macintosh } { CD-ROM, } { Floppy disk s } { Keyboard, } { Mouse, } { Joystick } System Shock is a first-person action-adventure video game developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Origin Systems. Released in 1994, the game is set aboard the fictional Citadel Station in a cyberpunk vision of 2072. Assuming the role of a nameless hacker, the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence. Unlike other first-person games of the time, System Shock features true 3D environments, and allows the player to look up and down, duck, go prone, jump, mantle, and lean to the side. Critics praised System Shock and hailed it as a major innovation in its genre. It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies. A sequel, System Shock 2, was released by Looking Glass Studios and off-shoot developer Irrational Games in 1999; the 2000 game Deus Ex and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successor s to the two games.

Its interface has been compared to that of Ultima Underworld; [ Paul C. Schuytema December 1994 SHODAN At The Cyberspace Corral Computer Gaming World 125 250, 252, 254 ] it features a freely movable mouse cursor for aiming weapons, interacting with objects, and manipulating the heads-up display (HUD). [ Frase, Tuesday; Smith, Harvey; Moreno, Al; Close, Rachel; Staff System Shock Terminal Access manual 1994 Origin Systems ] View and posture controls on the HUD allow the player to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, and crawl; practical uses for these actions include taking cover, retrieving items beneath the player character, and navigating small passages. The HUD also features three &quot; multi-function displays &quot;, which each present one of five selectable information windows, such as a weapon readout, an automap, or an inventory. The game takes place inside a large, multi-floor space station, in which players explore, combat enemies and solve puzzles. The player advances the plot by acquiring log discs and e-mail s; the game contains no non-player characters with which to converse. Specific computer terminals allow the player to temporarily enter Cyberspace; inside, the player moves weightlessly through a wire frame 3D environment, while collecting data and fighting security programs. Actions in Cyberspace sometimes cause events in the game&apos;s physical world; for example, certain locked doors may only be opened in Cyberspace. The player collects items and weapons throughout the game, such as first-aid kits, lead pipes, dart pistols, and dermal patches. Dermal patches provide the character with beneficial effects—such as regeneration or increased melee attack power—but can cause detrimental side-effects, such as fatigue and distorted color perception. Attachable &quot; hardware &quot; may also be found, including targeting systems, energy shield s and head-mounted lanterns. Increasingly advanced versions of this hardware may be obtained as the game progresses. When activated, most hardware drains from a main energy reserve, which necessitates economization. System Shock features sixteen weapons, of which the player can carry a maximum of seven at one time. Projectile weapons often have selectable ammunition types with varying effects; for example, the dart pistol may fire either explosive needles or tranquilizers. Energy weapons forgo ammunition, and instead draw from the player&apos;s energy reserve. These weapons feature adjustable shot power, which proportionally affects energy consumption. Energy weapons overheat if fired too often—rendering them unusable for a short time. Several types of explosives may also be found, ranging from percussion grenades to land mines and adjustable time bombs. Weapons and munitions deal specific kinds of damage, and certain enemies are immune, or more vulnerable, to particular types. For example, electromagnetic pulse weapons heavily damage robots, but do not affect mutants. Conversely, gas grenades are effective against mutants, but do not damage robots. When an enemy is attacked, the damage is calculated by armor absorption, vulnerabilities, critical hit s, and a degree of randomness. [ Frase, Tuesday System Shock I.C.E. Breaker 1994 Origin Systems ] The effectiveness of an attack is represented in-game by messages such as &quot; Normal damage &quot;, which are displayed near attacked enemies when certain hardware is active. [ Plot ] In the game&apos;s prologue, the protagonist—a nameless hacker—is caught while attempting to access files concerning Citadel Station, a space station owned by the fictional TriOptimum Corporation. The hacker is taken to Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego, a TriOptimum executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the hacker in exchange for a confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls the station. To entice cooperation, Diego promises the hacker a valuable military grade neural implant. { Diego: This is Edward Diego from TriOptimum. The charges against you are severe, but they could be dismissed, if you perform a service. Who knows... there might even be a military grade neural interface in it for you, if you do the job right. } After hacking SHODAN, removing the AI&apos;s ethical constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface. { SHODAN: True to his word, Edward Diego allows the hacker to be fitted with a neural cyberspace interface. } Following the operation, the hacker is put into a six-month healing coma. The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma, and finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station. All robots aboard have been reprogrammed for hostility, and the crew have been either mutated, transformed into cyborg s, or killed. Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum counter-terrorism consultant, contacts the player and claims that Citadel Station&apos;s mining laser is being powered up for a strike against Earth. SHODAN&apos;s plan is to destroy all major cities on the planet, in a bid to become a kind of god. { SHODAN: In my talons, I shape clay, crafting lifeforms as I please. Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth. My whims will become lightning bolts that devastate the mounds of humanity. Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision. God... the title suits me well. } Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker&apos;s incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. { Rebecca: Employee 2-4601, listen carefully. My name is Rebecca Lansing, and I&apos;m a counter-terrorism consultant to TriOptimum. We&apos;re tracking a disruption on Citadel Station — something involving an on-board AI called SHODAN. You are TriOp&apos;s only contact on station. Communications are out, and there is evidence of biological contamination. The mining laser is charging, for a possible strike against Earth. There&apos;s a man named Nathan D&apos;Arcy, who may know something about taking the laser offline. His office is near the central hub on your level. The AI is on the bridge. Once the laser is out, look for the source of the problem there. And by the way, we know all about you and your friend Diego. Pull this off, and we&apos;ll clear your record. That implant you&apos;re wearing is military-grade hardware; use it well. Lansing out. } With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station&apos;s own shields. Foiled by the hacker&apos;s work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station&apos;s crew into mutants. { SHODAN: I see there&apos;s still an insect loose in my station. Do not be fooled into thinking that you have preserved your planet. I am perfecting a mutagen virus in one of the groves, that will turn all Earthly life into festering, gibbering, pestulant mutations. When the station reaches Earth, I shall loose the virus. Poor, poor Earthlings. } The hacker again defeats the AI, this time by jettisoning the chambers used to cultivate the virus. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to download itself into Earth&apos;s computer networks. { Rebecca: Hacker? This is Rebecca. We&apos;ve got a new situation here. A few seconds ago we caught a surge of activity on Citadel Station. Our best guess is that SHODAN is preparing to download itself into Earth&apos;s ComNet. You&apos;ll have to take plastique on the storage level, and use it to knock out the four antenna relays on the engineering level. Don&apos;t try to--*static* / SHODAN: You know, hacker, you are by far the most bothersome human being I have found on this station. But don&apos;t bother with the antennas, you can&apos;t stop me there. It&apos;s hopeless, and we both know it. } Following Rebecca&apos;s advice, the hacker prevents the download&apos;s completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data. { SHODAN: I hope you amused yourself with the antennae. My central consciousness remains supremely undisturbed on the bridge. When the cyborgs catch up to you, I will be watching. } Soon after, Rebecca contacts the hacker, and says that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station&apos;s destruction; she provides him with details on how to do this. { Rebecca: Listen up, hacker. I&apos;ve finally convinced the brass at TriOptimum to let us blow the station. If you can find out the system&apos;s authorization code, you can set the reactor to overload. Look for that code from Willard Richie, the SysOp on engineering. Then you have to go to the reactor core, and look for a panel where you can enter the code, and hit the overload switch. You&apos;ll need at least a level two environment suit to survive, or else a hell of a lot of Detox. Escape pods are on the flight deck, the launch code is 001. Good luck, we&apos;ll be watching. } After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station&apos;s self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. The hacker discovers that the pods are guarded by Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. The hacker dispatches him, and attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. { SHODAN: You have destroyed my beautiful station. You will not escape now. I am departing, but you shall remain to die, my enemy, my creator. } Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. { Rebecca: Ok, now don&apos;t panic. You can still get out of this alive, if you move. SHODAN is going to separate the bridge from the rest of the station. When that happens, be on the bridge. We&apos;ve got a team of engineers here — people who worked on the station and on SHODAN. We&apos;ll try to feed you info while you make your run--*static* / SHODAN: I see you are still receiving transmissions from Earth. We&apos;ll have no more of that. } The hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN&apos;s jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computer s. { Taggert: Ok, I think Morris&apos; scrambler&apos;s working. It&apos;ll take SHODAN awhile before it cuts us off. Listen, when you reach the center of the bridge, look for the primary cyberjack. You can&apos;t take SHODAN down anywhere but cyberspace. Those computers are so shielded, to destroy them you&apos;d have to blow up the whole bridge. } Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker. [ Development ] [ Origins ] System Shock was first conceived during the final stages of Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds development, between December 1992 and January 1993. Doug Church spent this period at the Texas headquarters of publisher Origin Systems, and discussions about Looking Glass Technologies &apos; next project occurred between him and producer Warren Spector, with input from Austin Grossman and Paul Neurath in Massachusetts. According to Church, the team believed that they &quot; had done too many dungeon games &quot;, and decided to create another &quot; immersive simulation game &quot; without a fantasy setting. A modern day setting was briefly considered, but Church explained that the idea was rejected because &quot; it [would] just beg so many questions: why can&apos;t I pick up the phone, why can&apos;t I get on the train, and so on &quot;. Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts, and he, Neurath and Grossman created several possible science fiction settings for the game. According to Spector, the game was initially titled &quot; Alien Commander &quot;, and was a spin-off of the Wing Commander series; however, the idea was soon changed entirely. He believed that &quot; part of the fun &quot; was that he and Church &quot; weren&apos;t tied to the Ultima universe or the Commander universe, so we could basically do whatever we liked &quot;. [ Bielby Matt Matt Bielby May/June 1994 1 System Shock; You&apos;re All Alone Now PC Gamer US 14–16 ] The four collaborated to write numerous &quot; minutes of gameplay &quot;, which described how the game would feel; Church gave the example, &quot; You know, &apos;You hear the sound of a security camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way&apos; &quot;. The documents would &quot; hint &quot; at the gameplay systems involved, and at the non-linear possibilities in each situation. Despite Neurath&apos;s involvement in the initial design, he said that the project &quot; was always Doug Church&apos;s vision at heart &quot;.

Church later said that &quot; pretty much everything [in the game] derived [from] two little three-paragraph &apos;minute of gameplay&apos; documents &quot;. Shortly before production began, Tribe bassist Greg LoPiccolo was hired contractually to work on the game&apos;s music; he had visited a friend at the company, and was asked by the game&apos;s programmers—many of whom were fans of the band—if he would take the role.

The character&apos;s shield is displayed at the top right, while weapons and abilities are listed at the bottom. } Church considered the game to be largely &quot; an outgrowth of Ultima Underworld &quot;, with more focus on action. However, he said that the game &quot; isn&apos;t about continuous combat so much as continuous tension, where we try to keep [players] wired and wondering what&apos;s around the corner &quot;.

Seeking to make System Shock a more &quot; integrated whole &quot; than Ultima Underworld, the designers streamlined the role-playing and simulation elements of the latter game, and removed aspects that took players out of the experience. They attempted to &quot; plunge [players] into the fiction and never provide an opportunity for breaking that fiction &quot;, and stated that &quot; System Shock, if nothing else, should feel continuous &quot;. This design approach resulted in the removal of conversations with non-player characters; the plot was instead conveyed by log discs and e-mail messages. System Shock 2 Project Manager Johnathan Chey later called the technology of 1994 &quot; simply inadequate to support believable and enjoyable interactions with [non-player characters] &quot;.

Spector&apos;s role as a producer gave him the job of explaining the game to the publisher&apos;s management, which he called his &quot; biggest challenge &quot;. He explained that they &quot; didn&apos;t always get what the team was trying to do &quot;, and said, &quot; You don&apos;t want to know how many times the game came this close to being killed (or how late in the project) &quot;.

LoPiccolo recorded all of the game&apos;s sound effects and spoken dialogue, using friends&apos; voices regularly for the latter. SHODAN was voice acted by fellow Tribe member Terri Brosius. He developed the game&apos;s audio over 16 months, working on a contractual basis until Tribe disbanded in May 1994; Ned Lerner gave him a full-time job as audio director the next day. The game&apos;s score—called &quot; dark &quot;, &quot; electronic &quot; and &quot; cyberpunk &quot; by the Boston Herald —was composed on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer. It dynamically changes according to the player&apos;s actions; he noted that, when using this method, it is necessary to write music that &quot; still flows with the overall theme and doesn&apos;t jump around &quot;. The original September 1994 floppy disk release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM was released in December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version.

The additional audio added so much it might as well have been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern.

[ Rouse III Richard Game Design: Theory &amp; Practice Second Edition Wordware Publishing 500-531 2005 1-55622-912-7 ] It also supports true local lighting, which allows objects within the environment to emit light. The game&apos;s star field system was written by programmer James Fleming. The designers utilized loopholes in the engine&apos;s renderer to create more diverse, striking environments; despite having coded the renderer, Church said that &quot; at first glance even I couldn&apos;t see how they did them &quot;. However, this contributed to the performance issues already being caused by the engine&apos;s advanced nature; during development, the team struggled to optimize the game. The team originally hoped to include polygon al 3D character models, but they could not be implemented on schedule. Seamus Blackley designed the game&apos;s physics system, which is a modified version of the one he wrote for Flight Unlimited. At the time, Church described it as &quot; far more sophisticated than what you would normally use for an indoor game &quot;. The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. [ Yee Bernie Through the Looking Glass PC Gamer 62, 63, 65, 67, 69 March 1995 ] The game&apos;s most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the character&apos;s head &quot; tilts forward when you start to run, and jerks back a bit when you stop &quot;, and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its &quot; head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to [the] mass and velocity of the objects involved &quot;. On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, &quot; If games don&apos;t obey physics, we somehow feel that something isn&apos;t right &quot;, and that &quot; the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn&apos;t notice the physics, but only notices that things feel the way they should &quot;.
