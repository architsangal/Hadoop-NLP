[ History ] Crescent was formed with the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 on March 2, 1889, and officially started that fall when William Brown began selling general merchandise out of a wagon. Soon he took on a partner, Benjamin Ryland, and the two moved into a log cabin. A post office christened &quot; Crescent City &quot; was established on February 21, 1890, the name taken from a moon-shaped glade where the town began. In November 1891 the town site was platted, and incorporated in 1893. The Denver, Enid and Gulf Railroad laid track one mile (1.6  km) west of the city in 1902, and the city obtained [ 160 acre km2 ] of land from two farmers (C. E. Wells and J. H. Rhoades) creating &quot; new Crescent &quot; or &quot; West Crescent &quot;; eventually the town moved to the new location. Oil was discovered north of town in 1926 and then south of town in 1930 in the &quot; Crescent Oil Field &quot;. { Hedglen, Thomas L. - &quot; Crescent &quot;.
