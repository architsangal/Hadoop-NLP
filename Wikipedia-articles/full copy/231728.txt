One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from [ 12 - 16 m ft ] and weigh approximately [ 36000 kg lb ]. The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is an acrobatic animal, often breaching and slapping the water. Males produce a complex song, which lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and is repeated for hours at a time. The purpose of the song is not yet clear, although it appears to have a role in mating. Found in ocean s and sea s around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to [ 25000 km mi ] each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or sub-tropical waters to breed and give birth in the winter. During the winter, humpbacks fast and live off their fat reserves. The species&apos; diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net feeding technique. Like other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the whaling industry. Due to over-hunting, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a whaling moratorium was introduced in 1966. Stocks have since partially recovered; however, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution also remain concerns. There are at least 80,000 humpback whales worldwide. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, humpbacks are now sought by whale-watchers, particularly off parts of Australia, New Zealand, South America, Canada, and the United States.

The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene. [ http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDFfiles/PDG413_Whaleevol.pdf PDF McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology 2004 The McGraw Hill Companies Whale Evolution Gingerich P Philip D. Gingerich ] However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other. Though clearly related to the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the humpback has been the sole member of its genus since Gray &apos;s work in 1846. More recently though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the Humpback is more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), and possibly to the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to rorquals such as the minke whale s.

The humpback whale was first identified as &quot; baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre &quot; by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Regnum Animale of 1756. In 1781, Georg Heinrich Borowski described the species, converting Brisson&apos;s name to its Latin equivalent, Balaena novaeangliae. In 1804, Lacépède shifted the humpback from the Balaenidae family, renaming it Balaenoptera jubartes. In 1846, John Edward Gray created the genus Megaptera, classifying the humpback as Megaptera longipinna, but in 1932, Remington Kellogg reverted the species names to use Borowski&apos;s novaeangliae. [ The Whales&apos; Journey Martin S 2011 251 Allen &amp; Unwin Pty., Limited 1-86508-232-5 ] The common name is derived from the curving of their back when diving. The generic name Megaptera from the Greek mega-/μεγα- &quot; giant &quot; and ptera/πτερα &quot; wing &quot;, [ Liddell &amp; Scott 2011 Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged Edition Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK 0-19-910207-4 ] refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means &quot; New Englander &quot; and was probably given by Brisson due the regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of New England. [ Description ] { Skeleton on Display at } { The Museum of Osteology, } { Oklahoma City, Oklahoma } { Boston Harbor } A humpback whale can easily be identified by its stocky body with an obvious hump and black dorsal coloring. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercle s, which are actually hair follicle s, and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which it lifts above the surface in some dive sequences, has wavy trailing edges. [ Recovery Plan for the Humpback Whale (Megapten Novaeangliae) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration PDF 1991 http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/whale_humpback.pdf 2011-06-30 ] The four global populations, all under study, are: North Pacific, Atlantic, and Southern Ocean humpbacks, which have distinct populations which complete a migratory round-trip each year and the Indian Ocean population, which does not migrate, prevented by that ocean&apos;s northern coastline. The long black and white tail fin, which can be up to a third of body length, and the pectoral fins have unique patterns, which make individual whales identifiable. [ Katona S.K. and Whitehead, H.P. 1981 Identifying humpback whales using their mural markings Polar Record 20 439–444 ] [ Kaufman G., Smultea M.A. and Forestell P. 1987 Use of lateral body pigmentation patterns for photo ID of east Australian (Area V) humpback whales Cetus 7 1 5–13 ] Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback&apos;s pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The two most enduring mention the higher maneuverability afforded by long fins, and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates. Humpbacks also have &apos; rete mirabile &apos;, a heat exchanging system, which works similarly in humpbacks, sharks and other fish. [ December 2010 ] alt=Photo showing humpback with only white underside of tail visible alt=Photo of vertical humpback displaying only white tail underside and rear body segment Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly coloured baleen plates on each side of the mouth. The plates measure from a mere [ 18 in cm ] in the front to approximately [ 3 ft m ] long in the back, behind the hinge. Ventral grooves run from the lower jaw to the umbilicus about halfway along the underside of the whale. These grooves are less numerous (usually 16–20) and consequently more prominent than in other rorqual s. [ December 2010 ] The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a [ 3 m ] heart-shaped to bushy blow, or exhalation of water through the blowholes. Because Humpback Whales breathe voluntarily, it is possible that the whales shut off only half of the brain when sleeping. [ O. I. Lyamin, L. M. Mukhametov, J. M. Siegel, P. R. Manger, and O. V.

Newborn calves are roughly the length of their mother&apos;s head. At birth, calves measure [ 20 ft m ] at [ 2 ST MT on ] The mother, by comparison, is about [ 50 ft m ]. They nurse for approximately six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color. Some calves have been observed alone after arrival in Alaska n waters. [ December 2010 ] Females reach sexual maturity at the age of five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity at approximately 7 years of age. The humpback whale lifespan ranges from 45–100 years. { Dawes 2008, p.291 } Fully grown, the males average [ 15 - 16 m ]. Females are slightly larger at [ 16 - 17 m ], and [ 40000 kg short ton ]; the largest recorded specimen was [ 19 m ft ] long and had pectoral fins measuring [ 6 m ft ] each. { Clapham 2002, p.589–592 } Females have a hemispherical lobe about [ 15 cm in ] in diameter in their genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females. The male&apos;s penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit. Male whales have distinctive scars on heads and bodies, some resulting from battles over females. [ November 2011 ] [ Identifying individuals ] The varying patterns on the tail flukes are sufficient to identify individuals. Unique visual identification is not currently possible in most cetacean species (other exceptions include orca s and right whale s ), making the humpback a popular study species. [ November 2011 ] A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates, and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique (Katona and Beard 1982). A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is currently maintained by College of the Atlantic. [ http://www.coa.edu/alliedwhaleresearch.htm Whalenet Data Search Wheelock College Williamson JM 2005 2007-04-03 ] Similar photographic identification projects have begun in the North Pacific by SPLASH (Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance and Status of Humpbacks), and around the world. [ Life history ] [ Reproduction ] Females typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months, yet some individuals have been known to breed in two consecutive years. The peak months for birth are January, February, July, and August. There is usually a 1-2 year period between humpback births. Humpback whales can live up to 48 years. Recent research on humpback mitochondrial DNA reveals that groups that live in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools.

Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. These whales are not excessively social in most cases. Groups may stay together a little longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. It is possible that some females retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback&apos;s range overlaps considerably with other whale and dolphin species — for instance, the minke whale. However, humpbacks rarely interact socially with them, though humpback calves in Hawaiian waters sometimes play with bottlenose dolphin calves. [ December 2010 ] [ Courtship ] Courtship rituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward the equator from summer feeding grounds closer to the poles. Competition is usually fierce, and unrelated males dubbed escorts by researcher Louis Herman frequently trail females as well as mother-calf dyads. Groups of two to twenty males gather around a single female and exhibit a variety of behaviors over several hours to establish dominance of what is known as a competitive group. Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive to try their luck. Behaviors include breaching, spyhopping, lob-tailing, tail-slapping, fin-slapping, peduncle throws, charging and parrying. Less common &quot; super pods &quot; may number more than 40 males, all vying for the same female. (M. Ferrari et al.) Whale song is assumed to have an important role in mate selection; however, scientists remain unsure whether song is used between males to establish identity and dominance, between a male and a female as a mating call, or both.

Ogg ] Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, however only males produce the long, loud, complex &quot; songs &quot; for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low register that vary in amplitude and frequency, and typically lasts from 10 to 20 minutes. Humpbacks may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. Cetacean s have no vocal cords, so whales generate their song by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities. Whales within a large area sing the same song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, and those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population&apos;s song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating. Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale song. Only males sing, suggesting that one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, and results in conflict. Singing may therefore be a challenge to other males.

This indicates that they are probably a more general communication tool. Scientists hypothesize that singing may keep migrating populations connected. (Ferrari, Nicklin, Darling, et al.) Some observers report that singing begins when competition for a female ends. { www.whaletrust.com } Humpback whales have also been found to make a range of other social sounds to communicate such as &quot; grunts &quot;, &quot; groans &quot;, &quot; thwops &quot;, &quot; snorts &quot; and &quot; barks &quot;. { Cecilia Burke, &apos; &apos;A whale&apos;s varied vocabulary&apos;, Australian Geographic, AG Online.

The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder. This ring can begin at up to [ 30 m ft ] in diameter and involve the cooperation of a dozen animals.

By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean, and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It was, however, the late 19th century introduction of the explosive harpoon that allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. It is estimated that during the 20th century, at least 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%, with North Atlantic populations estimated to have dropped to as low as 700 individuals. { Breiwick JM, Mitchell E, Reeves RR (1983) Simulated population trajectories for northwest Atlantic humpback whales 1865–1980. Fifth biennial Conference on Biology of Marine Mammals, Boston Abstract. p14 } In 1946, the International Whaling Commission was founded to oversee the whaling industry. They imposed rules and regulations for hunting whales and set open and closed hunting seasons.To prevent extinction, the International Whaling Commission banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966.

[ Journal of the Acoustic Society of America 94 1849–1850 Blast injury in humpback whale ears ] Once hunted to the brink of extinction, the humpback has made a dramatic comeback in the North Pacific. A 2008 study estimates that the humpback population that hit a low of 1,500 whales before hunting was banned worldwide, has made a comeback to a population of between 18,000 and 20,000.

[ Dierauf L &amp; Gulland F 2001 Marine Mammal Medicine CRC Press 0-8493-0839-9 ] The United Kingdom, among other countries, designated the humpback as a priority species under the national Biodiversity Action Plan. The sanctuary provided by U.S. National Park s such as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and Cape Hatteras National Seashore, among others, have also become major factors in sustaining populations.

Chittleborough and W. H. Dawbin in the 1960s. [ 10.1071/MF9650033 Chittleborough RG. 1965 Dynamics of two populations of the humpback whale Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 16 33–128 ] Roger Payne and Scott McVay made further studies of the species in 1971.

In August 2008, the IUCN changed humpback&apos;s status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered. [ http://cms.iucn.org/index.cfm?uNewsID%3D1413 Humpback whale on road to recovery, reveals IUCN Red List 2008-08-12 IUCN 2008-08-12 ] The United States is considering listing separate humpback populations, so that smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000-20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpback&apos;s extraordinary migrations, which can extend the [ 5157 mi km ] from Antarctica to Costa Rica. [ Whale-watching ] [ Whale watching ] { Maui, } { Hawaii } Humpback whales are generally curious about objects in their environment. Some individuals, referred to as &quot; friendlies &quot;, approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes. Because humpbacks are often easily approachable, curious, easily identifiable as individuals, and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale-watching tourism in many locations around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of &quot; eco tourism &quot; to use the species without killing them. This whale watching business attracts 1 million visitors a year, which results in a profit of $80 million. [ November 2011 ] There are many commercial whale-watching operations on both the humpback&apos;s summer and winter ranges: [ November 2011 ] North Atlantic North Pacific Southern Hemisphere Summer New England, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, the northern St. Lawrence River, the Snaefellsnes peninsula in the west of Iceland California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia Antarctica, Bahía Solano and Nuquí in Colombia Winter Samaná Province of the Dominican Republic, the Bay of Biscay France, Hawaii, Baja, the Bahía de Banderas off Puerto Vallarta Sydney, Byron Bay north of Sydney, Hervey Bay north of Brisbane, North and East of Cape Town, New Zealand, the Tonga n islands, [ Famous humpbacks ] [ The Tay Whale ] { John Struthers about to dissect the Tay Whale, } { Dundee, photographed by } { George Washington Wilson in 1884 } In December 1883 a male humpback swam up the Tay estuary of Scotland, past what was then the whaling port of Dundee. The whale was exhibited to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition which travelled to Edinburgh and London. The whale was dissected by professor John Struthers, who wrote seven papers on its anatomy, and then in 1889 a monograph on the humpback.

Migaloo is the only known all-white humpback whale. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8126237.stm Exclusion zone for special whale 2009-06-30 BBC News 2009-06-30 ] First sighted in 1991 and believed to be 3–5 years old at that time, Migaloo is an indigenous Australian word for &quot; white fella &quot;. Migaloo was shown to be male in 2004 by analysis of sloughed skin samples. Because of the intense interest, environmentalists feared that he was becoming distressed by the number of boats following him each day. In response, the Queensland and New South Wales governments introduce legislation each year to create a 500  m (1600  ft) exclusion zone around the whale. Recent close up pictures have shown Migaloo to have skin cancer and/or skin cysts as a result of his lack of protection from the sun.

ISBN 0-89346-346-9 } { Callenbach E &amp; Leefeldt C Humphrey the Wayward Whale, ISBN 0-930588-23-1 } In 1985, Humphrey swam into San Francisco Bay and then up the Sacramento River towards Rio Vista. { Jane Kay, San Francisco Examiner Monday, 9 October 1995 } Five years later, Humphrey returned and became stuck on a mudflat in San Francisco Bay immediately north of Sierra Point below the view of onlookers from the upper floors of the Dakin Building. He was pulled off the mudflat with a large cargo net and the help of the Coast Guard. Both times he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a &quot; sound net &quot; in which people in a flotilla of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known as &quot; oikami. &quot; At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean. { Toni Knapp, The Six Bridges of Humphrey the Whale. Illustrated by Craig Brown. Roberts Rinehart, 1993 (1989) } After leaving San Francisco Bay in 1990, Humphrey was seen only once, at the Farallon Islands in 1991.
