At other times, Mr Cameron could be found in the kitchen making coffee. The MP was unaware his lover shared the apartment with a reporter. At the time of the affair the woman worked as a Commonwealth DPP solicitor. She has moved to Washington. The pair hit it off when Mr Cameron revealed he had trained as a solicitor and worked for top firm Blake Dawson Waldron. &quot; How MP betrayed his pregnant wife Telegraph August 17, 2004 } Mark Bahnisch wrote &quot; He was probably.... unwise not to enquire of the “exotic solicitor”‘s flatmate what her occupation was – she turned out to be a member of the Canberra Press Gallery – hence his pre-emptive confession &quot; Fairfax publication The Sydney Morning Herald later noted that Cameron &quot; realised he had been so indiscreet – his lover shared a house with a News Limited journalist – that it would come out anyway &quot;. { &quot; One of the few casualties of the recent Australian election on the Coalition side was the former member for Parramatta, Ross Cameron, who combined a public confession of an affair with an “exotic solicitor” (whatever that may mean), with a practice of sending out Christmas cards with pictures of his smiling family and appropriate Biblical verses. I’d be inclined to agree with Michael Howard that MPs’ private lives are their own business, but perhaps Mr Cameron’s loud trumpetting of his “family values” and “Bible-believing Christian” credentials contributed to the willingness of the media to run with the story. He was probably also unwise not to enquire of the “exotic solicitor”‘s flatmate what her occupation was – she turned out to be a member of the Canberra Press Gallery – hence his pre-emptive confession. &quot; &quot; http://clubtroppo.com.au/2004/11/14/anarchy-in-the-uk/ } { &quot; Ironically, the other big story of the week involved not ugly lies but an ugly truth. Ross Cameron was the religious right&apos;s point man in Parliament. He hosted weekly prayer meetings in his office, he lectured all and sundry on family values, he was a second-generation, evangelical Christian. He was also such a monumental pants man and hypocrite that even he couldn&apos;t stand himself any more, so he &apos;fessed up. Well, that&apos;s his story. More likely he realised he had been so indiscreet – his lover shared a house with a News Limited journalist – that it would come out anyway. In any case, he clearly misjudged the way his confession would be received. Far from lauding him for his belated honesty, the tabloid media went in for the kill, contrasting the then pregnant wife at home with the &quot; exotic &quot; younger &quot; party girl &quot;, etc, etc. After a few days of this, one Liberal strategist opined the person who could win Parramatta for the party now was Cameron&apos;s wife &quot;. http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/20/1092972745285.html } Richard Wilson in The culture of contempt notes that there had been a &quot; deliberate decision by a number of journalists not to report the often open philandering of Liberal MP for Parramatta Ross Cameron.....

Ex-Liberal Andrew Elder concluded in 2010 that &quot; the Liberal Party.... insisted that Cameron be married before he could be endorsed and go to Parliament. In marrying – a public display of his private life – Cameron&apos;s challenge was to find an avowedly Christian woman who did not mind his sexual infidelity but did not practice it herself: a tough ask, impossible for our Ross. When the inevitable happened in 2004, Ross decided to go public. Accept me as I am, he insisted: I&apos;m going to talk family values but I won&apos;t practice it. Mrs Cameron realised that there was more dignity in abandoning this farce than standing by to prop it up. &quot; [ http://andrewelder.blogspot.com/2010/05/ross-cameron-moment-tony-abbotts-ego.html The Ross Cameron Moment 18 May 2010 15 April 2011 ] Cameron moved out of the family home shortly after the publication of the Good Weekend article and the marriage ended. Cameron remarried in 2009. Like his first wife, his second wife was six months pregnant when the ceremony took place. Cameron has four children from his first marriage, and two from his second.
