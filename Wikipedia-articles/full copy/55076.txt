[ October 2008 ] [ February 2011 ] [ Abattoir ] Workers and cattle in a slaughterhouse. A slaughterhouse or abattoir [ En-us-abattoir.ogg &apos; æ b @ t w ɑr ] is a facility where animals are killed for consumption as food products. Slaughterhouses which process meat not intended for human consumption are sometimes referred to as Knacker&apos;s yards or Knacker ies. In the United States, around nine billion (an unverified number) animals are slaughtered every year [ May 2011 ] (this includes about 150.4 million cattle, bison, sheep, hogs, and goats and 8.9 billion chickens, turkeys, and ducks) in 5,700 slaughterhouses and processing plants employing 527,000 workers; [ May 2011 ] in 2009, [ 13450000 LT MT on us ] of beef were consumed in the U.S. alone. { &quot; U.S. Beef and Cattle Industry &quot;, United States Department of Agriculture, cited in Torres, Bob. Making a Killing. AK Press, 2007, p. 45. } In Canada, 650 million animals are killed annually. { &quot; Slaughterhouses &quot;, Global Action Network, accessed March 18, 2008. } In the European Union, the annual figure is 300 million cattle, sheep, and pigs, and four billion (an unverified number) chicken s. [ May 2011 ] Slaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant logistical problems and public health requirements. [ May 2011 ] Public aversion to meat packing in many cultures influences the location of slaughterhouses. In addition, some religions stipulate certain conditions for the slaughter of animals. There has been criticism of the methods of transport, preparation, herding, and killing within some slaughterhouses, and in particular of the speed with which the slaughter is sometimes conducted. Investigations by animal welfare and animal rights groups have indicated that in some cases animals are skinned or gutted while alive and conscious. In some cases animals are driven for hundreds of miles to slaughterhouses in conditions that often result in injuries and death en route. { See, for example, Vansickle, J. &quot; Quality Assurance Program Launched, &quot; National Hog Farmer, February 15, 2002, which reports that each year 420,000 pigs are crippled and 170,000 killed during transport to slaughterhouses, cited in Williams, Erin E. and DeMello, Margo. Why Animals Matter. Prometheus Books, 2007, p. 49. } Slaughtering animals is opposed by animal rights groups on ethical grounds. [ Productivity ] Typically 45-50% of the animal can be turned into edible products ( meat ). About 15% is waste, and the remaining 40-45% of the animal is turned into byproducts such as leather, soaps, candles (tallow), and adhesives. [ May 2011 ] [ History ] { Lovis Corinth, 1893. } Slaughterhouses have existed as long as there have been settlements too large for individuals to rear their own stock for personal consumption. Early maps of London show numerous stockyards in the periphery of the city, where slaughter occurred in the open air. A term for such open-air slaughterhouse is a shambles. There are streets named &quot; The Shambles &quot; in some English towns (e.g. Worcester, York ) which got their name from having been the site on which butchers killed and prepared animals for consumption. [ May 2011 ] [ Design ] [ May 2011 ] [ October 2008 ] { Temple Grandin are intended to reduce stress in animals being led to slaughter. } In the latter part of the 20th century, the layout and design of most US slaughterhouses was influenced by the work of Dr. Temple Grandin. { Grandin, T. &quot; Best Practices for Animal Handling and Stunning &quot;, Meat &amp; Poultry, April 2000, pg. 76. } She suggested that reducing the stress of animals being led to slaughter may help slaughterhouse operators improve efficiency and profit. { Grandin, T. and Deesing, M. 2008. Humane Livestock Handling. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA, USA. } In particular she applied an intuitive understanding of animal psychology to design pens and corral s which funnel a herd of animals arriving at a slaughterhouse into a single file ready for slaughter. Her corrals employ long sweeping curves so that each animal is prevented from seeing what lies ahead and just concentrates on the hind quarters of the animal in front of it. This design also attempts to override the animals&apos; survival instincts and prevent them from reversing direction. [ May 2011 ] As of 2011 Grandin claimed to have designed over 54% of the slaughterhouses in the United States as well as many others around the world. [ March 2011 ] [ Mobile design ] By 2010 a mobile facility the Modular Harvest System had received USEda approval. It can be moved from ranch to ranch. It consists of three trailers, one for slaughtering, one for consumable body parts and one for other body parts. Preparation of individual cuts is done at a butchery or other meat preparation facility. [ Muhlke Christine FIELD REPORT; A Movable Beast The New York Times 22 23 May 2010 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23food-t-000.html ] [ Process ] [ May 2011 ] A steer restrained for stunning just prior to slaughter. The slaughterhouse process differs by species and region and may be controlled by civil law as well as religious laws such as Kosher and Halal laws. A typical U.S. procedure follows: [ http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/oie/downloads/tahc_mar07/tahc-guide-slau-ans-mar07.pdf Guidelines for the Slaughter of Animals ] Cattle (mostly steers and heifers, some cows, and even fewer bulls) arrive via truck or rail from a ranch, farm, or feedlot. Place animals in holding pens. Knock them out by applying an electric shock of 300 volts and 2 amps to the back of the head, effectively stunning them, USDA or by use of a captive bolt pistol to the front of the cow&apos;s head (a pneumatic or cartridge-fired captive bolt). Swine can be rendered unconscious by CO 2 /inert gas stunning. (This step is prohibited under strict application of Halal and Kashrut codes.) Hang them upside down by both of their hind legs and place them on the processing line. Sever the carotid artery and jugular vein with a knife. The blood drains from the body, causing death through exsanguination. Remove the head and feet. Cut around the digestive tract to prevent fecal contamination later in the process. Remove the hide /skin by &quot; down pullers &quot;, &quot; side pullers &quot; and &quot; fisting &quot; off the pelt (sheep and goats). Hides can also be removed by laying the carcase on a cradle and skinning with a knife. Remove internal organs and inspect them for parasites and signs of disease. Separate the viscera from the heart and lungs, referred to as the &quot; pluck &quot; for inspection. Also separate livers for inspection. Drop or remove tongues from the head, and send the head down the line on head hooks or head racks for inspection of the lymph nodes for signs of systemic disease. A government inspector inspects the carcase for safety. (This inspection is performed by the Food Safety Inspection Service in the U.S., and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Canada.) Reduce levels of bacteria using interventions such as steam, hot water, and organic acids. Optionally Electrically stimulate cattle and sheep (only) to improve meat tenderness. Chill carcases to prevent the growth of microorganism s and to reduce meat deterioration while the meat awaits distribution. Cut the chilled carcase into primal cut s, subprimals and/or leave intact as a &quot; side &quot; of meat. Beef and horse carcases are always split in half and then quartered, pork is split into sides only and goat/ veal /mutton and lamb is left whole. The remaining carcase may be further processed to extract any residual traces of meat, usually termed advanced meat recovery or mechanically separated meat, for human or animal consumption. Materials such as bone, lard or tallow, are sent to a rendering plant. Also, lard and tallow can be used for the production of biodiesel or heating oil. The wastewater, consisting of blood and fecal matter, generated by the slaughtering process is sent to a waste water treatment plant. The meat is transported to distribution centers that then distribute to retail markets. [ International variations ] [ May 2011 ] The standards and regulations governing slaughterhouses vary considerably around the world. In many countries the slaughter of animals is regulated by custom and tradition rather than by law. In the non-Western world, including the Arab world, the Indian sub-continent, etc., both forms of meat are available: one which is produced in modern mechanized slaughterhouses, and the other from local butcher shops. In some communities animal slaughter may be controlled by religious law s, most notably halal for Muslim s and kashrut for Jew ish communities. These both require that the animals being slaughtered should be conscious at the point of death, [ January 2012 ] and as such animals cannot be stunned prior to killing. This can cause conflicts with national regulations when a slaughterhouse adhering to the rules of kosher preparation is located in some Western countries. In Islamic and Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, due to it being forbidden for an animal to be killed prior to slaughter. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning where the shock is less painful and non-fatal, and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock. In many societies, traditional cultural and religious aversion to slaughter led to prejudice against the people involved. In Japan, where the ban on slaughter of livestock for food [ April 2010 ] was lifted only in the late 19th century, the newly found slaughter industry drew workers primarily from villages of burakumin, who traditionally worked in occupations relating to death (such as executioners and undertakers). In some parts of western Japan, prejudice faced by current and former residents of such areas ( burakumin &quot; hamlet people &quot; ) is still a sensitive issue. Because of this, even the Japanese word for &quot; slaughter &quot; (屠殺 tosatsu) is deemed politically incorrect by some pressure group s as its inclusion of the kanji for &quot; kill &quot; (殺) supposedly portrays those who practice it in a negative manner. Some countries have laws that exclude specific animal species or grades of animal from being slaughtered for human consumption, especially those that are taboo food. The former Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee suggested in 2004 introducing legislation banning the slaughter of cows throughout India, as Hinduism holds cows as sacred and considers their slaughter unthinkable and offensive. This was often opposed on grounds of religious freedom. The slaughter of cows and the importation of beef into the nation of Nepal are strictly forbidden. Several U.S. states have banned the slaughter and consumption of dogs. [ Poultry slaughter house ] [ January 2012 ] [ Law ] [ May 2011 ] { USDA inspection of } { pig. } Most countries have laws in regard to the treatment of animals at slaughterhouses. In the United States, there is the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, a law requiring that all swine, sheep, cattle, and horses be stunned unconscious with just one application of a stunning device by a trained person before being shackled and hoisted up on the line ( chicken s are exempt from this Act). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is opposed to the Humane Slaughter Act, and violations of the Act carry no penalties. [ November 2010 ] Since stopping the line to re-knock conscious animals causes &quot; down time &quot; and results in lower profits, the Humane Slaughter Act is usually bypassed and ignored by USDA supervisors. There is some debate over the enforcement of this act. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as kosher shechita and dhabiĥa halal. Most strict interpretations of kashrut require that the animal be fully sensible when its carotid artery is cut. [ January 2012 January 2012 ] The novel The Jungle detailed unsanitary conditions in slaughterhouses and the meatpacking industry during the 1800s. This led directly to an investigation commissioned directly by the President, and to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which established the Food and Drug Administration. A much larger body of regulation deals with the public health and worker safety regulation and inspection. [ Animal welfare concerns ] [ April 2010 ] For her book Slaughterhouse, Gail Eisnitz, chief investigator for the Humane Farming Association (HFA), interviewed slaughterhouse workers in the U.S. who say that, because of the speed with which they are required to work, animals are routinely skinned while apparently alive, and still blinking, kicking, and shrieking. Eisnitz argues that this is not only cruel to the animals, but also dangerous for the human workers, as cows weighing several thousands of pounds thrashing around in pain are likely to kick out and debilitate anyone working near them. { Eisnitz, Gail A. Slaughterhouse. Prometheus Books, 1997, cited in Torres, Bob. Making a Killing. AK Press, 2007, p. 46. } According to the HFA, Eiznitz interviewed slaughterhouse workers representing over two million hours of experience, who, without exception, told her that they have beaten, strangled, boiled, and dismembered animals alive, or have failed to report those who do. The workers described the effects the violence has had on their personal lives, with several admitting to being physically abusive or taking to alcohol and other drugs. { &quot; HFA Exposé Uncovers Federal Crimes &quot;, Humane Farming Association, accessed March 8, 2008. } The HFA alleges that workers are required to kill up to 1,100 hogs an hour, and end up taking their frustration out on the animals. Eisnitz interviewed one worker, who had worked in ten slaughterhouses, about pig production. He told her: [ Hogs get stressed out pretty easy. If you prod them too much, they have heart attacks. If you get a hog in the chute that&apos;s had the shit prodded out of him and has a heart attack or refuses to move, you take a meat hook and hook it into his bunghole. You try to do this by clipping the hipbone. Then you drag him backwards. You&apos;re dragging these hogs alive, and a lot of times the meat hook rips out of the bunghole. I&apos;ve seen ham s — thigh s — completely ripped open. I&apos;ve also seen intestines come out. If the hog collapses near the front of the chute, you shove the meat hook into his cheek and drag him forward. Eisnitz, p. 82, cites in Torres, Bob. Making a Killing. AK Press, 2007, p. 47. ] Over the last few decades, some research has been done toward making slaughterhouses more humane; one well-known scientist in this field is Temple Grandin. [ Fish ] Historically, some doubted that fish could experience pain. However, laboratory experiments have shown that fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g. injections of bee venom ) in a similar way to mammals. [ Sneddon LU Pain perception in fish: indicators and endpoints. ILAR Journal 50 4 38–42 19949250 ] [ Oidtmann B Hoffman RW Pain and suffering in fish Berliner und Münchener tierärztliche Wochenschrift 114 7-8 277–82 2001 Jul-Aug 11505801 ] The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish. [ Lund V Mejdell CM, Röcklinsberg H, Anthony R, Håstein T Expanding the moral circle: farmed fish as objects of moral concern. Diseases of aquatic organisms 72 2 109–118 2007-05-04 17578250 ] In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out, or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object [ Davie PS Kopf RK Physiology, behaviour and welfare of fish during recreational fishing and after release. New Zealand veterinary journal 54 4 161–172 2006 Aug 16915337 ] (called pithing or ike jime in Japanese). [ Major slaughterhouses ] The largest slaughterhouse in the world is operated by the Smithfield Packing Company in Tar Heel, North Carolina. It is capable of butchering over 32,000 pigs a day. In the US, the majority of major meat packing plants are located in the Midwestern and High Plains regions.
