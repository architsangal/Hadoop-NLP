[ http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/williams.html Astronaut Bio: Dafydd (Dave) R. Williams NASA March 2008 ] He had two spaceflight s, both of which were Space Shuttle missions. His first spaceflight, STS-90 in 1998, was a 16-day mission aboard Space Shuttle &apos;&apos;Columbia&apos;&apos; dedicated to neuroscience research. His second flight, STS-118 in August 2007, was flown by Space Shuttle &apos;&apos;Endeavour&apos;&apos; to the International Space Station. During that mission he performed three spacewalks, becoming the third Canadian to perform a spacewalk and setting a Canadian record for total number of spacewalks. [ Astronaut Dave Williams Biography astronautdavewilliams.com http://astronautdavewilliams.com/Biography.html July 28, 2011 ] These spacewalks combined for a total duration of 17 hours and 47 minutes. In 1998, Williams became the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA, when he held the position of Director of the Space and Life Sciences Directorate at the Johnson Space Center. [ Education ] He attended high school in arber Beaconsfield, Quebec and earned a B.Sc in from McGill University, Montreal, in 1976, a master of science degree in physiology, MD, and master of surgery degrees from McGill University, Montreal, in 1983. He completed a residency in family practice in the faculty of medicine, University of Ottawa, in 1985 and obtained fellowship in emergency medicine from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, following completion of a residency in emergency medicine at the University of Toronto, in 1988. [ Medical career ] Williams received postgraduate training in advanced invertebrate physiology at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington. Subsequently, his interests switched to vertebrate neurophysiology when, for his master&apos;s thesis, he became involved in basic science research on the role of adrenal steroid hormones in modifying the activity of regions within the central nervous system involved in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. While working in the Neurophysiological Laboratories at the Allan Memorial Institute for Psychiatry, he assisted in clinical studies of slow wave potentials within the central nervous system. His clinical research in emergency medicine has included studies evaluating the initial training and skill retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills, patient survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the early identification of trauma patients at high risk, and the efficacy of tetanus immunization in the elderly. In 1988 he became an emergency physician with the department of emergency services at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre as well as a lecturer with the Department of Surgery at the University of Toronto. He served as a member of the Air Ambulance Utilization Committee with the Ontario Ministry of Health both as an academic emergency physician and later as a representative of community emergency physicians. In addition, he has trained ambulance attendants, paramedic s, nurse s, residents, and practicing physicians in cardiac and trauma resuscitation as a course director in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) with the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation and in Advanced Trauma Life Support with the American College of Surgeons. From 1989 to 1990, he served as an emergency physician with the Emergency Associates of Kitchener - Waterloo and as Medical Director of the Westmount Urgent Care Clinic. In 1990 he returned to Sunnybrook as Medical Director of the ACLS program and coordinator of postgraduate training in emergency medicine. Subsequently, he became the Acting Director of the Department of Emergency Services at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Assistant Professor of Surgery, University of Toronto, and Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of Toronto. He remains active in life science and space medicine research, both as a Principal Investigator and as a Co-Investigator. In April 2008, Williams was recruited by McMaster University as physician scientist where he is the director for the new McMaster Centre for Medical Robotics at St. Joseph&apos;s Healthcare Hamilton. [ http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id%3D5362 Canadian astronaut lands at McMaster McMaster University Daily News April 15, 2008 ] On May 18, 2011, Williams was announced as the new President and CEO of Southlake Regional Health Centre to lead the facility into becoming a full-fledged teaching and research centre. [ Astronaut career ] Williams was selected by the Canadian Space Agency in June 1992. He completed basic training and in May 1993 was appointed manager of the Missions and Space Medicine Group within the astronaut program. His collateral duty assignments have included supervising the implementation of operational space medicine activities within the astronaut program and the coordination of the Canadian Astronaut Program Space Unit Life Simulation (CAPSULS) Project. In February 1994 he participated in a 7-day space mission simulation. During this CAPSULS Project he was the Principal Investigator of a study to evaluate the initial training and retention of resuscitation skills by non-medical astronauts. He was also assigned as one of the crewmembers and acted as the crew medical officer. He announced his retirement as an astronaut on 29 February 2008, effective from 1 March 2008. [ NASA experience ] { Tim Broderick, Williams; front: } { Nicole Stott, } { Ron Garan. } In January 1995, Williams was selected to join the 1995 international class of NASA mission specialist astronaut candidates. He reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 and completed training and evaluation in May 1996. On completing basic training, he was assigned to work technical issues for the payloads/habitability branch of the astronaut office. From July 1998 to November 2002, Williams served as Director of the Space and Life Sciences directorate with responsibility for research in both physical and biomedical space sciences at the Johnson Space Center (JSC). With this appointment, he became the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA. Overall crew medical safety was one of his principal concerns, in addition to flight medical operations and JSC occupational and environmental health. His programs were directed toward protecting astronauts from the hazards of the space environment, including space radiation and microgravity, in addition to maintaining their medical, physical, and psychological well-being while aloft and on return to Earth. His other oversight responsibilities were in the fields of telemedicine, 3-D tissue culture/regeneration in microgravity, the curatorial management of extraterrestrial materials, and of qualifying humans for very long space journeys and ensuring their safe return to Earth. Williams served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001.

During the 16-day Spacelab flight, the seven-person crew aboard space shuttle &apos;&apos;Columbia&apos;&apos; served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged Williams over 381 hours in space.
