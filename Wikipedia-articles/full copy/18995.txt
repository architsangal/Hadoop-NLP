Scorsese was raised in a devoutly Catholic environment.

Enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, at least two films of the genre, Land of the Pharaohs and El Cid, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on Italian neorealism, and commented on how Bicycle Thieves alongside Paisà, Rome, Open City inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian genes. In his documentary, Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of Roberto Rossellini &apos;s Paisà which he first saw on television alongside his relatives, who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, made a significant impact on his life. He acknowledges owing a great debt to the French New Wave and has stated that &quot; the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not. &quot; [ http://www.newwavefilm.com/new-wave-cinema-guide/nouvelle-vague-where-to-start.shtml New Wave Film Guide: Nouvelle Vague &amp; International New Wave Cinema - Where to Start Newwavefilm.com 2012-01-05 ] He has also cited filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini as a major influence on his career.

(1963) and It&apos;s Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America&apos;s involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet &apos;67. [ Finding the boy again http://living.scotsman.com/features/Finding-the-boy-again.2317392.jp The Scotsman Alistair Harkness April 11, 2002 ] Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian-American film professor Haig P. Manoogian. In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white I Call First, which was later retitled Who&apos;s That Knocking at My Door with his fellow students actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese&apos;s semi-autobiographical &apos;J.R. Trilogy&apos;, which also would have included his later film, Mean Streets. [ 1970s ] From there he became friends with the influential &quot; movie brats &quot; of the 1970s: Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg. It was Brian De Palma who introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro. During this period he worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary Woodstock and met actor-director John Cassavetes, who would also go on to become a close friend and mentor. [ Bill Chambers http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/scorseseondvd70s.htm Scorsese on DVD Film Freak Central March 3, 2010 ] Scorsese is also credited as one of the cameramen who photographed the infamous late-1969 Altamont rock festival for the 1970 Rolling Stones film &quot; Gimme Shelter &quot;. [ Mean Streets ] [ Mean Streets ] In 1972 Scorsese made the Depression -era exploiter Boxcar Bertha for B-movie producer Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with next to no money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with Mean Streets. Following the film&apos;s release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else&apos;s projects. Championed by influential movie critic Pauline Kael, Mean Streets was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of Mean Streets was actually shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing, and a rock soundtrack. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, Samuel Fuller, and early Jean-Luc Godard. [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html Scorsese, Master Of The Rage Washington Post November 24, 1991 Hal Hinson ] (Indeed the film was completed with much encouragement from Cassavetes, who felt Boxcar Bertha was undeserving of the young director&apos;s prodigious talent.) In 1974, actress Ellen Burstyn chose Scorsese to direct her in Alice Doesn&apos;t Live Here Anymore, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director&apos;s early career, as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with Italianamerican, a documentary featuring his parents, Charles and Catherine Scorsese. [ Taxi Driver ] [ Taxi Driver ] Taxi Driver followed in 1976 – Scorsese&apos;s dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man&apos;s slow, deliberate descent into insanity. The film established Scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer Michael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the troubled and psychotic Travis Bickle. The film co-starred Jodie Foster in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, Matthew, called &quot; Sport. &quot; Taxi Driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin Arthur Bremer and Pickpocket, a film by the French director Robert Bresson. Writer/director Schrader often returns to Bresson&apos;s work in films such as American Gigolo, Light Sleeper, and Scorsese&apos;s later Bringing Out the Dead. [ Thurman John http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/37/taxi_driver/ Citizen Bickle, or the Allusive Taxi Driver: Uses of Intertextuality Sensesofcinema.com 1976-04-05 2012-01-05 ] Already controversial upon its release, Taxi Driver hit the headlines again five years later, when John Hinckley, Jr. made an assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster&apos;s Taxi Driver character (in the film, De Niro&apos;s character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).

Scorsese was subsequently offered the role of Charles Manson in the movie Helter Skelter and a part in Sam Fuller &apos;s war movie The Big Red One, but he turned both down. However he did accept the role of a gangster in exploitation movie Cannonball directed by Paul Bartel. In this period there were also several directorial projects that never got off the ground including Haunted Summer, about Mary Shelley and a film with Marlon Brando about the Indian massacre at Wounded Knee. [ New York, New York and The Last Waltz ] [ New York, New York (film) The Last Waltz ] The critical success of Taxi Driver encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical New York, New York. This tribute to Scorsese&apos;s home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. New York, New York was the director&apos;s third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Liza Minnelli (a tribute and allusion to her father, legendary musical director Vincente Minnelli ). The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by Frank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese&apos;s usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison to his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded by some to be among the director&apos;s finest achievements. Richard Brody in the New Yorker wrote: &quot; For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films. &quot; [ Brody Richard http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2008/01/28/080128gomo_GOAT_movies_brody &quot; Top of the heap &quot;, &apos; &amp; #39;The New Yorker&apos; &amp; #39; January 28, 2008 Newyorker.com 2011-08-01 2012-01-05 ] Jean-Luc Godard is another admirer of the film. [ John Patterson http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/26/godard.scorsese &quot; Worshippers at the church of Cinema &quot;, &apos; &amp; #39;Guardian&apos; &amp; #39; 26 September 2006 Guardian September 26, 2008 2012-01-05 London ] The disappointing reception that New York, New York received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded The Last Waltz, documenting the final concert by The Band. It was held at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Neil Diamond, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Paul Butterfield, Ronnie Wood and Van Morrison. However, Scorsese&apos;s commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary entitled American Boy also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in Taxi Driver. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director&apos;s already fragile health. Scorsese also helped provide footage for the documentary Elvis on Tour. [ 1980s ] [ Raging Bull ] { Raging Bull &apos;&apos; } [ Raging Bull ] By several accounts (Scorsese&apos;s included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese&apos;s life when he persuaded Scorsese to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film, Raging Bull. Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, calling it a Kamikaze method of film-making.

[ http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0%2C%2C112416%2C00.html Martin Scorsese: Raging Bull Guardian December 9, 1999 Derek Malcolm London ] [ http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-02-07-dvd-raging-bull_x.htm &apos;Raging Bull&apos; returns to the ring USA Today February 7, 2005 Mike Snider ] It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Robert De Niro, and Scorsese&apos;s first for Best Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went to Robert Redford for Ordinary People. Raging Bull, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese&apos;s style reached its zenith: Taxi Driver and New York, New York had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight). [ http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html Raging Bull Eufs.org.uk March 5, 2001 March 3, 2010 ] Thematically too, the concerns carried on from Mean Streets and Taxi Driver: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption. Although the screenplay for Raging Bull was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote Mean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader&apos;s original draft. It was re-written several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York ). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro. [ Ageing bulls return Observer http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0%2C%2C98151%2C00.html October 31, 1999 Mark Morris London ] The American Film Institute chose Raging Bull as the #1 American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. [ The King of Comedy ] [ The King of Comedy (1983 film) ] Scorsese&apos;s next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, The King of Comedy (1983). A satire on the world of media and celebrity, it was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed up until this point, often using a static camera and long takes. [ evil jimi http://www.ehrensteinland.com/htmls/library/koc.html The King of Comedy Ehrensteinland.com March 3, 2010 ] The expressionism of his recent work here gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese&apos;s trademarks, however, such as its focus on a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (murder and kidnapping, respectively). [ http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html The King of Comedy Film Review Timeout.com March 3, 2010 ] The King of Comedy failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his fifteen favourite films. [ http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm The Official Site Wim Wenders March 3, 2010 ] Also, Scorsese apparently believes that this is the best performance De Niro ever gave for him. [ January 2012 ] Next Scorsese made a brief cameo appearance in the movie Anna Pavlova (also known as A Woman for All Time), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, Michael Powell. This led to a more significant role in Bertrand Tavernier &apos;s jazz movie Round Midnight. In 1983 Scorsese began work on a long-cherished personal project, The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1951 (English translation 1960) novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis, who was introduced to the director by actress Barbara Hershey when they were both attending New York University in the late 1960s. The movie was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.) [ After Hours ] [ After Hours (film) ] After the collapse of this project Scorsese again saw his career at a critical point, as he described in the documentary Filming for Your Life: Making &apos;After Hours&apos; (2004). He saw that in the increasingly commercial world of 1980s Hollywood, the highly stylized and personal 1970s films he and others had built their careers on would not continue to enjoy the same status. Scorsese decided then on an almost totally new approach to his work. With After Hours (1985) he made an aesthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost &quot; underground &quot; film-making style – his way of staying viable. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ( Griffin Dunne ) and featured cameos by such disparate actors as Teri Garr and Cheech and Chong. A bit of a stylistic anomaly for Scorsese, After Hours fits in well with popular low-budget &quot; cult &quot; films of the 1980s, e.g. Jonathan Demme &apos;s Something Wild and Alex Cox &apos;s Repo Man. [ The Color of Money ] [ The Color of Money ] Along with the 1987 Michael Jackson music video &quot; Bad &quot;, in 1986 Scorsese made The Color of Money, a sequel to the much admired Robert Rossen film The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman. Although typically visually assured, The Color of Money was the director&apos;s first foray into mainstream commercial film-making. It won actor Paul Newman a belated Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a long time goal for him: The Last Temptation of Christ. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of Steven Spielberg &apos;s Amazing Stories. [ The Last Temptation of Christ ] [ The Last Temptation of Christ (film) ] After his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal film-making with the Paul Schrader -scripted The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988. Based on Nikos Kazantzakis &apos;s controversial 1960 book, it retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Even prior to its release the film caused a massive furore, worldwide protests against its blasphemy effectively turning a low budget independent movie into a media sensation. [ http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html Martin Scorsese&apos;s The Last Temptation of Christ Pbs.org March 3, 2010 ] Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan -induced hallucination while on the cross. Looking past the controversy, The Last Temptation of Christ gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese&apos;s canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality which had under-pinned his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for Rain Man ). Along with directors Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola, in 1989 Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film New York Stories, called &quot; Life Lessons &quot;. [ 1990s ] [ Goodfellas ] [ Goodfellas ] After a decade of mostly mixed results, Gangster epic Goodfellas (1990) was a return to form for Scorsese and his most confident and fully realized film since Raging Bull. De Niro and Joe Pesci in Goodfellas offered a virtuoso display of the director&apos;s bravura cinematic technique and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named Goodfellas &quot; the best mob movie ever &quot; and is ranked #1 on Roger&apos;s movie list for 1990, along with Gene Siskel and Peter Travers, the film is widely considered one of the director&apos;s greatest achievements.

[ http://www.timeout.com/film/dvd/50197.html Goodfellas (Wide Screen) Timeout.com March 3, 2010 ] Despite this, many view Goodfellas as a Scorsese archetype – the apogee of his cinematic technique. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination for Goodfellas but again lost to a first-time director, Kevin Costner ( Dances With Wolves ). Joe Pesci earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Goodfellas. Scorsese and the film won over a numerous of different awards, including five BAFTA Awards, a Silver Lion and more. After the film, Goodfellas was acknowledged as the second best in the gangster film genre (after The Godfather ). The American Film Institute put Goodfellas at #94 on the AFI&apos;s 100 Years...100 Movies list and on the 2007 updated version they moved Goodfellas up to #92 on the AFI&apos;s 100 Years...100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and they put Goodfellas at #2 on their list of the top 10 Gangster films. In 1990, he acted in a cameo role as Vincent van Gogh in the film Dreams by legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. [ Cape Fear ] [ Cape Fear (1991 film) ] 1991 brought Cape Fear, a remake of a cult 1962 movie of the same name, and the director&apos;s seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton &apos;s The Night of the Hunter (1955). Cape Fear received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence. However, the lurid subject matter did give Scorsese a chance to experiment with a dazzling array of visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning eighty million dollars domestically, it would stand as Scorsese&apos;s most commercially successful release until The Aviator (2004), and then The Departed (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. [ The Age of Innocence ] [ The Age of Innocence (film) ] The opulent and handsomely mounted The Age of Innocence (1993) was on the surface a huge departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of Edith Wharton&apos;s novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th Century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon original release, but was a box office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted in Scorsese on Scorsese by editor/interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a 19th Century failed romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job. Scorsese was interested in doing a &quot; romantic piece &quot;. His friend, Jay Cocks gave him the Wharton novel in 1980, suggesting that this should be the romantic piece Scorsese should film as Cocks felt it best represented his sensibility. In Scorsese on Scorsese he noted that: &quot; Although the film deals with New York aristocracy and a period of New York history that has been neglected, and although it deals with code and ritual, and with love that&apos;s not unrequited but unconsummated – which pretty much covers all the themes I usually deal with – when I read the book, I didn&apos;t say, &apos;Oh good, all those themes are here.&apos; &quot; Scorsese, who was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton&apos;s text, wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this aim, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films which made an emotional impact on him. In Scorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such as Luchino Visconti &apos;s Senso and his Il Gattopardo as well as Orson Welles &apos;s The Magnificent Ambersons and also Roberto Rossellini &apos;s La Prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV. Although The Age of Innocence was ultimately different than these films in terms of narrative, story and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. Recently, it has started to come back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including for Scorsese for Best Adapted Screenplay), winning the Costume Design Oscar. It also made a significant impact on directors such as Chinese auteur Tian Zhuangzhuang, [ http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename%3DTian%26amp%3Bsurname%3DZhuang-Zhuang Sight &amp; Sound &amp; #124; Top Ten Poll 2002 – How the directors and critics voted BFI September 29, 2008 March 3, 2010 ] and British filmmaker Terence Davies, [ http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename%3DTerence%26amp%3Bsurname%3DDavies Sight &amp; Sound &amp; #124; Top Ten Poll 2002 – How the directors and critics voted BFI September 29, 2008 March 3, 2010 ] both of whom ranked it among their ten favorite films. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award winning actor, Daniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again in Gangs of New York. [ Casino ] [ Casino (film) ] { 1995&apos;s expansive Casino, like The Age of Innocence before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Critically, however, Casino received mixed notices. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. } [ June 2011 ] { Indeed many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again being an unbridled psychopath. } { Sharon Stone was nominated for the } { Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. } During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables. It is quite often rumored that a real game of poker was being held at the time between extras and that a pot of $2000 was at stake. [ January 2012 ] [ A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies ] [ A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies ] Scorsese still found time for a four hour documentary in 1995 offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career, stating &quot; I wouldn&apos;t feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries. &quot; [ Kundun ] [ Kundun ] If The Age of Innocence alienated and confused some fans, then Kundun (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the People&apos;s Liberation Army &apos;s entering of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama&apos;s subsequent exile to India. Not least a departure in subject matter, Kundun also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colourful visual images. [ http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html Kundun Time Out March 3, 2010 ] The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Disney, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting Kundun&apos;s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director&apos;s reputation. In the long term however, it generally appears Kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. Kundun was the director&apos;s second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following The Last Temptation of Christ. [ Bringing Out the Dead ] [ Bringing Out the Dead ] Bringing Out the Dead (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier Taxi Driver. [ http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/319 Bringing Out The Dead Bfi.org.uk January 29, 2010 March 3, 2010 ] Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of Robert Bresson.

It stars Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore, and Patricia Arquette. [ 2000s ] [ Gangs of New York ] [ Gangs of New York ] { Gangs of New York &apos;&apos; screening at the } { Cannes Film Festival with } { Leonardo DiCaprio and } { Cameron Diaz. } In 1999 Scorsese also produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers entitled Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, also known as My Voyage to Italy. The documentary foreshadowed the director&apos;s next project, the epic Gangs of New York (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome&apos;s famous Cinecittà film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100  million, Gangs of New York was Scorsese&apos;s biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like The Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis ). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled with many rumors referring to the director&apos;s conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein.

The film still received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 75% of the reviews they tallied for the film were positive and summarizing the critics by saying &quot; Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis&apos;s electrifying performance. &quot; [ http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/ Gangs of New York Rotten Tomatoes 2012-01-05 ] Nonetheless, the themes central to the film were consistent with the director&apos;s established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and sub-cultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the Oscar season of late 2002.

In February 2003, Gangs of New York received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, however it did not win in any category. Scorsese also had uncredited involvement as executive producer with the 2002 film Deuces Wild, { IMDb: Deuces Wild credits } written by Paul Kimatian.

[ No Direction Home ] [ No Direction Home ] No Direction Home is a documentary film by Martin Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan&apos;s entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then- controversial transformation from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his &quot; retirement &quot; from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident.The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the PBS American Masters series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the BBC Two Arena series) on September 26–27, 2005.

During the ceremony, Scorsese helped launch N.I.A.F.&apos;s Jack Valenti Institute, which provides support to Italian film students in the U.S., in memory of former Foundation Board Member and past president of the Motion Picture Association of America (M.P.A.A.) Jack Valenti. Scorsese received his award from Mary Margaret Valenti, Jack&apos;s widow. Certain pieces of Scorsese&apos;s film related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access. In 2011 Scorsese received an honorary doctorate from the National Film School in Lodz. At the awards ceremony he said, &quot; I feel like I&apos;m a part of this school and that I attended it &quot;, paying tribute to the films of Wajda, Munk, Has, Polanski and Skolimowski.
