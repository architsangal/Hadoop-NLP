The founder of Uechi Ryū was Kanbun Uechi (上地完文)(1877–1948), an Okinawan who went to Fuzhou in Fukien Province, China to study martial arts when he was 20 years old. { Official Karate Site of the Okinawan Prefecture } Uechi-ryū means &quot; Style of Uechi &quot; or &quot; School of Uechi &quot;. [ Early history ] Kanbun Uechi studied Pangai-noon (half-hard, half-soft) under Shushiwa in the Fujian (a.k.a. Fukien) province of mainland China in the late 19th century and early 20th century. After studying 10 years under Shushiwa, Kanbun Uechi opened his own school in the province of Nanjing. Two years later, Kanbun Uechi returned to Okinawa, determined never to teach again because one of his Chinese students had killed a neighbour with an open-hand technique in a dispute over land irrigation. While he was working as a janitor he was persuaded by a co-worker, Ryuyu Tomoyose, to teach again after having been first convinced to show Tomoyose ways of defending himself against different attacks. When his confidence as a teacher was restored, Uechi, with the help of Ryuyu Tomoyose, moved to Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture, where, in 1925, he established the Institute of Pangainun-ryū (half-hard half-soft) Todi-jutsu, and opened a dojo to the public. Eventually, in 1940, his Okinawan students renamed the system as &quot; Uechi Ryū &quot;. Grandmaster Kanbun Uechi. Kanbun Uechi&apos;s son, Kanei Uechi, taught the style at the Futenma City Dojo, Okinawa, and was considered the first Okinawan to sanction teaching foreigners. One of Kanbun&apos;s students, Ryuko Tomoyose, taught a young American serviceman named George Mattson who authored several books on the subject and is largely responsible for popularizing the style in America. Uechi Ryū emphasizes toughness of body with quick blows and kicks. Some of the more distinctive weapons of Uechi practitioners are the one-knuckle punch (shoken), spearhand (nukite), and the toe kick (sokusen geri). On account of this emphasis on simplicity, stability, and a combination of linear and circular movements, proponents claim the style is more practical for self-defense than most other martial arts. In contrast to the more linear styles of karate based on Okinawan Shuri-te or Tomari-te, Uechi Ryū&apos;s connection with Chinese Nanpa Shorin-ken means the former shares a similar foundation with Naha-Te (and thus with Goju-ryu ) despite their separate development. { JKF Goju-Kai site } Thus, Uechi Ryū is also heavily influenced by the circular motions which belong to the kung fu from Fujian province. Uechi Ryū is principally based on the movements of 3 animals: the Tiger, the Dragon, and the Crane. [ Kata ] There are eight empty-hand katas in Uechi Ryū; the longest has 36 steps. Only Sanchin, Seisan, and Sanseirui come from Pangai-noon; the others were added to the style by Kanei Uechi. Kanei Uechi designed all of the additional kata. Many of the names of the newer kata were formed from the names of prominent figures in the art, e.g. Kanshiwa from Kanbun and Sushiwa. The current list of empty-hand kata is: Sanchin Kanshiwa Kanshu Seichin Seisan Seirui Kanchin Sanseirui (also known as Sandairui) The Sanchin kata is deceptively simple in appearance. It teaches the foundation of the style, including stances and breathing. Kanbun Uechi is quoted as saying &quot; All is in Sanchin. &quot; Though it is not difficult to learn the movements of Sanchin, to master the form is thought to take a lifetime. Additionally, some organizations teach that each kata has a &apos;meaning&apos; or moral; the more accurate meaning, however, is that each kata teaches a specific concept: [ Sanchin 三戦 ] [ 戦う &quot; to fight/to struggle &quot; ] [ Kanshiwa 完子和 ] [ Kanshu 完周 ] [ Daini Seisan 第二十三 ] [ Seichin 十戦 ] [ Seisan 十三 ] [ Seiryu 十六 ] [ Kanchin 完戦 ] [ Sanseiryu 三十六 ] : Literally translated as &quot; three fights/conflicts &quot;. From the kanji for &quot; three &quot; and. Usually interpreted as three Modes/Conflicts: Mind, Body and Spirit). An alternate interpretation is &quot; Three Challenges &quot; being those of softness, timing, and power. : A combination of the first kanji in Kanbun&apos;s name, and the last two kanji (if written in Chinese order) of Shu Shiwa&apos;s[Japanese pronunciation] name.) This kata teaches the new student the concept of harnessing natural strength through the use of primarily tiger-style techniques.Also known as Kanshabu. : A combination of the first kanji in Kanbun&apos;s name, and the kanji for Shu Shiwa&apos;s family name (Shu) [see previous note on pronunciation]. This kata is also known as.) This kata teaches the concept of precision in timing through using crane techniques. : Literally translated it means &quot; 10 fights/conflicts &quot; )or a combination between two other katas- Seisan and Sanchin. An alternate meaning interprets the name phonetically and then it translates as &quot; Spirit Challenge &quot;, implying that it teaches the concept of soft whip-like motion. This form uses whip-like dragon-style techniques. : Literally translated, it means &quot; 13 &quot;. Usually interpreted as &quot; Thirteen modes of attack and defense &quot; or &quot; 13 positions to attack/defend from &quot;.) An alternate meaning is simply &quot; 13th Room Kata &quot;, being the form synthesised in the 13th room of Shaolin, using individual techniques taught in the previous training rooms. This kata combines the &quot; Three Challenges &quot; concept, and the student can go back and recognize and further develop those elements in the previous forms. : Along the lines of the others, literally translated this means simply &quot; 16 &quot;. An alternate translation uses phonetics rather than literal kanji meaning, and can denote &quot; 10 Dragons Form &quot;, as there are 10 dragon techniques in the kata. This kata teaches the concept of stability since the four consecutive Dragon techniques in rotation call for a strong sense of balance. : A combination of Kanbun&apos;s first kanji and &quot; fight &quot;. The first kanji of Kanbun, Kanei, and Kanmei are the same. Since this was created by Kanei UechiI from fighting techniques he favored from his father&apos;s training, the name is considered to mean &quot; Kanei&apos;s Challenge &quot;, or &quot; Kanei&apos;s Fight &quot;. This form teaches the practitioner the concept of making defensive movements at one stroke (called &quot; ikkyoodo &quot; —all at one stroke). : Literally translated,tiger coming down from mountain also it means simply &quot; 36 &quot;. Usually interpreted as &quot; thirty-six modes of attack and defense &quot; or &quot; 36 positions to attack/defend from. &quot; ). It can also mean &quot; 36th Room Kata &quot; as it is made from techniques taught individually in the previous 35 rooms (or previous 12 rooms in three rotations). Shu Shiwa was also known as &quot; The 36th Room Priest &quot; according to the 1977 Uechi-Ryu Kyohon (Techniques Book). This final kata combines all the previous concepts to pre-empt the attack. [ Ranks ] These are the ten beginner or Kyū ranks, which in traditional practice count down from 10 to 1:10. Jukyu (White Belt) 9. Kukyu (Yellow Belt) (or white belt with one yellow stripe) 8. Hachikyu (Blue Belt)(or yellow belt) 7. Shichikyu (Yellow belt with one purple stripe) 6. Rokkyu (Purple Belt) 5. Gokyu (Green Belt) (or purple belt with one brown stripe) 4. Yonkyu (Red Belt w/ 1 Brown Stripe) (or red belt) 3. Sankyu (Brown Belt) (or Red belt with one brown stripe) 2. Nikyu (Brown Belt w/ 1 Black Stripe) (or brown belt) 1. Ikkyu (Brown Belt w/ 2 Black Stripes) (or brown belt with one black stripe) These are the ten black belt or Dan ranks: Shodan (Regular Black belt/1st degree) Nidan (2nd degree) Sandan (3rd degree) Yondan (4th degree) Godan (5th degree) Rokudan (Master&apos;s title: Renshi) (6th degree) Nanadan (Master&apos;s title: Kyoshi) (7th degree) Hachidan (Master&apos;s title: Kyoshi) (8th degree) Kyūdan (Master&apos;s title: Hanshi) (9th degree) Jūdan (Master&apos;s title: Hanshi (The same as 9th degree) (10 degree) Belt colors used may vary from school to school. [ Weapons ] There are no weapons in the Uechi Ryū system, although several masters in Okinawa counterbalanced their training with Kobudo weapon systems and made them part of their curriculum. Okinawan weapons include, in part: bō (6&apos; staff), nunchaku, sai, kama, eku bo (Oar), and tonfa. Also Kanbun was fond of the bo and is incorporated in some styles as extra classes. [ Additional training elements ] Kanei Uechi, besides adding kata, also introduced a sequence of exercises to the Uechi Ryū training regimen. The junbi undo are warm-up and stretching exercises based on Asian school training exercises. The &quot; hojo undō &quot; are standardized exercises that incorporate elements of all of the katas of the system. The junbi undo exercises are: Ashi saki o ageru undo (heel pivot) Kakato o ageru undo (heel lift) Ashikubi o mawasu undo (foot and ankle twist) Hiza o mawasu undo (knee circular bend) Ashi o mae yoko ni nobasu undo (leg lift and turn) Ashi o mae uchi naname no ageru undo (straight leg lift) Tai o mae ni taosu undo (waist scoop) Koshi no nenten (trunk stretch) Ude o mae yoko shita nobasu undo (double arm strike) Kubi o mawasu undo (neck exercise) The hojo undo exercises are: Sokuto geri (Side kick) Shomen geri (Front kick) Mawashi tsuki (Hook Punch) Hajiki uke hiraken tsuki (Tiger paw blocks and strike) Seiken tsuki (Closed Fist Block and Punch) Wauke shuto uraken shoken tsuki/Shuto Uchi-Ura Uchi-Shoken Tsuki (Chop, Backfist, One-knuckle punch) Hiji tsuki (Elbow strikes) Tenshin zensoku geri (Turn-Block-Front Kick-Forward Leg) Tenshin kosuko geri (Turn-Block-Front Kick-Back Leg) Tenshin shoken tsuki (Turn-Block-One Knuckle Punch) Shomen hajiki (fingertip strikes) Koi no shippo uchi, tate uchi (wrist blocks in four directions) Koi no shippo yoko uchi (Fish-tail wrist blocks) Shin Kokyu (Deep breathing) These are sometimes described as the phonics of Karate. [ March 2011 ] Kanei Uechi developed a set of pre-arranged sparring exercises for the colored (non-black) belt ranks. These exercises are referred to as kumite. They involve two partners exchanging a formal sequence of blocks and strikes. There are five of these exercises, and each one involves three to six exchanges of single blocks and strikes. The kumite exercises involve blocks and strikes that are, for the most part, also found in Uechi Ryū kata. Thus, like kata bunkai, these exercises help students become familiar with the application of Uechi Ryū techniques. Typically, the highest kyu ranks are expected to be able to move through these exercises with great strength and fluidity. Dan level students practice additional pre-arranged sparring exercises. Applications of kata are also practiced in a pre-arranged format. These patterns are called kata bunkai. Kanshiwa bunkai and Seisan bunkai date to Kanei Uechi. Other bunkai for other katas, such as Kanshu and Seichin, are also often practiced but may vary in format more from dojo to dojo. Special forms of strength training and body conditioning are generally practiced in Uechi Ryū drilling. A formal Uechi Ryū forearm conditioning exercise, called kote kitae, involves the ritualized pounding of one&apos;s fists and forearms against the forearms of a partner. Kanbun Uechi learned this conditioning exercise in China. A similar Uechi Ryū exercise involves exchanging leg kicks with a partner (ashi kotae). Working with a makiwara is also a part of Uechi Ryū training. Uechi Ryū karateka also incorporate other traditional Okinawan physical conditioning exercises as part of their training, such as plunging hands into baskets full of rocks, or performing Sanchin kata leg movements while gripping nigiri-game (heavy stone jars). [ Uechi Ryū today ] Like many arts, Uechi Ryū experienced organizational splits after its founder&apos;s death.Some of the senior practitioners of the original art split from the main organization and created other organizations or styles, including Shohei-ryu and recreated versions of Pangai-noon. The rift came about through some teachers wanting to teach a varied form of Uechi (from slightly different kata to newer conditioning drills), and some wanting to teach the &quot; classical &quot; form as designed by Kanbun. The differences between the four remaining major groups are unnoticeable to the casual observer, and some in Okinawa believe that a large part of the split was due to personality conflicts.
