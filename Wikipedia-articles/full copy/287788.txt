Though her grandfather and her uncle were baron s, she and her father were members of the untitled nobility. Princess Mathilde is currently the only crown princess consort of a reigning european house bearing noble ancestry along with Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein (because Camilla Parker Bowles only belongs to the gentry ). She is a cousin of the current President of the Republic of Poland Bronislaw Komorowski. Mathilde&apos;s father was Count (formerly Jonkheer ) Patrick d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz ( Uccle, 28 April 1936 – Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, 25 September 2008), son of Baron Charles d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz ( Ghent, 8 March 1885- Proven, 7 December 1968), who was of Walloon noble ancestry; her mother was Countess Anna Maria Komorowska (born 24 September 1946 in Białogard, Poland ), daughter of Count Leon Michael Komorowski ( Siedliska, 14 August 1907-1992) and Polish Princess Zofia María Sapieha of Krasiczyn, Clan Lis ( Bobrek [ June 2011 ], 10 October 1919- Herstal, 14 August 1997). Upon her marriage to Prince Philippe of Belgium, the Duke of Brabant in 1999, King Albert II of the Belgians elevated the family d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz from the baronial to the comital rank, hereditary in the male lineage. Upon the accession of her husband, Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant to the throne of Belgium she would be the first Belgian queen consort of native Belgian nationality. { Her predecessors were, in order of succession, } { French, } { Austrian, } { German, } { Swedish, } { Spanish, and } { Italian. } { Lilian, Princess of Réthy was never officially designated as queen consort. } Mathilde is the oldest of five children. She has three younger sisters and one younger brother: Jonkvrouw Marie-Alix d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz (born 16 September 1974 - April, 1997). Margravine Elisabeth von Pallavicini, née Countess d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz (born 17 January 1977) who is married to Margrave Alfonso von Pallavicini with whom she has 2 children; Margravine Olympia and Margrave Adalberto.

Count Charles-Henri d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz (born 13 May 1985). On 29 March 2008, Henri d&apos;Udekem d&apos;Acoz, Princess Mathilde&apos;s uncle, told a Belgian newspaper that his brother, Patrick had been admitted to the Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht, and was dying. The Count was in an irreversible coma and in critical condition. Henri stated that his brother had been ill since January, and his illness had gradually put him into the coma. Henri noted that Mathilde had visited her father in the hospital, as had other members of the Royal Family. { RTL Info – &apos;Le père de la princesse Mathilde est mourant&apos; } { Vader prinses Mathilde ligt op sterven } On 25 September 2008, it was announced that the Count had died, aged 72, in Ottignies. [ Education ] Princess Mathilde attended secondary school at the Institut de la Vierge Fidèle in Brussels. She then studied speech therapy at the Institut Libre Marie Haps in Brussels from 1991 to 1994 and earned a diploma with &quot; grande distinction &quot; (equivalent to magna cum laude ). Mathilde then worked as a speech therapist in her own practice in Brussels from 1995 to 1999. She also studied psychology at the Université catholique de Louvain and earned a diploma in psychology with &quot; distinction &quot; in 2002. She speaks French, Dutch, English and Italian. Her mother, who spent most of her life outside of Poland, did not teach her Polish, thinking that it would not be necessary. Therefore, Mathilde knows only a few words in Polish. { Wprost Weekly, The Polish-Belgian Queen (Krolowa polsko-belgijska) 21 December-28, 2008 } [ Marriage and children ] The announcement of Mathilde&apos;s engagement to the Belgian heir-apparent, Prince Philippe, who had never been seriously linked with any woman, came as a surprise to the country. Mathilde married Prince Philippe on 4 December 1999 in Brussels, civilly at the Brussels Town Hall and religiously at the Cathedral of Saint Michel and Saint Gudula. Mathilde&apos;s bridal gown was designed by Edouard Vermeulen. She was made Princess of Belgium on 8 November 1999 (published on 13 November 1999 and effective from 4 December 1999).

Mathilde is also godmother to two princesses: Princess Alexia of the Netherlands and Princess Isabella of Denmark. 200px [ Royal role ] As Princess of Belgium, Mathilde carries out a number of official roles, including representing Belgium on state visits, receiving state visits from abroad, and as patron of many charities.
