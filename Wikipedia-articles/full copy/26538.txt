[ Curia (Roman Catholic Church) ] [ the building that housed the Roman Senate Curia Julia ] The Roman Curia is the administrative apparatus of the Holy See and the central governing body of the entire Catholic Church, together with the Pope. { The Holy See is often referred to as &quot; the Vatican &quot;, a word of many meanings, since it can refer to the geographical area, known by that name even before } { Christianity, to the residence of the Pope, to the Holy See, and to the State of } { Vatican City, which was created in 1929 } It coordinates and provides the necessary central organization for the correct functioning of the Church and the achievement of its goals. [ &quot; In exercising supreme, full, and immediate power in the universal Church, the Roman pontiff makes use of the departments of the Roman Curia which, therefore, perform their duties in his name and with his authority for the good of the churches and in the service of the sacred pastors &quot; Decree concerning the Pastoral Office of Bishops in the Church, &apos;&apos;Christus Dominus&apos;&apos;, 9 Decree concerning the Pastoral Office of Bishops in the Church, Christus Dominus ] Curia in medieval and later Latin usage means &quot; court &quot; in the sense of &quot; royal court &quot; rather than &quot; court of law &quot;. The Roman Curia, then, sometimes anglicized as the Court of Rome, as in the 1534 Act of Parliament that forbade appeals to it from England, { English Reformation Sources } is the Papal Court, and assists the Pope in carrying out his functions. The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to cabinets in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but only the Second Section of the Secretariat of State, known also as the Section for Relations with States, the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and the Congregation for Catholic Education, can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government. It is normal for every Latin Catholic diocese to have its own curia for its administration. For the Diocese of Rome, these functions are not handled by the Roman Curia, but by the Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome, as provided by the Apostolic Constitution Ecclesia in Urbe. The Vicar General of Rome, traditionally a Cardinal, and his deputy the Vicegerent, who holds the personal title of Archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. Until recently, there still existed hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the Papal States were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by Pope Pius X, was incorporated into the Code of Canon Law (promulgated 1917). Further steps toward reorganization were begun by Pope Paul VI in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the second Code of Canon Law (1983). { Roman Curia. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 18, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online } The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the Holy See. The following organs or charges, according to the official website of the Holy See, compose the Curia: { The Roman Curia } [ The Secretariat of State ] { John F.

The Secretariat of State was created in the 15th century { The Secretariat of State } and is now the dicastery most involved in coordination of the Holy See&apos;s activities. [ The Congregations ] The Roman Congregations { Congregations } are a type of dicastery (department with a jurisdiction) of the Roman Curia, the central administrative organism of the Catholic Church. Each Congregation is led by a prefect, who is a Cardinal. Until recently, a non-cardinal appointed to head a congregation was styled as pro-prefect until he was made cardinal in a consistory. This practice has recently been abandoned. [ The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ] The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith { Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith } (CDF) (Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei), previously known as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, and sometimes simply called the Holy Office, is the oldest of the nine congregations of the Roman Curia.

[ The Congregation for the Oriental Churches ] { Congregation for the Oriental Churches } The Congregation for the Oriental Churches { Congregation for the Oriental Churches } (Congregatio pro Ecclesiis Orientalibus) is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for contact with the Eastern Catholic Churches for the sake of assisting their development, protecting their rights and also maintaining whole and entire in the one Catholic Church, alongside the liturgical, disciplinary and spiritual patrimony of the Latin Rite, the heritage of the various Oriental Christian traditions. It has exclusive authority over the following regions: Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula, Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, southern Albania and Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, and Ukraine. The Congregation for the Oriental Churches has its origins in the &quot; Congregatio de Propaganda Fide pro negotiis ritus orientalis &quot; founded by Pope Pius IX on January 6, 1862. Included in the Congregation&apos;s membership are all Eastern Catholic patriarch s and major archbishop s, as well as the President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. { Pope John Paul II (1998), Apostolic constitution &apos;&apos;Pastor Bonus&apos;&apos; } It was formally set up by Pope Benedict XV on 1 May 1917.

After preparing a case, including the approval of miracle s, the case is presented to the pope, who decides whether or not to proceed with beatification or canonization. The predecessor of the congregation was the Sacred Congregation for Rites, founded by Pope Sixtus V on 22 January 1588 in the Bull Immensa Aeterni Dei. The congregation dealt both with regulating divine worship, and the causes of saints. On 8 May 1969, Pope Paul VI issued the Apostolic Constitution Sacra Rituum Congregatio, dividing it into two congregations, the &apos;&apos;Congregation for the Divine Worship&apos;&apos; and one for the causes of saints. The latter was given three offices, those of the judiciary, the Promoter General of the Faith and the historical-juridical. With the changes in the canonization process introduced by Pope John Paul II in 1983, a College of Relators was added to prepare the cases of those declared as Servants of God. Since 9 July 2009, the Prefect is Cardinal Angelo Amato, while the current secretary (appointed 29 December 2010) is Archbishop Marcello Bartolucci [ The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples ] { Bernini, the southwest facade seen here by } { Borromini : etching by } { Giuseppe Vasi, 1761 Collegio di Propaganda Fide } The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples { Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples } (Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelizatione) is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for missionary work and related activities.

[ The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life ] The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life { Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic } (Congregatio pro Institutis Vitae Consecratae et Societatibus Vitae Apostolicae) is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for everything which concerns institutes of consecrated life ( religious institute s and secular institute s ) and societies of apostolic life, both of men and of women, regarding their government, discipline, studies, goods, rights, and privileges.

[ The Apostolic Penitentiary ] The Apostolic Penitentiary, { Apostolic Penitentiary } more formally the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Penitentiary, is one of the three tribunals of the Roman Curia. The Apostolic Penitentiary is chiefly a tribunal of mercy, responsible for issues relating to the forgiveness of sin s in the Roman Catholic Church.

[ The Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura ] The Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura { Apostolic Signatura } is the highest judicial authority in the Catholic Church besides the Pope himself, who is the supreme ecclesiastical judge. In addition, it is an administrative office for matters pertaining to the judicial activity of the whole Church. Appeals in standard judicial processes, if appealed to the Apostolic See, normally are not handled by the Signatura. Those go to the Roman Rota, which is the ordinary appellate tribunal of the Apostolic See. The Supreme Tribunal handles some of the more specialized kinds of cases, including the following: Petitions for a declaration of nullity against a Rotal decision; Conflicts of jurisdiction between two or more tribunals or dicasteries, Recourse against administrative acts of ordinaries and dicasteries (including some penal cases decided without using a court), Although a Rotal decision can be appealed, if not res judicata, to a different panel (turnus) of the Rota, there is no right of appeal from a decision of the Signatura, { Code of Canon Law, canon 1629 §1 } although a complaint of nullity on formal grounds is possible. { Code of Canon Law, canons 1619-1627 } As an administrative office, it exercises jurisdiction (vigilance) over all the tribunals of the Catholic Church. It can also extend the jurisdiction of tribunals, grant dispensations for procedural laws, establish interdiocesan tribunals, and correct advocates. [ The Tribunal of the Rota Romana ] The Tribunal of the Roman Rota is the highest appellate tribunal. { Pastor Bonus, 126 } While usually trying cases in appeal in third instance (as is normally the case in the Eastern Catholic Churches ), { Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium [CCEO] canon 1065 } or even in second instance if appeal is made to it directly from the sentence of a tribunal of first instance, it is also a court of first instance for cases specified in the law and for others committed to the Rota by the Roman Pontiff. { Codex Iuris Canonici [CIC] canons 1443, 1444. } It fosters the unity of jurisprudence and, through its own sentences, is a help to lower tribunals. The greater Part of its decisions concern the nullity of marriage. In such cases its competence includes marriages between two Catholics, between a Catholic and non-Catholic, and between two non-Catholic parties whether one or both of the baptized parties belongs to the Latin or an Eastern Rite. { EWTN Presentation of the Tribunals of the Roman Curia } The court is named Rota (Latin for: wheel) because the judges, called auditors, originally met in a round room to hear cases. { Edward Peters, Canon Law —Canonistics —Rota Background, http://www.canonlaw.info/personal_rotademo.htm (updated 21 October 2006). } [ The Pontifical Councils ] [ large ] [ The Pontifical Council for the Laity ] The Pontifical Council for the Laity { Pontifical Council for the Laity } has the responsibility of assisting the Pope in his dealings with the laity in lay ecclesial movements or individually, and their contributions to the Church.
