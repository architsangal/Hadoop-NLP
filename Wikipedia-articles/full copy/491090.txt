Raphe+Nuclei A08.186.211.132.659.632 n_11 12582773 ] The raphe nuclei ( &quot; raffe &quot;, Greek: ραφή = seam) are a moderate-size cluster of nuclei found in the brain stem. Their main function is to release serotonin to the rest of the brain. [ George J. Siegel Bernard W. Agranoff, Stephen K. Fisher, R. Wayne Albers, Michael D.

In order from caudal to rostral, the raphe nuclei are known as the nucleus raphe obscurus, the raphe magnus, the raphe pontis, the raphe pallidus, the nucleus centralis superior, nucleus raphe dorsalis, nuclei linearis intermedius and linearis rostralis.

The midsagittal section of the brain stem indicating the position of the raphe nuclei 18 April 2006 ] Some scientists chose to group the linearis nuclei into one nucleus, shrinking the number of raphe to seven, e.g., NeuroNames makes the following ordering: [ ancil 190 ] Nucleus raphe obscurus (nucleus raphe obscurus) Nucleus raphe magnus (raphe magnus) Nucleus pallidus (raphe pallidus) Pontine raphe nucleus (raphe pontis) Inferior central nucleus Superior central nucleus (nucleus centralis superior) Dorsal raphe nucleus (nucleus raphe dorsalis) [ Projections ] These nuclei interact with almost every pertinent portion of the brain, but only a few of them have specifically independent interaction. These select nuclei are discussed as follows. Overall, the caudal raphe nuclei, including the raphe magnus, pallidus and raphe obscurus, all project towards the spinal cord and brain stem. The more-rostral nuclei, including the raphe pontis, centralis (also called median), dorsal, tend to project towards the brain areas of higher function [ BilZ0r Erowid 2005 http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/pharmacology/images/pharmacology_article2-4-med.png Figure 4. Diagram of the human brain showing the divergent serotonergic projections of the raphe nuclei to both cortical and subcortical locations throughout the brain. PNG The Neuropharmacology of Hallucinogens: a technical overview Erowid Pharmacology Vaults 18 April 2006 ] Dopamine and serotonin pathways in the brain [ Function ] The raphe nuclei have a vast impact upon the central nervous system.Many of the neurons in the nuclei (but not the majority) are serotonergic; i.e., contain serotonin, a type of monoamine neurotransmitter. It is important to note that pharmacology traditionally affects global serotonin levels, while the actions of the raphe nuclei are dependent on the complex interplay between nuclei. [ March 2009 ] Projections from the raphe nuclei also terminate in the dorsal horn of spinal gray matter where they regulate the release of enkephalins, which inhibit pain sensation. The raphe nuclei provides feedback to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), thus contributing in circadian rhythms in animals. The SCN transmits to the raphe nuclei via the dorsomedial hypothalamus nucleus altering serotonin levels for sleep/wake states. The raphe nuclei will then transmit feedback to the SCN about the animal&apos;s vigilance and levels of alertness. This reciprocal feedback between the two structures provides an adaptable yet stable basis of circadian rhythms. [ J.M.
