Noggin the Nog is a popular British children&apos;s character appearing in his own TV series (of the same name) and series of illustrated books, the brainchild of Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. The TV series is considered a &quot; cult classic &quot; from the golden age of British children&apos;s television. Noggin himself is a simple, kind and unassuming King of the Northmen in a roughly Viking-age setting, with various fantastic elements such as dragons, flying machines and talking birds. Some of the original artwork for the series is on display at the Rupert Bear Museum. [ Plot and characters ] The stories were based around the central character of Noggin, the simple good-natured son of Knut, King of the Nogs, and his queen Grunhilda. When King Knut dies, Noggin must find a queen to rule beside him or else forfeit the crown to his uncle, Nogbad the Bad. After many adventures, Noggin meets and marries Nooka of the Nooks, (an Eskimo princess), and becomes the new king. Noggin and Nooka have a son, Knut, who comes to the fore in later storylines. Other regular characters include: Thor Nogson  – Noggin&apos;s friend and Captain of the Royal Guard. Nogson portrays himself as &quot; fierce &quot;, but is actually anything but. Olaf the Lofty  – An eccentric but well-meaning inventor. Olaf&apos;s inventions rarely work out exactly as he intends them to. Graculus  – A big green bird who arrives as Nooka&apos;s messenger in the first episode. Later by chance they return to the place of his birth and meet his family, who unlike him are incapable of human speech. Grollith  – A friendly ice dragon who Noggin befriends, and who helps Noggin and his friends in a later episode. Although the individual stories vary, any trouble encountered by the heroes is usually caused by Nogbad the Bad, who never gives up trying to claim Noggin&apos;s throne for himself. [ Television series ] The original television series was first broadcast on 11 September 1959 shown by the BBC in the United Kingdom from 1959 to 1965. twenty-one programmes were made in black and white, and six in colour at a running time of ten minutes, by a company called Smallfilms. When the programme made a comeback in 1979, it ran for just six episodes and was made in colour, one new two-part story and a colour remake of the second saga, originally a six-parter, &quot; Noggin and the Ice Dragon &quot;. This colour series of Noggin the Nog ran until mid-1980. The level of stop-motion animation was basic, but did not detract from the popularity of the series. The on-screen title is &quot; The Saga of Noggin the Nog &quot;, since the stories were based on the principle of a Norse saga, and episodes began with the words, &quot; Listen to me and I will tell you the story of Noggin the Nog, as it was told in the days of old &quot;, or &quot; In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale  ... and those tales they tell are the stories of a kind and wise king and his people; they are the Sagas of Noggin the Nog. Welcome to Northlands, a tribute to Noggin, King of the Nogs and the People of the Northlands. &quot; These opening lines, combined with Vernon Elliott &apos;s haunting bassoon score, conveyed a slightly &quot; creepy &quot; atmosphere, which children found a little frightening and consequently even more exciting. Visually, it was primarily inspired by the Lewis chessmen (of Norse origin), in fact one story is about Noggin playing chess with Nogbad the Bad. A new series was rumoured in the late 1990s but nothing came of it. The complete series was released on DVD in 2005, in a package which also included DVD versions of the short story books.

[ Recognition with a Noggin stamp ] 1994 stamp: Noggin and Ice Dragon (SG1804) Noggin has received an accolade achieved by very few Norse characters  – he appeared with the Ice Dragon reading him a note from Nogbad, on a British commemorative postage stamp (SG1804) in January 1994. The art work for the stamp was drawn by Peter Firmin, who also produced a series of illustrations for the advertising campaign to publicize the new stamps. The stamp was one of a set of ten on the theme of &quot; messages &quot;, featuring characters from British children&apos;s literature. All the characters were pictured holding a letter, note or message. Noggin&apos;s note reads: &quot; I, Nogbad the Bad do hereby promise to be Good. &quot; [ References ] [ Postgate&apos;s genius lives on at museum http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/main.cfm?objectid%3D4324 Canterbury City Counci l 20 October 2010 16 December 2008 ] [ The BBC Story  – September anniversaries http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/great_moments/archive/september.shtml BBC 31 July 2010 ] [ BFI Screenonline http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/562377/index.html The Saga of Noggin the Nog 31 July 2010 ] [ http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/in-a-spirit-of-animation-1166585.html The Independent In a spirit of animation Rex Fontaine 21 June 1998 20 May 2010 ] [ Stamps and First Day Cover Smallfilms http://www.smallfilms.co.uk/noggin/stamps.htm 23 September 2009 ] [ Noggin the Nog Memorabilia  – stamps Northlands (Neil Jones) 1997–2003 http://www.nogginthenog.co.uk/memorabilia/stamps.htm 23 September 2009 ] [ External links ] [ 562377 Noggin the Nog ] Noggin the Nog Fan Site Noggin the Nog at smallfilms.co.uk The Dragons&apos; Friendly Society Category:Television series by Smallfilms Category:BBC children&apos;s television programmes Category:1959 in British television Category:1959 television series debuts Category:1965 television series endings
