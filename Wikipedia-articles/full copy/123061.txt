[ Transportation ] Waynesville Regional Airport at Forney Field serves the community with air service; even though it&apos;s on Fort Leonard Wood, it is jointly run by the cities of Waynesville and St. Robert and is available for civilian use by private pilots and scheduled commercial passenger service. The major east-west route is 20px Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was 20px U.S. Route 66, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through Devil&apos;s Elbow, St. Robert, Waynesville, Buckhorn, and Hazelgreen. Names for U.S. Route 66 vary - at different places, it&apos;s called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road. Major north-south routes near Crocker include: 20px Route 133 runs north from Interstate 44 exit 145 about two miles east of Hazelgreen to Richland, Swedeborg, Crocker, and about two miles west of Dixon, then north out of the county. 20px Route 17 crosses Interstate 44 at exit 153 at Buckhorn, runs east through Waynesville, turns north to Crocker, and then runs north out of the county to Iberia. South of Interstate 44, Highway 17 hugs the western edge of Fort Leonard Wood, passes near Laquey, and circles south of the post until it runs out of the county and eventually joins Highway 32 in Roby. 20px Highway T runs north from Highway 17 at Waynesville to Swedeborg, where it meets and ends at Highway 133 about halfway between Richland and Crocker. [ School Districts ] Fort Leonard Wood is in Pulaski County and a high percentage of military personnel live off post in surrounding communities, especially St. Robert and Waynesville but also the farther-out cities of Richland, Crocker, and Dixon, and the unincorporated communities of Laquey, Swedeborg and Devil&apos;s Elbow, all of which have a lower housing cost than nearer housing in St. Robert and Waynesville. Military personnel assigned to training areas on the south end of the post sometimes choose to live in the unincorporated areas of Big Piney and Palace in Pulaski County, or the northern Texas County communities of Plato and Roby. Seven main school districts are fully or partly within the borders of Pulaski County, not counting two small districts which are mostly within other counties and only have only a few dozen residents within Pulaski County. All seven school districts have a high percentage of Fort Leonard Wood military dependents, and over two-thirds of Waynesville students fall into that category. The city of Crocker, along with the surrounding rural areas, is served by the Crocker R-II School District. Other school districts serving Pulaski County are the Laquey R-V School District, Richland R-IV School District, Swedeborg R-III School District, and Dixon R-I School District. While located in northern Texas County, the Plato R-V School District serves Pulaski County residents living south of the post. [ Politics ] The Crocker area has four elected governing bodies, each of which is independent of each other: the city of Crocker, the Crocker R-II School District, the Crocker Rural Fire Protection District, and Pulaski County Water Supply District No. 2. State law requires cities to hold elections each year regardless of how many people file for office; other boards such as school boards, fire boards and water boards only hold elections if the number of candidates running is not the same as the number to be elected, so water and fire boards often do not hold elections and school boards sometimes do not hold elections. Crocker has a five-member city council with two wards; all members serve for two-year terms. The mayor is elected in odd-numbered years and the two aldermen from each ward are elected in alternate years. In the April 2011 city election, incumbent Mayor Linda Wilson chose not to run for re-election and was replaced by former Mayor James Morgan, who Wilson defeated two years earlier. Morgan won with 91 votes or 43.6 percent, compared to 71 votes or 34.1 percent for former Alderman Jim Patton and 46 votes or 22 percent for a third candidate, Anita Zimmerman. Ward I Alderman Lorie Layman ran unopposed for re-election and received 81 votes. In Ward II, former alderman Charles Stroburg, who lost his bid for re-election the previous year, was elected with 69 votes or 58 percent, beating Mike Smith with 50 votes or 42 percent.

Two of the three school board incumbents, Tracey Layman Smith and Dawn Kubinski, lost by wide margins, gathering 153 and 222 votes, respectively. The only incumbent to win re-election, Robert Goodrich, came in third with 279 votes, not far ahead of challenger Mark Fancher, who tied with Kubinski to earn 222 votes. The highest vote-getter was Bob Boulware, who retired as superintendent of the Laquey R-V School District but had previously served for many years as district administrator of Crocker’s neighboring school, the Swedeborg R-III School District. Boulware received 368 votes, not far ahead of Donald Mayhew with 358 votes, the former Pulaski County Surveyor who served as school board president until he lost a bid for re-election last year.
