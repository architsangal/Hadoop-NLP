He murdered numerous women and girls, most of whom were alleged prostitutes, in Washington during the 1980s and 1990s, earning his nickname when the first five victims were found in the Green River. [ 2305751 ] He strangled them, usually with his arm but sometimes using ligatures. After strangling the women, he would dump their bodies throughout forested and overgrown areas in King County, often returning to the dead bodies to have sexual intercourse with them.

As part of a plea bargain wherein he agreed to disclose the whereabouts of still missing women, he was spared the death penalty and received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. [ Early life ] Ridgway was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Mary Rita Steinman and Thomas Newton Ridgway. [ http://crime.about.com/od/serial/a/Gary-Ridgway.htm Gary Ridgway: The Green River Killer Charles Montaldo About.com 2011-02-14 2011-07-01 ] He has two brothers—Gregory Leon and Thomas Edward. Ridgway&apos;s homelife was somewhat troubled; relatives have described his mother as domineering and have said that young Ridgway witnessed more than one violent argument between his parents. { McCarthy (Time). } As a boy Ridgway had a habit of wetting the bed. His mother would often be the one to discover the accidents and would bathe him immediately. She would belittle him and embarrass him in front of his family. From a young age, Ridgway had conflicting feelings of sexual attraction and anger toward her. { Guillen 2007, p. 130. } As a young child, Ridgway was tested with an I.Q. of 82, signifying low intelligence, and his academic performance in school was so poor that at one point in high school he had to repeat a year in order to pass. His classmates at Tyee High School describe him as congenial but largely forgettable. His teenage years, however, were troubled; when he was 16, he stabbed a six-year-old boy, who survived the attack. He had led the boy into the woods and then stabbed him through the ribs into his liver. According to the victim and Ridgway himself, Ridgway walked away laughing and saying, &quot; I always wondered what it would be like to kill someone. &quot; [ Adult life ] At age 20, after graduating from high school, Ridgway joined the Navy. { Gary Ridgway: The Green River Killer } After graduation, he married his high school girlfriend, Claudia Barrows, and was sent to Vietnam, where he served onboard a supply ship { Prothero, Mark (2006). Defending Gary, p. 117. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco. ISBN 0-7879-8106-0. } and saw combat. During his time in the military, Ridgway began spending a lot of time with prostitutes and contracted gonorrhea for the second time and also genital warts. This angered him, but he continued to have unprotected sex with prostitutes. Meanwhile, his wife Claudia, alone and 19 years old, had an affair, and the marriage quickly ended within a year. When questioned about Ridgway after his arrest, friends and family described him as friendly but strange. His first two marriages resulted in divorce because of infidelities by both partners. His second wife, Marcia Winslow, claimed that he had placed her in a chokehold. { McCarthy, p. 4 (online version). } Ridgway had become fanatically religious during his second marriage, proselytizing door-to-door, reading the Bible aloud at work and at home, and insisting that Marcia follow the strict teachings of their church pastor. Ridgway would also frequently cry after sermons or reading the Bible. [ http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/greenriver/threat_7.html?sect%3D2 Green River Killer: River of Death Rachael Bell Turner Entertainment Networks 2011-07-01 ] Ridgway continued to solicit the services of prostitutes during this marriage and also wanted Marcia to participate in sex in public and inappropriate places, sometimes even in areas where his victims&apos; bodies were later discovered. According to women in his life, Ridgway had an insatiable sexual appetite. His three ex-wives and several old girlfriends reported that Ridgway demanded sex from them several times a day. Often he would want to have sex in a public area or in the woods. Ridgway himself admitted to having a fixation with prostitutes, [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3DQtrLm4J6A9gC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA444%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA444%26amp%3Bdq%3Drebecca%2Bguay%2Bridgway#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Drebecca%20guay%20ridgway%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse The Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer Robert Keppel William J.

He frequently complained about their presence in his neighborhood, but he also took advantage of their services regularly. It has been speculated that Ridgway was torn between his uncontrollable lusts and his staunch religious beliefs. In 1975 his second wife gave birth to his son, Matthew.

His court statements later reported that he had killed so many, he lost count. A majority of the murders occurred between 1982 and 1984. The victims were believed to be either prostitutes or runaways picked up along Pacific Highway South ( International Blvd. 99 ) whom he strangled. Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the Green River except for two confirmed and another two suspected victims found in the Portland, Oregon area. The bodies were often left in clusters, sometimes posed, usually nude. He would sometimes return to the victims&apos; bodies and have intercourse with them (an act of necrophilia ). Because most of the bodies were not discovered until only the skeletons remained, four victims are still unidentified. Ridgway occasionally contaminated the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported a few victims&apos; remains across state lines into Oregon to confuse the police. Ridgway began each murder by picking up a woman, usually a prostitute. He sometimes showed the woman a picture of his son, to help her trust him. After having sex with her, Ridgway strangled her from behind. He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgway began using ligatures to strangle his victims. Most victims were killed in his home, his truck, or a secluded area. In the early 1980s, the King County Sheriff&apos;s Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were Robert Keppel and Dave Reichert, who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy from 1984. Their interviews with Bundy were of little help in the Green River investigations but elicited confessions from Bundy on unsolved cases. Also contributing was John E. Douglas, who has since written much on the subject of the Green River Killer. Ridgway was arrested in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became a suspect in 1983 in the Green River killings. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a polygraph test, and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet.

Investigation Discovery 2010-10-13 1 9 ] In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway&apos;s crimes before he was contacted by authorities in 1987, and in fact had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she didn&apos;t watch the news. Author Pennie Morehead interviewed Ridgway in prison and she said while he was in the relationship with Mawson his kill rate went down, and that he truly loved her. Mawson told a local television reporter, &quot; I feel I have saved lives... by being his wife and making him happy. &quot; [ Wife Of Nation&apos;s Worst Serial Killer Shares Her Story KIRO 7 Eyewitness News http://www.kirotv.com/news/13362515/detail.html 2007-05-22 2010-10-14 ] The samples collected in 1987 were later subjected to a DNA analysis, providing the evidence for his arrest warrant. On November 30, 2001, Ridgway was at the Kenworth Truck factory, where he worked as a spray painter, when police arrived to arrest him. Ridgway was arrested on suspicion of murder of four women nearly 20 years after first being identified as a potential suspect when DNA evidence conclusively linked semen left in the victims to the saliva swab taken by the police. The four victims named in the original indictment were Marcia Chapman, Opal Mills, Cynthia Hinds, and Carol Ann Christensen. Three more victims—Wendy Coffield, Debra Bonner, and Debra Estes—were added to the indictment after a forensic scientist identified microscopic spray paint spheres as a specific brand and composition of paint used at the Kenworth factory during the specific time frame when these victims were killed. [ Plea bargain, confessions, sentencing ] Early in August 2003, Seattle television news reported that Ridgway had been moved from a maximum security cell at King County Jail to an undisclosed location. Other news reports stated that his lawyers, led by Anthony Savage, were closing a plea bargain that would spare him the death penalty in return for his confession to a number of the Green River murders. On November 5, 2003, Ridgway entered a guilty plea to 48 charges of aggravated first degree murder as part of a plea bargain, agreed to in June, that would spare him execution in exchange for his cooperation in locating the remains of his victims and providing other details. In his statement accompanying his guilty plea, Ridgway explained that all of his victims had been killed inside King County, Washington, and that he had transported and dumped the remains of the two women near Portland to confuse the police. Deputy prosecutor Jeffrey Baird noted in court that the deal contained &quot; the names of 41 victims who would not be the subject of State v. Ridgway if it were not for the plea agreement. &quot; King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng explained his decision to make the deal: [ Norm Maleng Statement of Norm Maleng on Ridgway Plea 2003-11-05 http://www.metrokc.gov/proatty/news/2003/RidgwPR5.htm 2008-06-23 ] On December 18, 2003, King County Superior Court Judge Richard Jones sentenced Ridgway to 48 life sentence s with no possibility of parole and one life sentence, to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to an additional 10 years for tampering with evidence for each of the 48 victims, adding 480 years to his 48 life sentences. Ridgway led prosecutors to three bodies in 2003. On August 16 of that year, the remains of a 16-year-old female found near Enumclaw, Washington, 40 feet from State Route 410, were pronounced as belonging to Pammy Annette Avent, who had been believed to be a victim of the Green River Killer. The remains of Marie Malvar and April Buttram were found in September. On November 23, 2005, The Associated Press reported that a weekend hiker found the skull of one of the 48 women Ridgway admitted murdering in his 2003 plea bargain with King County prosecutors. The skull of Tracy Winston, who was 19 when she disappeared from Northgate Mall on September 12, 1983, was found by a man hiking in a wooded area near Highway 18 near Issaquah, southeast of Seattle. Ridgway confessed to more confirmed murders than any other American serial killer. Over a period of five months of police and prosecutor interviews, he confessed to 48 murders—42 of which were on the police&apos;s list of probable Green River Killer victims. [ Anitra Mulwee http://www.karisable.com/grkmulwee.htm karisable.com 2008-03-19 ] On February 9, 2004, county prosecutors began to release the videotape records of Ridgway&apos;s confessions. In one taped interview, he told investigators initially that he was responsible for the deaths of 65 women, but in another taped interview with Reichert on December 31, 2003, Ridgway claimed to have murdered 71 victims and confessed to having had sex with them prior to killing them, a detail which he did not reveal until after his sentencing. { Cold Case Files : &quot; Obsession: Dave Reichert and the Green River Killer (Original airdate: 2005-12-15) on } { A &amp; E. } In his confession, he acknowledged that he targeted prostitutes because they were &quot; easy to pick up and that he hated most of them. &quot; [ Eric Hickey Serial Murderers and Their Victims 2010 25 ] He also confessed that he had sex with his victims&apos; bodies after he murdered them, but claimed he began burying the later victims so that he could resist the urge to commit necrophilia.

In his own words, &quot; I would talk to her... and get her mind off of the, sex, anything she was nervous about. And think, you know, she thinks, &apos;Oh, this guy cares&apos;... which I didn&apos;t. I just want to, uh, get her in the vehicle and eventually kill her. &quot; { Cold Case Files #56 } { A &amp; E Network } Later in a statement Ridgway said that murdering young women was his &quot; career &quot;. [ http://www.karisable.com/greenriver.htm Green River Killer Karisable.com 2010-09-27 ] Ridgway is incarcerated at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington. [ Victims ] Before Ridgway&apos;s confession, authorities had attributed 49 murders to the Green River Killer. { Green River victims&apos; list may grow by six } As mentioned above, Ridgway confessed to murdering at least 71 victims. [ Confirmed ] At the time of his December 18, 2003 sentencing, authorities had been able to find at least 48 sets of remains, including victims not originally attributed to the Green River Killer. Ridgway was sentenced for the deaths of each of these 48 victims, with a plea agreement that he would &quot; plead guilty to any and all future cases (in King County) where his confession could be corroborated by reliable evidence. &quot; { Remains found in Auburn, Wash. possible Green River victim } Name Age Disappeared Found 1 Wendy Lee Coffield 16 July 8, 1982 July 15, 1982 2 Gisele Ann Lovvorn 17 July 17, 1982 September 25, 1982 3 Debra Lynn Bonner 23 July 25, 1982 August 12, 1982 4 Marcia Fay Chapman 31 August 1, 1982 August 15, 1982 5 Cynthia Jean Hinds 17 August 11, 1982 August 15, 1982 6 Opal Charmaine Mills 16 August 12, 1982 August 15, 1982 7 Terry Rene Milligan 16 August 29, 1982 April 1, 1984 8 Mary Bridget Meehan 18 September 15, 1982 November 13, 1983 9 Debra Lorraine Estes 15 September 20, 1982 May 30, 1988 10 Linda Jane Rule 16 September 26, 1982 January 31, 1983 11 Denise Darcel Bush 23 October 8, 1982 June 12, 1985 12 Shawnda Leea Summers 16 October 9, 1982 August 11, 1983 13 Shirley Marie Sherrill 18 October 20–22, 1982 June 1985 14 Rebecca &quot; Becky &quot; Marrero 20 December 3, 1982 December 21, 2010 15 Colleen Renee Brockman 15 December 24, 1982 May 26, 1984 16 Alma Ann Smith 18 March 3, 1983 April 2, 1984 17 Delores LaVerne Williams 17 March 8–14, 1983 March 31, 1984 18 Gail Lynn Mathews 23 April 10, 1983 September 18, 1983 19 Andrea M.

Agisheff does not fit the profile of any of the victims of the Green River Killer considering her age, and she was not a prostitute or a teenaged runaway. Although he has never been charged with her murder, Gary Ridgway did confess to killing Kasee Ann Lee. During police interrogations in 2003, Ridgway stated that he strangled Lee in 1982 and left her body near a drive-in theatre off the Sea-Tac Strip. As of October 2008, law enforcement officials have been unable to locate Lee&apos;s remains at the dump site that Ridgway indicated. (Guillen, T. Serial Killers: Issues Explored Through the Green River Murders. Upper Saddle River, NJ : Pearson, 2007. Page 145). Ridgway is a suspect in the death of Tammie Liles. Her body was discovered within a mile of the bodies of known victims Shirley Shirell and Denise Bush. Liles remained unidentified until 1998. Evidence exists to suggest that Ridgway murdered Keli Kay McGinness. Shortly before her disappearance, McGinness was questioned by a Port of Seattle police officer while &quot; dating &quot; Ridgway near the SeaTac Strip. Furthermore, during the summer of 2003, Ridgway led authorities to the bodies of several of his victims. One of those bodies (which later turned out to be April Buttram) was initially identified by Ridgway as being that of Keli Kay McGinness.
