Brooks&apos; own possible involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator. { Doward, Jamie, Toby Helm, et al., &quot; Phone-hacking scandal: is this the tipping point for Murdoch&apos;s empire? &quot;, } { The Guardian, 9 July 2011 23.11 BST.

It emerged after he was appointed to the board investigation that Dinh is godfather to one of Lachlan Murdoch &apos;s children and friend of Lachlan since 2003. Further, in 1992, a decade before he met Lachlan, Dinh wrote of his sister, held in a Hong Kong refugee camp, in the New York Times, which led to NBC TV coverage and then to a series of articles in the South China Morning Post. The Post was owned by Rupert Murdoch, and Dinh&apos;s articles there were credited with helping free his sister. The personal ties to Murdoch interests and family were debated as Dinh took the role in the phone-hacking investigation. { &quot; Murdoch’s Denials Are Tough to Believe, Former Wall Street Journal Reporter Sarah Ellison Says &quot;, interview by } { Amy Goodman, } { Democracy Now, July 20, 2011. } { Grover, Ronald, and Tom Schoenberg, &quot; News Corp.

Dinh was also involved in the selection and confirmation of 100 district and 23 appellate judges in his role representing the U.S. Department of Justice. After 9/11, Dinh conducted a comprehensive review of DOJ priorities, policies and practices, and played a key role in developing the USA PATRIOT Act and revising the Attorney General&apos;s Guidelines, which govern federal law enforcement activities and national security investigations. [ April 2007 ] [ Georgetown University Law Center ] Dinh is Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center. His expertise lies in constitutional law, corporations law, and the law and economics of development. He is also currently Co-Director of the Asian Law &amp; Policy Studies Program. He previously served as Co-Director of the Joint Program in Law and Business Administration, from 1998–99. [ Personal life ] His family was separated in 1975 when his father, Phong Dinh, was imprisoned in a re-education camp after the fall of Saigon. His father was being held as a political prisoner in the family&apos;s war-ravaged homeland. He escaped in 1978, and remained a fugitive in Vietnam, when his mother, Nga Thu Nguyễn, and his older siblings got on a boat with 85 other people and set out. For 12 days Dinh was in a broken 15-foot-long boat with no food or water as they encountered a Thai fishing crew that gave them food and gas, and helped fix the boat and pointed them toward land. When they reached Malaysia, they found only to be met by gunshots from a patrol boat; the Malaysians didn&apos;t want them. Their boat docked but Dinh&apos;s mother realized that the port police would force them to leave the next morning, so she sneaked back out to the boat alone that night with an axe and damaged the boat so as not to be sent back on it. After six months as refugees in Malaysia, Dinh&apos;s family made it to Oregon in November 1978. They picked strawberries for menial wages, sending money back to Dinh&apos;s father and a sibling hiding out in Vietnam. After Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, the crop damage forced his family to relocate to Fullerton. Dinh was honored by his high school alma mater when he was added to Fullerton&apos;s wall of fame. He will share that wall with an ideological opposite, David Boies, former Vice President Al Gore &apos;s lawyer for the Florida recount. Dinh was reunited with his father in 1983. In 1992, he was reunited with one of his sisters at a refugee camp in Hong Kong, a meeting filmed by the newsmagazine show Dateline NBC. [ Future Supreme Court nominee ] Dinh was mentioned as a potential nominee to The Supreme Court of the United States in a Republican administration.
