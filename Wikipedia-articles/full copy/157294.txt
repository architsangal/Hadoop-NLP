Forest have been based at the City Ground since 1898. Founded in 1865, the club were founder members of the Football Alliance in 1889 and joined the Football League in 1892. Forest won the FA Cup in 1898 and 1959, but their most successful period came under the management of Brian Clough, between 1975 and 1993, during which time they won their only league title, two consecutive European Cup s and four League Cup s. Forest have become a yo-yo club since, and their last spell in the Premier League ended in 1999. Forest are the only former European champion club not to be currently playing in their top-tier domestic league or division. The club is often referred to simply as Forest, the name the club carries on their crest and sometimes, erroneously, as Notts Forest, which is actually an abbreviation of Nottinghamshire and thus a reference to cross-city rivals Notts County. The team are also called the Reds, due to the colour of their strip.

[ http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engfootalliancehist.html England – Football Alliance Rsssf.com 23 July 2006 24 February 2012 ] They were then allowed entry to The Football League.

In 1949 the club were relegated to the Third Division, but bounced back two years later as champions of the Second. A brief period of glory followed at the end of the 1950s, as they regained First Division status in 1957 and won the FA Cup for a second time in 1959, despite losing Roy Dwight, cousin of pop icon Elton John, through a broken leg [ http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10308~1239793%2C00.html Club &amp; #124; History &amp; #124; History &amp; #124; FA Cup Final 1959 Nottingham Forest 24 February 2012 ] and becoming the first team to defeat the Wembley &apos;hoodoo&apos;. By this time Forest had become the biggest team in Nottingham, overtaking Notts County. But after reaching the high of runners-up spot and cup semi-finalists in 1967, Forest were relegated from the First Division in 1972. Brian Clough managed Nottingham Forest for 18 years. [ Brian Clough Era (1975–1993) ] Forest were considered a moderate club by English league standards until the mid 1970s, when Brian Clough and his assistant Peter Taylor took the helm at the club, shortly after Clough&apos;s highly colourful, very controversial and ultimately disastrous 44 day tenure as manager of Leeds United. Clough became the most successful manager in the history of Nottingham Forest. He had won the league title with Forest&apos;s neighbours Derby County in 1972, and came to Nottingham Forest on 6 January 1975, after a 0–2 home defeat by Notts County, on Boxing Day, prompted the committee (Forest had no board of directors then) to sack the previous manager Allan Brown. Clough&apos;s first game in charge was the third round FA Cup replay against Tottenham Hotspur, a 1–0 victory thanks to a goal by Scottish centre-forward Neil Martin. Nottingham Forest won promotion to the top division at the end of the 1976–77 season after finishing third in the Second Division, but no-one could have predicted how successful Clough&apos;s team would be over the next three seasons. Nottingham Forest became one of the few teams (and the most recent team to date) to win the English First Division Championship a year after winning promotion from the English Second Division ( 1977–78 season ). { The others were } { Liverpool in 1906, } { Everton in 1932, } { Tottenham Hotspur in 1951 and } { Ipswich Town in 1962. Forest remain the only club to achieve this feat having not been promoted as champions. } In 1978–79, Forest went on to win the European Cup by beating Malmö 1–0 in Munich&apos;s Olympiastadion and retained the trophy in 1979–80, beating Hamburg 1–0 in Madrid, at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, thanks to an outstanding performance by goalkeeper Peter Shilton. They also won the European Super Cup and two League Cup s. Beside Shilton, key players of that era included right-back Viv Anderson (the first black player to play for the England national team ), midfielder Martin O&apos;Neill, striker Trevor Francis and a trio of Scottish internationals: winger John Robertson, midfielder Archie Gemmill and defender Kenny Burns. The club reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1983–84 but were knocked out by Anderlecht in controversial circumstances. It later emerged that in the second leg, the Belgian club had bribed the referee but the referee in question had since died in a car accident and was hence not able to be held accountable. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/42383.stm BBC News Forest sues Anderlecht over &apos;84 bribery scandal 24 December 1997 10 April 2010 ] Nottingham Forest&apos;s next significant trophy came in 1989 when they beat Luton Town 3–1 in the League Cup final. For most of the season they had been hopeful of completing a unique domestic treble, but were beaten into third place in the League by Arsenal and Liverpool and lost to Liverpool in the replay of the FA Cup semi-final, originally held at Hillsborough, where 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death on terracing, the match was abandoned after 6 minutes. When football resumed they captured the Full Members Cup with a 4–3 victory over Everton. Clough&apos;s side retained the League Cup in 1990 when they beat Oldham Athletic 1–0; the winning goal scored by Nigel Jemson. There was chance for more success in 1991 when Forest reached their only FA Cup final under Brian Clough and went ahead after scoring an early goal (Stuart Pearce free kick) against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, but ended up losing 2–1 in extra time after an own goal by Des Walker. Forest beat Southampton 3–2 in the Full Members Cup final in 1992, but then lost to Manchester United in the League Cup in the same season, both finals being played by a Forest team much weakened by injuries. Brian Clough&apos;s 18-year reign as manager ended in May 1993 when Forest were relegated from the inaugural Premier League after 16 illustrious years of top flight football which had seen a league title, two European Cups and four League Cups. [ Frank Clark (1993–1996) ] Frank Clark, who had been a left-back in Nottingham Forest&apos;s 1979 European Cup winning team, returned to the club in May 1993 to succeed Brian Clough as manager. His management career had previously been uneventful, although he had won the Fourth Division promotion playoffs with Leyton Orient in 1989. Having inherited most of the players from the Clough era, Clark was able to achieve a return to the Premier League when the club finished Division One runners-up at the end of the 1993–94 season. Forest finished third in 1994–95 and qualified for the UEFA Cup – their first entry to European competition in the post- Heysel era. The club reached the quarter-finals, the furthest an English team reached in UEFA competitions that season. The 1996–97 season became a relegation battle and Clark was sacked in December. [ Dave Bassett (1997–1999) ] 34-year-old captain Stuart Pearce was installed as player-manager on a temporary basis and he inspired a brief upturn in the club&apos;s fortunes. In March 1997 he was replaced on a permanent basis by Dave Bassett. Forest were unable to avoid relegation and finished the season in bottom place. They won promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt, being crowned Division One champions in 1997–98.Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with Ron Atkinson replacing him. [ Into the 21st century (1999–present) ] Ron Atkinson was unable to prevent Forest from once again slipping back into the Football League with a succession of poor results, most noticeably an 8–1 defeat by Manchester United. David Platt succeeded Atkinson and spent approximately £12  million on players, including the Italian veterans Moreno Mannini, Salvatore Matrecano and Gianluca Petrachi. [ Platt hires Italians as Goldbaek balks http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-platt-hires-italians-as-goldbaek-balks-1110481.html The Independent London 3 August 1999 ] Platt managed two mid-table finishes before departing to manage England U-21s.

A poor league run the following season, following the release of key players, led to the sacking of Hart in February 2004 in order to prevent relegation. [ Forest finally lose patience with Hart http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/feb/07/newsstory.sport8 The Guardian London 7 February 2004 14 October 2011 ] The decision was unpopular with certain quarters of the fanbase and Hart was described as a &apos;scapegoat&apos;.

Following the brief caretaker stewardship of Mick Harford, Gary Megson took charge of Forest in January 2005 but failed to stave off relegation as the club ended the season second from bottom in 23rd place, [ Championship 2004/05 http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id%3D146 Racing Post Soccerbase 14 October 2011 ] becoming the first European Cup-winners ever to fall into their domestic third division.

Colin Calderwood was appointed as the twelfth manager of Forest in thirteen years in May 2006 and became the longest-serving manager since Frank Clark. The Calderwood era was ultimately one of rebuilding. In his first season he led the club to the play-offs, having squandered a 7-point lead at the top of League One which had been amassed by November 2006. Forest eventually succumbed to a 5–4 aggregate defeat in the semi-finals against Yeovil Town.

At the meeting in the Clinton Arms which established Nottingham Forest as a football club, the committee also passed a resolution that the team colours should be ‘ Garibaldi red’. { The Official History of Nottingham Forest } This decision was made in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian patriot who was the leader of the redshirts party. At this time, clubs identified themselves more by their headgear than their shirts and a dozen red caps with tassels were duly purchased, making Forest the first club to ‘officially’ wear red, a colour that has since been adopted by a significant number of others. Forest is the reason behind Arsenal &apos;s choice of red, having donated a full set of red kits following Arsenal&apos;s foundation in 1886. [ Stadium ] [ City Ground ] The City Ground Nottingham Forest originally played at the Forest Recreation Ground where they remained until 1879 when they relocated to the Meadows. Following this move, Forest began playing their more important matches at Trent Bridge due to its larger capacity. By 1880, all of Forest&apos;s matches were taking place at Trent Bridge but the club secured a site of its own in Lenton in 1882, naming it Parkside. The inadequate facilities necessitated the building of an improved ground in the next field in 1885 at a cost of £500. In 1890, Forest relocated once more, this time with the intention of drawing larger crowds in a location closer to the centre of Nottingham. The Town Ground, on the banks of the River Trent, was built in 1890 at a cost of £1,000 before growing success led to a final move across the Trent to the current City Ground site in 1898. Since then the ground has undergone extensive redevelopment, resulting in the 30,602-seater Euro 96 venue which we know today. Contrary to popular belief the name &quot; Forest &quot; does not originate from Sherwood Forest, but from the Forest Recreation Ground just north of Nottingham City Centre which is where the club first played upon its formation in 1865. The City Ground is the 21st largest League football stadium in England List of football stadiums in England On 20 June 2007, Forest announced plans to relocate to a 50,000-seater new stadium in either the Clifton area of the city or a site near to the current City Ground in Holme Pierrepont. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/6220982.stm BBC News Forest consider City Ground exit 20 June 2007 10 April 2010 ] { http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/audio/Plans-Forest-super-stadium-Holme-Pierrepontarticle-308652-details/article.html } [ September 2011 ] The club later announced revised plans for a new ground at Gamston which formed part of the FA &apos;s bid to host the 2018 World Cup, with Nottingham beating neighbours Derby and Leicester (both of which already had modern stadia capable of hosting such international games) into the final stages of selection by the FA to be included within the bid. However, in December 2010 The FA controversially failed in the bid and it was announced by FIFA that the 2018 World Cup will be staged in Russia. Following this announcement Forest&apos;s plans for a new stadium were scrapped for the foreseeable future and the club announced the intention to remain at the City Ground. [ Local rivals and derbies ] Whilst Notts County is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained at least one division higher since the 1994–95 season and the club&apos;s fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, located less than half an hour&apos;s drive, 14 miles away.

Leicester City are Forest&apos;s other East Midlands rival due to the close proximity and economic/social rivalry of the two cities. During the pre-Clough era, Leicester were largely considered Forest&apos;s main rivals. This is still the case for Forest fans of Melton Mowbray, Loughborough and yesteryear. A Football League Cup tie in September 2007 took on an extra dimension after Leicester defender Clive Clarke collapsed due to heart failure. After the match was abandoned, Leicester demonstrated sportsmanship in the replay and allowed Forest keeper Paul Smith to score at the beginning of the match. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6996432.stm BBC Sport – Nottingham Forest 2–3 Leicester BBC News 18 September 2007 24 February 2012 ] This was in acknowledgement that Forest were leading 1–0 when the original tie was abandoned. The act was met with applause from both sets of fans and praised by the press.

Chants of &apos;scab&apos; are still often heard at these games aimed towards the Forest fans. The exciting 2003 Football League Championship Play-off semi final between the two clubs, in which Sheffield United finished as 5-4 aggregate winners, also fueled the rivalry.

One of them is &quot; City Ground &quot;, sung to the tune of Mull of Kintyre ( Paul McCartney &amp; Wings ). Forest fans have adapted the verses, and the anthem features lyrics such as &quot; Oh mist rolling in from the Trent &quot; and &quot; My desire, is always to be here, oh City Ground &quot;. The second anthem is &apos; You&apos;ve Lost That Loving Feeling &apos; (the Righteous Brothers), which Forest fans sing to taunt the opposing fans when the Reds have scored a goal. Chelsea Dagger by The Fratellis is played whenever Forest score Another Trent End favourite is: &quot; I never felt more like singing the blues, when Forest win, and Derby lose &quot;, sung to the tune of Singing the Blues (Guy Mitchell). To the tune of The Animals Went In Two By Two – Hurrah is the chant &quot; When Derby go down again and again, we&apos;ll sing, we&apos;ll sing &quot;. This opening line is repeated before &quot; When Ian Moore scores a goal you can shove your Hector up your hole and we&apos;ll all go mad when Derby go down again &quot; This line refers to Ian Storey-Moore a Forest goalscoring favourite of the 1960s, and a similarly prolific Kevin Hector of fierce rivals Derby County. &apos;The Forest March&apos;(&apos; We&apos;ve Got the Whole World in Our Hands &apos;) was released in February 1978 on 7-inch vinyl. This was a joint collaboration between the group Paper Lace and Nottingham Forest Football Club and features the fans singing as well as the team of the time. Changes to the lyrics included &quot; We&apos;re the best team, in the land / We&apos;re the best damn team, in the land &quot; amongst others. An older anthem from the City Ground terraces is the fans&apos; adaptation of Lee Marvin &apos;s 1970 number one hit Wand&apos;rin&apos; Star, with such lyrics as: &quot; I was bo-rn, under a Trent End goal &quot; and also slight changes in the verses where Marvin describes what wheels and mules were made for, to how certain implements were made for inflicting injuries on fans of fierce rivals Derby County. For 40 years the team used to appear from the tunnel to the theme tune from Associated TeleVision &apos;s television series The Adventures of Robin Hood. Since the 2006/7 season the theme tune for the BBC&apos;s new Robin Hood TV series has been used.
