[ Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association.svg organization United Kingdom 1970 President Lawrie Dring Chief Commissioner Graham Rutherford http://www.traditionalscouting.co.uk/ World Federation of Independent Scouts ] The Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association (B-PSA) is a youth organisation found in the United Kingdom, with affiliations in various countries. Baden-Powell Scouting focuses on the importance of tradition in the Scout movement. Japan, Argentina, Malaysia, Germany, Denmark, Ghana, Canada [ http://www.bpsa-canada.org/ B-PSA Canada ] and the United States [ http://bpsa-us.org/about/ B-PSA United States ] have traditional organisations that are affiliated to the Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association (B-PSA). The Baden-Powell Scout Association shares the heritage of the youth Scouting Movement, however they believe in a more traditional way of Scouting which closely follows the program set out by Baden-Powell in his book: Scouting for Boys. It was formed in the United Kingdom in 1970 when it was felt that rest of the Scout Movement was abandoning the traditions and intentions set out by General Robert Baden-Powell in 1907. The Baden-Powell Scouts retain the belief that essence of the movement should be based on outdoor activities related to the skills of explorers, backwoodsmen and frontiersmen. It is a voluntary, non-formal educational charity movement for young people. It is independent, non-political, non-military, and open to all without distinction of origin, race, creed or gender, in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by Robert Baden-Powell. As an independent Scout Association, they are members of the World Federation of Independent Scouts (WFIS). The WFIS was formed in Laubach, Germany, in 1996 by Lawrie Dring, President of the B-PSA, a British Scouter with the independent Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association (B-PSA). This is a world body that recognises Independent Scouts Associations in countries across the globe which teach traditional Baden-Powell Scouting values. Their aim is to improve the standard of our future citizens with the object of using their efficiency for service for their fellows. { World Federation of Independent Scout Organisations } [ History ] [ 1907-1969 ] British Scouting certificate from December 3, 1914 In 1907, General Robert Baden-Powell was inspecting 7,000 members of the Boy&apos;s Brigade at Glasgow. Sir William Smith, the founder of The Boy&apos;s Brigade, asked Baden-Powell if he had ever considered rewriting his training manual for soldiers, &quot; Aids To Scouting for N.C.O.s and Men &quot; to make it appeal to boys. As a result of this conversation Baden-Powell ran an experimental camp for 20 boys at Brownsea Island Scout camp to test out theories on providing activities for boys.

[ http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/ The History of Scouting 2007-08-18 ScoutBase ] An unexpected result of this was the formation of Scout Patrols around the country, all of which followed the principles set out in Baden-Powell&apos;s work. In 1910 this led Baden-Powell to form the The Boy Scout Association as a national body to organise and support the Scout Patrols. Scouting in the UK continued to follow the programme established by Baden-Powell until 1967, and the publication of the The Chief Scouts&apos; Advance Party Report, which introduced major changes to the uniform, sections and programme.

They did not agree with elements of the changes proposed by the Advance Party Report, and asked that Groups wishing to maintain a more traditional approach to Scouting should be allowed to do so. In mid-1970 The Scout Action Group published The Black Report, which outlined their views.

The two factions reconciled their differences in June 1990, and in 1994 there were nearly 70 Groups in the Association. In the 1990s there was a dip in the number of active Groups in the Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association, in common with a fall in numbers experienced by The Scout Association at that time, and the number of Groups had dropped to around 40 in 2001.

Once a Scout is invested Lord Baden-Powell believed that he would continue to live the Scout Law. This law is kept by Scouts from the age of ten and Adult Leaders must renew their promise on regular occasions. The original Scout Law, written by Lord Baden-Powell, appeared in 1908. The Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association use his 1911 version, which is as follows: A Scout&apos;s honour is to be trusted A Scout is Loyal to the King and to his officers, and to his country, and to his employers. A Scout&apos;s duty is to be useful and to help others. A Scout is a friend to all and a brother to every other Scout, no matter to what social class the other belongs. A Scout is Courteous. A Scout is a friend to animals. A Scout obeys orders of his patrol leader or scout master without question. A Scout smiles and whistles under all difficulties. A Scout is thrifty. A Scout is clean in thought, word and deed. The Baden-Powell Scouts Association hold the ideals of Scouting that were created by Baden-Powell. The history of the association dates back to the foundations of Scouting in the UK in 1908. The association follow a charter set down in their Policy Association Rules. They have no paid Executive Staff or Leaders. The traditional programme also develops a sense of duty, personal discipline and honour. In addition to a wide range of activities Scouts in the B-PSA continue to practise traditional Scouting skills: lighting fire by friction navigating by means other than a compass backwoods cooking camping in self erected &quot; bivvys &quot; The Baden-Powell Scouts Association is affiliated to the umbrella organisation The World Federation of Independent Scouts. They are also affiliated with other Traditional Scout Associations around the world. The Baden-Powell Scouts use the original programmes and wear traditional uniforms. Wolf Cubs continue to use the Grand Howl at the beginning of their meetings. The Tenderfoot badge issued by the Baden-Powell Scouts&apos; Association The advancement program for members of the Baden-Powell Scouts Association is symbolized by the earning of staged badges. Merit badges and rank may be earned by any registered member of the association. In Wolf Cubs this consists of Tenderpad, First Star and Second Star - working towards the final award of Leaping Wolf. The First and Second Stars are worn on the Cub&apos;s cap, this positioning leading them to sometimes be referred to as one then both eyes open. In the Scouts section they use the same ranks as in Scouting for Boys with Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, and the Scout Cord. Senior Scouts can earn the Bushman&apos;s Cord (with variations for Air and Sea Scouts ) and the St. George&apos;s Scout award, which takes the place of the Queens Scout award in The Scout Association. Rover Scouts are able to earn the Baden-Powell Award. The requirements for these badges, and the overall designs of the award badges, remain true to the original Boy Scouts Association requirements and designs, with the stars on the original awards being replaced by the initials B and P, and the word &quot; BOY &quot; being replaced by &quot; B-P &quot;.

The Association is open to males and females in mixed and separate sections. The sections (Beavers to Senior Scouts) are led by a Section Leader, who must hold a warrant for the position, aided by assistant leaders.
