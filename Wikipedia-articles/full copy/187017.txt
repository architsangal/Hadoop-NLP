Serving as a friend of both Hawaiian royalty and the elite immigrant community, Dole advocated the westernization of Hawaiian government and culture. [ Early years ] Dole was born April 23, 1844 in Honolulu to Protestant Christian missionaries from Maine in the United States. His father was Daniel Dole (1808–1878) principal at Punahou School and mother was Emily Hoyt Ballard (1808–1844). His mother died from complications within a few days of his birth. Dole was named after his uncle, Sandford K. Ballard who was a classmate of his father&apos;s at Bowdoin College (and brother of his mother) who died in 1841.

Gibson and adoption of the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It stripped voting rights from all Asians outright, and disenfranchised poor Native Hawaiians and other citizens by raising income and wealth requirements for voting, thus effectively consolidating power with the elite residents. In addition, it minimized the power of the monarch in favor of more influential governance by the cabinet. Dole and other lawyers of American descent drafted this document, which became known as the &quot; Bayonet Constitution &quot;. [ David W.

After Kalākaua&apos;s death, his sister Queen Lili uokalani appointed him to her Privy Council on August 31, 1891. [ End of the monarchy ] The monarchy ended on January 17, 1893 after the Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii organized by many of the same actors involved in the 1887 revolt.

Indeed, Cleveland tried to directly help reinstate the monarchy, after an investigation led by James Henderson Blount. The Blount Report of July 17, 1893, commissioned by President Cleveland, concluded that the Committee of Safety conspired with U.S. ambassador John L. Stevens to land the United States Marine Corps, to forcibly remove Queen Lili uokalani from power, and declare a Provisional Government of Hawaii consisting of members from the Committee of Safety. On November 16, 1893, Albert Willis presented the Queen with Cleveland&apos;s request that she grant amnesty to the Revolutionists in return for reinstatement. The Queen refused, and, according to Willis, demanded capital punishment for those involved. On December 23, unaware that Cleveland had referred the matter to Congress, Willis presented the Provisional Government with Cleveland&apos;s demand to restore the queen to the throne the Provisional Government refused. Queen Liliuokalani wrote in her book Hawaii&apos;s Story by Hawaii&apos;s Queen, that she did not demand capital punishment. { Lili uokalani (Queen of Hawaii) } { http://books.google.com/books?id%3DQrTCvcy0sE4C } { Lee and Shepard, reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, LLC (July 25, 2007) } { 1898 } { 978-0-548-22265-2 } The Morgan Report of February 26, 1894, concluded that the overthrow was locally based, motivated by a history of corruption of the monarchy, and that American troops only served to protect American property and citizens and had no role in the end of the Hawaiian Monarchy.

Dole in turn appointed Thurston to lead a lobbying effort in Washington, DC and secure Hawai i&apos;s annexation.Dole was successful as a diplomat – every nation that recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii also recognized the republic. Dole&apos;s government weathered several attempts to restore the monarchy, including an attempted armed rebellion, the January 24, 1895 counter-revolution.Leader Robert William Wilcox and the other conspirators were captured and sentenced to death, but had their sentences reduced or commuted by Dole. The Queen abdicated and swore allegiance to the Republic of Hawaii in February. While under arrest, she wrote, &quot; I hereby do fully and unequivocally admit and declare that the Government of the Republic of Hawaii is the only lawful Government of the Hawaiian Islands, and that the late Hawaiian monarchy is finally and forever ended, and no longer of any legal or actual validity, force or effect whatsoever. &quot; [ William Adam Russ The Hawaiian Republic (1894-98) And Its Struggle to Win Annexation Associated University Presses 1992 71–72 0-945636-52-0 ] Queen Lili uokalani provided a more detailed story of the events from her perspective in the later chapters of her book. { Territory of Hawaii after the } { Hawaiian Organic Act of 1900 } [ Governor and federal judge ] In March 1899 Henry Ernest Cooper, who had been chairman of the Committee of Safety in 1893, became attorney general.
