Before his departure to take up the post he had approached at least three officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Lord Elgin, &quot; the answer of the Government... was entirely negative. &quot; [ Casey Christopher October 30, 2008 &quot; Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time &quot; : Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism Foundations.

However, while conducting surveys, he found that Parthenon statuary that had been documented in a 17th-century survey was now missing, and so he investigated. According to a Turkish local, marble sculptures that fell were burned to obtain lime for building. Although the original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jul/21/highereducation.parthenon Elgin Marbles: fact or fiction?

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000. { Encyclopædia Britannica Online } [ http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184554/Elgin-Marbles Elgin Marbles Encyclopædia Britannica 2011-04-18 ] Elgin intended the marbles for display in the British Museum, selling them to the British government for less than the cost of bringing them to Britain and declining higher offers from other potential buyers, including Napoleon. [ Description ] [ Parthenon Frieze Metopes of the Parthenon ] The Elgin Marbles include some 17 figures from the statuary from the east and west pediment s, 15 (of an original 92) of the metope panels depicting battles between the Lapiths and the Centaur s, as well as 247 feet (or 75 m of an original [ 524 ft on or ] ) of the Parthenon Frieze which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon. Elgin&apos;s acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the Athenian Acropolis : a Caryatid from Erechtheum; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike; and a number of other architectural fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Treasury of Atreus. [ Legality of the removal from Athens ] As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site, including the Parthenon and the surrounding buildings. He allegedly obtained from the Sultan a firman to allow his artists access to the site. The original document is now lost, but what is said to be a translated Italian copy made at the time still survives. { St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, USA; 3 edition (July 17, 1998) } Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that &quot; any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman &quot;, { see &quot; Was the Removal of the removal of the Parthenon Marbles legal? &quot; in http://www.uk.digiserve.com/mentor/marbles/index.htm } and its authenticity has been challenged. { Dadid Rudenstine, &quot; Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? &quot; in The Nation, vol. 270, 21 (2000) p.30 } The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. The committee had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the marbles. The report claimed that the document { Full transcription of the document in http://www.damon.gr/marmara/firman_gr.htm } in the appendix was an accurate translation in English of an Ottoman firman dated in July 1801. In Elgin&apos;s view it amounted to an Ottoman authorization to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801, but researchers have so far failed to locate any traces of it despite the fact that the Ottoman archives still hold an outstanding number of similar documents dating from the same period. Moreover the parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. Philip Hunt. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and claimed that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation purportedly in his possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, claimed to possess Hunt&apos;s Italian document and &quot; vouches for the accuracy of the English translation &quot;. In addition, the committee report states on page 69 &quot; (Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan &quot;. But the document presented to the committee was &quot; an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original firman &quot;, { Kate Fitz Gibbon, Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law, Rutgers University Press (2005), p.115 } and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair. The lines pertaining to the removal of the marbles allowed Elgin and his team to fix scaffolding, make drawings, make mouldings in chalk or gypsum, measure the remains of the ruined buildings and excavate the foundations which may have become covered in the [ghiaja]; and &quot;...that when they wish to take away [qualche(meaning &apos;a few&apos;)] pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto &quot;. The interpretation of these lines has been questioned even by non-restitutionalists, { John Henry Merryman, &quot; Thinking about the Elgin Marbles &quot; in Michigan Law Review, Vol. 83, No. 8, (Aug., 1985), pp. 1898–1899 } particularly the word qualche, which in modern language should be translated as a few. According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from the Piraeus. { John Henry Merryman. Whither the Elgin Marbles? in Imperialism, Art And Restitution, John Henry Merryman, ed., New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. } Despite the controversial firman, many have questioned the legality of Elgin&apos;s actions. A study by Professor David Rudenstine of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, &quot; is certainly not established and may well be false &quot;. { Rudenstine, David, 1999. The Legality of Elgin&apos;s Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles International Journal of Cultural Property, Vol 8, No. 1, 1999, pp. 356–376 } Rudenstine&apos;s argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads &quot; We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador &quot; but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is &quot; We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N. &quot;. In Rudenstine&apos;s view, this substitution of &quot; Mr. Philip Hunt &quot; with the initials &quot; N.N. &quot; can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee&apos;s insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorization for the removal of the marbles was provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, &quot; Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens &quot;. On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had &quot; retained none of them. &quot; Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was &quot; Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted to [Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva? &quot; to which Hunt answered &quot; yes &quot;, adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document. In contrast, Professor John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law and also Professor of Art at Stanford University, putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable. The Ottoman sultan was grateful to the British for repelling Napoleon ic expansion, and the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him. Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalizes his (and therefore the British Museum&apos;s) claim to the Marbles. He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorization to remove the marbles &quot; is at best ambiguous &quot;, adding that the document &quot; provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon... The reference to &apos;taking away any pieces of stone&apos; seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin&apos;s party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects &quot;. [ Contemporary reaction &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Criticism by Elgin&apos;s contemporaries &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] When the marbles were shipped to England, they were &quot; an instant success among many &quot; who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival, but both the sculptures and Elgin also received criticism from detractors. Lord Elgin began negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but negotiations failed despite the support of British artists after the government showed little interest. Many Britons opposed the statues because they were in bad condition and therefore did not display the &quot; ideal beauty &quot; found in other sculpture collections. The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and in June 1816, after parliamentary hearings, the House of Commons offered £35,000 in exchange for the sculptures. Even at the time the acquisition inspired much debate, although it was supported by &quot; many persuasive calls &quot; for the purchase. Lord Byron did not care for the sculptures, calling them &quot; misshapen monuments &quot;. [ James A.W. Heffernan Museum of Words University of Chicago Press Chicago 2004 125 0-226-32314-5 ] He strongly objected to their removal from Greece, denouncing Elgin as a vandal. His point of view about the removal of the Marbles from Athens is also reflected in his poem &quot; Childe Harold&apos;s Pilgrimage &quot; : [ http://www.elginism.com/20040720/90/ The story of the Elgin Marbles International Herald Tribune 2004-07-14 2009-06-25 ] Dull is the eye that will not weep to see Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed By British hands, which it had best behoved To guard those relics ne&apos;er to be restored.

Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time: [ http://www.newsweek.com/id/200852 Romancing the Stones Newsweek 2009-06-25 ] &quot; The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loot those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred, &quot; said Sir John Newport. A parliamentary committee investigating the situation concluded that the monuments were best given &quot; asylum &quot; under a &quot; free government &quot; such as the British one. In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions which silenced most of his detractors, although the subject remained controversial. [ June 2009 ] John Keats was one of those who saw them privately exhibited in London, hence his two sonnet s about the marbles. Notable supporters of Elgin included the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon. A public debate in Parliament followed Elgin&apos;s publication, and Elgin&apos;s actions were again exonerated. Parliament purchased the marbles for the nation in 1816 by a vote of 82-30 for £35,000. They were deposited in the British Museum, where they were displayed in the Elgin Saloon (constructed in 1832), until the Duveen Gallery was completed in 1939. Crowds packed the British Museum to view the sculptures, setting attendance records for the museum. William Wordsworth viewed the marbles at the museum and commented favourably on their aesthetics. [ William Wordsworth The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth W. Paterson 1884 22 ] [ Damage ] Some of the marbles were damaged before Lord Elgin&apos;s obtaining them. [ Use as a Christian church ] After the conversion of the Greek people to Christianity the Parthenon was eventually converted from a temple of the Virgin (Parthenos) Athena to a holy temple (hieros naos) of the Virgin Mary. { Anthony Kaldellis Associate Professor (Department of Greek and Latin, The Ohio State University), &apos;&apos;A Heretical (Orthodox) History of the Parthenon&apos;&apos;, p.7 } The church of the Parthenon and Athens in general was considered the fourth most important pilgrimage in the Byzantine Empire, after Constantinople, Ephesos and Thessalonica. { Kaldelis, (2007), p. 3. } The temple&apos;s use as a Christian church constitutes the single longest period of its history (ca. 500–1450 AD) and its importance as a church and Christian pilgrimage was greater than that it enjoyed in Ancient Greece. { Kaldelis, (2007), p.11–12. } During this period, frescoes and inscriptions were added to the marble walls and columns as it was a custom of the era&apos;s pilgrim to mark their visit. Altogether some 220 funerary inscriptions survive for the years 600-1200, though many more were probably lost due to structural damage to the building and erosion of the surface. Similar inscriptions were found in the Propylaia as well as on the church of St. George in the Keramykos, which in antiquity was a temple of Hephaistos and is today called the Theseion. { Kaldelis, (2007), p.4 } From 1205 to 1456 Athens was ruled by Western Crusaders and the church was converted into a Latin cathedral, although the stream of pilgrims continued. { Kaldelis, (2007), p.6 } [ Morosini ] East Pediment Another example of prior damage is that sustained during wars. It is during these periods that the Parthenon and its artwork have sustained by far the most extensive damage. In particular, an explosion ignited by Venetian gun and cannon fire bombardment in 1687, whilst the Parthenon was used as a munitions store during the Ottoman rule, destroyed or damaged many pieces of Parthenon art including some of those later taken by Lord Elgin. [ http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/198 Stanford Archaeopedia ] In particular this explosion sent the marble roof, most of the cella walls, 14 columns from the north and south peristyles and carved metopes and frieze blocks flying and crashing to the ground and thus destroyed much of the artwork. Further damage was made to the art of the Parthenon by the Venetian general Francesco Morosini when he subsequently looted the site of its larger sculptures. His tackle was faulty and snapped, dropping an over life-sized Poseidon and the horses of Athena&apos;s chariot from the west pediment to the rock of the Acropolis forty feet below. { The Parthenon, } { Cambridge University Press } [ War of Independence ] The Erechtheum was used as a munitions store by the Ottomans during the Greek War of Independence [ http://www.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id%3D2384 History ] (1821–1833) which ended the 350-year Ottoman rule of Athens. The Acropolis was besieged twice during the Greek War of Independence, once by the Greek and once by the Ottoman forces. During the siege the Greeks were aware of the dilemma and chose to offer the besieged Ottoman forces, who were attempting to melt the lead in the columns to cast bullets, bullets of their own if they would leave the Parthenon undamaged. { Hitchens Christopher, The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?, 1998,p.viii, ISBN 1-85984-220-8 } [ Elgin ] Elgin consulted with sculptor Antonio Canova in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world&apos;s best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further. To facilitate transport by Elgin, the column capital of the Parthenon and many metopes and slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself to which these Marbles were connected. { Where Gods Yearn for Long-Lost Treasures, } { New York Times } One shipload of marbles on board the British brig Mentor was caught in a storm off Cape Matapan and sank near Kythera, but was salvaged at the Earl&apos;s personal expense; [ http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/parthenon_sculptures/parthenon_-_facts_and_figures.aspx The Parthenon Sculptures British Museum ] it took two years to bring them to the surface.

As early as 1838, scientist Michael Faraday was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the National Gallery. { Andrew Oddy, &quot; The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975 &quot;, in Studies in Conservation, vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.146 } { Jenkins, I., &apos; &quot; Sir, they are scrubbing the Elgin Marbles! &quot; — some controversial cleanings of the Parthenon Sculptures&apos;, Minerva 10(6) (1999) 43-45. } The marbles generally were very dirty... from a deposit of dust and soot.... I found the body of the marble beneath the surface white.... The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt.... The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much imbedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalis, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt... but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed.... The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed. A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. Richard Westmacott, who was appointed superintendent of the &quot; moving and cleaning the sculptures &quot; in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concluded { Andrew Oddy, &quot; The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975 &quot;, in Studies in Conservation, vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p.148 } &apos;I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by ignorant or careless moulding — with oil and lard — and by restorations in wax, and wax and resin. These mistakes have caused discolouration. I shall endeavour to remedy this without, however, having recourse to any composition that can injure the surface of the marble Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in the years 1937–38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble&apos;s &quot; patina &quot; { Gardner, Ernest Arthur: A Handbook of Greek Sculpture. Published 1896 Macmillan; } but Lord Duveen, who financed the whole undertaking, acting under the misconception that the marbles were originally white { Andrew Oddy, &quot; The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975 &quot;, in Studies in Conservation, vol. 47, no.3, (2002), p. 149 } probably arranged for the team of masons working in the project to remove discoloration from some of the sculptures. The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of carborundum stone. They are now deposited in the British Museum&apos;s Department of Preservation.

[Untitled]. Studies in Conservation 46(1): 79-80, 2001 } According to Harold Plenderleith, the surface removed in some places may have been as much as one-tenth of an inch (2.5  mm). The British Museum has responded to these allegations with the statement that &quot; mistakes were made at that time. &quot; On another occasion it was said that &quot; the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons &quot; and that &quot; the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain. &quot; During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum, Dr Ian Jenkins, deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that &quot; The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up &quot;. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000 year long weathering on the Acropolis [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/dec/01/maevkennedy Mutual attacks mar Elgin Marbles debate The Guardian 2008-12-29 London Maev Kennedy 1999-12-01 ] Dorothy King, in a newspaper article, claimed that techniques similar to the ones used in 1937-1938 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable. Attention has been drawn by the British Museum to a purportedly similar cleaning of the temple of Hephaistos in the Athenian Agora carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens { J. M. Cook and John Boardman, &quot; Archaeology in Greece, 1953 &quot;, The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 74, (1954), pp. 147 } with steel chisels and brass wire in 1953. According to the Greek ministry of Culture, the cleaning was carefully limited to surface salt crusts. The 1953 American report concluded that the techniques applied were aimed at removing the black deposit formed by rain-water and &quot; brought out the high technical quality of the carving &quot; revealing at the same time &quot; a few surviving particles of colour &quot;. According to documents released by the British Museum under the Freedom of Information Act, a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of vandalism by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures. { Hastings, Chris.

This restoration has included replacing the thousands of rusting iron clamps and supports that had previously been used, with non-corrosive titanium rods; { Smith, Helena. Repair of Acropolis started in 1975 - now it needs 20 more years and £47m, The Guardian, June 10, 2005. Retrieved March 6, 2010. } removing surviving artwork from the building into storage and subsequently into a new museum built specifically for the display of the Parthenon art; and replacing the artwork with high-quality replicas. This process has come under fire from some groups as some buildings have been completely dismantled, including the dismantling of the Temple of Athena Nike and for the unsightly nature of the site due to the necessary cranes and scaffolding. But the hope is to restore the site to some of its former glory, which may take another 20 years and 70 million euros, though the prospect of the Acropolis being &quot; able to withstand the most extreme weather conditions — earthquakes &quot; is &quot; little consolation to the tourists visiting the Acropolis &quot; according to The Guardian. Directors of the British Museum have not ruled out temporarily loaning the marbles to the new museum, but state that it would be under the condition of Greece acknowledging British ownership.

The British Museum is a creative and living achievement of the Enlightenment, while the Parthenon, on the other hand, is a ruin that can never now be restored. the assertion that fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world&apos;s great museums – this has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the famous bust of Nefertiti in Berlin &apos;s Neues Museum; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums, so the Greeks would then establish a precedent to claim these other artworks; some scholars argue that the marbles were saved from what would have been severe damage from pollution and other factors, which could have perhaps destroyed the marbles, if they had been located in Athens the past few hundred years; experts agree that Greece could mount no court case because Elgin was granted permission by what was then Greece&apos;s ruling government and a legal principle of limitation would apply, i.e. the ability to pursue claims expires after a period of time prescribed by law; more than half the original marbles are lost and therefore the return of the Elgin Marbles could never complete the collection in Greece. In addition, many of the marbles are too fragile to travel from London to Athens; display in the British museum puts the sculptures in a European artistic context, alongside the work of art which both influenced and was influenced by Greek sculpture. This allows parallels to be drawn with the art of other cultures; the notion that the Parthenon sculptures are an item of global rather than solely Greek significance strengthens the argument that they should remain in a museum which is both free to visit, and located in one of Europe&apos;s most visited cities. The government of Greece intends to charge visitors of the New Acropolis Museum, where they can view the marbles (as of 2011 the price is €5). a legal position that the museum is banned by charter from returning any part of its collection. The last was tested in the British High Court in May 2005 in relation to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the museum; it was ruled that these could not be returned. { Ruling tightens grip on Parthenon marbles, The Guardian, May 27, 2005. Retrieved March 5, 2010. } The judge, Sir Andrew Morritt, ruled that the British Museum Act – which protects the collections for posterity – cannot be overridden by a &quot; moral obligation &quot; to return works known to have been plundered. It has been argued, however, that connections between the legal ruling and the Elgin Marbles were more tenuous than implied by the Attorney General.

H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at Stanford University and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, there would be a moral argument for returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. The Guardian has written that many repatrionists imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon. However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. The sculptures which Elgin spared have been taken down and put in the New Acropolis Museum. &quot; Is it more spiritually satisfying to see the Marbles in an Athenian museum gallery than one in London? &quot; Other voices, this time in the House of Lords, have raised more acute concerns about the fate of the Elgin Marbles if they were to be returned to Greece. In an exchange on 19 May 1997, Lord Wyatt, asked: My Lords, is the Minister aware that it would be dangerous to return the marbles to Athens because they were under attack by Turkish and Greek fire in the Parthenon when they were rescued and the volatile Greeks might easily start hurling bombs around again? { Yannis Hamilakis, &quot; Stories from Exile: Fragments from the Cultural Biography of the Parthenon (or &apos;Elgin&apos;) Marbles &quot;, in World Archaeology, Vol. 31, No. 2, The Cultural Biography of Objects, (Oct., 1999), p.316 } [ Public perception of the issue ] [ Opinion polls ] Despite the British Museum&apos;s position on its ownership of the marbles, in 1998, a poll carried out by Ipsos MORI asking &quot; If there were a referendum on whether or not the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece, how would you vote? &quot; returned these values from the general adult population: { Public and MPs would return the Elgin Marbles!, } { Ipsos MORI. } 40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece 15% in favour of keeping them at the British Museum 18% would not vote 27% had no opinion A more recent opinion poll in 2002 (again carried out by MORI) showed similar results, with 40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote.
