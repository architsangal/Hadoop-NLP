[ the city in Quebec the submarine HMCS Chicoutimi (SSK 879) ] [ Chicoutimi Borough Chicoutimipano.jpg Arrondissements de Saguenay.png Country Canada Province Quebec Region Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean City Saguenay Borough president Jacques Fortin ] [ 48 25 40 N 71 03 33 W region:CA-QC_type:city(65000) title ] Chicoutimi ( [ icon ʃ ɨ ˈ k uː t ɨ m i ] ) is one of the three borough s of Saguenay, Quebec, Canada. It is situated at the confluence of the Chicoutimi and Saguenay River s. Located 225 kilometres north of Quebec City, it is home to a branch of the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. When the city of Saguenay was constituted on February 18, 2002 by municipal amalgamation, the borough of Chicoutimi was created from the former city of Chicoutimi, the former city of Laterriére, and part of the former township of Tremblay. The former city of Chicoutimi had a population of 60,008 in the Canada 2001 Census, the last census in which Chicoutimi was counted as a separate city. { 2001 Statistics Canada Community Profiles: Chicoutimi } [ History ] The site of Chicoutimi was first settled in 1676 as a French trading post in the fur trade. The city of Chicoutimi was founded in 1842 by Peter McLeod. Following the completion of a railway line to Roberval in 1893, Chicoutimi especially developed at the beginning of the 20th century as an industrial city based on pulp production. Since the Great Depression, the city became an administrative and commercial center. The Conservatoire de musique de Saguenay was founded in Chicoutimi in 1967, and the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi was founded in 1969. The city also played host to the Quebec Summer Games in 1972. In the municipal amalgamations of 1976, Chicoutimi annexed the neighbouring towns of Chicoutimi-Nord and Rivière-du-Moulin. In a later round of amalgamations in 2002, the cities of Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie, Lac-Kénogami, Laterrière, Shipshaw and part of Tremblay merged to form the new city of Saguenay. { http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/pdf/modfev02.pdf } Chicoutimi became a borough of Saguenay. During the summer of 1996 a record rainfall in the region caused major flooding in the downtown, as well as outlying areas. The total cost of the disaster was recorded to be 1.5 billion Canadian dollars. It also claimed seven lives and destroyed many bridges. Chicoutimi&apos;s sister city was Camrose in Alberta, which then became Saguenay&apos;s sister city. Chicoutimi is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicoutimi.

Two bridges cross the Saguenay river in Chicoutimi: St-Anne ( footbridge ) Dubuc bridge [ Rivière-aux-rats ] The seven-mile river crosses the Rosaire-Gautier park and passes under downtown Chicoutimi. Once a larger river, draining of the land for agriculture left it as a creek. It was causing problems because it was swelling swiftly and flooded the downtown. That, coupled with the fact that it had become an open sewer, forced the city to canalize it partly in 1928. [ Langevin River ] Also known as Rivière-du-Moulin. Separates the two neighbourhoods of what used to be the town of Rivière-du-Moulin, lower (St-Nom-de-Jésus) and upper (St-Isidore) which are now parts of Chicoutimi. Surrounded by Rivière-du-Moulin park. Crossed through three minor bridges. [ Chicoutimi River ] Important industrial river that originates from the Kenogami Lake. At the end of the 19th century, the Compagnie de pulpe de Chicoutimi (Chicoutimi pulp company) was created by French-Canadian investors. They chose the Chicoutimi river to transport the logs from the Laurentian Highlands to the Pulperie. Today, the Pulperie is a museum and the city of Chicoutimi obtains its drinkable water from this river. [ Steep roads ] Chicoutimi contains one of the steepest roads in Canada, if not all of North America. Côte-St-Ange, which connects the centre of the city with the Cote de la Reserve neighbourhood above La Pulperie Museum, has an 18 degree grade. This is comparable to Filbert Street in San Francisco or Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand. [ September 2007 ] [ Sports ] The city has been home to the QMJHL &apos;s Chicoutimi Saguenéens since 1973. They play at the Centre Georges-Vézina.
