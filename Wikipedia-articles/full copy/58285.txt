In heat transfer at a boundary (surface) within a fluid, the Nusselt number is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across ( normal to) the boundary. In this context, convection includes both advection and conduction. Named after Wilhelm Nusselt, it is a dimensionless number. The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the heat convection but with a (hypothetically) stagnant (or motionless) fluid. A Nusselt number close to one, namely convection and conduction of similar magnitude, is characteristic of &quot; slug flow &quot; or laminar flow. A larger Nusselt number corresponds to more active convection, with turbulent flow typically in the 100–1000 range. The convection and conduction heat flows are parallel to each other and to the surface normal of the boundary surface, and are all perpendicular to the mean fluid flow in the simple case. \mathrm{Nu}_L = \frac{hL}{k_f} = \frac{\mbox{Convective heat transfer coefficient}}{\mbox{Conductive heat transfer coefficient}} where: L = characteristic length k f = thermal conductivity of the fluid h = convective heat transfer coefficient Selection of the characteristic length should be in the direction of growth (or thickness) of the boundary layer. Some examples of characteristic length are: the outer diameter of a cylinder in (external) cross flow (perpendicular to the cylinder axis), the length of a vertical plate undergoing natural convection, or the diameter of a sphere. For complex shapes, the length may be defined as the volume of the fluid body divided by the surface area. The thermal conductivity of the fluid is typically (but not always) evaluated at the film temperature, which for engineering purposes may be calculated as the mean -average of the bulk fluid temperature and wall surface temperature. For relations defined as a local Nusselt number, one should take the characteristic length to be the distance from the surface boundary to the local point of interest. However, to obtain an average Nusselt number, one must integrate said relation over the entire characteristic length. Typically, for free convection, the average Nusselt number is expressed as a function of the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number, written as: Nu = f( Ra, Pr ). Else, for forced convection, the Nusselt number is generally a function of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number, or Nu = f( Re, Pr ). Empirical correlations for a wide variety of geometries are available that express the Nusselt number in the aforementioned forms. The mass transfer analog of the Nusselt number is the Sherwood number. [ Derivation ] The Nusselt number may be obtained by a non dimensional analysis of the Fourier&apos;s law since it is equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface: q = -k \nabla T, where q is the heat flux, k is the thermal conductivity and T the fluid temperature. Indeed if: \nabla&apos; = -L \nabla, and T&apos; = \frac{T_h-T_0}{T_h-T_c} we arrive at : -\nabla&apos;T&apos; = -\frac{L}{k(T_h-T_c)}q=\frac{hL}{k} then we define : Nu_L=\frac{hL}{k} so the equation become : Nu_L=-\nabla&apos;T&apos; By integrating over the surface of the body: \overline{Nu}=-{{1} \over {S&apos;}} \int_{S&apos;}^{} Nu \, dS&apos;\!, where S&apos; = \frac{S}{L^2} [ Empirical Correlations ] [ Free convection ] [ Free convection at a vertical wall ] Cited [ Frank P.

It is easy to solve but is less accurate when there is a large temperature difference across the fluid. It is tailored to smooth tubes, so use for rough tubes (most commercial applications) is cautioned. The Dittus-Boelter equation is: \mathrm{Nu}_D = 0.023 \mathrm{Re}_D^{4/5} \mathrm{Pr}^{n} where: D is the inside diameter of the circular duct \mathrm{Pr} is the Prandtl number n = 0.4 for heating of the fluid, and n = 0.3 for cooling of the fluid. The Dittus-Boelter equation is valid for { Incropera, Frank P.; DeWitt, David P. (2007). Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer (6th ed.). New York: Wiley. p. 514.

Taking water with a bulk fluid average temperature of 20 °C, viscosity 10.07×10¯⁴ Pa·s and a heat transfer surface temperature of 40 °C (viscosity 6.96×10¯⁴, a viscosity correction factor for ({\mu} / {\mu_s}) can be obtained as 1.45. This increases to 3.57 with a heat transfer surface temperature of 100 °C (viscosity 2.82×10¯⁴ Pa·s), making a significant difference to the Nusselt number and the heat transfer coefficient. [ Sieder-Tate correlation ] The Sieder-Tate correlation for turbulent flow is an implicit function, as it analyzes the system as a nonlinear boundary value problem. The Sieder-Tate result can be more accurate as it takes into account the change in viscosity ( \mu and \mu_s ) due to temperature change between the bulk fluid average temperature and the heat transfer surface temperature, respectively. The Sieder-Tate correlation is normally solved by an iterative process, as the viscosity factor will change as the Nusselt number changes.
