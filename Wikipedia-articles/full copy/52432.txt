A number of stimulant s are derived from xanthine, including caffeine and theobromine. [ Spiller, Gene A. Caffeine CRC Press Boca Raton 1998 0-8493-2647-8 ] Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation. It is created from guanine by guanine deaminase. It is created from hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. It is also created from xanthosine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Voet, Donald; Voet, Judith; Pratt, Charlotte (2008). &quot; The Major Pathways of Purine Catabolism in Animals &quot;, Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level, p. 840. Xanthine is subsequently converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme. Studies reported in 2008, based on 12 C/ 13 C isotopic ratio s of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, suggested that xanthine and related chemicals, including the RNA component uracil, were formed extraterrestrially.

[ Clinical significance of xanthine derivatives ] Derivatives of xanthine, known collectively as xanthines, are a group of alkaloid s commonly used for their effects as mild stimulant s and as bronchodilator s, notably in treating the symptoms of asthma. In contrast to other, more potent stimulants, their main effect consists mainly of opposing the actions of the sleepiness-inducing adenosine, making them somewhat less effective as stimulants than sympathomimetic amine s. Due to widespread effects, the therapeutic range of xanthines is narrow, making them merely a second-line asthma treatment. The therapeutic level is 10-20 micrograms/mL blood; signs of toxicity include tremor, nausea, nervousness, and tachycardia/arrhythmia. Methylxanthines affect not only the airways but stimulate heart rate, force of contraction, cardiac arrhythmias at high concentrations. In the CNS they increase alertness, stimulate the respiratory centre, and are used for treatment of infantile apnea. In high doses they can lead to convulsions that are resistant to anticonvulsants. Methylxanthines induce acid and pepsin secretions in the GI tract. Methylxanthines are metabolized by Cytochrome P450 in the liver. Methylated xanthines include caffeine, aminophylline, IBMX, paraxanthine, pentoxifylline, [ Deree J, Martins JO, Melbostad H, Loomis WH, Coimbra R.
