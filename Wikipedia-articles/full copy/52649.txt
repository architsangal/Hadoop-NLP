Acetylcholine is one of many neurotransmitters in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the only neurotransmitter used in the motor division of the somatic nervous system (sensory neurons use glutamate and various peptides at their synapses). Acetylcholine is also the principal neurotransmitter in all autonomic ganglia. In cardiac tissue acetylcholine neurotransmission has an inhibitory effect, which lowers heart rate. However, acetylcholine also behaves as an excitatory neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle. [ Biology 2002 Pearson Education, Inc. San Francisco, CA 0-8053-6624-5 1037 Campbell, N. A. 6th Reece, J. B. 48 ] [ History ] Acetylcholine (ACh) was first identified in 1914 by Henry Hallett Dale for its actions on heart tissue. It was confirmed as a neurotransmitter by Otto Loewi, who initially gave it the name Vagusstoff because it was released from the vagus nerve. Both received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Acetylcholine was also the first neurotransmitter to be identified. [ Chemistry ] Acetylcholine is an ester of acetic acid and choline with chemical formula [ acetyl CH 3 CO ] O [ Methylenes CH 2 ] [ CH 2 ] [ Nitrogen N + ] ( [ methyl CH 3 ] ) 3. This structure is reflected in the systematic name, 2-acetoxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium. Its receptors have very high binding constants. [ Function ] [ Acetylcholine ACh many many nicotinic; muscarinic nicotine, physostigmine curare, atropine choline Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) ] Acetylcholine has functions both in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and in the central nervous system (CNS) as a neuromodulator. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine activates muscles, and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system. In the central nervous system, acetylcholine and the associated neurons form a neurotransmitter system, the cholinergic system, which tends to cause anti-excitatory actions. [ In the peripheral nervous system ] In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine activates muscles, and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system.When acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptor s on skeletal muscle fibers, it opens ligand-gated sodium channels in the cell membrane. Sodium ions then enter the muscle cell, initiating a sequence of steps that finally produce muscle contraction. Although acetylcholine induces contraction of skeletal muscle, it acts via a different type of receptor ( muscarinic ) to inhibit contraction of cardiac muscle fibers. In the autonomic nervous system, acetylcholine is released in the following sites: preganglionic sympathetic fibers to suprarenal medulla, the modified sympathetic ganglion; on stimulation by acetylcholine, the suprarenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine { some postganglionic sympathetic fibers } pseudomotor neurons to sweat gland s. [ In the central nervous system ] { Micrograph of the } { nucleus basalis (of Meynert), which produces acetylcholine in the CNS. } { LFB-HE stain. } In the central nervous system, ACh has a variety of effects as a neuromodulator upon plasticity, arousal and reward. ACh has an important role in the enhancement of sensory perceptions when we wake up [ Jones BE From waking to sleeping: neuronal and chemical substrates Trends in pharmacological sciences 26 11 578–86 2005 16183137 10.1016/j.tips.2005.09.009 ] and in sustaining attention.

Cognitive brain research 9 3 313–25 2000 10808142 10.1016/S0926-6410(00)00012-4 ] Damage to the cholinergic (acetylcholine-producing) system in the brain has been shown to be plausibly associated with the memory deficits associated with Alzheimer&apos;s disease. { http://www.biopsychiatry.com/alzheim.htm } ACh has also been shown to promote REM sleep [ Platt Bettina The cholinergic system, EEG and sleep Behavioural Brain Research 221 2 499–504 2011 10.1016/j.bbr.2011.01.017 Riedel Gernot 21238497 ] [ Pathways ] There are three ACh pathways in the CNS. [ December 2009 ] Pons to thalamus and cortex Magnocellular forebrain nucleus to cortex Septohippocampal [ Structure ] Acetylcholine and the associated neurons form a neurotransmitter system, the cholinergic system from the brainstem and basal forebrain that projects axons to many areas of the brain. In the brainstem it originates from the Pedunculopontine nucleus and dorsolateral tegmental nuclei collectively known as the meso pontine tegmentum area or pontomesencephalotegmental complex. [ Woolf NJ Butcher LL Cholinergic systems in the rat brain: III. Projections from the pontomesencephalic tegmentum to the thalamus, tectum, basal ganglia, and basal forebrain Brain Research Bulletin 16 5 603–37 1986 3742247 10.1016/0361-9230(86)90134-6 ] [ Woolf NJ Butcher LL Cholinergic systems in the rat brain: IV. Descending projections of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum Brain Research Bulletin 23 6 519–40 1989 2611694 10.1016/0361-9230(89)90197-4 ] In the basal forebrain, it originates from the basal optic nucleus of Meynert and medial septal nucleus : The pontomesencephalotegmental complex acts mainly on M1 receptor s in the brainstem, deep cerebellar nuclei, pontine nuclei, locus ceruleus, raphe nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive. It also projects to the thalamus, tectum, basal ganglia and basal forebrain. Basal optic nucleus of Meynert acts mainly on M1 receptor s in the neocortex. Medial septal nucleus acts mainly on M1 receptor s in the hippocampus and neocortex. In addition, ACh acts as an important &quot; internal &quot; transmitter in the striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. It is released by a large set of interneurons with smooth dendrites, known as tonically active neurons or TANs. [ Plasticity ] ACh is involved with synaptic plasticity, specifically in learning and short-term memory. Acetylcholine has been shown to enhance the amplitude of synaptic potentials following long-term potentiation in many regions, including the dentate gyrus, CA1, piriform cortex, and neocortex. This effect most likely occurs either through enhancing currents through NMDA receptors or indirectly by suppressing adaptation. The suppression of adaptation has been shown in brain slices of regions CA1, cingulate cortex, and piriform cortex, as well as in vivo in cat somatosensory and motor cortex by decreasing the conductance of voltage-dependent M currents and [ Calcium in biology Ca 2+ ] -dependent [ Potassium in biology K + ] currents. [ April 2010 ] In behaving animals the ACh extracellular levels in nucleus accumbens are phase-locked with the acquisition of an appetitive learning. [ Crespo JA, Sturm K, Saria A, Zernig G Activation of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the nucleus accumbens core is necessary for the acquisition of drug reinforcement J.

One effect is to cause a slow depolarization [ September 2008 ] by blocking a tonically-active [ K + ] current, which increases neuronal excitability. Alternatively, acetylcholine can activate non-specific cation conductances to directly excite neurons. [ Haj-Dahmane S Andrade R Muscarinic activation of a voltage-dependent cation nonselective current in rat association cortex Journal of Neuroscience 16 12 3848–61 1996 8656279 ] An effect upon postsynaptic M4-muscarinic ACh receptor s is to open inward-rectifier potassium ion channel (K ir ) and cause inhibition. The influence of acetylcholine on specific neuron types can be dependent upon the duration of cholinergic stimulation. For instance, transient exposure to acetylcholine (up to several seconds) can inhibit cortical pyramidal neurons via M1 type muscarinic receptors that are linked to Gq-type G-protein alpha subunits. M1 receptor activation can induce calcium-release from intracellular stores, which then activate a calcium-activated potassium conductance which inhibits pyramidal neuron firing. [ Gulledge AT Stuart GJ Cholinergic inhibition of neocortical pyramidal neurons Journal of Neuroscience 25 44 10308–20 2005 16267239 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2697-05.2005 ] On the other hand, tonic M1 receptor activation is strongly excitatory. Thus, ACh acting at one type of receptor can have multiple effects on the same postsynaptic neuron, depending on the duration of receptor activation. [ Gulledge AT Bucci DJ Zhang SS Matsui M Yeh HH M1 Receptors Mediate Cholinergic Modulation of Excitability in Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons Journal of Neuroscience 29 31 9888–902 2009 19657040 2745329 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1366-09.2009 ] Recent experiments in behaving animals have demonstrated that cortical neurons indeed experience both transient and persistent changes in local acetylcholine levels during cue-detection behaviors. [ Parikh V Kozak R Martinez V Sarter M Prefrontal acetylcholine release controls cue detection on multiple time scales Neuron 56 1 141–54 2007 17920021 2084212 10.1016/j.neuron.2007.08.025 ] In the cerebral cortex, tonic ACh inhibits layer 4 medium spiny neuron s, the main targets of thalamocortical inputs while exciting pyramidal cell s in layers 2/3 and layer 5. [ Eggermann E Feldmeyer D Cholinergic filtering in the recurrent excitatory microcircuit of cortical layer 4 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 106 28 11753–8 2009 19564614 2710689 10.1073/pnas.0810062106 ] This filters out weak sensory inputs in layer 4 and amplifies inputs that reach the layers 2/3 and layer L5 excitatory microcircuits. As a result, these layer-specific effects of ACh might function to improve the signal noise ratio of cortical processing. At the same time, acetylcholine acts through nicotinic receptors to excite certain groups of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex, which further dampen down cortical activity.

When cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are lesioned, animals&apos; ability to detect visual signals was robustly and persistently impaired.

Looking at ACh&apos;s effect on thalamocortical connections, a known pathway of sensory information, in vitro application of cholinergic agonist carbachol to mouse auditory cortex enhanced thalamocortical activity.

An additional suggested function of ACh in cortex is suppression of intracortical information transmission. Gil et al. (1997) applied the cholinergic agonist muscarine to neocortical layers and found that excitatory post-synaptic potentials between intracortical synapses were depressed. In vitro application of cholinergic agonist carbachol to mouse auditory cortex suppressed intracortical activity as well. Optical recording with a voltage-sensitive dye in rat visual cortical slices demonstrated significant suppression in intracortical spread of excitement in the presence of ACh.

Bear et al. (1986) found that the typical synaptic remapping in striate cortex that occurs during monocular deprivation is reduced when there is a depletion of cholinergic projections to that region of cortex. [ Bear MF, Singer W Modulation of visual cortical plasticity by acetylcholine and noradrenaline Nature 320 6058 172–6 1986 3005879 10.1038/320172a0 ] Kilgard et al. (1998) found that repeated stimulation of the basal forebrain, a primary source of ACh neurons, paired with presentation of a tone at a specific frequency, resulted in remapping of the auditory cortex to better suit processing of that tone. [ Kilgard MP, Merzenich MM Cortical map reorganization enabled by nucleus basalis activity Science 279 5357 1714–8 1998 March 9497289 10.1126/science.279.5357.1714 ] Baskerville et al.

Apart from the cortical areas, Crespo et al. (2006) found that the activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the nucleus accumbens is necessary for the acquisition of an appetitive task. ACh has been implemented in reporting expected uncertainty in the environment [ Yu Dayan 2005 ] based both on the suggested functions listed above and results recorded while subjects perform a behavioral cuing task. Reaction time difference between correctly cued trials and incorrectly cued trials, called the cue validity, was found to vary inversely with ACh levels in primates with pharmacologically (e.g. Witte et al., 1997) and surgically (e.g. Voytko et al., 1994) altered levels of ACh.

[ Synthesis and degradation ] Acetylcholine is synthesized in certain neuron s by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase from the compounds choline and acetyl-CoA. Cholinergic neurons are capable of producing ACh. An example of a central cholinergic area is the nucleus Basilis of Meynert in the basal forebrain. [ May 2012 ] The enzyme acetylcholinesterase converts acetylcholine into the inactive metabolites choline and acetate. This enzyme is abundant in the synaptic cleft, and its role in rapidly clearing free acetylcholine from the synapse is essential for proper muscle function. Certain neurotoxins work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, thus leading to excess acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thus causing paralysis of the muscles needed for breathing and stopping the beating of the heart. [ Receptors ] [ Acetylcholine receptor ] There are two main classes of acetylcholine receptor (AChR), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor s (nAChR) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor s (mAChR). They are named for the ligands used to activate the receptors. [ Nicotinic ] Nicotinic AChRs are ionotropic receptors permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. They are stimulated by nicotine and acetylcholine. They are of two main types, muscle type and neuronal type. The former can be selectively blocked by curare and the latter by hexamethonium. The main location of nicotinic AChRs is on muscle end plates, autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic and parasympathetic), and in the CNS. [ Katzung, B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology McGraw-Hill Medical 2003 0-07-141092-9 9th ] [ Myasthenia gravis ] The disease myasthenia gravis, characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, occurs when the body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission. Over time, the motor end plate is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating this disorder. They allow endogenously-released acetylcholine more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by acetylcholinesterase in the gap junction. [ Muscarinic ] Muscarinic receptors are metabotropic, and affect neurons over a longer time frame. They are stimulated by muscarine and acetylcholine, and blocked by atropine. Muscarinic receptors are found in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, in heart, lungs, upper GI tract and sweat glands. Extracts from the plant Deadly nightshade included this compound (atropine), and the blocking of the muscarinic AChRs increases pupil size as used for attractiveness in many European cultures in the past. Now, ACh is sometimes used during cataract surgery to produce rapid constriction of the pupil. It must be administered intraocularly because cornea l cholinesterase metabolizes topically-administered ACh before it can diffuse into the eye. It is sold by the trade name Miochol-E (CIBA Vision). Similar drugs are used to induce mydriasis (dilation of the pupil), in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and many other situations. [ Drugs acting on the acetylcholine system ] Blocking, hindering or mimicking the action of acetylcholine has many uses in medicine. Drugs acting on the acetylcholine system are either agonists to the receptors, stimulating the system, or antagonists, inhibiting it. [ ACh receptor agonists/antagonists ] Acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists can either have an effect directly on the receptors or exert their effects indirectly, e.g., by affecting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which degrades the receptor ligand. Agonists increase the level of receptor activation, antagonists reduce it. [ Associated disorders ] ACh Receptor Agonists are used to treat myasthenia gravis and Alzheimer&apos;s disease. [ Alzheimer&apos;s disease ] Since α4β2 AchRs are reduced in Alzheimer&apos;s disease, drugs that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, e.g. galantamine hydrobromide (a competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor), are commonly used in its treatment. [ Direct acting ] These are drugs that mimic acetylcholine on the receptor. In low doses, they stimulate the receptors, in high they numb them due to depolarisation block.

The resulting accumulation of acetylcholine causes continuous stimulation of the muscles, glands, and central nervous system. They are examples of enzyme inhibitors, and increase the action of acetylcholine by delaying its degradation; some have been used as nerve agent s ( Sarin and VX nerve gas) or pesticide s ( organophosphates and the carbamates ). In clinical use, they are administered to reverse the action of muscle relaxant s, to treat myasthenia gravis, and to treat symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s disease ( rivastigmine, which increases cholinergic activity in the brain). [ Reversible ] The following substances reversibly inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (which breaks down acetylcholine), thereby increasing acetylcholine levels.

Echothiophate Isofluorophate Organophosphate Insecticides ( Malathion, Parathion, Azinphos methyl, Chlorpyrifos, among others) Organophosphate-containing nerve agents (e.g., Sarin, VX ) Victims of organophosphate-containing nerve agents commonly die of suffocation as they cannot relax their diaphragm.

This inhibition may lead to acetylcholine deficiency, and can have consequences on motor function. [ Release inhibitors ] Botulin acts by suppressing the release of acetylcholine; where the venom from a black widow spider ( alpha-latrotoxin ) has the reverse effect. AcH inhibition causes paralysis. When bitten by a black widow spider, one experiences the wastage of Ach supplies. If and when the supply is depleted, the muscles begin to contract, and paralysis occurs. [ Other/uncategorized/unknown ] Surugatoxin [ Notes ] [ References ] [ Brenner, G.M.; Stevens, C.W.
