As a seven year-old, he witnessed and survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. { Issey Miyake. &quot; A Flash of Memory &quot;. } { The New York Times, July 13, 2009. } He studied graphic design at the Tama Art University in Tokyo, graduating in 1964. After graduation, he worked in Paris and New York City. Returning to Tokyo in 1970, he founded the Miyake Design Studio, a high-end producer of women&apos;s fashion. In the late 1980s, he began to experiment with new methods of pleat ing that would allow both flexibility of movement for the wearer as well as ease of care and production. This eventually resulted in a new technique called garment pleating in 1993&apos;s Pleats Please in which the garments are cut and sewn first, then sandwiched between layers of paper and fed into a heat press, where they are pleated. The fabric&apos;s &apos;memory&apos; holds the pleats and when the garments are liberated from their paper cocoon, they are ready-to wear. He did the costume for Ballett Frankfurt with pleats in a piece named &quot; the Loss of Small Detail &quot; William Forsythe and also work on ballet &quot; Garden in the setting &quot;. He had a long friendship with Austrian-born pottery artist Dame Lucie Rie. She bequeathed to him her substantial collection of ceramic and porcelain button s, which he integrated into his designs and presented in new collections. He also developed a friendship with Apple &apos;s Steve Jobs and produced the black turtlenecks which would become a part of Jobs&apos; signature attire. Jobs said, &quot; So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them. &quot; { Steve Jobs&apos; black turtleneck reportedly explained in biography (Los Angeles Times, October 11, 2011) } In 1994 and 1999, Miyake turned over the design of the men&apos;s and women&apos;s collections respectively, to his associate, Naoki Takizawa, so that he could return to research full-time. In 2007, Naoki Takizawa opened his own brand, supported by the Issey Miyake Group and was replaced, as a Creative Director of the House of Issey Miyake, by Dai Fujiwara. As of 2012, he is one of the co-Directors of 21 21 DESIGN SIGHT, Japan&apos;s first design museum.
