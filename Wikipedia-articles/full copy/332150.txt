Mangum, along with the other founding members of the Elephant 6, attended Ruston High School in the late 1980s. The friends shared a passion for acts of the 1960s, most notably The Zombies and Donovan, as well as an affinity for later alternative rock bands such as Sonic Youth and the Minutemen.

[ With Neutral Milk Hotel ] Neutral Milk Hotel was born after the end of Synthetic Flying Machine, with an original line-up of Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss on guitar and bass and Jeff Mangum on drums. Around 1995 Mangum left Synthetic Flying Machine to focus on his own songs. A year of intensive songwriting (some of it accomplished, according to Mangum, while he was living in a haunted closet) in Denver, Colorado with Robert Schneider at his Pet Sounds Studio resulted in his debut album, On Avery Island, released in 1996, consisting mostly of Schneider and Mangum playing with friends. Mangum eventually expanded the line up of Neutral Milk Hotel and in 1998 released In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. [ After Neutral Milk Hotel ] The relative success of the album in addition to the pressures of sudden fame took its toll on Mangum, who disbanded Neutral Milk Hotel in 1998 after a tour in support of their latest album. Mangum has kept largely out of the public eye since, only rarely playing acoustic sets and concentrating more on his recorded sound and music collages. In March 2001, Mangum and Julian Koster (also formerly of Neutral Milk Hotel ) contributed to an album called Major Organ and the Adding Machine. Other involved players were Kevin Barnes from the band of Montreal, Eric Harris and Will Cullen Hart of Olivia Tremor Control, and Elf Power &apos;s Andrew Rieger.
