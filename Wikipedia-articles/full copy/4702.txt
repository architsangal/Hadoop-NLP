It is isolated from the nearest Dravidian-speaking neighbour population by a distance of more than [ 1500 km ]. [ Parkin 1989 37 ] [ Distribution ] Brahui is spoken in the southwest region of Pakistan, as well as regions of Afghanistan and Iran which border Pakistan; however, many members of the ethnic group no longer speak Brahui. The 2005 edition of Ethnologue reports that there are some 2.2 million speakers; 90% of those live in Pakistan, mainly in the region of Balochistan. [ Lewis 2009 ] [ Classification ] Brahui belongs, with Kurukh (Oraon) and Malto, to the northern subfamily of the Dravidian family of languages. It has been influenced by the Iranian languages spoken in the area, especially Balochi. [ Emeneau 1962 ] [ September 2010 ] Brahui language is seen as a recent migrant language to its present region. Scholars accept that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from central India after 1000 AD. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a Northwestern Iranian language, and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 AD. [ Witzel 1998 1 ] {, which cites } [ Elfenbein 1987 ] One scholar places the migration аs late as the 13th or 14th century. [ Sergent 1997 ] [ September 2010 ] However, a few scholars have hypothesised that Brahui is a remnant of a formerly widespread Dravidian language family that is believed to have been reduced or replaced during the influx of Iranian/Indo-Aryan languages upon their arrival in South Asia. [ Dialects ] Kalat, Jhalawan, and Sarawan, with Kalat as the standard dialect. [ Orthography ] Brahui is the only Dravidian language which has not been written in a Brahmi -based script in the recent past; instead, it is written in the Arabic script. More recently, a Roman-based orthography named Brolikva which is short form of Brahui Roman Likvar has been developed by the Brahui Language Board of the University of Balochistan in Quetta. and adopted by Talár Talar.

They classify it in &quot; unsafe &quot; status, the least endangered level out of the five levels of concern (Unsafe, Definitely Endangered, Severely Endangered, Critically Endangered, and Extinct). [ Moseley 2009 ] [ Publications ] Haftaí Talár recently became the first ever daily newspaper in Brahui language. It uses the new Latin alphabet, and is &quot; an attempt to standardize and develop Brahui language to meet the requirements of modern political, social and scientific discourse. &quot; [ http://www.talarpub.tk/ Talár Publications Haftaí Talár 2010-06-29 ] [ Notes ] [ References ] [ Emeneau Murray B.
