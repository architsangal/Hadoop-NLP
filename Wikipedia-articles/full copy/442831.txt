[ Assim u0.jpg 240px Astronesthes similus ( Phosichthyoidei : Stomiidae ) Animalia Eumetazoa Deuterostomia Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Osteichthyes Actinopterygii Neopterygii Teleostei Stenopterygii (disputed) Stomiiformes Regan, 1909 Suborders Gonostomatoidei Phosichthyoidei Stomiatiformes ] Stomiiformes is an order of deep-sea ray-finned fish es of very diverse morphology. It includes for example dragonfish es, lightfish es, loosejaw s, marine hatchetfish es and viperfish es. The order contains 4 families (5 according to some authors) with more than 50 genera and almost 400 species. As usual for deep-sea fishes, there are few common names for species of the order, but the Stomiiformes as a whole are often called dragonfishes and allies or simply stomiiforms. { Nelson (2006): pp.207-208 } The scientific name means &quot; Stomias-shaped &quot;, from Stomias (the type genus ) + the standard fish order suffix &quot; -formes &quot;. It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek stóma (στόμᾶ, &quot; mouth &quot; ) + Latin forma ( &quot; external form &quot; ), the former in reference to the huge mouth opening of these fishes. { Woodhouse (1910), Glare (1968-1982), FishBase (2005) } [ Description and ecology ] Members of this order are mostly pelagic fishes living in deep oceanic waters. Their distribution around the world&apos;s oceans is very wide, ranging from subtropical and temperate waters up to subarctic or even Antarctic ones.   { FishBase (2005), Nelson (2006): p.207 } { Sloane&apos;s Viperfish, &apos;&apos;Chauliodus sloani&apos;&apos; } The smallest species of this order is the bristlemouth Cyclothone pygmaeae. Native to the Mediterranean Sea, it reaches just 1.5 cm (0.6 in) as an adult. The largest species is the barbeled dragonfish Opostomias micripnis, widely found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean s and measuring about [ 50 cm in on ] in adult length. These fish have a highly unusual and often almost nightmarish appearance. They all have teeth on the premaxilla and maxilla. Their maxillary ligament s, as well as some muscles and certain bones in the branchial cavity, are specialized in a distinctive way. Most have large mouths extending back past the eyes. Some also have a chin barbel. The dorsal and/or pectoral fin s are missing in some, but others have a adipose fin. The pelvic fin has 4-9 rays, and the stomiiforms possess 5-24 branchiostegal ray s. Their scale s are cycloid, delicate and easily sloughed off; some are scaleless. The coloration is typically dark brown or black; a few (mostly Gonostomatoidei ) are silver, and photophore s (light-producing organs) are common in this order. [ Bioluminescence ] { Half-naked Hatchetfish, &apos;&apos;Argyropelecus hemigymnus&apos;&apos; ( } { Gonostomatoidei : } { Sternoptychidae ), with a } { crustacean Note the } { photophore s along the fish&apos;s belly } As common for deep-sea creatures, all members of Stomiiformes (except one) have photophore s, whose structure is characteristic of the order. The light emitted can be more or less strong and its color can be light yellow, white, violet or red. The light coming from these fish is generally invisible to their prey. The lighting mechanism can be very simple – consisting of small gleaming points on the fish body – or very elaborate, involving lens es and refractor s. The most common arrangement is one or two rows of photophores on the ventral aspect of the body. The rows run from the head down to the tip of the tail. Photophores are also present in chin barbels of the family Stomiidae. The light produced in these glandular organs is the product of an enzymatic reaction, a catylization of coelenterazine by calcium ions. [ May 2011 ] [ Daily migration ] During the day, Stomiiformes stay in deep waters. When the sun sets, most of them follow the dimming sunlight up to near-surface waters, which are richer in animal life such as small fishes and plankton ic invertebrate s. During the night, these Stomiiformes hunt and feed on such organisms, swimming back to deeper waters when the sun rises. They apparently are able to measure the intensity of the sunlight that reaches them. [ November 2009 ] They will thus move to stay always in the zone where light intensity is very low, though it is not entirely dark. This daily migration is well observed at quite a few species of stomiiforms. However, it is also performed by other fishes, while some larger Stomiiformes – among them the largest predator s of the deep sea – stay in their habitat all the time and feed on smaller migrating fish that return from the surface. [ Reproduction ] Stomiiforms spawn generally in deep seas, but the eggs are light and float towards the ocean surface. They hatch in surface waters. When the larva e have completed their metamorphosis and look like adults, they descend to join the main population. Like a lot of benthic fish species, certain members of the order – especially in the genera Cyclothone and Gonostoma – change their sex during their life. When they become sexually mature, they are males; later on they transform into females. [ Systematics ] The Stomiiformes are often placed in the teleost superorder Stenopterygii, usually together with the Ateleopodiformes (jellynoses), but sometimes on their own. Whether it is indeed justified to accept such a small group is doubtful; it may well be that the closest living relatives of the &quot; Stenopterygii &quot; are found among the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and that the former would need to be merged in the latter. In some classifications, the &quot; Stenopterygii &quot; are kept separate but included with the Protacanthopterygii and the monotypic superorder Cyclosquamata in an unranked clade called Euteleostei. That would probably require splitting two additional monotypic superorders out of the Protacanthopterygii, and thus result in a profusion of very small taxa. { Nelson (2006): pp.207-208, Diogo (2008) } { Elongated Bristlemouth, &apos;&apos; } { Gonostoma elongatum &apos;&apos; ( } { Gonostomatoidei : } { Gonostomatidae ) } { Yarrella blackfordi &apos;&apos; ( } { Phosichthyoidei : } { Phosichthyidae ) } The Stomiiformes have also been considered close relatives of the Aulopiformes. The latter are otherwise placed in a monotypic superorder &quot; Cyclosquamata &quot; but also appear to be quite close to the Protacanthopterygii indeed. The relationships of these – and the Lampriformes or Myctophiformes, which are also usually treated as monotypic superorders – to the taxa mentioned before is still not well resolved at all, and regardless whether one calls them Protacanthopterygii sensu lato or Euteleostei, the phylogeny of this group of moderately-advanced Teleostei is in need of further study. { FishBase (2005), Diogo (2008) } The ancestral Stomiiformes probably had thin brownish bodies, rows of egg-shaped photophore s adorning the lower body parts, and mouths with numerous teeth. From these, two lineages evolved, probably some time during the Late Cretaceous : Among the modern Stomiiformes, the Gonostomatidae and Phosichthyidae are phenetic ally very similar, but this is due to their being very plesiomorph ic and retaining many traits of the original stomiiforms. Each of the two has characteristic synapomorph ies with one of the more advanced stomiiform families – the Sternoptychidae and the Stomiidae, respectively. These two, in turn, are highly autapomorph ic, and at a casual glance do not look as if they were as closely related to the other stomiiforms as they actually are. Thus, the classification of the suborder s and families of the Stomiiformes is: Family Gonostomatidae – bristlemouths, anglemouths, &quot; lightfishes &quot; (including Diplophidae) Family Sternoptychidae – marine hatchetfishes, bottlelights, constellationfishes, pearlsides { Suborder } { Phosichthyoidei } Family Phosichthyidae – lightfishes Family Stomiidae – barbeled dragonfishes,
