[ the Arkansas lawyer and judge Vic Fleming ] [ 1889 2 23 y ] { Pasadena, } { California, United States } [ 1949 1 6 1889 2 23 ] { Cottonwood, } { Arizona, United States } { Lucile Rosson (1933-1949) } Victor Lonzo Fleming (February 23, 1889 – January 6, 1949) was an American film director, cinematographer, and producer. His most popular films were The Wizard of Oz (1939), and Gone with the Wind (1939), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Director. [ Life and career ] Fleming was born in La Canada, California, the son of Elizabeth Evaleen (née Hartman) and William Alonzo &quot; Lon &quot; Fleming, who worked in the water industry in Pasadena. His mother was of part German descent. Fleming served in the photographic section during World War I, and acted as chief photographer for President Woodrow Wilson in Versailles, France.

Fleming soon rose to the rank of cinematographer, working with both Dwan and D. W. Griffith, and directed his first film in 1919. { Glen O. Gabbard, Krin Gabbard, Psychiatry and the Cinema, page 37 (American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1999, second edition). ISBN 0-88048-826-3 } Many of Fleming&apos;s silent films were action movies, often starring Douglas Fairbanks, or Westerns, and with his robust attitude and love of outdoor sports he became known as a &quot; man&apos;s director &quot;. But he also proved an effective director of women. Under his direction, Vivien Leigh won the Best Actress Oscar, Hattie McDaniel won for Best Supporting Actress, and Ingrid Bergman was nominated. [ MGM ] { Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, CA. } In 1932 Fleming joined MGM and directed some of the studio&apos;s most prestigious films. Red Dust (1932), Bombshell (1933), and Reckless (1935) showcased Jean Harlow, while Treasure Island (1934) and Captains Courageous (1937) brought a touch of literary distinction to boy&apos;s-own adventure stories. His two most famous films came in 1939, when The Wizard of Oz was closely followed by Gone with the Wind. Fleming&apos;s version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941), with Spencer Tracy, was generally rated below Rouben Mamoulian &apos;s 1931 Pre-Code version, which had starred Fredric March. Fleming&apos;s 1942 film version of John Steinbeck &apos;s Tortilla Flat starred Spencer Tracy, John Garfield, Hedy Lamarr, and Frank Morgan. Other films that Fleming made with Tracy include Captains Courageous (for which Tracy won his first Oscar), A Guy Named Joe, and Test Pilot. He directed Clark Gable in a total of five films - Red Dust, The White Sister, Test Pilot, Gone With the Wind, and Adventure. Fleming died suddenly from a heart attack soon after completing Joan of Arc (1948) with Ingrid Bergman. It was one of the few films that he did not make for MGM. Despite mixed reviews, Fleming&apos;s film version of the life of Joan received seven Academy Award nominations, winning two Academy Awards.
