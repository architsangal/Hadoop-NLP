He is unpopular with his crew mates, and is often the target of insults or pranks. Throughout the first seven seasons, his character wore an &quot; H &quot; symbol on his forehead, which stands for &quot; Hologram &quot;, as in the Series I episode &quot; The End &quot; the character was killed in a lethal radiation leak. In Series VIII, he was brought back to life, along with the other members of the original Red Dwarf crew. The creators of the series acknowledge that Rimmer&apos;s surname comes from a snobby prefect with whom they attended school. They claim, however, that only the boy&apos;s name was used, and not his personality because that would imply he had one. [ Background ] [ Early life ] Young Rimmer was often the target of his brothers&apos; bullying. Within the fictional universe of Red Dwarf, Rimmer was born on Io, somewhere during the 21st through 23rd centuries, { Red Dwarf Series II episode &quot; } { Stasis Leak &quot; shows a calendar from 2077, the year that Rimmer died, which conflicts with Series IV episode &quot; } { DNA &quot; when Lister describes himself as a &quot; 23rd century guy &quot;. } { In the episode &quot; } { Ouroboros &quot; the year when an eight month old baby Lister was discovered under a pub pool table is given as 2155, and in &quot; } { Backwards &quot; Lister mentions he is 25 years old. Rimmer is presumably a few years older than Lister, judging by the age difference of the actors that play them. } where he suffered an unhappy childhood. He grew up in the shadow of his three older and more successful brothers, John, Howard and Frank and unlike his brothers he was not sent to the academy to become professional officer, they tormented and bullied him throughout his youth and whose successes in both school and career greatly overshadowed him. His father had been rejected from the Space Corps in his youth for being an inch below regulation height, and was thus fixated on all his sons succeeding where he had failed; to which end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions, and stretched them on a rack to make them taller causing Rimmer to reach a great height at an early age. [ Better than Life Better Than Life Red Dwarf Red Dwarf II 2 ] His mother was a cold woman, who had no time for fools, but was having an affair with Rimmer&apos;s uncle Frank { Rimmer: Anyway, middle of the night, I wake up with this tongue stuck down my throat. Wide awake now -- I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. It was Uncle Frank! He&apos;d got the wrong room, he thought I was my mum! -- } [ The Last Day The Last Day Red Dwarf Red Dwarf III 6 ] and Porky Roebuck&apos;s father. The Series III DVD booklet goes on to conjecture that Arnold&apos;s three brothers were actually Frank&apos;s children. Arnold was also bullied by other children at school  — where he was known as &quot; Bonehead &quot; and his best &quot; friend &quot;, Porky Roebuck, once spearheaded a plan to eat him during a Space Scouts survival course. Rimmer later recounts an occasion on which Roebuck threw his favourite shoes into the school septic tank whilst he was wearing them. Rimmer attended a boarding school from age 8 to 18 where he used to sleep wearing boxing gloves and was visited by his future self (this being the Hologram Rimmer telling him to plagiarize a future invention, when he was 18 he joined a Polytechnic and studied maintenance. Rimmer left home when he was 16, hoping he would become get into the Space Academy, which for an unknown reason he could not (possibly due to his exam performance) his father would not pay for him to attend the Academy like he did for Rimmer&apos;s brothers.Rimmer also earned two swimming certificates: one Bronze Swimming Certificate, and one Silver Swimming Certificate (Despite not being not able to swim)  — BSc and SSc respectively  — which he includes in official correspondence. [ Life on board Red Dwarf ] Rimmer joined the Space Corps at a low-entry level as a third technician, and devoted his life to his career, engaging with few activities outside of work. He is also rather unsuccessful with women, managing to have a sexual relationship with only one woman, Yvonne McGruder, the ship&apos;s female boxing champion. The entire encounter lasted little more than twelve minutes, including the time it took to eat a pizza. { In the 1995 novel } { Last Human, Rimmer&apos;s one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Also, apparently there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night, leading to them going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off Red Dwarf. } Rimmer claims that he lost his virginity in the back of his brother&apos;s Bentley with a girl named Sandra { Red Dwarf series 3 &quot; } { Marooned &quot; } though this was said in order to hide from Lister the fact that he actually lost it to Yvonne McGruder. The show&apos;s creators have also stated he was lying. Despite serving in the Space Corps for fourteen years, he never managed to become an officer, only to advance himself from third technician to second technician. He has attempted to pass the astronavigation exam, required to become an officer, 11 times, but has failed on every occasion, frequently because he spends the allotted revision time indulging his talent for calligraphy and design in the creation of elaborate timetables, leaving no time for actual preparation. In the ensuing panic, he often takes up chain smoking and becomes dependent on stimulants in an attempt to condense months of complex learning into just a few days. In turn, this has pushed Rimmer to several psychotic episodes and breakdowns during exams, and on one occasion caused him to write &quot; I am a fish &quot; repeatedly on the exam paper. However, he believes he has been kept down due to an incident where he was invited to the captain &apos;s table and humiliated himself when served gazpacho soup, which he demanded be taken away and brought back hot. During his service on Red Dwarf, he is assigned to both work with and share quarters with Third Technician Dave Lister, the only crew member of Red Dwarf that he outranks. The two are notably different in personality — unlike the uptight and pompous Rimmer, Lister is unmotivated, slovenly, relaxed and well-liked. Rimmer has been known to be called &quot; bonehead &quot; and &quot; smeghead &quot;. [ Death and afterlife ] Rimmer died in the radiation leak which wiped out the entire crew of Red Dwarf, with the exception of Lister, who was in stasis at the time, and Lister&apos;s pregnant cat, Frankenstein, who was safe in the ship&apos;s hold. Three million years later, when Lister was brought out of stasis, Rimmer was chosen by Holly to be reactivated as a hologram in order to keep Lister company and prevent him from being driven insane with loneliness. He was chosen simply because only one hologram could be active at any given time and Rimmer was the person Lister spoke to most. { HOLLY: He&apos;s the person you knew best. Over 14 million words in all. } [ Balance of Power Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) Red Dwarf Red Dwarf II 2 ] It is from this point that Rimmer&apos;s &quot; life &quot; is covered in Red Dwarf. In Series III in the episode Timeslides where the crew discover they can go into any photograph and change their future, Rimmer accidentally changes the past so he is no longer a hologram - he is alive. However this happiness is short-lived as he dies within minutes anyway after hitting a box that unknown to him contained explosives. He is seen in the next episode once again as a hologram. { Lister inspects Rimmer&apos;s &quot; Light Bee &quot;, the device that projects his hologram. } As a &quot; soft-light &quot; hologram, Rimmer retains his memories and physical appearance, but is composed of light and has no tangible form (other than a small &quot; light bee &quot; projection unit when away from Red Dwarf). He remains very unhappy with his lot after his death, frequently bemoaning his fate. Despite his dissatisfaction with his existence, he bitterly resists any move to turn him off. He remains as obnoxious and difficult to like for his crewmates as he was before his death, and gradually develops a pompous tendency to quote Space Corps regulations at any possible opportunity  — despite his tendency to get the numbers wrong for which Kryten often corrects him. In Series VI, he encounters a being known as Legion, who upgrades Rimmer&apos;s projection unit from &quot; soft light &quot; to &quot; hard light &quot;, giving him a physical form and the ability to interact directly with the world, in addition to making him virtually indestructible. To conserve power (more of which is required for Rimmer&apos;s hard-light hologram) he normally uses soft light, only switching to hard light when necessary. In Series VII, Rimmer is approached by a dying alternate version of himself, Ace Rimmer, who asks Rimmer to become a defender of the multiverse upon Ace&apos;s death. Although initially hesitant, Rimmer finds himself rising to the challenge and leaves to start his new life. [ Returned to life ] When Red Dwarf is restored by nanobots in Series VIII, the entire crew is restored to life as well, including Rimmer. Because he is resurrected as he was at the time of the accident, he lacks any of the growth that the &apos;other&apos; Rimmer has gone through since the series began, reverting him back to his original persona. Due to a series of events, Lister, Rimmer, Kryten, the Cat &amp; Kristine Kochanski are sentenced to two years in the ship&apos;s brig for misuse of confidential information. At the end of Series VIII, in the final episode, &quot; Only the Good... &quot;, when a chameleonic microbe destroys Red Dwarf and everyone else evacuates to a mirror universe, Rimmer is trapped on the disintegrating ship. At the end of the episode he encounters the Grim Reaper, announcing that he is dead, and then tells him that they&apos;ll travel to the River Styx, until Rimmer interrupts him ( &quot; Not today, matey! &quot; ), knees him in the groin, says &quot; Remember, only the good die young! &quot; and flees. [ Back to Earth ] In the 2009 special &quot; Red Dwarf: Back to Earth &quot; he is a hard light hologram again - how this has come about is yet to be explained. After an encounter with a female despair squid, Rimmer and the rest of the crew hallucinate an alternate reality in which they are fictional characters and their lives are just a TV show that they have somehow escaped from. On the audio commentary for the Director&apos;s Cut, when Rimmer recalls Cat&apos;s references to the despair squid, writer/director Doug Naylor says that the scene &quot; says a few interesting things about who the man with the &quot; H &quot; is on his head, &apos;cause I think it can only be one of one person &quot;. Therefore this is apparently the same Rimmer who became left the ship as Ace Rimmer in Series VII. The fate of the resurrected human Rimmer is unrevealed. [ Personality ] Rimmer&apos;s primary character traits include anal-retentiveness, over-adherence to protocol, cowardice, misogyny, and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of self-loathing, which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others. As the highest ranking survivor aboard the ship (despite being a hologram), Rimmer often deludes himself into believing that he is in charge and that he has somehow been moulding &quot; his &quot; crew into an effective spacegoing unit. { RIMMER: Captain, I&apos;ve been in effective command of Red Dwarf now for nearly four years. I&apos;ve guided that ragamuffin, ragtail crew of whacked out crazies and hippy peace-niks through hell and back. If I gave the order, those guys would crawl on their bellies across broken glass with their flies unzipped. So don&apos;t tell me I&apos;m not an officer, Captain, just because in deep space there&apos;s no academy around to award me my pips. } [ Holoship Holoship Red Dwarf Red Dwarf V 1 ] Rimmer&apos;s poor repair work on the drive plate was responsible for the radiation leak that killed the crew, and Rimmer bore the guilt of this (although he also partly blamed Lister for the accident, as he was unable to help repair the drive plate due to being in stasis at the time). However, in &quot; Justice &quot;, after Rimmer is jailed for over 9000 years for the accident, Kryten successfully argues at his appeal that Rimmer&apos;s guilt is misplaced - as a second technician (and one who &quot; couldn&apos;t outwit a used teabag &quot; ), he could not possibly have been responsible for (and indeed would not have been trusted with) work that might endanger the crew if not performed correctly. Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission. Rimmer was finally able to live his fantasy of commanding an army in the Series IV episode &quot; Meltdown &quot;, leading an army of &quot; good &quot; wax-droids against a much larger force of &quot; evil &quot; wax-droids. Although Rimmer ultimately succeeds in destroying the opposing army, his forces are completely wiped out when he uses most of them as a diversion and then has Kryten turn up the heating to melt all the droids. In addition to his fondness for militarism, elitism and Hammond organ music, Rimmer also enjoys Morris dancing and is an authority on 20th century telegraph poles, especially those observed while train spotting. Rimmer has also been attempting to learn Esperanto for eight years, but has failed miserably. Many episodes of Red Dwarf focus on the conflict between Rimmer&apos;s ego and his neuroses. In &quot; Me ² &quot;, Rimmer manages to trick Lister into generating a holograph duplicate in order to provide him with a companion; however, as a consequence of Rimmer&apos;s self-loathing, the two Rimmers are incapable of getting along, and their interaction becomes so bitter and hate-filled that the duplicate must be turned off. In &quot; Terrorform &quot;, a &quot; psi-moon &quot; sculpted to reflect Rimmer&apos;s psychological make-up becomes a desolate, swampy hell-hole dominated by Rimmer&apos;s Self-Loathing, personified as a sadistic beast, with a metaphysical graveyard marking the &quot; demise &quot; of his various virtuous qualities. Despite his cowardice, and tendency to run from any kind of danger or fight, Rimmer is the member of the crew most willing to kill, preferably in the safest and most cowardly way possible, although, due to a mixture of cowardice, and the fact that for much of the series he cannot physically harm anyone, he seldom manages to. He has; attempted to coerce Lister to shoot a dangerous Simulant in the back (bemoaning the fact that said Simulant was currently awake), suggested shooting Kryten and Lister into space when they were temporarily removed from time, and casually pushed a fellow hologram into traffic after she repeatedly threatened to have him &quot; erased &quot;. Rimmer&apos;s personality flaws are in fact almost completely a result of his hang-ups. An alternative version of Rimmer, Ace Rimmer, who was kept back a year in school, learned humility and inner strength and grew up to become a charming and well liked Space Corps test pilot, interstellar hero, and sexual seducer. [ Dimension Jump Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode) Red Dwarf Red Dwarf IV 5 ] Surprisingly, however, Rimmer is still capable of nobility, honour and love. When Red Dwarf encounters a Holoship, with an all-hologram crew composed of the &quot; best and brightest &quot;, Rimmer desperately wants to join. A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, falls in love with him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her. This act of nobility surprises even Rimmer himself. Furthermore, in the episode &quot; Out of Time &quot;, Rimmer is disgusted by his corrupt future self to the point where he&apos;d rather do battle with him than surrender. Then, when the others are killed, he frantically risks his life to bring them back. [ Appearance ] Rimmer&apos;s status as a hologram in most episodes of Red Dwarf is shown by the &quot; H &quot; on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from The Cat, such as &quot; alphabet head &quot; and &quot; goalpost head &quot;. Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair { Red Dwarf Series V, &quot; } { The Inquisitor &quot;. } relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man. { Red Dwarf series 1, &quot; } { Future Echoes &quot;. } When Lister and The Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that &quot; every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts &quot; (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying &apos;that he had hair like his, just not on his head&apos;). { Red Dwarf Series VI, &quot; } { Emohawk: Polymorph II &quot;. } Rimmer&apos;s Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer&apos;s jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special &quot; Back to Earth &quot;, Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the addition of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a quilted collar; possibly being part of a quilted under shirt which though the jacket is not removed at all during any of the 3 episodes. The hologram &quot; H &quot; on his forehead also changes from series to series: it starts as a grey colour and a blocky shape, then in Series III it becomes bright blue and reflective, then in Series V its shape is changed to a thinner and more stylised font. His &quot; H &quot; also briefly changes to a reflective red colour set inside a circle when he temporarily joins the holoship SS Enlightenment. [ Casting ] Rimmer encounters his &quot; female opposite &quot; Arlene. Among the actors who auditioned for Rimmer were Norman Lovett (who went on to play Holly instead), David Baddiel, Hugh Laurie, and Alfred Molina.

Barrie, who had originally auditioned for Lister, was familiar with Rob Grant and Doug Naylor having worked together on Son of Cliché and Spitting Image, and with the producers on Happy Families and various Jasper Carrott productions. He has appeared in all but four episodes of the show, which he missed in series VII due to scheduling conflicts.

Chris Barrie was given an offer to reprise his role, but turned it down for fear of being tied into a restrictive, long-term contract, which is common in American television production.
