[ 1956 4 4 ] { Waterville, } { Maine, } { U.S. } { 1986–present } { Television producer, writer and attorney } { Michelle Pfeiffer (1993–present) } David Edward Kelley (born April 4, 1956) is an American television writer and producer, known as the creator of Picket Fences, Chicago Hope, The Practice, Ally McBeal, Boston Public, Boston Legal and Harry&apos;s Law, as well as several films. Kelley is one of very few screenwriters to have had a show created by him run on all four of the top commercial U.S. television networks ( ABC, CBS, Fox &amp; NBC ). [ Early life ] Kelley was born in Waterville, Maine, raised in Belmont, Massachusetts and attended the Belmont Hill School. He is the son of legendary Boston University Terriers and New England Whalers hockey coach Jack Kelley { Kelley&apos;s father, Jack Kelley, was the coach of the } { Boston University } { hockey team from 1962 to 1972 and of the } { World Hockey Association &apos;s } { New England Whalers in their inaugural season of 1972-1973. } and played the game himself. Kelley was a stick boy for the Whalers during his father&apos;s time as coach { Willes, Ed. The Rebel League: The Short and Unruly Life of the World Hockey Association. Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2004. } and the captain of the hockey team at Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1979 with a degree in politics.

For his senior thesis he turned the Bill of Rights into a play. &quot; I made each amendment into a character &quot;, he said. &quot; The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won&apos;t shut up. The Second Amendment guy, all he wanted to talk about was his gun collection. Then the 10th Amendment, the one where they say leave the rest for the states to decide, he was a guy with no self-esteem. &quot; Also while at Princeton, he was a member of the Princeton Triangle Club.

He began working for a Boston law firm, mostly dealing with real estate and minor criminal cases. In 1983, while considering it only a hobby, Kelley began writing a screenplay, a legal thriller, which was optioned in 1986 and later became the Judd Nelson feature film From the Hip in 1987.

His agent sent him Kelley&apos;s movie script for From the Hip. Enthusiastic, Bochco made him a writer and story editor for the show. During this first year, Kelley kept his law office in Boston as a hedge. However, his involvement in the show only expanded. In the second year, he became executive story editor and co-producer. Finally, in 1989, Bochco stepped away from the series making Kelley the executive producer. While executive producer, Kelley received two Emmys for Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series and the show received the award for Outstanding Drama Series for both years. For the first five seasons that he was involved with the show, he wrote or co-wrote two out of three episodes. Kelley left after the fifth season in 1991 and ratings began to fall. As Newsday &apos; s TV critic wrote, &quot; The difference between good and bad L.A. Law... was David Kelley. &quot; { Levine, David E.

Expressing a desire to focus more on his production company and upcoming projects, Kelley ceased day-to-day involvement with both series in 1995, allowing others to write and produce. Towards the end of the fifth season in 1999, facing cancellation, Kelley fired most of the cast members added since he had left the show, brought back Mandy Patinkin and began writing episodes again.

The Practice would be the first of four successful series by Kelley that were set in Boston, proximal to his hometown of Belmont, Massachusetts. Receiving critical applause (along with two Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series ) but low ratings in its starting seasons, it eventually became a popular top 10 program.

The program was initially considered a modest hit but received less than glowing reviews. The previous season, Kelley stumbled with both the short-lived Snoops, his first attempt at delegating most of the responsibilities to others, and with Ally, the experiment with 30-minute shortened episodes of Ally McBeal. The TV critic from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram opined that these failures and the weaknesses he saw in Boston Public were a sign that Kelley had lost the Midas touch.

Kelley medical drama to be TNT series Chicago Tribune May 14, 2012 ] [ Methods ] [ Writing ] Kelley writes his first drafts longhand using a heavy metal Bic ballpoint and yellow legal pad. He easily churns out scripts in two to four days, initially working without collaboration, finding it faster and easier than trying to explain what he wants to others. Kelley has been criticised for not delegating. A Picket Fences writer described his time on the show as &quot; the most boring period of my life—you&apos;d write a scene... [and Kelley would] rewrite it completely. Or he just cut you out completely—you learned nothing. Having a writing staff was a needless expense for the network. &quot; { Tucker, Kissing Bill O&apos;Reilly, Roasting Miss Piggy: 100 Things to Love And Hate About TV. p. 4 } Kelley gradually became more comfortable bringing in writers for ideas and taking over writing responsibilities. Kelley described this as a natural evolution: [ There&apos;s a period at the beginning of a series [when] you&apos;re doing most of the writing and then you go through another period where you have the ideas and you&apos;re assigning those stories and ideas to other people and hopefully they execute them. Then if you&apos;re lucky you get a staff where they come into the room with their own ideas and specific takes on how to execute them and they do. ] [ Story elements ] Kelley structures his episodes with multiple storylines. An episode may include a self contained subplot plus other story arcs that either began in a previous episode or will continue subsequently—some will continue the entire season. The viewer is thereby rarely sure whether what appears as a simple incident will blossom into a major plot point. { Ellis, Seeing Things: Television in an Age of Uncertainty p 123 } Kelley seeds his plots with political and social &quot; hot-button &quot; issues. One method is by introducing provocative legal cases. Episodes have covered the gamut of contemporary issues from the culpability of tobacco companies and gun makers to assisted-suicide crusaders. [ September 20, 1999 Millman, Joyce http://www.salon.com/ent/col/mill/1999/09/20/kelley/ Kelleyvision Salon.com 2007-03-31 ] Another way is by undergirding the character&apos;s social interrelationships with serious explorations such as feminism, sexuality and divorce.

Kelley Likes Stirring the Pot ABC News 2007-04-01 ] Instead of lessons, Kelley strives to &quot; raise moral and ethical questions without easy answers. &quot; He avoids a didactic narrative by not losing sight of the audience&apos;s desire to be entertained. { Orlik, Electronic Media Criticism: : Applied Perspectives, p. 125 } He states: [ June 12, 1995 Coe Steve The dramatic license of David Kelley. Broadcasting &amp; Cable ] Instead of taking clear stands on issues, Kelley creates scenarios meant to challenge audience preconceptions. For example an episode of Ally McBeal dealt with a female employee who sued for sexual harassment because she noticed that other prettier women were being promoted. There was deliberately no clear point of view. Kelley uses humor and the surreal and mixes tragedy with farce. He describes his strategy as follows: [ Often we try to seduce the audience at the beginning that this is going to be fun, a romp or a ride, and then once the ride has begun, to reveal some serious subject matter for them to think about. Levine, David E Kelley: The Man Behind Ally McBeal. p. 31 ] In Ally McBeal, Kelley utilized two techniques: a voiceover providing an interior monologue for the title character, and Walter Mitty fantasy sequences (ala Dream On as critics have noted) giving a humorous and often deeply honest (but sometimes ironic) explanation of the character&apos;s inner thoughts. { Levine, David E Kelley: The Man Behind Ally McBeal. pp. 60-61 } [ September 10, 1997 Carter, Bill http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9B02E6DB1539F933A2575AC0A961958260 Looks Like a Hit The New York Times 2007-04-09 ] [ March 18, 1998 Jefferson, Margo http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9F06EEDF1039F93BA25750C0A96E958260 You Want to Slap Ally McBeal, but Do You Like Her? The New York Times 2007-04-10 ] [ Crossover episodes ] Kelley frequently crossed the cast of different shows. One crossover program event (which crossed networks also) involved characters from Kelley&apos;s Ally McBeal on the Fox network appearing on his ABC show, The Practice, and, in turn, The Practice characters appeared on Ally McBeal. This was done in spite of the two shows&apos; different tones (one a comedy, the other a drama). { Caldwell, Television After TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition, p. 64 } This crossover was partially credited for raising ratings for The Practice, which it sustained after those episodes. Kelley repeated this maneuver with his Boston Public, Ally McBeal, and Boston Legal shows. Thereafter, many other crossovers occurred including shows not created by Kelley. Kelley&apos;s most elaborate crossover was only partially successful. He sought to crossover an episode of his Picket Fences with Chris Carter&apos;s The X-Files. Both shows aired Friday nights, but on different networks. The intent was to begin the story on one show, then hope viewers would switch channels to watch the conclusion on another network. CBS balked, and both scripts were rewritten, with Files Fox Mulder no longer set to appear on Fences. Yet, both episodes deal with Wisconsin and cows, with Fences referencing an FBI investigation in a neighboring town. CBS blurred the connection further by postponing the Fences episode by one week. [ Holbrook Thom http://www.poobala.com/picketandxfiles.html Picket Fences and The X-Files Thom Holbrook&apos;s Crossover &amp; Spin Offs July 15, 2011 ] [ Casting ] Kelley often uses regular actors from older shows in newer shows, and vice versa. For example, Anthony Heald and Rene Auberjonois both played judges on The Practice, and both went on to be regular cast members in later shows (Heald on Boston Public as a vice-principal and Auberjonois on Boston Legal as a partner at a law firm). Both Kathy Baker and Justin Shenkarow (Picket Fences) have been used in Boston Public. Kathy Baker as Meredith &quot; The Hook Lady &quot; Peters and Justin Shenkarow as the student Warren Dickson. In addition many actors who either had the main roles or major roles in Kelley&apos;s previous shows would make at least one guest appearance in Boston Legal. [ Disappearing Characters and Plot Lines ] Kelley&apos;s shows often have radical plot and character changes that are not explained, which can lead to a show quickly dropping in the ratings. For example, in Ally McBeal, Ally&apos;s roommate, who was a key cast member for the first two seasons, suddenly disappears without explanation and is never spoken of again. This happened again with the second season of Harry&apos;s Law, where they location is changed and two main cast member depart the show. It has been said by fans and critics that season two, wasn&apos;t better than season one and the show had lost its quirkiness. [ Legal profession ] The Practice was considered more accurate in its portrayal of the law than L.A. Law or Ally McBeal. The importance of legal strategy sometimes at the expense of the truth rang true. One attorney said, &quot; [I]t&apos;s really about the tactics and the mistakes that opposing counsel makes. &quot; Judges were represented as complex, less-than-perfect human beings, sometimes with emotional problems. Plots demonstrated how a defendant&apos;s personality would impact the adjudication of a case. [ May 3, 2001 Speier, Michael http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117798572.html?categoryid%3D1048%26amp%3Bcs%3D1%26amp%3Bquery%3DDavid%2BE.%2BKelley%2B Attorneys quick to offer reality check Variety 2007-04-02 ] Stuart Levine of Variety magazine said, &quot; [The Practice] isn&apos;t afraid to paint the firm&apos;s clients as the dregs of society. &quot; Kelley said, [ One of the most fundamental questions people have about defense attorneys is, &apos;How can you do that? How can you go to bat every day for a person whom you may not know is guilty but you have a pretty good idea that he&apos;s not so innocent? ] Other aspects of the legal profession in Kelley&apos;s shows have been criticized as unrealistic. Attorneys have complained that: Ex parte meetings (where lawyers meet in a judge&apos;s chambers without opposing counsel present) do not happen, Judges would not allow attorneys to badger or attack witnesses, His shows overplayed prosecutorial and law enforcement misconduct, The time required to select and empanel a jury is never shown and is not allowed for in the story&apos;s timeline, and Many of the cases would never have made it to trial. [ Women ] When the program Ally McBeal first ran, many women lauded its portrayal of the lead character. Sharon Waxman, writing for The Washington Post, commented that Kelley had a keen insight into the human nature of both men and women. She quoted Dyan Cannon : &quot; This man understands the way a woman thinks,... the complex ways we&apos;ve found to hide our fears. &quot; [ Waxman Sharon Sharon Waxman America Follows His Script The Washington Post G.01 February 22, 1998 http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/26542008.html?dids%3D26542008%3A26542008%26amp%3BFMT%3DABS%26amp%3BFMTS%3DABS%3AFT%26amp%3Bdate%3DFeb%2B22%2C%2B1998%26amp%3Bauthor%3DSharon%2BWaxman%26amp%3Bpub%3DThe%2BWashington%2BPost%26amp%3Bedition%3D%26amp%3Bstartpage%3DG.01%26amp%3Bdesc%3DAmerica%2BFollows%2BHis%2BScript ] A New York Times writer used the character as an example of a strong television woman&apos;s role, [ December 18, 1997 Sterngold, James http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9E06EFD8133FF93BA25751C1A961958260 Strong Women in TV?

Time 2007-04-10 Ginia Bellafante ] In response, author Erica Jong felt that the Time journalist diminished her argument by using only pop-cultural references and ignoring the majority of real-world women who have made significant progress. [ Jong Erica Erica Jong Ally McBeal and Time Magazine Can&apos;t Keep the Good Women Down The New York Observer 19 July 13, 1998 http://www.ericajong.com/nyobserver980713.htm ] Writing in Salon.com, Joyce Millman disputed that Ally McBeal should even be described as a &quot; women&apos;s show &quot; -- that its representations of women were, in fact, a male fantasy. She felt that Kelley treated his female characters &quot; sadistically &quot; in general, beginning all the way back to L.A. Law, saving only The Practice for positive remarks. What can&apos;t be denied is that Kelley&apos;s Ally McBeal was hugely successful in attracting the 18-to-34-year-old women audience demographic. The New York Times columnist, Maureen Dowd, quoted two young, professional women saying they liked shows with female characters like themselves, single, even obsessed. Dowd quoted the executive producer of Law &amp; Order, Dick Wolf, &quot; I think there is a wish-fulfillment factor when you put an attractive woman in a situation where she is doing real, adult stuff. &quot; [ July 22, 1998 Dowd, Maureen http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9B00E7DB1639F931A15754C0A96E958260 Liberties; She-TV, Me-TV The New York Times 2008-03-26 Maureen Dowd ] [ Public education ] Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, writing in the New York Times, praises Kelley&apos;s series Boston Public as an attempt to both reflect and change public opinion about public education, particularly the urban, overcrowded, underfinanced variety. He liked the realism of the setting, the mixed ethnicity of the faculty and (ofttimes antipathetic) student body and the bureaucratic struggles. He criticized Kelley, though, for pandering to stereotypes of teachers and students and for failing to show successful teaching strategies. [ December 17, 2000 Freedman, Samuel G. http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9C05E6D6133FF934A25751C1A9669C8B63 A Report Card for &apos;Boston Public&apos;: A&apos;s and F&apos;s The New York Times 2008-03-26 Samuel G. Freedman ] [ Medicine ] In The New York Times, Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, felt that medical drama s such as Kelley&apos;s Chicago Hope do a good job of addressing bioethical issues such as who should receive a liver transplant or when should a patient be allowed to die. However, there is a lack of discussion concerning the primary money issue: &quot; How do people pay for this? &quot; [ December 15, 1996 Dreifus, Claudia http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9805EFD9163FF936A25751C1A960958260 Who gets the liver transplant? Which one&apos;s the mother? When do you lie? (And those are the easy ones) The New York Times 2007-04-08 ] The show has been criticized for presenting a one-sided view of managed care, portraying HMOs as dramatically evil while glossing over the complexities. Doctors are too often shown as selfless patient advocates ready to battle whatever the financial cost.

The New York Times 2007-04-08 ] [ Catholicism ] Kelley has incorporated religious subject matter from the beginning, including issues involving Protestantism, Judaism, Scientology and Catholicism among others. With the widespread media coverage of child sexual abuse cases in the Roman Catholic Church during the mid-to-late 1990s, Kelley began to introduce this controversy into his scripts. For instance, the character Bobby Donnell on The Practice, a Catholic, became personally estranged from the Church over the issue of sexually abusive priests. While the conservative Catholic League didn&apos;t have an issue with this episode, [ November 7, 2002 Carter, Bill http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9C00EFD7113EF934A35752C1A9649C8B63 A Catholic Writer Brings His Anger to &apos;The Practice&apos; The New York Times 2008-03-26 ] they frequently complained of anti-Catholic bias in Kelley&apos;s shows because of his references to this subject.
