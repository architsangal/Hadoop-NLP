The Libertarian National Convention is held every two years by the United States Libertarian Party to choose members of the Libertarian National Committee, and to conduct other party business. In presidential election years, the convention delegates enact a platform and nominate the Libertarian presidential and vice-presidential candidates who then face the nominees of other parties in the November general election. While most delegates to the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention are tied to particular candidates, delegates to the Libertarian National Convention are free to choose, as was previously the case for the larger parties. Accordingly, Libertarian National Conventions place less emphasis on festivities and spinning the press, though some of each may be found. The complete convention is televised by C-SPAN with additional broadcast television coverage of the presidential nominating process. Perhaps the most interesting difference between Libertarian National Conventions and those of the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States is that the Libertarian Party has not and refuses to accept taxpayer money to pay for its convention. [ May 2008 ] This is in keeping with Libertarian principles that taxation is coerced (i.e. not voluntary) and, therefore, theft; it is considered an &quot; ethical violation &quot; for a good Libertarian who adheres to the Non-Aggression Principle to knowingly commit theft. [ May 2008 ] None of the above is always an option on all ballots. [ Past conventions ] [ March 2010 ] [ 1972 ] The first Libertarian National Convention was held in 1972 in Denver, Colorado.
