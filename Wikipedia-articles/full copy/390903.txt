Historical marker where the Rush-Bagot Agreement was made in Washington, D.C. The Rush–Bagot Treaty was a treaty between the United States and Britain limiting naval armaments on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, following the War of 1812. It was ratified by the United States Senate on April 16, 1818., [ Norton Mary Beth A People and a Nation 2001 Houghton Mifflin Company Boston 0-618-00550-1 246 ] and has been confirmed by Canada, following Confederation in 1867. The treaty provided for a large demilitarization of lakes along the international boundary, where many British naval arrangements and forts remained. The treaty stipulated that the United States and British North America could each maintain one military vessel (no more than 100 tons burden) as well as one cannon (no more than eighteen pounds) on Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. The remaining Great Lakes permitted the United States and British North America to keep two military vessels &quot; of like burden &quot; on the waters armed with &quot; like force &quot;. The treaty, and the separate Treaty of 1818, laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary between the U.S. and British North America.

After the terms of the notes were agreed upon by Rush and Bagot, the Rush-Bagot Agreement was unofficially recognized by both countries. On April 6, 1818, it was submitted to the United States Senate and formally ratified on April 16, 1818. The treaty eventually led to the Treaty of Washington of 1871, which completed disarmament. The United States and Canada agreed in 1946, through an exchange of diplomatic notes, that the stationing of naval vessels for training purposes was permissible provided each government was fully notified in advance. In 2004, the U.S. Coast Guard decided to arm 11 of its small cutters stationed on Lake Erie and Lake Huron with M240 7.62 mm machine gun s. The American decision was based on a climbing number of smuggling operations as well as the increased threat of terrorist activity after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Canadian government decided that the armament did not violate the treaty, as the guns were to be used for law enforcement rather than military activities. Canada reserved the right to arm its vessels ( Canadian Coast Guard ) with similar weapons. { http://www.journaltimes.com/articles/2006/03/11/local/iq_3947488.txt } [ Military Installations ] { Stone Frigate, } { Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Ontario } The Stone Frigate, located at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, was constructed during 1820 to store part of the dismantled British fleet from the War of 1812, which had been dismantled pursuant to the Rush-Bagot Treaty of 1818. { Gilbert Collins Guidebook to the Historic Sites of the War of 1812 p. 201 } There are still military facilities near or next to the Great Lakes: [ York ] Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station - Niagara Falls, New York LFCATC Meaford, Meaford, Ontario CFB Trenton, Trenton, Ontario CFB Kingston, Kingston, Ontario Canadian Maritime Command Reserve base - Toronto, Ontario Selfridge Air National Guard Base - Harrison Township, Michigan CFD Mountain View - Prince Edward County, Ontario Land Force Central Area HQ - Toronto, Ontario Denison Armoury - Toronto, Ontario Canadian Forces College - Toronto, Ontario Royal Military College - Kingston, Ontario Four Mile Point Live Firing Range - Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario Duluth Air National Guard Base - Duluth, Minnesota Finland Air Force Station - Finland, Minnesota Minneapolis Armory - Minneapolis, Minnesota Wisconsin Air National Guard - General Mitchell International Airport - Milwaukee Camp Perry - Port Clinton, Ohio Empire Air Force Station - Empire, Michigan Grand Marais Air Force Station - Grand Marais, Michigan Port Austin Air Force Station, Port Austin, Michigan Sault Sainte Marie Air Force Station - Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan [ Outcome ] The border between the US and British North America was demilitarized, including the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.
