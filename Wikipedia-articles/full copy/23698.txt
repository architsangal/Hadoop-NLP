[ July 2008 ] The International Fixed calendar (also known as the Cotsworth plan, the Eastman plan, the 13 Month calendar or the Equal Month calendar) is a solar calendar proposal for calendar reform designed by Moses B. Cotsworth, who presented it in 1902. { Moses B. Cotsworth, The rational almanac: tracing the evolution of modern almanacs from ancient ideas of time, and suggesting improvements (Acomb, England:Cotsworth, 1905) } It provides for a year of 13 months of 28 days each, with one or two days a year belonging to no month or week. It is therefore a perennial calendar, with every date fixed always on the same weekday. Though it was never officially adopted in any country, it was the official calendar of the Eastman Kodak Company from 1928 to 1989. { Exhibit at } { George Eastman House, viewed June 2008 } [ Rules ] The calendar year has 13 months with 28 days each, divided into exactly 4 weeks [(13 * 28) = 364]. An extra day added as a holiday at the end of the year, sometimes called &quot; Year Day, &quot; brings the total to 365 days. Each year coincides with the corresponding Gregorian year, so January 1 in the Cotsworth calendar always falls on Gregorian January 1. { See the table in Cotsworth, Rational Almanac, p. i. } Twelve months are named and ordered the same as those of the Gregorian calendar, except that the extra month is inserted between June and July, and called Sol. Situated in mid-summer, the name of the new month was chosen in homage to the sun. { Cotsworth suggested &quot; Mid &quot; as an alternative name. See his address in Royal Society of Canada, Proceedings and Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, 3d series, vol. II (Ottawa: James Hope &amp; Son, 1908), pp. 211-41 at 231. } But it escaped notice that the sun&apos;s prominence around June and July holds for the Northern hemisphere only. Leap year in the International Fixed Calendar conatins 366 days, and its occurrence follows the Gregorian rule. There is a leap year in every year whose number is evenly divisible by 4, but not if the year number is evenly divisible by 100, unless it is also evenly divisible by 400. So although the year 2000 was a leap year, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were common years. The International Fixed Calendar inserts the extra day in leap year after June 28th and before Sol 1st. Each month begins on a Sunday, and ends on a Saturday; consequently, every year begins on Sunday. All the months look like this: Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The 13 months and extra days occur on the following Gregorian dates: Month Starts Ends January January 1 January 28 February January 29 February 25 March February 26 March 25* April March 26* April 22* May April 23* May 20* June May 21* June 17* Leap Day June 17 Sol June 18 July 15 July July 16 August 12 August August 13 September 9 September September 10 October 7 October October 8 November 4 November November 5 December 2 December December 3 December 30 Year Day December 31 * These dates are a day earlier in a leap year. [ History ] The simple idea of a 13-month perennial calendar has been around since at least the middle of the 18th century. Versions of the idea differ mainly on how the months are named, and the treatment of the extra day in leap year. The &apos;&apos;Georgian calendar&apos;&apos; was proposed in 1745 by an American Colonist from Maryland writing under the pen name, Hirossa Ap-Iccim (= Rev. Hugh Jones ). { Hirossa Ap-Iccim, &quot; An Essay on the British Computation of Time, Coins, Weights, and Measures &quot; The Gentleman’s Magazine, 15 (1745): 377-379 } The author named the plan, and the thirteenth month, after King George II of Great Britain. The 365th day each year was to be set aside as Christmas. The treatment of leap year varied from the Gregorian rule, however; and the year would begin closer to the winter solstice. In a later version of the plan, published in 1753, the 13 months were all renamed for Christian saints. In 1849 the French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798–1857) proposed the 13-month Positivist Calendar, naming the months: Moses, Homer, Aristotle, Archimedes, Caesar, St. Paul, Charlemagne, Dante, Gutenberg, Shakespeare, Descartes, Frederic and Bichat. The days of the year were likewise dedicated to &quot; saints &quot; in the Positivist Religion of Humanity. Positivist weeks, months, and years begin with Monday instead of Sunday. Comte also reset the year number, beginning the era of his calendar (year 1) with the Gregorian year 1789. For the extra days of the year not belonging to any week or month, Comte followed the pattern of Ap-Iccim (Jones), ending each year with a festival on the 365th day, followed by a subsequent feast day occurring only in leap years. Whether Moses Cotsworth was familiar with the 13-month plans that preceded his International Fixed Calendar is not known. He did follow Ap-Iccim (Jones) in designating the 365th day of the year as Christmas. His suggestion was that this last day of the year should be designated a Sunday, and hence, because the following day would be New Year&apos;s Day and a Sunday also, he called it a Double Sunday. { Cotsworth, The Rational Almanac, p. i. } Since Cotsworth&apos;s goal was a simplified, more &quot; rational &quot; calendar for business and industry, he would carry over all the features of the Gregorian calendar consistent with this goal, including the traditional month names, the week beginning on Sunday, and the Gregorian leap-year rule. To promote Cotsworth&apos;s calendar reform The International Fixed Calendar League was founded in 1923, just after the plan was selected by the League of Nations as the best of 130 calendar proposals put forward. { Duncan Steel, Marking Time: The Epic Quest to Invent the Perfect Calendar (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000), p. 309. } Sir Sandford Fleming, the inventor and driving force behind worldwide adoption of standard time, became the first president of the IFCL. { Moses Bruine Cotsworth, Calendar Reform (London: The International Fixed Calendar League, 1927), Preface. } The League opened offices in London and later in Rochester, New York. George Eastman, of the Eastman Kodak Company, became a fervent supporter of the IFC, and instituted its use at Kodak. The International Fixed Calendar League ceased operations shortly after the calendar plan failed to win final approval of the League of Nations in 1937. { See Journal of Calendar Reform vol. 16, no. 4 (1944): 165-66 } [ Advantages ] The several advantages of The International Fixed Calendar are mainly related to its organization. Every year has exactly 52 weeks divided in 13 months. Each month has exactly 28 days divided in 4 weeks. The calendar is the same every year (perennial), unlike the annual Gregorian calendar, which differs from year to year. Hence, scheduling is easier for institutions and industries with extended production cycles. Every day of the month falls on the same weekday in each month &amp; #151;the 17th always falls on a Tuesday, for example. Statistical comparisons by months are more accurate, since all months contain exaclty the same number of business days and weekends; likewise for comparisons by 13-week quarters. Thirteen equal divisions of the year are superior to twelve unqual divisions in terms of monthly cash flow in the economy, or so supporters of the IFC argued. See Frank Parker Stockbridge, &quot; New Calendar by 1933 &amp; #151;Eastman, &quot; Popular Science Monthly (June 1929): 32, 131-33; and George Eastman, &quot; The Importance of Calendar Reform to the World of Business, &quot; Nation&apos;s Business (May 1926): p. 42, 46. [ Disadvantages ] For the superstitious, a disadvantage to this format is that every month includes a Friday the 13th, and this date occurs thirteen times every year. Thirteen, being prime, is not evenly divisible, putting all activities currently done on a quarterly basis out of alignment with the months; each quarter would be 13 weeks instead. Several religious groups oppose any interruption of the seven-weekday sequence. { Joseph Hertz, Calendar Reform } [ See also ] World Calendar Leap week calendar Calendar Reform [ Notes ] [ External links ] Article on the International Fixed Calendar League at the International Institute of Social History Archives.
