From 1998 until her election to Parliament, she worked as a barrister. In 1995, she began a live-in relationship with a man forty years her senior, then dean of law at Melbourne University, Colin Howard. The relationship ended in 2001, however they remained close until his death in 2011. Her relationship with Howard was later the subject of a bitter dispute between Mirabella and Howard&apos;s adult children.

She was president of the Melbourne University Liberal Club, vice-president of the Australian Liberal Students Federation, a delegate to the Liberal Party State Council of Victoria and is also a member of numerous Policy Assembly Committees. She became well known during the debate on Australia becoming a republic as a prominent advocate for retaining the constitutional monarchy, and was an elected member of the 1998 Constitutional Convention. Prior to her preselection as the Liberal candidate to succeed Lou Lieberman as the member for Indi, Mirabella spent some time working as a barrister in Wangaratta, despite being based on Melbourne. Mirabella received a well above-average 5.6% swing to her in the 2004 federal election, giving her 66.3% of the two-party preferred vote and making Indi one of the safest Liberal seats in the country. In 2005, she attracted public attention as a key member of an informal &quot; ginger group &quot; of Liberal backbenchers. She chaired this group with Victorian Senator Mitch Fifield. The group argued for &quot; tax reform &quot; (in essence, tax cuts paid for by reductions in government spending), sparking public debate on the topic. On the prominent issue of asylum seekers, she attacked fellow Liberal backbenchers Petro Georgiou and Judi Moylan, labelling them &quot; political terrorists &quot; for defying government policy on mandatory detention and threatening to hijack the government&apos;s agenda by voting down the proposals in Parliament. She was rebuffed soon after, as Prime Minister John Howard agreed to meet some of their concerns and recommendations. In August 2005 she called for Muslim women to be required to remove their head dress when posing for photo identification. Mirabella has been an advocate of voluntary student unionism (VSU) since her Liberal student days and has strongly supported the legislation which prohibited universities from forcing their students to join student unions and pay &quot; services fees &quot; to them. Mirabella was re-elected in the 2010 election and is Shadow Minister for Innovation, Industry and Science. { http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/parl/43/Shadow/index.htm } [ Criticism of former Liberal Party leader ] In January 2008, Mirabella launched an attack on former Liberal Party Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, after a speech he gave at Melbourne University on &quot; the Bush Administration (reversing) 60 years of progress in establishing a law-based international system &quot;, claiming errors and &quot; either intellectual sloppiness or deliberate dishonesty &quot;, and that he tacitly supports Islamic fundamentalism, should have no influence on foreign policy, and that his stance on the war on terror has left him open to caricature as a &quot; frothing-at-the-mouth leftie &quot;.

Christie, Aboriginal People in Colonial Victoria, 1835–86, pp. 175–176. } [ Gillard-Gaddafi Comparison ] On 2 March 2011, Mirabella compared the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard to Muammar Gaddafi, claiming that both were delusional.
