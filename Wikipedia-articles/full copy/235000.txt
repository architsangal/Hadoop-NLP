The term &quot; Most Valuable Player &quot; is typically only used in Canada, the United States, the Philippines and South Korea. In many sports, some MVP awards are presented just for a specific game or match (in other words, a man of the match award), while others are awarded based on an entire season or year. The gender neutral term &quot; Player of the Match &quot; is usually substituted for &quot; Man of the Match &quot; in women&apos;s team competitions. { See for example 2007 FIFA Women&apos;s World Cup Final } Specific North American examples include (first regular season, then playoffs): Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award, World Series Most Valuable Player Award, and League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award National Football League Most Valuable Player Award and Super Bowl MVP Award National Hockey League Hart Memorial Trophy (regular season) and Conn Smythe Trophy (playoffs) National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award and Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Award Major League Soccer MVP and MLS Cup MVP One award commonly referred to as an &quot; MVP &quot; award, despite the fact that its official name does not match the &quot; MVP &quot; initialism: NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player Award &apos;In Cricket&apos; Most valuable player rating by cricketworld.com World Cricket Indian Premier League, Most valuable player in IPL In the Australian Football League, the term &quot; best and fairest &quot; is more commonly used than &quot; most valuable player &quot; for the equivalent award on a season basis, and &quot; best on ground &quot; (BOG) is more commonly used for a single-match award.
