There are 13 high schools under the domain of the local education authority, 12 of which are either comprehensive, foundation or voluntary-aided, and one city academy. A number of successful independent schools, including St Benedict&apos;s School (co-ed), St Augstine&apos;s Priory (girls) and Notting Hill &amp; Ealing High School (girls), are also located within the borough. The controversial King Fahd Academy is an independent Saudi funded school within the borough.

The BME (black and minority ethnic) peoples make up approximately 40% of the borough&apos;s population, comprising particularly South Asians (about 20%), African and Caribbean (about 10%) and Chinese and other Asian (about 5%). As well as being ethnically diverse, Ealing is also home to various religions with substantial followers, higher than the typical London average. Christianity makes up the largest religious group with 50%, whilst Islam has 10%, Sikhism 8.5%, and Hinduism 7.8% The remaining 24% were not religious, or chose not to state their faith. In 2006 the borough was said to have &quot; one of the largest Polish communities in the country &quot;. { Ealing Times, 21st August 2006, Eighth Celebration of Polish Culture, Ealingtimes.co.uk } [ Community ] The borough has a long-standing Irish community. This is particularly visible through the number of Irish pubs in the borough and the popularity of Gaelic games within the community. County flags for example, can be seen flown on the outside or hung inside of various pubs in the area. Additionally the former towns of Ealing and Acton has a large Polish community. This owes its origins to the World War II refugees from Poland finding both cheap accommodation and work in the Acton area, which back then had a lot a light engineering companies busy with government war contracts. The Polish community has grown considerably since Poland joined the EU and its migrant workers have been able to come to the UK freely. This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of Polish orientated shops and social centres in the borough and has seen a rise in the demand for places at local primary schools. In the last decade the community has spread increasingly into Ealing. In Southall, which lays the west side of the borough is a very large South Asian community often described as &quot; Little India &quot;.
