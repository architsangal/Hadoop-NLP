Selfridge was founded in 1911. The population was 160 at the 2010 census. Sub-Divisions near this city include Chadwick, ND and Porcupine, North Dakota. [ Geography ] Selfridge is located at [ 46.042028 -100.924673 type:city_region:US dms inline ]. [ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 0.3 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ School System ] The Selfridge Public School District system consists of two main school buildings. Selfridge Elementary serves grades K-6. The high school serves grades 7-12. The school system enrolls a little less than 100 kids.The schools were built in the 1950s to replace the old main school house. The elementary school was once a private school for the St. Philomena Catholic Church. [ Local Business ] The city is now served by the Farmers Union (or Cenex), Branding Iron Bar &amp; Steakhouse, USDA ( United States Department of Agriculture ), Cedar Soil Conservation, and the community elevators. [ History ] [ section May 2011 ] Selfridge was settled in 1911 along a Milwaukee Road branch line that diverged from the railroad&apos;s Pacific Extension transcontinental route in McLaughlin, South Dakota and ran to New England, North Dakota. [ Wick Douglas A. Selfridge (Sioux County) http://www.webfamilytree.com/North_Dakota_Place_Names/S/selfridge_%28sioux_county%29.htm North Dakota Place Names 7 May 2011 ] The first depot was a stationary boxcar moved into Selfridge in 1917 by the railroad on a flatcar; G.E. Langbein became the first depot agent. The boxcar-depot was in pretty deplorable condition upon arrival; it took quite a bit of work to fix it up. In the early days, trains were used extensively, for long distance travel by Selfridge residents and continued until the later 40&apos;s. Selfridge was dependent on the railroad in the early years. Everything came in by train: groceries, lumber, fruit, coal, meat, machinery, mail and even ice. The town shipped all its produce out by train also. Again, the mail, livestock, grain dairy products etc. The trains were a vital part of Selfridge as a growing community. The first business, a general store, was started in 1911, followed shortly by the Sioux Lumber Company later in 1911. This made for access to building supplies for other businesses and homes which followed. Some of the first homes were crude shanties until the residents could later build their homes, such as the J.K. Wead home and the B.L. Smestad home. These are still being lived in by families today. Farmers came to the Selfridge area hoping to make their fortune in flax. The area was open range and cattle had to be herded day and night. The area had good farming ground and excellent ranching hills. Horses were used for pulling wagons and for farming and most of the prairie was broken up with walking plows.Travel was slow and difficult due to crude prairie trails and lack of roads. Good roads weren&apos;t really built until the 1930s when W.P.A. was put into effect. The roads were then built with horses and crude machinery. For the first eight years after it was founded, Selfridge existed as an unorganized community without the benefit of municipal ordinances and local supervision—a real &quot; wild west &quot; sort of environment. Before they incorporated to become a village, the residents of Selfridge fought a losing struggle to have Selfridge designated as the county seat before Sioux County became separated from Morton County. History repeated itself, when again in the 1950s the residents tried to have the county seat relocated from Fort Yates to Selfridge because it is more centrally located. Both times were disappointing defeats. In 1925, the City of Selfridge boasted 51 homes and 63 business places.It contained 2 churches, 4 schools, 3 elevators, 2 garages, 3 implementdealers, 4 filling stations, 2 welding shops, 1 long distance phone, 1 lawyer,1 pool hall, 2 banks, 1 public hall, 1 picture show, 4 general stores, 3grocery and meat stores, 1 blacksmith shop, 1 feed barn, 1 rooming house, 2restaurants, 4 real estate offices, 2 oil stations, 1 hotel, 1 hardware, 1newspaper, 1 drug store, 1 barber shop, 2 cream stations, 3 contractors, 1painter, 2 lumber yards, 2 confectioneries, 1 millinery shop, and 1 electric andpower &amp; light company. By 1930 the town had more than doubled its population. We can honestly say thecommunity of Selfridge was a bustling, thriving place to live. The peoplesupported their community one hundred percent. Everything was purchased at home—from machinery, cars, groceries, clothing, fuel, building supplies etc. Nobody went out of town to patronize another community. This is what gave Selfridge its vitality. The roads and mode of travel were not conducive to buying away from home. About the only way things were purchased away from home was through the Sears and Roebuck Catalog. Organizations and groups were formed with all members supporting and maintaining the group to its fullest potential. During the depression years of the thirties, many local men and area farmerssupported their families by working on W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration). The pay was anywhere from $25 to $42 per month depending on the type of work and job and whether the men furnished their own teams of horses. Our city park was started and planted with grass and trees. The City Auditorium was built and sidewalks installed. National Youth Association (NYA) gave many of our young people jobs. They earned $6.00 a month. As the town grew, fire became its greatest hazard. A volunteer fire departmenthas always been in existence in Selfridge, but never formerly organized until1973. Balls and fundraisers were held often to raise money for equipment. Manyof the Selfridge business places and homes have been lost to major firesthrough the years. Always the people rallied and rebuilt. More evidence of thefortitude the Selfridgites possessed. Prairie fires through the years havethreatened the very existence of Selfridge. As the years progressed, so did the modernization of travel and roads. Peoplewere soon able to jump into modern fast moving vehicles and get to theirdestination with not much time lost. Because of cars, trucks, tractors, and upto date machinery, we no longer needed horses and soon the village blacksmithand harness repair shops disappeared. Soon came the discontinuance of passengertrain service because cars were so much more convenient. When rail freightservice was no longer available our city dray line was no longer needed. Thelist could go on of the businesses lost to modernization. In the early years of the 1940s bumper crops were harvested around the countryside of Selfridge. The farmers enjoyed a chance to take a breath withoutwondering where the next meal was coming from as in the previous ten years.They hauled their grain into 3 self-operating elevators in Selfridge. Businessin town flourished and once again building and remodeling could be seen everywhere. Just as fast as Selfridge recovered from the depression, it was hitby the war years. Research proves that people in Selfridge worked together and everyone did more than 100% to help the war effort and bring peace in the world again. Farming practices in the Selfridge area have changed drastically over the past100 years—trash cover on summer fallow, a faster coverage of all stages of farming including seeding, summer fallow, harvesting, etc., as well aschemicals used on weed and insect control, seed variety and treatment. TheCedar Soil Conservation Office should be given credit here as they assisted indam, dugouts, dike building, planning, surveying and financially. Modernfarming practices have cut down on farm labor costs but increased in farmmanagement costs. Farmers and ranchers now spend long hours with thecalculators and computers figuring out how to get the best production for theleast cost. An adequate supply of good water is essential to the growth and development ofany town or city. The years during the 50&apos;s saw the most progress of Selfridgesince its beginning. Once again, through research, it was found that theCity Council worked diligently to bring about the water and sewer system to the City of Selfridge. Our leading well driller, George Walker Jr., has to be given credit for the important role he played during this project. Also, not to be forgotten, was the long awaited day of blacktopping all the streets of Selfridge. Farmers and townspeople alike worked for the successful completion of this project. Here again, the Blotske Brothers Construction helped in making this project the success it was. These improvements are today taken for granted, but had we all been a part of Selfridge during those years, we would realize what an asset these projects are and would be more appreciative of them. In the late 50&apos;s and early 60&apos;s, Selfridge hit its peak population. Muchconstruction and building was going on in this area. This meant jobs forpeople, families moving into our town and maintaining our school and supportingour businesses. The building of the Five Star Cheese Plant also meant jobs forpeople in our community and an outlet for the product of the dairy farmer. Bythe 1970s the Selfridge population started going down as did the population of most small towns. People were better able to purchase away from home at a cheaper price. The small town businesses could not buy in the large quantities and therefore, their prices remained higher causing people to buy away from home. Business at home fell off and right on the heels of that came the closing doors of many business places. That, we know all too well, means loss of jobs. And the young people started leaving the community. During the later years of 1970 it was even feared by the community that it might have to close the doors on its school. This was the trend across the whole country—people moving from rural to urban settings. But, the &quot; Spirit of Selfridge &quot; prevailed through all the low times of itsshort life. Now young people are again building homes and so are the oldergeneration in their retirement years. Young people are taking over existingbusiness places and starting new ones. Our students are trying their wings andreturning to the &quot; old home town &quot; to seek employment or to try a new enterprise.Organizations are forming, with members are once again supporting and workingtogether for the success of the group as a whole. The transitory employees whopass through Selfridge, such as teachers, government workers, southerncombiners, have always remarked on the friendliness of the community and thespirit it possesses. [ Recreation ] Froelich Dam is the city&apos;s number one hotspot for recreational activities such as inner tubing, boating, fishing, canoeing, and swimming. The city has one park that forms the heart of downtown. Less than a mile north of the city is Fred Rocks Dam which is viewable from the highway. Citation needed|date=November 2010}} [ Transportation ] The only main access to the city is using North Dakota Highway 6. The Milwaukee Road line that ran through the city was abandoned in 1983, leaving Selfridge without railway access. [ Brovald Ken C.
