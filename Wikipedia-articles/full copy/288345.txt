This decision caused concern within the Firebird database project due to the assumption that users and Internet search engines would be confused by a database and a web browser both using the name Firebird.

The statement also said that the Mozilla Firebird name was a project codename. On February 9, 2004, Mozilla renamed its browser Mozilla Firefox, thus ending the conflict.

For ensuring the ACID properties of transactions, the database engine keeps different versions of each record changed by the active users in the database. When the transactions are committed, the last version of every changed record is marked as the definitive. If transactions are rolled back, the database engine keeps the mark on the original record versions, leaving them untouched. [ http://www.ibexpert.info/ibe/index.php?n%3DDoc.Multi-generationalArchitectureMGAAndRecordVersioning Multi-generational architecture (MGA) and record versioning HK-Software July 14, 2011 ] As a result, Firebird disk writes are very reduced in comparison with databases that use the traditional transaction log architecture. [ http://www.ibphoenix.com/resources/documents/community/doc_296 Interview with Jim Starkey from InterBase World Marina Novikova, InterBase World July 14, 2011 ] Transactions writing data don’t block another ones reading it and viceversa, because each one sees its own version of the database. [ http://www.firebirdfaq.org/faq44/ What is Multi Generational Architecture (MGA)? The Firebird FAQ July 14, 2011 ] The advantages of this design, however, have a tradeoff: some maintenance (“sweeping”) is required from time to time to clean-up old record versions and freeing disk space. [ http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/gfix-housekeeping.html Database Housekeeping And Garbage Collection The Firebird Project July 14, 2011 ] The multi-generational architecture ensures that OLTP and DSS/OLAP operations can be run simultaneously without the delays caused by locking mechanisms found in other products. [ http://www.firebirdfaq.org/faq44/ What is Multi Generational Architecture (MGA)? The Firebird FAQ July 14, 2011 ] [ Indexes ] Firebird also uses special high-performance index structures and algorithms, making all indexes of the database to behave like well-turned “clustered indexes” used by other architectures. Firebird index buckets aren’t subject to two-phase locking, and Boolean “and” and “or” operations can be performed on intermediate bitmaps at a negligible cost, eliminating the need for the optimizer to choose between alternative indexes. [ http://www.ibphoenix.com/resources/documents/community/doc_296 Interview with Jim Starkey from InterBase World Marina Novikova, InterBase World July 14, 2011 ] [ Variants ] Firebird SuperServer has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with shared cache Firebird SuperClassic also has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with separate caches Firebird Classic uses inetd to run one copy of the server per client connection, recommended for SMP systems but might have event-notification issues if access is via a firewall Firebird Embedded for creating CD-ROM catalogs, single user or evaluation versions of applications; omits some advanced features such as event notification [ Licensing ] The Firebird database engine and its modules are released under an open-source license, the Initial Developer&apos;s Public License (IDPL), a variant of the Mozilla Public License (MPL). It does not force the developer to open the products using Firebird or even custom-derivatives made from its source code; but if the developer chooses to do so, then some terms and conditions should be honored. The IDPL gives the developer the freedom of making proprietary, closed source applications that use Firebird or are based on it.

However, for demanding environments, commercial support is available from the company IBPhoenix, that has a group of the main developers of the product working for it. Many support options are available, ranging from casual email support to contracts that designate direct and unlimited access to senior support engineers.

It is implemented on the client library, fbclient.dll on Windows systems and libfbclient.so on Unix ones. [ http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/ufb-cs-clientlib.html The Firebird client library The Firebird Project July 14, 2011 ] The Services API is a special function set for accessing and controlling service administration tasks such as user management, backup/restore and statistics gathering. Embedded SQL is a technique that simplifies the development of C/C++ and COBOL Firebird applications, by using a preprocessor called gpre, which allows to embed SQL statements directly into the source code of the host language.
