As of the 2010 census, the town population was 415. { United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011. } [ History ] [ April 2012 ] The name on the town charter is Llandaff, after the Bishop of Llandaff, chaplain to England&apos;s King George III. Originally, however, the land was granted as Whitcherville to James Avery and 60 others on January 31, 1764. But those settlers forfeited their grant by failure to comply with the requirements of the charter, so the territory was re-granted to Dartmouth College on January 19, 1770. Settlements were made under the Dartmouth grant. Roads and a mill were built at the expense of the college, and on November 11, 1774, the town was incorporated. After the Revolutionary War, however, the first grantees successfully claimed that their forfeiture was illegal, so the college had to abandon its title and lose what it had expended in making the settlements. Landaff was originally much larger than today. It was changed by legislative actions over the years: On July 2, 1845, it gained a small tract from the then-adjoining town of Lincoln. On June 23, 1859, all of Landaff lying northwest of the Ammonoosuc River was annexed to the town of Lisbon. On July 20, 1876, the town was divided, with the eastern half becoming the town of Easton. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 28.5 sqmi km2 ], of which [ 28.4 sqmi km2 on ] is land and [ 0.1 sqmi km2 on ] is water, comprising 0.25% of the town.
