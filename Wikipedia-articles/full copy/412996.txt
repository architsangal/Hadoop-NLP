[ Controversies ] [ Reputed conflicts of interest ] [ MBNA loan ] Moran&apos;s support for harsher bankruptcy law provisions and sponsorship of stricter bankruptcy legislation brought allegations in 2002 that his support came in return for financial favors by financial institutions which could benefit from such laws. In January 1998, one month before he introduced the legislation, credit card bank MBNA advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer debtors to declare bankruptcy. Moran received a favorable debt consolidation loan from the bank that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy arising from credit card and stock market losses. The $447,000 loan at a favorable interest rate was the largest loan to an individual MBNA issued in 1998. Its belated disclosure triggered a Federal Elections Commission investigation into whether or not it constituted an improper contribution. The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia at the time, Tim Kaine, joined Republican lawmakers in calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation into the loan, saying that Moran had made &quot; an error in judgment &quot; by accepting it. In his own defense, Moran said that the timing of the legislation&apos;s introduction was coincidental and had nothing to do with the loan. MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress, and that the loan &quot; made good business sense &quot; because with the mortgage loan, &quot; we improved our position by getting security for an unsecured loan.... He had credit cards with us, he was having financial difficulties; this put him in a better position to be able to pay us back from a cash-flow standpoint. &quot; [ http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/us/bankruptcy-bill-opponents-criticize-loan.html Bankruptcy Bill Opponents Criticize Loan Shenon Philip August 9, 2002 New York Times March 7, 2010 ] [ http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid%3D1298%26amp%3Bdat%3D20020707%26amp%3Bid%3Do_EyAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DywgGAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D6649%2C1357696 Report: Moran backed lender&apos;s cause after loan July 7, 2002 Sunday Free Lance-Star 7 March 13, 2010 ] [ PMA group ] The House Ethics Committee investigated several members of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, including Moran, Peter J.

Moran told Tikkun that AIPAC is &quot; [t]he most powerful lobby and has pushed this war from the beginning. I don&apos;t think they represent the mainstream of American Jewish thinking at all, but because they are so well organized, and their members are extraordinarily powerful – most of them are quite wealthy – they have been able to exert power. &quot; Moran&apos;s remarks were criticized by the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and the National Jewish Democratic Council. Ronald Halber, executive director of the first group, said that Moran &quot; uses several age-old canards that have been used throughout history that have brought violence upon Jews... He uses clearly anti-Semitic images such as Jewish control of the media and wealthy Jews using their wealth to control policy. &quot; He was also criticized by many House Democrats, including Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Energy and Commerce committee chairman Henry Waxman, who said that Moran&apos;s remarks were inaccurate and &quot; deeply offensive &quot;.
