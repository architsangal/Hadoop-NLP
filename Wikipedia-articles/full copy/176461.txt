ISBN 978-0-7432-8253-6 } was the assassin of U.S. President William McKinley. In the last few years of his life, he claimed to have been heavily influenced by anarchist s such as Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. [ Early life ] Czolgosz was born in Alpena, Michigan, [ June 2011 ] in 1873, one of eight children (six sons and two daughters) [ Channing 1902 ] of Mary (née Nowak) and Paul Czolgosz, Polish Catholic immigrants from Prussia. [ Rauchway 114, 126 ] [ Richardson 2003 ] According to a different source, Czolgosz&apos;s ancestors were immigrants from what is now Belarus. His father might have immigrated to the US in the 1860s from Astravets near Hrodna. At immigration, he stated his ethnicity as Hungarian and changed his surname from Zholhus (Жолгусь, Żołguś) to Czolgosz. { Президента США Уильяма МакКинли застрелил белорус? } He was baptized in St. Albertus Catholic Church. [ http://www.upi.com/topic/Leon_Czolgosz/wiki/ Leon Czolgosz  — Wiki UPI.com 2011-06-14 2011-06-22 ] [ June 2010 UPI wiki is a knock-off of this article; see recursion ] His family moved to Detroit when he was five years old. He left his family farm in Warrensville, Ohio, at the age of ten to work at the American Steel and Wire Company with two of his brothers. After the workers of his factory went on strike, he and his brothers were fired. Czolgosz then returned to the family farm in Warrensville. At the age of sixteen, he was sent to work in a glass factory in Natrona, Pennsylvania for two years before moving back home. [ June 2011 ] [ June 2011 ] [ Interest in anarchism ] In 1898, after witnessing a series of similar strikes (many ending in violence), Czolgosz again returned home where he was constantly at odds with his stepmother and with his family&apos;s Roman Catholic beliefs. It was later recounted that through his life he had never shown any interest in friendship or romantic relationships, and was bullied throughout his childhood by peers. [ June 2011 ] He became a recluse and spent much of his time alone reading Socialist and anarchist newspapers while drinking milk in his mother&apos;s basement. He was impressed after hearing a speech by the political radical Emma Goldman, whom he met for the first time during one of her lectures in Cleveland in 1901. After the lecture Czolgosz approached the speakers&apos; platform and asked for reading recommendations. A few days later he visited her home in Chicago and introduced himself as Nieman {No man}, but Goldman was on her way to the train station. He only had enough time to explain to her about his disappointment in Cleveland&apos;s socialists, and for Goldman to introduce him to her anarchist friends who were at the train station. [ Goldman 1931 289–290 ] She later wrote a piece in defense of Czolgosz. [ http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/filmmore/pt.html American Experience Emma Goldman : Transcript PBS 3-11-2004 ] The radical Free Society newspaper issued a warning pertaining to Czolgosz, reading: [ Everett ch5 ] [ The attention of the comrades is called to another spy. He is well dressed, of medium height, rather narrow shoulders, blond and about 25 years of age. Up to the present he has made his appearance in Chicago and Cleveland. In the former place he remained but a short time, while in Cleveland he disappeared when the comrades had confirmed themselves of his identity and were on the point of exposing him. His demeanor is of the usual sort, pretending to be greatly interested in the cause, asking for names or soliciting aid for acts of contemplated violence. If this same individual makes his appearance elsewhere the comrades are warned in advance, and can act accordingly. ] Czolgosz believed there was a great injustice in American society, an inequality which allowed the wealthy to enrich themselves by exploiting the poor. He concluded that the reason for this was the structure of government itself. Then he learned of a European crime which changed his life: On July 29, 1900, King Umberto I of Italy had been shot dead by anarchist Gaetano Bresci. Bresci told the press that he had decided to take matters into his own hands for the sake of the common man. The assassination shocked and galvanized the American anarchist movement, and Czolgosz is thought to have consciously imitated Bresci. New York police officer Joseph Petrosino believed that the same group had targeted President McKinley, but his warnings were useless, because McKinley ignored them. { http://www.italyculturemonth.org/images/bookmark_09_GP_web.pdf } However, it is worth noting that Czolgosz was a Republican. Like his father and brother, he voted in Republican primaries in Cleveland. During his attempts to get anarchist support, they turned him away because they thought he was a police spy. Czolgosz&apos;s interest in anarchism was greatly exaggerated in the press while his Republicanism rarely mentioned. { Lee, Earl (2001). You Are Being Lied To. The Disinformation Company. } [ March 2012 ] Such exaggeration appears to have been unnecessary, as Czolgosz&apos;s own words (including at his execution) and his devotion to notorious anarchist Emma Goldman and her beliefs make it clear that the impetus for his actions were to advance the anarchist cause. In addition, of course, it should be noted that McKinley was himself a Republican. [ Assassination of President McKinley ] { McKinley. } [ Assassination of William McKinley ] On August 31, 1901, Czolgosz moved to Buffalo, New York, the site of the Pan-American Exposition. There, he rented a room at Nowak&apos;s Hotel on 1078 Broadway. { &quot; Czolgosz Says He Had No Aid &quot;, Chicago Sunday Tribune, 8 Sep. 1901. } On September 6 he went to the exposition with a.32 caliber Iver-Johnson &quot; Safety Automatic &quot; revolver (serial #A63344 [ http://www.thefirearmsforum.com/showthread.php?t%3D85281 Iver Johnson used to assassinate Mckinley TheFirearmsForum.Com 2012-03-11 ] ) he claimed he had purchased on September 2 for $4.50. { Leon Czolgosz and the Trial  — &quot; Lights out in the City of Light &quot;  — Anarchy and Assassination at the Pan-American Exposition } With the gun wrapped in a handkerchief in his pocket, Czolgosz approached McKinley&apos;s procession, the President having been standing in a receiving line inside of the Temple of Music, greeting the public for 10 minutes. At 4:07  pm Czolgosz reached the front of the line. McKinley extended his hand; Czolgosz slapped it aside and shot him in the abdomen twice at point blank range. Members of the crowd immediately subdued Czolgosz, before the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps [ June 2011 ] and police intervened, and beat him so severely it was initially thought he might not live to stand trial. { The Trial and Execution of Leon Czolgosz } Czolgosz was then briefly held in a cell at Buffalo&apos;s 13th Precinct house at 346 Austin Street until he was moved to the city&apos;s police headquarters downtown. [ Trial and execution ] Following the assassination, newly inaugurated President Theodore Roosevelt issued a pronouncement declaring: &quot; When compared with the suppression of anarchy, every other question sinks into insignificance.” [ Doherty 2011 ] On September 13, the day before McKinley succumbed to his wounds, Czolgosz was transferred from the police headquarters, since the headquarters were undergoing repairs, to the Erie County Women&apos;s Penitentiary. On the 16th he was taken to the Erie County Jail before being arraigned before County Judge Emery. After the arraignment, he was transferred to Auburn State Prison. [ June 2011 ] A grand jury indicted Czolgosz on September 16 with one count of first-degree murder. Throughout his incarceration, Czolgosz spoke freely with his guards, but refused every interaction with Robert C. Titus and Lorin L. Lewis, the prominent judges-turned-attorneys assigned to defend him, and with the expert psychiatrist sent to test his sanity. [ June 2011 ] A prison guard later came forward claiming that Czolgosz confided in him that because he claimed himself to be an anarchist, he would not talk with any people he viewed as related to authority which included his lawyers or any presiding trial judge. The district attorney at trial was Thomas Penney, assisted by a Mr. Haller, whose performance was described as &quot; flawless &quot;. [ Dr. McDonald&apos;s description of the trial. ] Although Czolgosz answered that he was pleading &quot; Guilty &quot;, the presiding Judge Truman C. White overruled him and entered a &quot; Not Guilty &quot; plea on his behalf. { Hamilton, Dr. Allan McLane. &quot; Autobiography &quot;. Pre-1921 } In the nine days from McKinley&apos;s death on September 14, to Czolgosz&apos;s trial on September 23, Czolgosz&apos;s lawyers were unable to prepare a defense since Czolgosz refused to speak to either one of them. As a result, Lorin Lewis argued at the trial that Czolgosz could not be found guilty for the murder of the president because he was insane at the time (similar to the defense that was used in the Charles J. Guiteau trial in 1881, after the shooting of President James A. Garfield ). On September 23 and 24 prosecution testimony was presented, consisting of the doctors who treated McKinley and various eyewitnesses to the shooting. Lewis did not call any defense witnesses. Czolgosz himself refused to testify on his own defense, nor did he ever speak at all in court. In his statement to the jury, Lewis noted Czolgosz&apos;s refusal to talk to his lawyers or cooperate with them, admitted his client&apos;s guilt, and said that &quot; the only question that can be discussed or considered in this case is... whether that act was that of a sane person. If it was, then the defendant is guilty of the murder... If it was the act of an insane man, then he is not guilty of murder but should be acquitted of that charge and would then be confined in a lunatic asylum. &quot; The prosecutor laid great stress on Czolgosz&apos;s anarchist affiliations and called upon the jury to heed the popular demand for a quick trial and execution. Since the defense had been unable to enter any evidence that Czolgosz had been afflicted with any kind of temporary insanity, there could only be one verdict. Even if the jury believed the defense that Czolgosz was insane by claiming that no sane man would have shot and killed the president in such a public and blatant manner in which he knew he would be caught, there was still the legal definition of insanity to be overcome. Under New York law, Czolgosz was legally insane only if he was unable to understand what he was doing. [ Great American Trials 1994 225–227 ] At Thomas Penney&apos;s request, White closed the trial with instructions to the jury that supported the prosecution&apos;s argument that (a): Czolgosz was not insane, and that (b): he knew clearly what he was doing. After this, any chance that remained of acquitting Czolgosz on the basis of insanity was gone, since the defense offered no evidence that he couldn&apos;t understand the wrongness of his crime. Czolgosz was convicted on September 24, 1901 after the jury deliberated for only one hour. On September 26, the jury unanimously recommended the death penalty. Czolgosz was said to have continued to remain silent and had shown no emotion upon both his conviction and death sentence. When he was asked by Judge White if he wanted to make any open court statement, Czolgosz shook his head meaning &apos;no&apos;. Upon returning to Auburn Prison, Czolgosz asked the warden if this meant he would be transferred to Sing Sing to be electrocuted, and he seemed surprised to learn that Auburn had its own electric chair. [ June 2011 ] [ a 1901 newspaper article related to the execution: &quot; Buffalo Men at the Execution &quot;. ] Czolgosz was electrocuted by three jolts, each of 1800 volt s, in Auburn Prison {, 1901 video of his execution } on October 29, 1901. { The Execution of Leon Czolgosz  — &quot; Lights Out in the City of Light &quot;  — Anarchy and Assassination at the Pan-American Exposition } His brother, Waldek, and his brother-in-law, Frank Bandowski, were in attendance. When Waldek asked the Warden for his brother&apos;s body to be taken for proper burial, he was informed that he &quot; would never be able to take it away &quot; and that crowds of people would mob him. [ June 2011 ] His last words were: &quot; I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people the good working people. I am not sorry for my crime. &quot; [ June 2011 ] As the prison guards strapped him into the chair, however, he did say through clenched teeth, &quot; I am only sorry I could not get to see my father. &quot; [ June 2011 ] Czolgosz was autopsied by John T. Gerin; [ Everett p448 ] his brain was autopsied by Edward Anthony Spitzka. The body was buried on prison grounds following the autopsy. Prison authorities originally planned to inter the body with quicklime to hasten its decomposition, but became dissatisfied with this option after testing quicklime on a sample of meat. After determining that they were not legally limited to the use of quicklime for the process, they poured sulfuric acid into Czolgosz&apos;s coffin so that his body would be completely disfigured. [ The New York Times, 1901-10-30 ] The warden estimated the acid caused the body to disintegrate within 12 hours. Czolgosz&apos;s letters and clothes were burned, although in the case of letters the names of those who had sent threatening or sympathetic correspondence were recorded for future reference. [ June 2011 ] [ Legacy ] [ The Tragedy at Buffalo ] Emma Goldman was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the assassination, but was released, due to insufficient evidence. She later incurred a great deal of negative publicity when she published &quot; The Tragedy at Buffalo &quot;. In the article, she compared Czolgosz to Marcus Junius Brutus, the killer of Julius Caesar, and called McKinley the &quot; president of the money kings and trust magnates. &quot; { &quot; The Tragedy at Buffalo &quot; } Other anarchists and radicals were unwilling to support Goldman&apos;s effort to aid Czolgosz, believing that he had harmed the movement. [ Goldman 1931 311–319 ] The scene of the crime, the Temple of Music, was demolished in November 1901, along with the rest of the Exposition grounds. A stone marker in the middle of Fordham Drive, a residential street in Buffalo, marks the approximate spot ( [ 42 56.321 N 78 52.416 W inline ] [ Site of the Assassination of President McKinley http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1MR2 30 July 2010 ] ) where the shooting occurred. Czolgosz&apos;s revolver is on display in the Pan-American Exposition exhibit at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society in Buffalo. Lloyd Vernon Briggs, who later became the Director of the Massachusetts Department for Mental Hygiene, reviewed the Czolgosz case in 1901 on behalf of Dr. Walter Channing shortly after Czolgosz&apos;s death. [ Rauchway 55 ] Briggs also reviewed the cases of Clarence Richeson and Bertram G. Spencer, men who had histories of mental illness before committing murder. Contrary to views almost universally expressed at the time of the assassination, Briggs concluded that Czolgosz was &quot; a diseased man, a man who had been suffering from some form of mental disease for years. He was not medically responsible and in the light of present-day psychiatry and of modern surgical procedure, there is a great question whether he was even legally responsible for the death of our President. &quot; [ Art ] Czolgosz is also featured as a central character of Stephen Sondheim &apos;s musical Assassins, in which his assassination of McKinley is depicted in a musical number called &quot; The Ballad of Czolgosz &quot;.
