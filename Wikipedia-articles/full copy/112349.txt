[ January 2010 ] [ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 0442420 } [ 3 ] Russiaville is a town in Liberty Township, Howard County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,094 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Kokomo, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. [ Etymology ] The town was named for Jean-Baptiste Richardville (whose father&apos;s surname was Richerville), a Miami chief of French-Miami descent who had relations with the United States government in treaty making in the early nineteenth century. through the French pronunciation of &quot; Ri-shar-ville, &quot; the name was gradually corrupted and changed to the current spelling; it has been pronounced &quot; Roo-sha-ville &quot; through much of its history. The apparent association with Russia led to the town high school&apos;s naming its athletic teams the &quot; Cossacks &quot; until 1949, when county consolidation changed Russiaville High School to Western High School. Some theorize an alternate history, that during the Cold War, residents consciously changed the pronunciation of Russiaville&apos;s name in order to disassociate their town from Russia, the leading state of the Soviet Union. A map from the 1840s-1850s in the Quaker Collection of Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, clearly shows a county named Richardville, and a town Richardville, at the site of present-day Russiaville. Some local history has suggested &quot; Rouchardville &quot; as the earlier spelling, but Richardville is correct. [ History ] Organized in 1844, the area was first named Richardville County in honor of the Miami chief Jean Baptiste Richardville who signed early treaties with the United States government. His Miami name was Pe-che-wa, meaning Wildcat. The Wildcat Creek watershed includes most of present-day Howard and Clinton counties, and the creek was named for him. The county was later renamed after a European-American settler. Another chief of the Miami, She-Moc-E-Nish, was granted the Anthony Wayne Flag, also known as the Greenville Treaty Flag. It was passed down to French-Indian descendants in the Aveline family. They eventually intermarried with one of the earliest Honey Creek Township European-American families. The Evans family is linked to both the Thomases and the Brubakers, all of whom have lands within the Wildcat Creek watershed dating back to the times of the earliest European-American settlements. A history of this flag can be seen at the Indiana Historical Bureau { &quot; Greenville Treaty Flag &quot;, Indiana History } As stated on the Honey Creek Township entry, &quot; Honey Creek was organized in 1841 as a township in the northeastern corner of neighboring Clinton County. The township&apos;s early population tended to be politically Republican, so the Republican party in Howard County and the Democrats in Clinton County collaborated to have Honey Creek Township removed from Clinton and added in 1850 to Howard. &quot; [2] Russiaville became a Quaker settlement in the years before the Civil War. They created a stop on the Underground Railroad for fugitive slaves in the antebellum years in nearby New London, then the site of the Friends Meeting serving the entire area. A local legend tells that the stop included a tunnel under New London from a safe house to a cave in the hollow of Honey Creek, near the location of the Friends Meetinghouse. Russiaville is the birthplace of Jonathan Dixon Maxwell (Sept. 3, 1864), builder of the Maxwell automobile. He is buried there. { &quot; Maxwell Auto &quot; Clan Maxwell USA } Almost all of the town was destroyed on April 11, 1965, by an F4 tornado, which was part of the Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak. With rebuilding, the town had a population of 1,094 at the 2010 census. [ Geography ] Russiaville is located at [ 40 25 8 N 86 16 19 W type:city ] (40.418852, -86.272010) [ 1 ].
