[ January 2012 ] [ GBR M 67 5.0 West East Denton Hattersley 1978 Constructed 1978–1981 1000x20px 1000x20px J1 → M60 motorway UK motorway map - M67.png M67 highlighted in dark blue. ] The M67 is a [ 5 mi km on ] urban motorway in Greater Manchester, England which heads east from the M60 motorway passing through Denton and Hyde before ending near Mottram. It was originally conceived as the first part of a trans-Pennine motorway between Manchester and Sheffield connecting the A57(M) motorway to the M1 motorway. Plans for a £180m improvement to the route by bypassing Mottram and Tintwistle, the A57/A628 Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle Bypass, and the &apos;Glossop spur&apos; linking to the A57 road are currently at the public inquiry stage but were &apos;suspended indefinitely&apos; in January 2008. [ Route ] Pictured looking west, toward Manchester The M67 heads east from the M60 motorway, passing through Denton and Hyde before ending near Mottram. From the end of the motorway traffic can either follow the A628 road or the A57 road further east to the M1 motorway and Sheffield. Before the motorway reaches its eastern terminal at Hattersley /Mottram roundabout (where traffic continues along the A57 into Longdendale ), there are the stub &apos;ski ramps&apos; where the motorway would have continued eastwards, [ http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f%3Dq%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bgeocode%3D%26amp%3Btime%3D%26amp%3Bdate%3D%26amp%3Bttype%3D%26amp%3Bq%3DTameside%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bll%3D53.454781%2C-2.033962%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.00145%2C0.004233%26amp%3Bt%3Dh%26amp%3Bz%3D18%26amp%3Bom%3D0 Google maps aerial photography of the ski ramps at Mottram 25 January 2008 ] as there are at the western end.

These schemes are connected by a viaduct over the River Tame and Peak Forest Canal. [ M67 Manchester to Sheffield motorway ] In 1967, at the time of the first public inquiry there were discussions regarding an extension of the motorway across the Peak District National Park [ http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1976/jun/23/m67-peak-district-national-park#S5CV0913P0-04105 HOUSE OF COMMONS Wednesday 23rd June 1976 - M67 (Peak District National Park) Hansard Prototype 24 June 1976 25 January 2008 ] It was to provide a second motorway link across the Pennine s to the south of the planned M62 and avoid the Snake and Woodhead passes, which are often closed in snowy weather. The full proposed route was to start from Manchester city centre at what was the A57(M) motorway eastern terminal roundabout (now a flyover for the A635, constructed in 1995), following the line of the A57 Hyde Road through the inner suburbs of Ardwick, Gorton and Debdale Park. Large-scale demolition took place along the line of the motorway (which is still evident today), tied in with the widening of the Belle Vue and Reddish Lane junctions. [ http://pathetic.org.uk/unbuilt/m67_manchester_to_sheffield_motorway/ M67 Manchester to Sheffield Motorway Pathetic Motorways 25 January 2008 ] From there the intended route follows the present-day M67, skirting Hyde and Denton. Upon reaching Mottram, the route passed the village to the north (through a tunnel), then crossed Mottram Moor to skirt Hollingworth through the Etherow valley floor. The motorway would then have run around the side of Bottoms Reservoir to reach Hadfield, from which the trackbed of the Woodhead railway line (the former intercity route between Manchester and Sheffield, now closed) was to have been followed up the Longdendale valley to Woodhead. At Woodhead, the route would have diverged, with one carriageway entering the Woodhead Rail Tunnel (now disused) and the other rising on a sweeping viaduct to go over a realigned Woodhead Pass. Beyond the Pennine watershed, the motorway would have continued on a new alignment past the villages of Langsett and Midhopestones, before meeting the route of the current Stocksbridge bypass. The Stocksbridge bypass would have been constructed on its present alignment and continued directly onto the M1 at junction 35a. Another part of the originally planned &quot; M67 &quot; exists in South Yorkshire, as the A616 Stocksbridge bypass which opened in 1989. As there was no certainty that the whole M67 scheme would be completed by this time, the then government decided that the scheme would not be built with motorway characteristics, but as a single carriageway with crawler lanes.

It would be to be built as an at-grade.
