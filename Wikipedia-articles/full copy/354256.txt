He was a descendant of King William IV by his mistress Dorothea Bland. [ Early life ] He was the younger of two children, and the only son, of William Sidney, 5th Baron De L&apos;Isle and Dudley (19 August 1859 – 18 June 1945) and his wife, Winifred Agneta Yorke Bevan (d. 11 February 1959). The Sidney family was one of England &apos;s oldest and most distinguished families. He was educated at Eton and Magdalene College, Cambridge and became a chartered accountant. In 1929 he joined the Grenadier Guards Reserve of Officers. [ War service ] Victoria Cross medal, ribbon &amp; bar During World War II Sidney served in France and Italy. He led a handful of men in the defence of the Anzio beachhead, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Sidney led a successful attack which drove German troops out of a gully. Later he led another counter-attack and dashed forward, engaging the Germans with his tommy gun at point-blank range, forcing a withdrawal. When the attack was renewed, Sidney and one guardsman were wounded and another killed, but he would not consent to have his wounds dressed until the Germans had been beaten off and the battalion &apos;s position had been consolidated. During this time, although extremely weak from loss of blood, he continued to encourage and inspire his men. In later life, when asked where he had been shot, he would jocularly respond that he was shot in Italy. This was to conceal the fact that he had, in fact, been shot in the buttocks. The ribbon for the medal was made from one of his father-in-law Lord Gort&apos;s uniforms and was awarded by General Alexander on 3 March 1944 in Italy. [ Political life ] At a by-election in October 1944 he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelsea. His father died in June 1945 and he succeeded as 6th Baron De L&apos;Isle and Dudley, requiring translation to the House of Lords. He retired from the House of Commons prior to the July 1945 general election. In 1951 he was appointed Secretary of State for Air under Winston Churchill and held that office until 1955. During this time he visited Australia, travelling to Woomera to examine weapons research and meeting the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. In 1956 he was created 1st Viscount De L&apos;Isle. [ Governor-General ] In 1961, following the sudden death of Lord Dunrossil, Menzies recommended De L&apos;Isle&apos;s appointment as Governor-General of Australia. He performed his ceremonial duties with dignity and travelled widely around Australia. There were no political or constitution al controversies during his term, even though the Menzies Liberal government until November 1963 enjoyed a majority in the House of Representatives of just 2 seats. De L&apos;Isle&apos;s Official Secretary throughout his term was Murray Tyrrell. [ Marriage and issue ] Sidney married Jacqueline Corrine Yvonne Vereker (20 October 1914 15 November 1962), daughter of Field Marshal Lord Gort, on 8 June 1940. The couple had 5 children; Elizabeth Sophia (b. 12 March 1941) Catherine Mary (b. 20 October 1942) Philip John Algernon, 2nd Viscount De L&apos;Isle (b. 21 April 1945) Anne Marjorie (b. 15 August 1947) Lucy Corinna Agneta (b. 21 February 1953) After his wife&apos;s death, he married Margaret Shoubridge on 24 March 1966 in Paris. They had no issue. [ Retirement ] By the time of his retirement in 1965, public opinion was strongly in favour of an Australian Governor-General, although this was not a reflection on his performance in the role. His continuing interest in Australia was shown by several visits after his retirement, the last for Australia&apos;s bicentenary in 1988, when he presented a bronze statue, which now stands in the grounds of Government House in Canberra. De L&apos;Isle held firmly conservative views and was involved in the foundation, in 1975, of what is now the Freedom Association. He died in Kent on 5 April 1991. [ Styles and honours ] The Hon.
