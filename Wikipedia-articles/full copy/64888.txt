[ Flaming Moe Flaming_Moe The Simpsons The Simpsons Fox 22 11 ] { Master&apos;s degree in folklore and mythology } { &quot; } { Three Men and a Comic Book &quot; } { Hank Azaria } Comic Book Guy (born Jeff Albertson) is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Hank Azaria, and first appeared in the second-season episode &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book &quot;, which originally aired on May 9, 1991. He is the proprietor of a comic book store, The Android&apos;s Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop. Comic Book Guy is based on &quot; every comic-bookstore guy in America &quot; [ Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves 2007-08-15 2000-10-21 TV Guide Joe Rhodes ] and represents a stereotypical middle-aged comic-book collector. He has become well known for his catchphrase, &quot; Worst [noun] ever! &quot; [ Role in The Simpsons ] [ Profile ] Comic Book Guy (claiming Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode &quot; Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass &quot; ) is an obese, nerd y and snob by man best known for his eloquence and sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid science fiction buff. He holds a master&apos;s degree in folklore and mythology (he translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his thesis ), { &quot; } { Three Men and a Comic Book &quot; } has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa. [ They Saved Lisa&apos;s Brain They_Saved_Lisa&apos;s_Brain The Simpsons The Simpsons Selman, Matt; Michels, Pete Fox 10 22 ] He has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail. His catchphrase is the declaration &quot; worst/best [subject] ever &quot;, sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall. For example, in the episode &quot; Saddlesore Galactica &quot;, he wears a T-shirt saying &quot; Worst Episode Ever &quot; and criticizes the idea of the Simpson family keeping a horse since that was the subject of a previous episode. Another example of breaking the fourth wall occurs in an episode when Comic Book Guy&apos;s chair collapses, and he sarcastically says &quot; Ooh, a fat man falls. Real original. &quot; Despite his solitary life, in The Simpsons Movie, minutes before his likely death, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting has been a &quot; life well spent &quot;. However, in &quot; Treehouse of Horror VIII &quot;, when a nuclear missile homes in on him, he says to himself &quot; Ohh, I&apos;ve wasted my life. &quot; (Although the &quot; Treehouse of Horror &quot; episodes are not part of the normal Simpsons canon). In the 19th season finale, &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, it is revealed that he has long, beautiful, overflowing hair. Comic Book Guy not only has a heart attack in Season 12, but encounters death twice; once in a French missile strike on Springfield, and also in &quot; Treehouse of Horror XVI &quot;, where Comic Book Guy is killed by Mr. Burns for refusing to run for five whole minutes. [ Romance ] Comic Book Guy was once married in an online role-playing game. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his &quot; power crystals &quot;. [ My Big Fat Geek Wedding My_Big_Fat_Geek_Wedding The Simpsons The Simpsons Curran, Kevin; Kirkland, Mark Fox 15 17 ] He is shown paired with a woman during a mass marriage that occurred when a cult took over Springfield, and presumably the two are wed in the mass ceremony. In Season 16&apos;s &quot; There&apos;s Something About Marrying &quot;, he hopes to wed a Xena: Warrior Princess cardboard figure. While part of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield in &quot; They Saved Lisa&apos;s Brain &quot;, he proposes plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating, called Pon farr ), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, &quot; much, much more &quot;. This is not his last foray into attempted leadership of Springfield; in the Season 17 episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, he is one of over 200 candidates for mayor, following his usual catchphrase into &quot; BEST MAYOR EVER. &quot; He is a virgin well into his forties, [ Mayored to the Mob Mayored_to_the_Mob The Simpsons The Simpsons Hauge, Ron; Scott III, Swinton O. Fox 10 9 ] but loses it when he becomes romantically involved with Principal Skinner &apos;s mother Agnes. ( Chief Wiggum is notably repulsed when he and his officers stumble upon the couple &quot; in the act &quot;.) He later dates Edna Krabappel and is shown with the Superman logo tattooed on his upper right buttock. They are nearly married at a science fiction convention, but Edna calls it off. Comic Book Guy was not particularly surprised by this, saying, &quot; There are a million valid reasons, but which one did you pick? &quot; When Edna gently explains &quot; It&apos;s like I&apos;m DC Comics, and you&apos;re Marvel &quot;, he accepts the comparison without any rancor. The Android&apos;s Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop. [ The Android&apos;s Dungeon ] Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android&apos;s Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. Many of the comics and toys he sells are of poor quality and often have very high prices (for example, &quot; The Ultimate Pog &quot;, featuring their supposed inventor, Steve Allen, costs $500). His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone and often banning certain customers for minor infractions. His store contains a lower level full of illegal videos (which include Mr. Rogers drunk, Alien Autopsy, Illegal Alien Autopsy, a &quot; good version &quot; of The Godfather Part III, and Kent Brockman picking his nose). In the Simpsons and Futurama cross-over comic, Fry points out the cardboard cutout in the front of the store looks like his friend, Bender (to which Comic Book Guy says that he and Bart are pulling an obvious Back to the Future cliche while riding on flying skateboards). In &quot; Husbands and Knives &quot;, the store was finally closed due to bankruptcy when a rival comic book shop opened up (whose owner had significantly better customer service), and Marge bought the land in order to open up &quot; Shapes &quot;, a gym for regular women, on its former site. Though having been gone for a few episodes (and thought to have been &quot; retired &quot; ), Comic Book Guy made an appearance in an episode that aired later in the season, &quot; Any Given Sundance &quot;. He was seen in the audience after Lisa&apos;s documentary played, writing a review of it on his blog; uncharacteristically, it was very positive, though his somewhat jaded voice tone implies that Lisa&apos;s documentary is far from being his favorite. In &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, his store seems to be open again, although nothing is known about his rival store, Coolsville. The store is also seen in the couch gag of &quot; Lisa the Drama Queen &quot;, where The Comic Book Guy puts a price tag on (then berates) a Simpsons couch gag toy. [ Character ] [ Creation ] Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok book shop who often &quot; [sat] &quot; on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce. &quot; Groening noted: [ I can&apos;t tell you how many times people have come up to me and said, &apos;I know who you based that comic book guy on. It&apos;s that comic-book guy right down the block.&apos; And I have to tell them, &apos;No, it&apos;s everycomic-bookstore guy in America.&apos; ] Azaria based Comic Book Guy&apos;s voice on a student who went by the nickname &quot; F &quot;, short for &quot; Flounder &quot; from the movie National Lampoon&apos;s Animal House, and lived in the room next door at his college. { Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Azaria &quot; loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they&apos;re his peers. &quot; [ Development ] Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons. The writers of the show are aware of the newsgroup and sometimes make jokes at its expense. [ Tossell Ivor Worst. Column.

Cohen decided to use this fan response to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans. [ Chris Baker Futurama Is Back!

When Comic Book Guy sees the Poochie episode, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, “Worst episode ever” on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit-picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart Simpson : { Alberti, pp. 147-148 } [ Comic Book Guy: Last night&apos;s Itchy &amp; Scratchy was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever. Rest assured I was on the Internet within minutes registering my disgust throughout the world. Bart: Hey, I know it wasn’t great, but what right do you have to complain? Comic Book Guy: As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me. Bart: For what? They’re giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? If anything, you owe them. Comic Book Guy: Worst episode ever. ] { David S. Cohen } { The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show, The Simpsons } The catchphrase further appears on his T-shirt in the eleventh season episode &quot; Saddlesore Galactica &quot;, [ Saddlesore Galactica Saddlesore_Galactica The Simpsons Long, Tim; Kramer, Lance Fox February 6, 2000 11 13 ] and as the title of the twelfth season episode &quot; Worst Episode Ever &quot;. [ Worst Episode Ever Worst Episode Ever The Simpsons Doyle, Larry; Nastuk, Matthew Fox 4 February 2001 12 11 ] The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, &quot; Worst. (Noun). Ever. &quot; [ Name ] A long- running gag on the show was never to reveal the character&apos;s name, with other characters referring to him as &quot; Comic Book Guy &quot;. The writers had intended to name the character as early as his first episode, but they could not think of a name for him, and they called him &quot; Comic Book Guy &quot;, with the intention of naming the character the next time they used him. { Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Three Men and a Comic Book &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } However, they kept putting it off. Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, &quot; Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass &quot;, Comic Book Guy nonchalantly tells Ned Flanders : &quot; My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me &apos;Comic Book Guy&apos; &quot;. [ Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass Homer_and_Ned&apos;s_Hail_Mary_Pass The Simpsons The Simpsons Steven Dean Moore, Tim Long Fox 16 8 ] Show runner Al Jean remarked: &quot; That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show. We did it so the most people possible would see it. &quot; Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be &quot; obsessed and tormented by &quot; Lois Lane, but was out of the room when the writers named him.
