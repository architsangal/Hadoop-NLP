[ the unit of length other uses of &quot; metre &quot; or &quot; meter &quot; meter (disambiguation) ] [ 1 4 ] The metre (meter in the US), symbol m, is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). Originally intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth&apos;s equator to the North Pole (at sea level), its definition has been periodically refined to reflect growing knowledge of metrology. Since 1983, it has been defined as &quot; the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of [ 1 &amp; frasl; 299,792,458 ] of a second &quot;. [ http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/17/1/ 17th General Conference on Weights and Measures (1983), Resolution 1. ] [ History ] [ History of the metre ] [ Name ] The first recorded proposal for a decimal-based unit of length was the universal measure unit proposed by the English philosopher John Wilkins in 1668. { Wilkins c. 2007 } In 1675, the Italian scientist Tito Livio Burattini, in his work Misura Universale, used the words [ it metro cattolico ] (lit. &quot; catholic [i.e. universal] metre &quot; ), which was derived from the Greek [ grc μέτρον καθολικόν ] (métron katholikón), &quot; a universal measure &quot;. This word gave rise to the French mètre which in 1797 was introduced into the English language. { meter 2009. } Belfry, Dunkirk - the northern end of the meridian arc Fortress of Montjuïc - the southerly end of the meridian arc [ Meridional definition ] In 1668, Wilkins proposed using Christopher Wren &apos;s suggestion of a pendulum with a half- period of one second to measure a standard length that Christiaan Huygens had observed to be 38 Rhineland or 39¼ English inches (997  mm) in length. In the 18th century, there were two favoured approaches to the definition of the standard unit of length. One approach followed Wilkins in defining the metre as the length of a pendulum with a half- period of one second, a &apos; seconds pendulum &apos;. The other approach suggested defining the metre as one ten-millionth of the length of the Earth&apos;s meridian along a quadrant, that is the distance from the equator to the North Pole. In 1791, the French Academy of Sciences selected the meridional definition over the pendular definition because the force of gravity varies slightly over the surface of the Earth, which affects the period of a pendulum. To establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of the metre, measurements of this meridian more accurate than those available at that time were imperative. The French Academy of Sciences commissioned an expedition led by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre Méchain, lasting from 1792 to 1799, which measured the distance between the Dunkerque belfry and Montjuïc castle, Barcelona to estimate the length of the meridian arc through Dunkerque (assumed to be the same length as the Paris meridian ). This portion of the meridian was to serve as the basis for the length of the half meridian, connecting the North Pole with the equator. The exact shape of the Earth is not a simple mathematical shape ( sphere or oblate spheroid ) at the level of precision required for defining a standard of length. The irregular and particular shape of the Earth (smoothed to sea level) is called a Geoid, which means &quot; Earth-shaped &quot;. However, in 1793, France adopted as its official unit of length a metre based on provisional results from the expedition. Although it was later determined that the first prototype metre bar was short by a fifth of a millimetre because of miscalculation of the flattening of the Earth, this length became the standard. The circumference of the Earth through the poles is therefore slightly more than forty million metres (40 007 863). { Humerfelt 2010 } [ Prototype metre bar ] Creating the metre-alloy in 1874 at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. Present Henri Tresca, George Matthey, Saint-Claire Deville and Debray { International Prototype Metre &apos;&apos; bar, made of an } { alloy of } { platinum and } { iridium, that was the standard from 1889 to 1960. } In the 1870s and in light of modern precision, a series of international conferences was held to devise new metric standards. The Metre Convention (Convention du Mètre) of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to be located in Sèvres, France. This new organisation would preserve the new prototype metre and kilogram standards when constructed, distribute national metric prototypes, and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards. The organisation created a new prototype bar in 1889 at the first General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM: Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures), establishing the International Prototype Metre as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of ninety percent platinum and ten percent iridium, measured at the melting point of ice. { National Institute of Standards and Technology 2003; Historical context of the SI: Unit of length (meter) } The original international prototype of the metre is still kept at the BIPM under the conditions specified in 1889. A discussion of measurements of a standard metre bar and the errors encountered in making the measurements is found in a NIST document. { Beers &amp; Penzes 1992 } [ Standard wavelength of krypton-86 emission ] In 1893, the standard metre was first measured with an interferometer by Albert A. Michelson, the inventor of the device and an advocate of using some particular wavelength of light as a standard of length. By 1925, interferometry was in regular use at the BIPM. However, the International Prototype Metre remained the standard until 1960, when the eleventh CGPM defined the metre in the new SI system as equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelength s of the orange - red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton -86 atom in a vacuum. [ Marion Jerry B. Physics For Science and Engineering 1982 CBS College Publishing 4-8337-0098-0 3 ] [ Speed of light ] To further reduce uncertainty, the seventeenth CGPM in 1983 replaced the definition of the metre with its current definition, thus fixing the length of the metre in terms of the second and the speed of light : [ 1 &amp; thinsp; &amp; thinsp; &amp; frasl; &amp; thinsp; &amp; thinsp; &amp; thinsp; 299,792,458 ] { of a second. } This definition fixed the speed of light in vacuum at exactly 299,792,458 metres per second. An intended by-product of the 17th CGPM’s definition was that it enabled scientists to compare their lasers accurately using frequency, resulting in wavelengths with one-fifth the uncertainty involved in the direct comparison of wavelengths because interferometer errors were eliminated. To further facilitate reproducibility from lab to lab, the 17th CGPM also made the iodine-stabilised helium–neon laser “a recommended radiation” for realising the metre. For purposes of delineating the metre, the BIPM currently considers the HeNe laser wavelength to be as follows: [ 632 991 212.58 fm ] with an estimated relative standard uncertainty (U &amp; thinsp;) of [ 2.1 -11 ]. { The term &apos;relative standard uncertainty&apos; is explained by NIST on their web site: } [ Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty The NIST Reference on constants, units, and uncertainties: Fundamental physical constants http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html NIST 2011-12-19 ] { Iodine ( &amp; lambda;≈633nm), } { National Research Council 2010 } This uncertainty is currently one limiting factor in laboratory realisations of the metre, and it is several orders of magnitude poorer than that of the second, based upon the caesium fountain atomic clock ( [ 5 -16 ] &amp; thinsp;). { National Institute of Standards and Technology 2011. } Consequently, a realisation of the metre is usually delineated (not defined) today in labs as [ 1579800.762042 (33) ] wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in vacuum, the error stated being only that of frequency determination. [ Iodine (λ ≈ 633 nm) BIPM http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/mep/M-e-P_I2_633.pdf MEP (Mise en Pratique) 2003 2011-12-16 ] This bracket notation expressing the error is explained in the article on measurement uncertainty. Practical realisation of the metre is subject to uncertainties in characterising the medium, in addition to various uncertainties of interferometry, and to uncertainties in measuring the frequency of the source. A commonly used medium is air, and NIST has set up an on-line calculator to convert wavelengths in vacuum to wavelengths in air. { The formulas used in the calculator and the documentation behind them are found at } [ http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Documentation.asp Engineering metrology toolbox: Refractive index of air calculator September 23, 2010 NIST 2011-12-16 ] { The choice is offered to use either the modified Edlén equation or the Ciddor equation. The documentation provides a discussion of how to choose between the two possibilities. } As described by NIST, in air the uncertainties in characterising the medium are dominated by errors in finding temperature and pressure, and errors in the theoretical formulas used are secondary. [ http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Documentation.asp#UncertaintyandRangeofValidity §VI: Uncertainty and range of validity Engineering metrology toolbox: Refractive index of air calculator September 23, 2010 NIST 2011-12-16 ] By implementing a refractive index correction such as this, an approximate realization of the metre can be implemented in air, for example, using the formulation of the metre as [ 1579800.762042 (33) ] wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in vacuum, and converting the wavelengths in vacuum to wavelengths in air. Of course, air is only one possible medium to use in a realization of the metre, and any partial vacuum can be used, or some inert atmosphere like helium gas, provided the appropriate corrections for refractive index are implemented.

Hulet 0-12-475977-7 Academic Press 1997 The error [introduced by using air] can be reduced tenfold if the chamber is filled with an atmosphere of helium rather than air. ] [ Length measurement in metres ] [ Length measurement ] Although the metre is now defined as the path length travelled by light in a given time, actual laboratory length measurements in metres are determined by counting the number of wavelengths of laser light of one of the standard types that fit into the length, { The BIPM maintains a list of recommended radiations on their web site. See } [ Recommended values of standard frequencies http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/mep.html BIPM 9 September 2010 2012-01-22 ] { National Physical Laboratory 2010 } and converting the selected unit of wavelength to metres. Three major factors limit the accuracy attainable with laser interferometer s for a length measurement: { Zagar, 1999, pp. 6 –65&apos;&apos;ff&apos;&apos; } { A more detailed listing of errors can be found in } [ NIST length scale interferometer measurement assurance; NIST document NISTIR 4998 §4 Re-evaluation of measurement errors John S Beers, William B Penzes http://www.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/4998.pdf 2011-12-17 December 1992 9 ff ] Uncertainty in vacuum wavelength of the source, Uncertainty in the refractive index of the medium, Least count resolution of the interferometer. Of these, the last is peculiar to the interferometer itself. The conversion of a length in wavelengths to a length in metres is based upon the relation: \lambda = \frac{c}{n f} \ which converts the unit of wavelength λ to metres using c, the speed of light in vacuum in m/s. Here n is the refractive index of the medium in which the measurement is made; and f is taken for the conversion here as the measured frequency of the source. Although conversion from wavelengths to metres introduces additional error in the overall length due to measurement error in determining the refractive index and the frequency, measurement of frequency is one of the most accurate measurements available.
