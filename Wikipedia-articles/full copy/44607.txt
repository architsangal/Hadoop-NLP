[ October 2010 ] During the 17th century, there were many kinds of publications, that told both news and rumours. Among these were pamphlets, posters, ballads etc. Even when the news periodicals emerged, many of these co-existed with them. A news periodical differs from these mainly because of its periodicity. The definition for 17th century newsbook s and newspapers is that they are published at least once a week. Johann Carolus &apos; Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien, published in Strassburg in 1605, is usually regarded as the first news periodical. { World Association of Newspapers: &quot; Newspapers: 400 Years Young! &quot; } In the beginning of the 17th century the right to print was strictly controlled in England. This was probably the reason why the first newspaper in English language was printed in Amsterdam by Joris Veseler around 1620. This followed the style established by Veseler&apos;s earlier Dutch paper Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &amp; c. However, when the English started printing their own papers in London, they reverted to the pamphlet format used by contemporary books. The publication of these newsbooks was suspended between 1632 and 1638 by order of The Star Chamber. After they resumed publication, the era of these newsbooks lasted until the publication of the Oxford Gazette in 1665. The control over printing relaxed greatly after the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1641. The Civil War escalated the demand for news. News-pamphlets or -books reported the war, often supporting one side or the other. Following the Restoration there arose a number of publications, including the London Gazette (first published on 16 November 1665 as the Oxford Gazette), { London-gazette.co.uk } the first official journal of record and the newspaper of the Crown. Publication was controlled under the Licensing Act of 1662, but the Act&apos;s lapses from 1679–1685 and from 1695 onwards encouraged a number of new titles. [ Eighteenth century ] There were twelve London newspapers and 24 provincial papers by the 1720s (the Daily Courant was the first daily newspaper in London). The Public Advertiser was started by Henry Woodfall in the 18th century. [Citation needed] [ Nineteenth century ] By the early 19th century there were 52 London papers and over 100 other titles. As stamp, paper and other duties were progressively reduced from the 1830s onwards (all duties on newspapers were gone by 1855) there was a massive growth in overall circulation as major events and improved communications developed the public&apos;s need for information. The Daily Universal Register began life in 1785 and was later to become known as The Times from 1788. This was the most significant newspaper of the first half of the 19th century, but from around 1860 there were a number of more strongly competitive titles, each differentiated by its political biases and interests. The Manchester Guardian was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of non-conformist businessmen. Its most famous editor, Charles Prestwich Scott, made the Manchester Guardian into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s. It is now called The Guardian and published in London. The Chartist Northern Star, first published on 26 May 1838, was a pioneer of popular journalism but was very closely linked to the fortunes of the movement and was out of business by 1852. At the same time there was the establishment of more specialised periodicals and the first cheap newspaper in the Daily Telegraph and Courier (1855), later to be known simply as the Daily Telegraph. From 1860 until around 1910 is considered a &apos;golden age&apos; of newspaper publication, with technical advances in printing and communication combined with a professionalisation of journalism and the prominence of new owners. Newspapers became more partisan and there was the rise of new or yellow journalism (see William Thomas Stead ). Socialist and labour newspapers also proliferated and in 1912 the Daily Herald was launched as the first daily newspaper of the trade union and labour movement. The Illustrated London News, founded in 1842, was the world&apos;s first illustrated weekly newspaper. Mason Jackson, its art editor for thirty years, published in 1885 The Pictorial Press, a history of illustrated newspapers. The Illustrated London News was published weekly until 1971 when it became monthly; bimonthly from 1989; and then quarterly before publication ceased. [ Twentieth century ] By the 1930s, over two thirds of the population was estimated to read a newspaper every day, with &quot; almost everyone &quot; taking one on Sundays.

Such readers are left ill-informed and unable to participate intelligently in political debate. &quot; The report also contained worries about the fact that &quot; general accuracy of the Press is comparatively low by scientific or administrative standards, &quot; and about early press intrusion causing &quot; considerable public indignation against sections of the press. &quot; They closed by advising &quot; the formation of a Press Tribunal to address complaints, and a Press Institute to provide continuous scientific study of the Press. &quot; [ See also ] List of newspapers in the United Kingdom Online Newspapers The English Mercurie, a hoax newsbook from the 18th century.
