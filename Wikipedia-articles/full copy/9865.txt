[ April 2011 ] [ European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Logo of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Sir Graham Watson MEP March 1976 (as &quot; Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe &quot; ) 30 April 2004 (as formal Party) Liberalism, Conservative liberalism, Social liberalism http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu.html Liberal International Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe European Liberal Youth European Liberal Forum Gold and Blue Rue Montoyer 31, 1000 Brussels, Belgium ] The European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is a European political party mainly active in the European Union, composed of 51 national-level liberal and liberal-democratic parties from across Europe. Having developed from a loose confederation of national political parties in the 1970s, the ELDR is now a recognised European political party incorporated as a non-profit association under Belgian law. Despite this legal status, the ELDR party has yet to achieve significant grassroots involvement and retains much of the character of a mere confederation of national political parties. [ February 2010 ] ELDR is affiliated to the Liberal International. As of 2010, the ELDR is the third largest political party represented in European Union institutions, with 75 Members of the European Parliament and 8 members of the European Commission. Of the 27 member states of the European Union, there are two with ELDR-affiliated Prime Ministers: Andrus Ansip in Estonia ( Reform Party ), and Mark Rutte in the Netherlands ( VVD ). Furthermore, the leader of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), Philipp Rösler, serves as Vice-Chancellor of Germany and the leader of the British Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, serves as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Liberals are also in government in eight other EU member states: Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. Since 20 July 2004, ELDR is politically represented in the European Parliament by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) parliamentary group, formed in conjunction with the European Democratic Party. The ALDE parliamentary group is led by Guy Verhofstadt, a former Prime Minister of Belgium. The ELDR party was previously attached to the ELDR Group. The youth wing of ELDR is the European Liberal Youth (LYMEC), which is predominantly based upon youth and student liberal organisations from across Europe but also contains a small number of individual members. LYMEC is led by German politician Alexander Plahr (FDP, Germany), who was elected to a two-year term as LYMEC President in May 2010, and has a collective membership of over 200,000 young liberal Europeans. [ Leadership ] The leader of ELDR is Sir Graham Watson MEP. He was elected President for a two-year mandate on 25 November 2011 at the Congress in Palermo, Italy. Following his election, Sir Graham said: &quot; I am honoured that ELDR has chosen me to lead our great party. I pledge to strengthen European Liberalism, support Liberal parties across our continent and build up the ELDR by opening its doors to new members. &quot; &quot; My three main goals will be to expand our Party, to update its campaign techniques and to build it into a party which is truly pan-European in its thinking. &quot; &quot; The multiple crises we are currently mired in - economic, political and environmental - are an opportunity for Liberals to show what we are made of. &quot; &quot; It is our job as Liberals to explain how we offer a real, principled and economically responsible alternative to the behemoths of conservatism and socialism. And as President of ELDR I intend to do just that. &quot; [ Structure ] [ Bureau ] The day to day management of the ELDR Party is handled by the Bureau, the members of which are: [ President ] Graham Watson MEP ( Liberal Democrats, United Kingdom): ELDR Party President [ Vice-Presidents ] Marc Guerrero ( CDC, Spain) Lousewies van der Laan ( Democrats 66, Netherlands) Alexander Graf Lambsdorff MEP ( FDP, Germany) Leoluca Orlando MP ( Italy of Values, Italy) Vesna Pusić MP ( HNS, Croatia) Dick Roche ( Fianna Fáil, Ireland) Astrid Thors MP ( Swedish People&apos;s Party of Finland, Finland) [ Treasurer ] Roman Jakic (Zares, Slovenia) [ ALDE group leaders ] Guy Verhofstadt MEP (OpenVLD, Belgium): ALDE Group Leader, European Parliament Anne Brasseur ( DP, Luxembourg): President of Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (ALDE-PACE) Flo Clucas (Liberal Democrats, United Kingdom): ALDE Group Leader, EU Committee of the Regions [ Other party officials ] Federica Sabbati (Italy): ELDR Party Secretary-General Alexander Beels ( VVD, Netherlands): ALDE Group Secretary-General Alexander Plahr (FDP, Germany): President, European Liberal Youth (LYMEC) Hans van Baalen MEP (VVD, Netherlands): President, Liberal International [ ELDR Congress ] The ELDR Congress is the sovereign body of the ELDR corporation, usually meeting on an annual basis, and as such its primary purposes are to: Elect members of the ELDR Bureau Debate, and adopt, resolutions on matters of policy; Adopt the ELDR Party&apos;s electoral manifesto for European Parliament elections Make amendments to the ELDR Party Statutes The voting members of the ELDR Congress number around 600–700, and are composed of: Members of the ELDR Council A number of representatives nominated by each of the Member Parties based on the number of votes that Party received at the last set of European Parliament elections, 2 representatives nominated by each of the Affiliate Parties, and 10 representatives nominated by the European Liberal Youth.

In March 1976, the Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe was established, which gradually evolved into the ELDR Party with a matching group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party. At an extraordinary Congress in Brussels held on 30 April 2004 the day before the enlargement of the European Union, the ELDR Party incorporated itself under Belgian law and later became a European political party. The ELDR Europarty allied with the European Democratic Party in 2004 to form the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with a matching group in the European Parliament.
