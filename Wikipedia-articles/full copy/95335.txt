[ DA ] {, } [ SE ] { 020, 01322 } The London Borough of Bexley ( [ En-uk-LBBexley.ogg pronunciation ] ) lies in south east Greater London, and is a borough referred to as part of Outer London. It has common borders with the London Borough of Bromley to the south, the Royal Borough of Greenwich to the west, across the River Thames to the north it borders the London Borough of Havering, the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and a small boundary with the unitary authority Thurrock in Essex to the north east, to the east it borders the Dartford borough in Kent and to the south east a tiny boundary with the Sevenoaks district of Kent. The borough is within the Thames Gateway, an area designated as a national priority for urban regeneration. [ History ] Prior to the 19th century the area now forming the Borough was practically unoccupied: very few of the present settlements were mentioned in the Domesday Book, although the village of Bexley has a charter dated 814CE. { A brief history of Bexley } Erith was a port on the River Thames until the 17th century; the opening of the sewage works at nearby Crossness in the late 19th century turned it into an industrial town. Today&apos;s settlement pattern is the result of the gradual extension of the London influence. Until the 19th century it was an area with few isolated buildings: examples being the Georgian Danson House and the Red House on Bexley Heath built for William Morris in 1859. With the coming of the railways building began apace, although the area is still composed of many disconnected settlements, interspersed with area of open ground and parks. The London Borough of Bexley was formed in 1965, under the London Government Act 1963 from the Municipal Boroughs of Bexley and Erith; Crayford Urban District : and part of Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District. { The other part of that Urban District becoming part of the } { London Borough of Bromley } The Council now styles itself the &quot; London Borough of Bexley &quot; in common with its formal name, although it previously styled itself &quot; Bexley London Borough &quot; until 1999 (possibly to maintain the link with its predecessor, Bexley Municipal Borough), and &quot; Bexley Council &quot; from 1999 to October 2007, when it reverted to its full formal name in conjunction with the adoption of a new Council logo bearing this name alongside the 1965 Coat of Arms. { http://reports.bexley.gov.uk/TROVEPROGS/TROVEIIS.DLL?/IS=1061165973/LI=07_Decisions/ID=40/OS=2+12/DS=838/LO=1/XD=838/RW=1600/RH=1200/VD=07Decisi/WV=7/FR=1/ST=ac/AC=CA/FI=10/HU=EmptyURL reports.bexley.gov.uk } The town of Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of the city of Columbus, was named at the suggestion of an early resident, Mr. Kilbourne, in honour of his family&apos;s roots in Bexley, England. In addition, a suburb of Sydney, Australia bears the name of Bexley, New South Wales. Also, a suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand is named Bexley. [ Governance ] The 21 wards of the London Borough of Bexley (green) and surrounding London boroughs (light grey) and other districts (dark grey) The administrative centre of the Borough is in Bexleyheath. There are 21 wards represented on Bexley Council; each ward elects three councillors, 63 in all. { Details of all councillors by ward } The wards are shown on the accompanying map. All seats were up for re-election during the election on May 4, 2006. Until that date, Labour held control of the council by a margin of one (32 Labour to 31 Conservative councillors). In the election, the Conservatives took 23 seats from Labour, giving them the majority. Insofar as central government is concerned, the borough is divided among the constituencies of Old Bexley and Sidcup; Erith and Thamesmead (shared with the Royal Borough of Greenwich ); and Bexleyheath and Crayford. After the 2005 General Election, Erith and Thamesmead is represented by a Labour Party MP while the remaining two seats were held by the Conservative Party; although on 29 January 2008 the Conservative Party whip was withdrawn from Old Bexley and Sidcup&apos;s MP Derek Conway following alleged misuse of funds, leaving him as an Independent MP. [ Geography ] [ List of districts in Bexley ] Bexley, lying as it does on the outer fringe of London, has many relatively large areas of open space. The ridge of higher ground in South London crosses the Borough from its high point of Shooters Hill, on the boundary with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, to end above the River Thames at Belvedere, where the land drops down to the old port of Erith. This high land, whose geology is the sand and pebbles of the Blackheath beds, { The Rural Landscape of Kent, SG McRae and CP Burnham, Wye College, 1973 } and which results in heathland, provided the line on the old Roman road ( Watling Street ) ran between Crayford and Welling. The land falls away to the north of the high ground, across the Erith Marshes to the River Thames, which here makes a loop to the north at Crossness. There is further ridge of less higher ground from the west terminating at Sidcup. Apart from the River Thames the other rivers within the Borough are the River Darent, which, with its tributary the River Cray and the smaller Stanham River, all form part of its north-eastern boundary; and the River Shuttle, a tributary of the Cray. The major centres of settlement can be considered in two parts: the older established erstwhile villages; and the infill areas of suburban houses and centres. { Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus } Among the former are Erith, in the 17th century a port on the Thames, and an industrial town in the later 19th century; Bexleyheath, created at the same time on the London to Dover road. By the earlier 20th century, both were created Urban District Council s (UDC), as was Foots Cray (an ancient village site). Thamesmead, the &quot; new town &quot; built on what was the Erith Marshes, extends into the Borough: both Thamesmead North and South are located here. Crayford was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and its parish later included the hamlets of North End and Slade Green. Smaller settlements include Welling, like Bexleyheath a staging post on the Dover Road, which was at one time of less importance than the nearby East Wickham (also an ancient village), was absorbed in Bexley UDC. Barnes Cray and North Cray were two hamlets in the Cray Valley; and Belvedere was the location of a medieval monastery. The map of Bexley { Map of Bexley } shows that a large proportion of its area comprises suburb ia. Some named places, like Albany Park and Barnehurst, are names given to developments engendered by the building of the railways. Some came into being when large estates and farmland were broken up for the sole purpose of suburban building: these include Blackfen, Lamorbey and part of Falconwood. Others simply reflect the nature of area: Lessness Heath; Longlands (part of Sidcup); Northumberland Heath and West Heath. [ Bexley parks and open spaces ] There are still open spaces, however, among the suburban streets and avenues. the Borough owns and maintains over one hundred parks and open spaces, large and small; and there is still a part of the Erith Marshes bordering the River Thames. The Crayford Marshes lie to the east of that river, as do Foots Cray Meadows further south. The largest of the open spaces are Lesnes Abbey Woods, Danson Park and Hall Place Gardens. There are also many golf courses and sports fields, particularly to the west of Crayford.

This rose slowly throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; reaching 10,963 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London. In the 2001 Census, the borough has a population of 218,307 – of whom 105,148 were male, and 113,159 female. Of the population, 44.3% were in full-time employment and 11.6% in part-time employment – compared to a London average of 42.6% and 8.6%, respectively. Residents were predominantly owner-occupiers, with 31.7% owning their house outright, and a further 46.5% owning with a mortgage. Only 2.2% were in local authority housing, with a further 11.5% renting from a housing association, or other registered social landlord. { &apos;&apos;Key Figures for 2001 Census: Census Area Statistics: Bexley&apos;&apos; accessed 25 February 2009 } [ Transport ] There are three suburban railway lines crossing the Borough, all destined to come together at Dartford. The most northerly is the North Kent Line : stations from west to east within the Borough are at Belvedere, Erith and Slade Green. The Bexleyheath Line has stations at Falconwood, (of which is the nearest to central London ) Welling, Bexleyheath and Barnehurst; whilst the most southerly of the three lines, the Dartford Loop Line, serves Sidcup, Albany Park, Bexley and Crayford. In common with many other boroughs south of the Thames, Bexley has no London Underground lines or any other London based transport methods like London Tramlink, the Docklands Light Railway or London Overground. However the upcoming Crossrail services may serve the borough on the North Kent Line, if a planned extension will take place from Abbey Wood. This plan is still in the proposal stage as of 2010. The principal roads through the Borough include the A2 trunk road; the A20 (Sidcup By-Pass) which generally marks its southern boundary; the A207, which is the route of the erstwhile Watling Street; the A206 which takes traffic from Woolwich and Dartford; and the latter&apos;s newer counterpart, the A2016 through Thamesmead. There are also some Long-distance footpath s in the Borough: among them the Thames Path and the London Outer Orbital Path. Bexley Borough has joined with three other adjoining boroughs to for the South East London Green Chain linking green spaces. London Buses routes: 51, 89, 96, 99, 132, 160, 177, 180, 229, 233, 244, 269, 286, 321, 401, 422, 428, 469, 472, 486, 492, B11, B12, B13, B14, B15, B16, R11, Night Routes N1, N21 and N89. [ Education ] [ List of schools in the London Borough of Bexley ] [ Local politics ] The Conservatives held 52 council seats, down 2 and Labour held 11 council seats, up 2. The Lib’ Dem’s saw their percentage of the vote go up by 2% in 2010, but still failed to get any councillors elected in 2006 and 2010. { http://democracy.bexley.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=1 &amp; RPID=1321054 } { http://democracy.bexley.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=3 &amp; RPID=1321059 } [ Religion ] The distinctive spire of St Mary the Virgin Church in Bexley The greater part of the population are nominal Anglicans, but a number of Roman Catholic churches and non-conformist congregations exist. In the 2001 Census, 22.7% of the area&apos;s population described themselves as non-religious or chose not to state their faith. { http://www.bexley.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4528 } Baptists, Plymouth Brethren, Methodist are among the other congregations. In 2008 the former Crayford Methodist Church was purchased by the North West Kent Muslim Association to become a mosque serving Bexley and Dartford boroughs. There are no Jewish congregations.
