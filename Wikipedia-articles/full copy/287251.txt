It is owned and promoted by Centro, and operated by West Midlands Travel Limited, [ http://nxbus.co.uk/the-metro/about/ About the Metro National Express Group 19 October 2010 ] a subsidiary of the National Express Group (NEG), under the brand name Travel Midland Metro (TMM). The current line opened in 1999, mostly using a disused railway trackbed. In Birmingham, it terminates at Snow Hill station. An extension to the line, allowing trams to run into Birmingham city centre, was approved in 2012, and is expected to be operational by 2015. Various other extensions, including entirely new lines, have been proposed but not yet approved.

It would have involved property demolition, [ http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1990/oct/22/midland-metro-bill Midland Metro Bill 22 October 1990 ] and was to have been the first of a series of tramways known as the &apos;Light Rail Transit&apos; system. Centro&apos;s proposals included converting the Hall Green to Shirley portion of the North Warwickshire railway to a tramway, and closing the remainder. A tramway to West Bromwich was to run along the Soho Road, with the parallel Great Western Railway right of way used for a by-pass. The Redditch to Lichfield rail service was to be discontinued, and its Aston to Sutton Coldfield section used as a tramway. [ Light Rail Transit for the West Midlands West Midlands County Council and West Midlands PTE 1984 ] The Clock Garage line, spearheaded by Wednesfield Labour councillor Phil Bateman, { Boynton (2001), p.73. } was eventually abandoned in the face of public opposition, { Boynton (2001), p.74. } and the Transport Executive was unable to find a Member of Parliament willing to sponsor an enabling Bill. [ Inception of the current system ] Following the establishment of a new Passenger Transport Authority in 1986, a light-rail scheme under the present name &quot; Midland Metro &quot; was revived with a different set of lines. The first of up to fifteen lines was intended be operating by the end of 1993, and a substantial network of 200 kilometres of tram lines was planned to be in use by 2000. [ Annual Report 1988-1989 West Midlands PTE ] In February 1988 it was announced that the first route would be between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, using a disused railway trackbed, a route which had not been included in the 1985 recommended network. A Bill to give Centro the powers to construct the line was deposited in Parliament in November 1988, and became an Act of Parliament a year later. [ Midland Metro, The Metro Project http://www.lrta.org/mmhist.html 25 March 2012 LRTA ] The Clock Garage line was subsequently revived in modified form, [ Midland Metro Line 2 map WMPTE ] as Midland Metro Line 2, with a new eastern terminus in Chelmsley Wood. Line 2 was intended to be extended from Chelmsley Wood to Birmingham Airport. Proposals were published to extend Line 1 to the Bullring shopping centre and build Line 2, and powers to build them were obtained. Neither Line 2 nor Line 3 (Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley and Merry Hill) were built, and powers to build them lapsed in 1997. { Boynton (2001), p.99. } [ Construction ] Tram 13 on former railway section.

[ March 2012 ] [ Economics ] At the time of Line 1&apos;s opening, the contractors who ran the line Altram, was a for-profit company owned by John Laing, Ansaldo, and West Midlands Travel. Soon after opening, it became evident to all three partners that Metro operating revenues would not cover costs. In 2001 Ansaldo decided it was &quot; not prepared to invest further monies in a loss-making venture which showed no prospect of ever becoming profitable &quot;. Laing &quot; felt there was no economic future in Altram and that to contribute further funds would only increase its loss in what it believed to be a failing project &quot;. In February 2003, The Times reported that the Metro&apos;s auditors had refused to sign off its accounts as a going concern. [ http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1179161.ece Auditors at Midland Metro refuse to sign off accounts The Times 12 February 2003 London Mark Court 12 May 2010 ] Michael J.

[ Letters Parker, Michael J. Solihull News 9 November 1990 ] Ansaldo and Laing had ceased practical involvement as early as 2003, but their official exit took place in 2006. Day-to-day operation of the tramway is in the hands of Travel Midland Metro, with losses largely covered by cross-subsidies from other parts of National Express&apos;s business.

CfIT estimated that the fare required for Midland Metro to break even was twice that of Manchester Metrolink, Tramlink (Croydon), and the Tyne and Wear Metro.
