[ History ] [ Formation, Get Some and death of Lynn Strait (1995–1998) ] The band was formed by singer Lynn Strait, the former bassist of a local punk band, Lethal Dose, and guitarist Mike Doling, formerly of Kronix. After building a strong following with performances in Los Angeles, Snot signed with Geffen Records, and began work on their debut album, Get Some, released on May 27, 1997. Although the album received positive critical notice, sales were disappointing. The band performed on the 1998 Ozzfest tour. On July 9, 1998, Strait was arrested in Mansfield, Massachusetts, for indecent exposure after emerging nude from the oversized toilet prop used by Limp Bizkit in their performances.

On December 11, 1998, Strait died in a car accident when a truck struck his car, killing him and his boxer, Dobbs. The band disbanded following Strait&apos;s death.
