The conclusion reached by this Advisory Committee was that the risk of permanent injury may outweigh the potential benefits. Subsequent to this meeting, which took place in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that it is their intention to continue to pursue the licensing of the fluoroquinolones for pediatric use in the United States, in spite of these findings. [ Special precautions ] Levofloxacin should be administered only as described within the Dosage Guidelines table found within the most current package insert. The status of the patient&apos;s renal function and hepatic function must also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Levofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver and the intestine. Modification of the dosage is recommended using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function (particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction). Within the package insert, it is stated &quot;...since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. &quot; The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection, in the range of 3 days to 60 days. Note: The patient&apos;s serum levels should be monitored during therapy to avoid a drug overdose.

The patient should be observed and appropriate hydration maintained. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [ Pharmacology ] Levofloxacin is the L-isomer of the racemate ofloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent.In chemical terms, levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is the pure(-)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug substance ofloxacin. The chemical name is (-)-(S)-9fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]-1,4benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate. The empirical formula is C 18 &lt; /sup &gt; H 20 FN 3 O 4 • ½ H2O, and the molecular weight is 370.38. Levofloxacin is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. Some of the endogenous compounds that are affected by the levofloxacin include GABA receptors (inhibitor), OCTN2 (inhibitor), [ Hirano T, Yasuda S, Osaka Y The inhibitory effects of fluoroquinolones on L-carnitine transport in placental cell line BeWo International Journal of Pharmaceutics 351 1–2 113–8 2008 March 17977676 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.09.022 ] blood glucose (alteration) potassium channels (in myocardial cells - inhibitor), [ Friedrich LV.

The ICH E14 guidelines recommend a threshold of around 5 ms for a positive QT/QTc study. The largest time-matched difference in QTc for levofloxacin suggests the potential for use in more rigorous QT/QTc studies. { Levofloxacin can be used effectively as a positive control in thorough QT/QTc studies in healthy volunteers } [ Taubel Jorg Naseem, A., Harada, T., Wang, D., Arezina, R., Lorch, U. and Camm, A.

Levofloxacin is rapidly and, in essence, completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The plasma concentration profile of levofloxacin after IV administration is similar and comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to that observed for LEVAQUIN Tablets when equal doses (mg/mg) are administered. Levofloxacin is excreted largely as unchanged drug in the urine. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. Glucuronidation and hydroxylation have been cited as one of the major metabolic pathways for levofloxacin hydrochloride. [ http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00478 Showing drug card for Rimantadine (DB00478) Canada 23 June 2009 ] However the drug card for levofloxacin ( DB01137 ) states that the biotransformation information is not available. Specific information regarding biotransformation does not appear to be readily available within the package inserts. [ Mechanism of action ] Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase iv, [ Drlica K, Zhao X DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 61 3 377–92 1 September 1997 9293187 232616 http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D9293187 ] which is an enzyme necessary to separate replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. The fluoroquinolones interfere with DNA replication by inhibiting an enzyme complex called DNA gyrase. This can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases, and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and in vivo tumor models. Although the quinolone is highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known. Quinolone-induced DNA damage was first reported in 1986.

Indeed, a distinctive feature of drugs based on the quinolone structure is their remarkable ability to target different type II topoisomerase enzymes. In particular, some congeners of this drug family display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases, but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and in vivo tumor models ] [ Interactions ] The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Coadministration may dangerously increase warfarin (Coumadin) activity; INR should be monitored closely. They may also interact with the GABA A receptor and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug s. [ Brouwers JR Drug interactions with quinolone antibacterials Drug Saf 7 4 268–81 1992 1524699 10.2165/00002018-199207040-00003 ] Quercetin, a flavonol, a kind of flavonoid, occasionally used as a dietary supplement, may interact with fluoroquinolones, as quercetin competitively binds to bacterial DNA gyrase. Some foods such as garlic and apple s contain high levels of quercetin; whether this inhibits or enhances the effect of fluoroquinolones is not entirely clear. [ Hilliard JJ, Krause HM, Bernstein JI A comparison of active site binding of 4-quinolones and novel flavone gyrase inhibitors to DNA gyrase Adv Exp Med Biol. 390 59–69 1995 8718602 ] Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with levofloxacin. However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, and enhance the effects of the warfarin and its derivatives. In patients receiving systemic cyclosporine concomitantly, transient elevations in serum creatinine has been noted. [ Significant drug interactions ] Levofloxacin has been reported to interact with a significant number of other drugs, as well as a number of herbal and natural supplements. Such interactions increased the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias, anticoagulant effects, the formation of non-absorbable complexes, as well as increasing the risk of toxicity. Some drug interactions are associated with molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and theophylline. The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine [ Harder S, Fuhr U, Staib AH, Wolff T Ciprofloxacin-caffeine: a drug interaction established using in vivo and in vitro investigations Am. J. Med. 87 5A 89S–91S 1989 November 2589393 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90031-4 ] and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose. Ciprofloxacin has been shown to interact with thyroid medications (levothyroxine) resulting in unexplained hypothyroidism. [ Cooper JG, Harboe K, Frost SK, Skadberg Ø Ciprofloxacin interacts with thyroid replacement therapy BMJ 330 7498 1002 2005 April 15860826 557149 10.1136/bmj.330.7498.1002 http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7498/1002 ] As such it is possible that levofloxacin may interact with thyroid medications as well. The use of NSAIDs (Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contraindicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of GABA neurotransmission. [ Domagala JM Structure-activity and structure-side-effect relationships for the quinolone antibacterials J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 33 4 685–706 1994 April 8056688 10.1093/jac/33.4.685 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/4/685 ] Whether or not such reactions occur after completion of therapy is unclear. Patients have reported reactions to NSAIDS long after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy, but there does not appear to be any research that would either confirm or deny this association other than these anecdotal reports. Some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine ) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side-effects of the coadministered drug. In addition, other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline. [ Janknegt R Drug interactions with quinolones J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 26 Suppl D 7–29 1990 November 2286594 ] Such drug interactions appear to be related to the structural changes of the quinolone ring and the inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system. As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug-specific rather than a class effect. Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients also taking the fluoroquinolones. This effect seems to be restricted to people aged 60 or over and within this group concomitant use of corticosteroids increases this risk substantially.

Of the fluoroquinolones, Ofloxacin and Levofloxacin are most likely to cause false positive results. Most levels detected are below (2000  ng/mL). A false-positive result may be ruled out by using a more specific test, usually gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Therefore, any patient who screens positive for opiates but denies taking them and has recently taken a Fluoroquinolone should be offered more specific testing. [ Zacher JL Givone DM False-positive urine opiate screening associated with fluoroquinolone use Ann Pharmacother 2004 38 1525–1528 ] Concommitant use with cardiac antidysrhythmics that prolong the QT interval should not be used in combination with levofloxacin due to the risk of torsades and R on T syndrome. Common medications still in use today include amiodarone, tykosin, and propafenone. Older medication such as ethmozine, quinidine, and mexilitine should be avoided as well.

International Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance 2005. } There are three known mechanisms of resistance. Some types of efflux pumps can act to decrease intracellular quinolone concentration. In gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to DNA gyrase, protecting it from the action of quinolones.

Novopharm was prevented from making, using, offering to sell, or selling a generic version of levofloxacin tablets in the Canadian market until the expiration of patent on June 23, 2009. Novopharm&apos;s generic version of Levaquin, had been sold in Canada since 2004. [ Current litigation ] An official complaint has been filed by The US Justice Department with a Federal Court in Boston (January 2010) accusing Johnson and Johnson of illegally paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Omnicare, one of the nation&apos;s largest pharmacies specializing in nursing home patients. In return, Omnicare nearly tripled its annual purchase of Johnson and Johnson&apos;s products; including Levaquin. The sales of Levaquin overtook other leading medications like Ciprofloxacin over a five year period between 1999 and 2004. These sales increased dramatically despite the growing reports concerning the severe adverse reactions associated with such therapy in the elderly.
