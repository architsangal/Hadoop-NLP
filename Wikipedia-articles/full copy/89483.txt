Its southern terminus is at Interstate 40 in Dandridge, Tennessee; its northern terminus is on Wellesley Island (near Fishers Landing, New York ) at the Canadian border, where the Thousand Islands Bridge connects it to Highway 401, the main freeway connecting Detroit to Toronto and Toronto to Montreal. Interstate 81 largely traces the paths created down the length of the Appalachian Mountains by migrating animals, Native Americans and early settlers.It also became a major corridor for troop movements during the Civil War. These trails and roadways gradually evolved into U.S. Route 11. Interstate 81 parallels much of the older Route 11. { Perrier, Dianne. (2010) Interstate 81: Great Warriors Trace. University Press of Florida. } Being mostly rural, it is heavily used as a trucking corridor, often as a bypass of the busier Interstate 95 to the east. The Interstate 81 Corridor Coalition, a six-state coalition, was organized to handle issues along Interstate 81, such as truck traffic and air pollution. As of October 15, 2008, this commission has met twice. { I-81 Safety Conference } { I-81 Corridor group } [ Route description ] |-| TN || 75 ||121|-| VA || 323 || 520|-| WV || 23 ||37|-| MD || 11 ||18|-| PA || 234 ||377|-| NY || 183 || 294|} [ Tennessee and Virginia ] Main articles: Interstate 81 in: Tennessee | Virginia Interstate 81 begins in Tennessee at Interstate 40 in Dandridge. The route parallels the Appalachian Mountains for much of its route through Tennessee and Virginia, serving such cities as the twin cities of Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia, Roanoke, Blacksburg, Lexington, Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Winchester. In Harrisonburg, I-81 cuts through James Madison University. It parallels its older counterpart, U.S. Route 11, for its entire length in Virginia. In July 2009, due to budgetary constraints, Virginia closed seven rest stops along I-81 in rural Virginia; however, in January 2010, it was announced that all rest areas will be reopened in the following months.

It then traverses the state of Maryland at one of its narrowest points, passing through the &quot; Hub City &quot; of Hagerstown where it intersects with a large number of other routes. [ Pennsylvania ] [ Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania ] Interstate 81 forms a major north –south corridor through the state of Pennsylvania, serving the boroughs of Chambersburg and Carlisle, where it meets the Pennsylvania Turnpike but does not directly interchange with it (motorists must use US 11 to connect). Around the state capital of Harrisburg, the route forms the northeastern section of Pennsylvania&apos;s Capital Beltway. The route then travels northeast toward the Wyoming Valley, where it serves the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, then heads north through the Endless Mountains region toward the state line. Although it is signed as a north–south highway, it is distinctly northeast–southwest and occasionally east–west throughout the state. [ New York ] [ Interstate 81 in New York ] Interstate 81 enters the state of New York near Binghamton. It parallels U.S. Route 11 in a north –south direction, through much of the state, serving the cities of Syracuse (where it intersects the New York State Thruway ), and Watertown. The route ends at the Canadian border at the Thousand Islands Bridge, where it crosses the St. Lawrence River, continuing as a short connector, Highway 137, which serves the Thousand Islands Parkway and Highway 401.
