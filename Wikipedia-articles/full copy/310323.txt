(2003) } Reinventing the Steel is the ninth and final studio album by heavy metal band Pantera. It was released through EastWest Records, on March 14, 2000. [ Album information ] In Australia a two-disc Tour Edition of the album was released. The first disc consists of the album proper, while the second is an unofficial hits compilation. This is now a collector&apos;s item. An edited version of the song &quot; Death Rattle &quot; was used on an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants titled &quot; Pre-Hibernation Week &quot;. This track was also featured on SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights, released August 14, 2001. [ Lyrics and style ] Reinventing the Steel contains lyrics mostly about the band itself, as on &quot; We&apos;ll Grind that Axe for a Long Time &quot; (where the band members tell about how they have kept it &quot; true &quot; throughout the years, while many of their peers &quot; sucked up for the fame &quot; ) and &quot; I&apos;ll Cast a Shadow &quot; (about Pantera&apos;s influence on the genre). There are also songs about their fans, like &quot; Goddamn Electric &quot; and &quot; You&apos;ve Got to Belong To It &quot;. &quot; Goddamn Electric &quot; mentions Black Sabbath, and Slayer, two of the band&apos;s main influences. The band members dedicated Reinventing the Steel to their fans, whom they viewed as their brothers and sisters. [ Cover art ] The cover art is a snapshot taken from the video of &quot; Revolution Is My Name &quot;, the first single of the album.

Rolling Stone (5/25/00, p.  73) - 3.5 stars out of 5 - &quot; Metal-revivalist....relying on the genre&apos;s primal elements of rage and analog noise...chopped up with squealing dissonance....brutal enough to please underground purists and familiar enough for weekend headbangers. &quot; Entertainment Weekly (3/24/00, p.  102) - &quot;...resumes their scorched-earth policy with vigor....dropping aural anvils [along] with a dash of inventiveness... &quot; - Rating: B+ [ http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C275778%2C00.html Reinventing the Steel Review Entertainment Weekly David Hiltbrand 2000-03-24 2012-05-13 ] &apos;&apos;Q&apos;&apos;

An undiluted, unvarnished slab of riffs paying distinct homage to Judas Priest&apos;s British Steel, and not just in a titular sense, but in basic song construction. &quot; CMJ (4/3/00, p.  32) - &quot; Crammed with everything they&apos;ve used to revolutionize metal....so old-school it could have been easily made in between the quartet&apos;s back-to-back classics. &quot; NME (4/15/00, p.  34) - 6 out of 10 - &quot; An unfashionably old-school metal album....it&apos;s Pantera&apos;s bid to herald the rebirth of bullet-belt, cut-off denim metal....It&apos;s a solid album, oozing drunk-as-hell metal spirit. &quot;
