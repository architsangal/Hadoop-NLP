[ March 2012 ] [ mdy 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 0449849 } [ mdy 3 ] Valparaiso ( [ icon ˌ v ɑː l p ə ˈ r eɪ z oʊ ] [ vahl-pə RAY zoh ] ) is a city in, and is the county seat of, Porter County, Indiana, United States. [ mdy 6 ] The population was 31,730 at the 2010 census, making it the second-largest city in Porter County. [ History ] The site of present-day Valparaiso was included in the purchase of land from the Potawatomi Indians by the U.S. Government in October 1832. Chiqua&apos;s town or Chipuaw { One of the earliest Authentic histories of Porter County, Indiana, From 1832 to 1876; Deborah H. Shults-Gay; ca 1917 } was located a mile east of the current Courthouse along the Sauk Trail. Chiqua&apos;s town existed from at or before 1830 until after 1832. { Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History; Helen Hornbeck Tanner; University of Oklahoma Press; Norman,Oklahoma, 1987; map 25 } The location is just north of the railroad crossing on State Route 2 and County Road 400 North. Located on the ancient Indian trail from Rock Island to Detroit, the town had its first log cabin in 1834. { Valparaiso City Employees. &quot; City History. &quot; City of Valparaiso. 14 Feb 2008 } This log cabin was later used as the hiding place of Charles Manson in 1975. Established in 1836 as Portersville, county seat of Porter County, it was renamed to Valparaiso (meaning &quot; Valley of Paradise &quot; in Spanish) in 1837 after Valparaíso, Chile, near which the county&apos;s namesake David Porter battled in the War of 1812. [ Ronald L. Baker Marvin Carmony Indiana Place Names Indiana University Press Bloomington 1995 0-253-28340-X 170 ] The city was once called the &quot; City of Churches &quot; due to the large number of churches it was home to at the end of the 19th Century. The city also has a long history of being a travel hub for the region. In 1858 the Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne, and Chicago Railroad reached Valparaiso and connected the city directly to Chicago. By 1910 an interurban railway had connected the city to Gary, Indiana. Today, while the city no longer has a passenger train station, it is still very much a part of the &quot; Crossroads of America &quot; due to its proximity to I-94, I-80, I-90, and I-65.Until 1991 it was the terminal of Amtrak &apos;s Calumet commuter service. [ Flag ] Inspired by the sights of rolling hills topped with trees and surrounding rich farmland, the flag&apos;s primary color is green. White, being a symbol of purity, was chosen as a secondary color to represent the city&apos;s deep religious roots. Gold was chosen as a third color to represent the quality of schooling, community life, and government in the area. Emblazoned on the flag is a &quot; V &quot; which stands for the V&apos;s of Valparaiso: Valparaiso University, Valparaiso High School, and Valparaiso Technical Institute. The center circle of the flag contains the Valparaiso University Chapel of the Resurrection (for education), a symbol for a church, a tree (for agriculture), and a gear (for industry). The Words &quot; Valparaiso, Indiana &quot; as well as the date of conception, 1866, are found encircling the four symbols. [ Geography ] Valparaiso is located at [ 41 28 34 N 87 3 25 W type:city ] (41.476151, -87.056919). [ mdy 1 ] The city is situated at the junctions of U.S. Route 30, State Road 2, Interstate 80, and State Road 49. According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of [ 15.58 sqmi ], of which [ 15.53 sqmi ] (or 99.68%) is land and [ 0.05 sqmi ] (or 0.32%) is water. [ http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_18.txt 2010 Census U.S. Gazetteer Files for Places – Indiana United States Census 2012-04-21 ] TopographyThe city is situated on the Valparaiso Moraine, which is near the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Glatiation has left numerous features on the landscape here. Perhaps hundreds of Kettle lakes and knobs make up the majority of this hilly area of northwest Indiana. The Pines Ski Area is the only remaining Kame in the city; the other one is under the university&apos;s Chapel of the Resurrection, however, grading of land in that area makes that particular kame almost nonexistent. Many glacial erratics can be found throughout the city. The moraine has left the city with mostly clay soil.

The official history of Valparaiso University was written by Richard Baepler. His Flame of Faith, Lamp of Learning details the history of the university from its Methodist roots in 1859 to its reputation as a Lutheran University (1925). The intellectual story of Valparaiso University in the post-war years might be best summarized by John Strietelmeier who wrote that what united the VU thinkers of this period was &quot; the dream that somewhere there might be a place where high faith and high intellect might meet to provide an apostate age with a new vision and a new hope. &quot; Streietelmeier was a Professor in Geography and an Editor of the University&apos;s &quot; The Cresset. &quot; His writings represent a critical set of impressions from the 1950s and 1960s at VU and are collected by Baepler in his Witness to His Generation: Selected Writings of John Strietelmeier along with a significant biography of Strietelmeier&apos;s life and intellectual context.

On October 1, 2007, Valparaiso inaugurated a city bus service, the V-Line. It operates between downtown, the university, shopping centers and the city&apos;s northern neighborhoods. It also offers an express service to the Indiana Dunes at the Dune Park train station of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transit District Friday though Sunday (Friday through Saturday during Valparaiso University&apos;s spring, summer and winter breaks), timed to meet certain trains. V-Line does not operate on holidays. A commuter bus service to Chicago started later this year and is called ChicaGo Dash. Its main station and hub are at Valparaiso&apos;s Village Station, a former railroad depot. It was designed eventually to serve as a Northern Indiana Commuter Transit District train station as well. The trains were meant to go be linked to the South Shore line and will go to and from Chicago picking up passengers along the way. However, the recent studies suggested that the originally proposed route would not attract enough passengers to be sustainable. NICTD is currently considering alternative routing though Gary in hopes that this will prove to be more viable. Valparaiso is served by three highways- U.S. Route 30 serves as the major east-west artery on the southern side of the city, Indiana Route 49 serves as the major north-south artery connecting it with Chesterton, Indiana and the Indiana Toll Road. Indiana Route 130 serves as a northwest-southeast route connecting it with Hobart, Indiana. The three major railroads that have tracks passing through the city are Norfolk Southern Railway, Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad, and Canadian National Railway. The Norfolk Southern Railway operates on the tracks that were previously used by the Nickel Plate Road, and the CF &amp; E Railroad operates on the tracks that were previously used by the Pennsylvania Railroad. [ Buildings of Note ] Porter County Courthouse (Indiana) replaced an earlier brick building in 1883. The current building is 128 feet by 98 feet. It was built with a square tower rising out of the center. The tower was 168 feet tall with a clock on each side. A fire in 1934 damaged in the interior requiring the removal of the tower.
