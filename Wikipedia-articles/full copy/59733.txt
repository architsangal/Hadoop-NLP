[ Even polygon stat table p6 ] In geometry, a hexagon (from Greek ἕξ hex, &quot; six &quot; ) is a polygon with six edges and six vertices. A regular hexagon has Schläfli symbol {6}. The total of the internal angles of any hexagon is 720°. [ Regular hexagon ] { compass and straightedge, given by } { Euclid &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { Elements &apos;&apos;, Book IV, Proposition 15. } A regular hexagon has all sides of the same length, and all internal angle s are 120 degrees. A regular hexagon has 6 rotational symmetries (rotational symmetry of order six) and 6 reflection symmetries (six lines of symmetry), making up the dihedral group D 6. The longest diagonals of a regular hexagon, connecting diametrically opposite vertices, are twice the length of one side. From this it can be seen that a triangle with a vertex at the center of the regular hexagon and sharing one side with the hexagon is equilateral, and that the regular hexagon can be partitioned into six equilateral triangles. Like square s and equilateral triangle s, regular hexagons fit together without any gaps to tile the plane (three hexagons meeting at every vertex), and so are useful for constructing tessellation s. The cells of a beehive honeycomb are hexagonal for this reason and because the shape makes efficient use of space and building materials. The Voronoi diagram of a regular triangular lattice is the honeycomb tessellation of hexagons. It is not usually considered a triambus, although it is equilateral. The area of a regular hexagon of side length t is given by A = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 \simeq 2.598076211 t^2. An alternative formula for area is { 1.5dt } where the length d is the distance between the parallel sides (also referred to as the flat-to-flat distance), or the height of the hexagon when it sits on one side as base, or the diameter of the inscribed circle. Another alternative formula for the area if only the flat-to-flat distance, d, is known, is given by A = \frac{ \sqrt{3}}{2} d^2 \simeq 0.866025404d^2. The area can also be found by the formulas A=ap/2 and \scriptstyle A\ =\ {2}a^2\sqrt{3}\ \simeq\ 3.464102 a^2, where a is the apothem and p is the perimeter. The perimeter of a regular hexagon of side length t is 6t, its maximal diameter 2t, and its minimal diameter \scriptstyle d\ =\ t\sqrt{3}. If a regular hexagon has successive vertices A, B, C, D, E, F and if P is any point on the circumscribing circle between B and C, then { PA + PB + PC + PD }. [ Cyclic hexagon ] A cyclic hexagon is any hexagon inscribed in a circle. If the successive sides of the cyclic hexagon are a, b, c, d, e, f, then the three main diagonals intersect in a single point if and only if { bdf }. { Cartensen, Jens, &quot; About hexagons &quot;, Mathematical Spectrum 33(2) (2000-2001), 37-40. } [ Hexagon inscribed in a conic section ] Pascal&apos;s theorem (also known as the &quot; Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem &quot; ) states that if an arbitrary hexagon is inscribed in any conic section, and pairs of opposite sides are extended until they meet, the three intersection points will lie on a straight line, the &quot; Pascal line &quot; of that configuration. [ Hexagon tangential to a conic section ] Let ABCDEF be a hexagon formed by six tangent line s of a conic section. Then Brianchon&apos;s theorem states that the three main diagonals AD, BE, and CF intersect at a single point. In a hexagon that is tangential to a circle and that has consecutive sides a, b, c, d, e, and f, { Gutierrez, Antonio, &quot; Hexagon, Inscribed Circle, Tangent, Semiperimeter &quot;,, Accessed 2012-04-17. } a+c+e=b+d+f.
