{ DansGuardian blocking } { whitehouse.com. } Content-control software, also known as secure web gateways [ http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/secure-web-gateway/ IT Glossary: Secure Web Gateway Gartner 2012-03-27 ], censorware or web filtering software, is a term for software designed and optimized for controlling what content is permitted to a reader, especially when it is used to restrict material delivered over the Web. Content-control software determines what content will be available. The restrictions can be applied at various levels: a government can attempt to apply them nationwide (see Internet censorship ), or they can, for example, be applied by an ISP to its clients, by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its students, by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child&apos;s computer, or by an individual user to his or her own computer. The motive is often to prevent persons from viewing content which the computer&apos;s owner(s) or other authorities may consider objectionable; when imposed without the consent of the user, content control can constitute censorship. Some content-control software includes time control functions that empowers parents to set the amount of time that child may spend accessing the Internet or playing games or other computer activities. In some countries, such software is ubiquitous. In Cuba, if a computer user at a government controlled Internet cafe types certain words, the word processor or browser is automatically closed, and a &quot; state security &quot; warning is given.

Nannyware has also been used in both product marketing and by the media. Industry research company Gartner uses secure web gateway (SWG) to describe the market segment. Companies that make products that selectively block Web sites do not refer to these products as censorware, and prefer terms such as &quot; Internet filter &quot; or &quot; URL Filter &quot;; in the specialized case of software specifically designed to allow parents to monitor and restrict the access of their children, &quot; parental control software &quot; is also used. Some products log all sites that a user accesses and rates them based on content type for reporting to an &quot; accountability partner &quot; of the person&apos;s choosing, and the term accountability software is used. Internet filters, parental control software, and/or accountability software may also be combined into one product. Those critical of such software, however, use the term &quot; censorware &quot; freely: consider the Censorware Project, for example. [ http://censorware.net/ Censorware Project censorware.net ] [ September 2011 ] The use of the term censorware in editorials criticizing makers of such software is widespread and covers many different varieties and applications: Xeni Jardin used the term in a 9 March 2006 editorial in the New York Times when discussing the use of American-made filtering software to suppress content in China; in the same month a high school student used the term to discuss the deployment of such software in his school district. [ http://159.54.226.83/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20060319%2FCOLUMN0203%2F603190309%2F1064 ? ] [ November 2010 ] [ http://sethf.com/anticensorware/hearing_dc.php DMCA 1201 Exemption Transcript, April 11 - Censorware Sethf.com 2009-10-25 ] In general, outside of editorial pages as described above, traditional newspapers do not use the term censorware in their reporting, preferring instead to use terms such as content filter, content control, or web filtering; the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal both appear to follow this practice. On the other hand, Web-based newspapers such as CNET use the term in both editorial and journalistic contexts, for example &quot; Windows Live to Get Censorware. &quot; [ http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/windows/0%2C39020396%2C39257292%2C00.htm Windows Live to get censorware - ZDNet.co.uk News.zdnet.co.uk 2006-03-14 2009-10-25 ] [ Types of filtering ] Filters can be implemented in many different ways: by a software program on a personal computer or by servers providing Internet access. Choosing an Internet service provider (ISP) that blocks objectionable material before it enters the home can help parents who worry about their children viewing objectionable content. Most content control software is marketed to organizations or parents. It is, however, also advertised on occasion to facilitate self-censorship by people struggling with Internet addiction. Those obsessed by online pornography or gambling, chat rooms or the Internet in general, may wish to prevent or restrict their own access. A number of accountability software products marketed as self-censorship or accountability software. These are promoted at churches and via religious media. [ PostBlog http://www.urbanministry.org/wiki/accountability-software SafeFamilies.org &amp; #124; Accountability Software: Encyclopedia of Urban Ministry Urbanministry.org 2009-10-25 ] Opinions as to when this software is moral (and sometimes legal) to use vary widely with individual people being strongly in favor and against the same software used in different scenarios. Client-side filters: [ http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pro_fm_filter.html Client-side filters nap.edu ] This type of filter is installed as software on your computer. This filter can be customized to meet a family&apos;s needs. This filter can be disabled only by someone with the password. Client-side filters usually work well in places like libraries, because only some access points need to be filtered, for instance, the computers in the children&apos;s playing and reading section. Browser based filters: [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q%3Dcontent%2Bfiltering%26amp%3Bappver%3D9.0.1%26amp%3Bplatform%3Dlinux Firefox browser based content filtering solution ] Browser based content filtering solution is the most lightweight solution to do the content filtering. There is no need to install native software or library to your home computer. Like Google Chromium and Firefox browser, most of their browser addons/extensions are written in JavaScript which must reviewed and tested by a review editor team before releasing to internet users. The major advantage of the browser based content filtering solution is that addon/extension solution is green, clean and easy to install and uninstall. Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs: Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs are Internet service providers that offer access to only a set portion of Internet content. Anyone who subscribes to this type of service is subject to the same type of restrictions. These types of filters are especially designed for kids. It offers webpages that have been carefully reviewed multiple times and assessed for their appropriateness and safety. Content, entertainment, and education are key aspects as well. There are strict rules for those who break chat room and bulletin board rules. Those who break the rules are uninvited. Email and instant messages can only be received from specified parties. Content limited ISPs that are intended for both children and adults allows access to almost everything, except what the ISP considers inappropriate. Limits and monitoring on email are very rare or do not exist at all. There are ISPs that provide both filtered/unfiltered access as well. Filtered access is available when there are ISPs that offer parental controls and passwords. Server filter-sides: These servers are in demand [ November 2011 ] and very useful in institutional settings, such as schools and library systems. All users are subject to the access policy defined by the institution. The filtering comes from the institution&apos;s ISPs directly or from the institution itself. The filtering can be customized, so a school district&apos;s high school library can have a different filtering profile than the district&apos;s junior high school library. Search-engine filters: Many search engines, such as Google and Alta Vista offer users the option of turning on a safety filter. When this safety filter is activated, it filters out the inappropriate links from all of the search results. If one knows the actual URL of a website that features sexual explicit or 18 + content, they have the ability to access it without using a search engine. Engines like Lycos, Yahoo, and Bing offer kid-oriented versions of their engines that permit only children friendly websites.

Over blocking can filter out material that should be acceptable under the filtering policy in effect, for example health related information may unintentionally be filtered along with porn-related material. Some parents may prefer to err on the side of caution by accepting over blocking to prevent any risk of access to sites that they determine to be undesirable.

Critics argue that content-filtering software allows private companies to censor as they please. (See Religious or political censorship, below). They further argue that government encouragement of content filtering, or legal requirements for content-labeling software, would be equivalent to censorship. [ October 2009 ] Some people contrast content-control with censoring, claiming that limiting the content one can view is similar to how communist governments limit the content its citizens can view in order to promote one idea. They argue that there is a chance for the content-filtering software to be abused. [ September 2011 ] [ Legal actions ] In 1998, a United States federal district court in Virginia ruled that the imposition of mandatory filtering in a public library violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights.

[ February 2007 ] In the late 1990s, groups such as the Censorware Project began reverse-engineering the content-control software and decrypting the blacklists to determine what kind of sites the software blocked. This led to legal action alleging violation of the &quot; Cyber Patrol &quot; license agreement.

(See Over-zealous filtering, below). Some content-control software companies responded by claiming that their filtering criteria were backed by intensive manual checking. The companies&apos; opponents argued, on the other hand, that performing the necessary checking would require resources greater than the companies possessed and that therefore their claims were not valid.

In 1994, the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA) — now part of the Family Online Safety Institute — developed a content rating system for online content providers. Using an online questionnaire a webmaster describes the nature of his web content. A small file is generated that contains a condensed, computer readable digest of this description that can then be used by content filtering software to block or allow that site. ICRA labels come in a variety of formats. [ http://www.fosi.org/icra/#tech ICRA: Technical standards used 2008-07-04 FOSI ] These include the World Wide Web Consortium&apos;s Resource Description Framework (RDF) as well as Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) labels used by Microsoft &apos;s Internet Explorer Content Advisor. [ http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/using/howto/security/contentadv/config.mspx Browse the Web with Internet Explorer 6 and Content Advisor Microsoft March 26, 2003 ] ICRA labels are an example of self-labeling. Similarly, in 2006 the Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP) initiated the Restricted to Adults self-labeling initiative. ASACP members were concerned that various forms of legislation being proposed in the United States were going to have the effect of forcing adult companies to label their content.

Like ICRA the RTA label is free. Both labels are recognized by a wide variety of content-control software. The Voluntary Content Rating (VCR) system was devised by Solid Oak Software for their CYBERsitter filtering software, as an alternative to the PICS system, which some critics deemed too complex. It employs HTML metadata tags embedded within web page documents to specify the type of content contained in the document. Only two levels are specified, mature and adult, making the specification extremely simple. [ Use in public libraries ] [ United States ] The use of Internet filters or content-control software varies widely in public libraries in the United States, since Internet use policies are established by the local library board. Many libraries adopted Internet filters after Congress conditioned the receipt of universal service discounts on the use of Internet filters through the Children&apos;s Internet Protection Act (CIPA). Other libraries do not install content control software, believing that acceptable use policies and educational efforts address the issue of children accessing age-inappropriate content while preserving adult users&apos; right to freely access information. Some libraries use Internet filters on computers used by children only. Some libraries that employ content-control software allow the software to be deactivated on a case-by-case basis on application to a librarian; libraries that are subject to CIPA are required to have a policy that allows adults to request that the filter be disabled without having to explain the reason for their request. Many legal scholars believe that a number of legal cases, in particular Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, established that the use of content-control software in libraries is a violation of the First Amendment. [ http://www.spectacle.org/cs/library.bak Purchase of blocking software by public libraries is unconstitutional Wallace Jonathan D. November 9, 1997 ] The Children&apos;s Internet Protection Act [CIPA] and the June 2003 case United States v. American Library Association found CIPA constitutional as a condition placed on the receipt of federal funding, stating that First Amendment concerns were dispelled by the law&apos;s provision that allowed adult library users to have the filtering software disabled, without having to explain the reasons for their request. The plurality decision left open a future &quot; as-applied &quot; Constitutional challenge, however. In November 2006, a lawsuit was filed against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington State for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon requests of adult patrons, but CIPA was not challenged in that matter. [ http://www.aclu-wa.org/detail.cfm?id%3D557 ACLU Suit Seeks Access to Information on Internet for Library Patrons ACLU of Washington November 16, 2006 ] In May 2010, the Washington State Supreme Court provided an opinion after it was asked to certify a question referred by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington: “Whether a public library, consistent with Article I, § 5 of the Washington Constitution, may filter Internet access for all patrons without disabling Web sites containing constitutionally-protected speech upon the request of an adult library patron.” The Washington State Supreme Court ruled that NCRL’s internet filtering policy did not violate Article I, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution. The Court said: “It appears to us that NCRL’s filtering policy is reasonable and accords with its mission and these policies and is viewpoint neutral. It appears that no article I, section 5 content-based violation exists in this case. NCRL’s essential mission is to promote reading and lifelong learning. As NCRL maintains, it is reasonable to impose restrictions on Internet access in order to maintain an environment that is conducive to study and contemplative thought.” The case now returns to federal court. In March 2007, Virginia passed a law similar to CIPA that requires public libraries receiving state funds to use content-control software. Like CIPA, the law requires libraries to disable filters for an adult library user when requested to do so by the user.

It was proposed by the Beazley led Australian Labor Party opposition in a 2006 press release, with the intention of protecting children who were vulnerable due to claimed parental computer illiteracy. It was announced on 31 December 2007 as a policy to be implemented by the Rudd ALP government, and initial tests in Tasmania have produced a 2008 report. Cleanfeed is funded in the current budget, and is moving towards an Expression of Interest for live testing with ISPs in 2008. Public opposition and criticism have emerged, led by the EFA and gaining irregular mainstream media attention, with a majority of Australians reportedly &quot; strongly against &quot; its implementation. [ http://nocleanfeed.com/learn.html Learn - No Clean Feed - Stop Internet Censorship in Australia No Clean Feed 2009-10-25 ] Criticisms include its expense, inaccuracy (it will be impossible to ensure only illegal sites are blocked) and the fact that it will be compulsory, which can be seen as an intrusion on free speech rights. Another major criticism point has been that although the filter is claimed to stop certain materials, the underground rings dealing in such materials will not be affected. The filter might also provide a false sense of security for parents, who might supervise children less while using the Internet, achieving the exact opposite effect. Cleanfeed is a responsibility of Senator Conroy&apos;s portfolio.

Also cached web pages returned by Google or other searches could bypass some controls as well. Web syndication services may provide alternate paths for content. Some of the more poorly-designed programs can be shut down by killing their processes: for example, in Microsoft Windows through the Windows Task Manager, or in Mac OS X using Force Quit or Activity Monitor. Numerous workarounds and counters to workarounds from content-control software creators exist. Google services are often blocked by filters, but these may most often be bypassed by using https:// in place of http:// since content filtering software is not able to interpret content under secure connections (in this case SSL). Many content filters have an option which allows authorized people to bypass the content filter. This is especially useful in environments where the computer is being supervised and the content filter is aggressively blocking Web sites that need to be accessed. [ March 2009 ] An encrypted VPN can also be used as means of bypassing content control software, especially if the content control software is installed on an Internet gateway or firewall. Sometimes, the antivirus software with web protection may stop the content-control filter. [ Products and services ] [ List of content-control software Category:Content-control software ] Some ISPs offer parental control options. Some offer security software which includes parental controls. Mac OS X v10.4 offers parental controls for several applications ( Mail, Finder, iChat, Safari &amp; Dictionary ). Microsoft&apos;s Windows Vista operating system also includes content-control software. Content filtering technology exists in two major forms: application gateway or packet inspection. For HTTP access the application gateway is called a web-proxy or just a proxy. Such web-proxies can inspect both the initial request and the returned web page using arbitrarily complex rules and will not return any part of the page to the requester until a decision is made. In addition they can make substitutions in whole or for any part of the returned result. Packet inspection filters do not initially interfere with the connection to the server but inspect the data in the connection as it goes past, at some point the filter may decide that the connection is to be filtered and it will then disconnect it by injecting a TCP-Reset or similar faked packet. The two techniques can be used together with the packet filter monitoring a link until it sees an HTTP connection starting to an IP address that has content that needs filtering. The packet filter then redirects the connection to the web-proxy which can perform detailed filtering on the website without having to pass through all unfiltered connections. This combination is quite popular because it can significantly reduce the cost of the system. Gateway-based content control software may be more difficult to bypass than desktop software as the user does not have physical access to the filtering device. However, many of the techniques in the Bypassing filters section still work.
