From the outset, the college’s founders, the Oblates, believed that their institution should promote reconciliation and a better understanding between French and English Canada. In 1965, the “ Université d’Ottawa - University of Ottawa ” was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. With its new provincial charter as a publicly-funded institution, the University was given the dual mandate of furthering bilingualism and biculturalism, as well as preserving and developing the French culture in Ontario and in Canada. The University of Ottawa implemented a policy on promoting bilingualism in 1974. { policy on bilingualism policy } Today, students have the choice to study in English, French, or both depending on their programme of study. Controversy has arisen over the years regarding implementing a course to be taught in both languages over alternating years, and eliminating English courses altogether in some faculties. A study of full professors&apos; employment contracts carried out by the Human Resources Service as part of Vision 2010 concluded that about half of the professors are actively bilingual when they are hired. Ninety-seven percent of support-staff positions are designated as “actively bilingual” and 93% of these positions are held by bilingual staff. From time to time the bilingual nature of the University of Ottawa has been the subject of linguistic debate. For example in October 2005, the Canadian French newspaper Le Droit reported on an internal memo to University of Ottawa recruiting officers heading to a recruitment fair in Toronto who were directed to speak solely in English while manning the booth. [ U of O edict sparks uproar http://www.metronews.ca/uploadedFiles/Metro_Ottawa_1118_2005.pdf http://web.archive.org/web/20060625041110/http%3A//www.metronews.ca/uploadedFiles/Metro_Ottawa_1118_2005.pdf 2006-06-25 PDF Metro Ottawa 2008-04-29 ] This sparked debate on the widely-held perception that students must speak French to study at the University of Ottawa. In fact just under 70 per cent of University of Ottawa students are anglophones, but most of the administration employees are francophones. [ University of Ottawa (QUICK FACTS) http://web5.uottawa.ca/mcs-smc/quickfacts/documents/quickfacts-2009.pdf 2007-09-17 2010-08-07 ] In March 2006, an open letter appeared in Le Droit signed by several University of Ottawa professors voicing their concerns on the status of French at the university. In the ensuing weeks, opinion pieces and letters to the editor ignited vigorous debate. In June 2006, the university established a Task Force on Programs and Services in French mandated to submit to the senate a development plan for programs and services in French for 2007-2012 that will help the university fully assume its mission and commitment to promote and develop French culture in Ontario. A final report will be submitted to the senate in the spring of 2007.
