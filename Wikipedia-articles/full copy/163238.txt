It is has been owned and operated by Caribbean Airlines Limited since 26 May 2011. Caribbean Airlines Limited, headquartered in Piarco, Trinidad and Tobago, has administrative offices for Air Jamaica located at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica.The government of Jamaica has a 16% stake in Caribbean Airlines Limited, which operates both Caribbean Airlines and Air Jamaica Brands. { http://www.caribbean-airlines.com/index.php/contact-us/integration-faq } [ History ] Air Jamaica was established in October 1968 and started operations on April 1, 1969, connecting Kingston and Montego Bay, with New York and Miami. { Flight International 27 March 2007 } At that time the Jamaican government owned a substantial part of the airline, with Air Canada owning a minor share and providing technical, maintenance and logistical help. During the 1970s, Air Jamaica expanded rapidly. Flights were added to Toronto and Montreal in Canada, to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico, to Philadelphia and many other destinations, especially across the Caribbean. Long-haul services to Europe were started on 1 April 1974. Air Jamaica used Douglas DC-8 s for a large part of the 1970s, but the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 727 jets became a part of the fleet towards the end of the decade when the government bought out Air Canada &apos;s small share. During the 1980s, growth slowed. Nevertheless, new routes were opened to Baltimore and Atlanta. { Boeing 747-100 from } { Aer Lingus in the early 1980s. } During the 1990s Air Jamaica continued to expand: the airline took over the Kingston- Nassau, Bahamas route, which had been left by British Airways, began a code sharing agreement with Delta Air Lines and opened routes to Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix (which was later dropped), and to Frankfurt, London, Manchester, Santo Domingo and Ft. Lauderdale. The route to Phoenix was opened because Air Jamaica was looking for expansion in the American West, beyond its route to Los Angeles. In 1994 the company was partially privatized, with the government retaining 25% of the company and giving 5% of it to the airline&apos;s employees. It began buying Airbus equipment, including the Airbus A340, and began a feeder service, a frequent flyer program (7th Heaven), and an inflight magazine, named SkyWritings. In December 2004, after financial losses, the Government of Jamaica took back full ownership of Air Jamaica. It employed 2,522 as of March 2007. The last private owner was Gordon Stewart, chairman and founder of Sandals Resorts and Beaches Resorts.

Investors with interest in the airline were speculated to be China National Aviation Holding Company (parent company of Air China ), Delta Air Lines, Virgin Group (parent company of Virgin Atlantic Airways ), Iberia Airlines (the national airline of Spain) and The Emirates Group (the Emirates Group is the parent company of Emirates Airlines ) and Caribbean Airlines. A private Jamaican, Spanish, British and American consortium was in talks with the Government of Jamaica to bid for the national carrier as well. { Air J/Virgin deal a priority for new transport minister } Air Jamaica&apos;s complete privitisation and divestment was extended from March 2009 to June 2009. In October 2007, Bruce Nobles, former President and Chief Operational Officer of Air Jamaica from May 2002 to June 2003, was asked to return to the national airline, replacing William Rogers, who was interim President and CEO of the airline since the October 2007 resignation of CEO Michael Conway. On 4 July 2009, &apos;&apos;The Jamaica Gleaner&apos;&apos; reported that US-based Spirit Airlines had reached an agreement with the Jamaican government to acquire the national airline. { Report: Spirit Airlines buys Air Jamaica } However, the Jamaica Observer reported on 5 July that the airline had not been sold as yet. { Air Jamaica not sold yet, say Gov&apos;t officials } On 17 December 2009, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Jamaica had recently approach the Government of Trinidad and Tobago regarding a possible merger or acquisition by Caribbean Airlines Limited. { ﻿Jamaica PM flies in for Air Jamaica /CAL talks } It has been decided that Air Jamaica will cease to operate under Jamaican ownership and be majorly run by Caribbean Airlines Limited until the transitional process is complete. Caribbean Airlines acquired the airline&apos;s fleet and route rights on 1 May 2010, and will open a new hub at Kingston&apos;s Norman Manley International Airport. The transition is expected to fully take place over a 6-12 month period. The acquisition makes Caribbean Airlines the largest airline in the Caribbean. On 27 May 2011 Jamaican Finance Minister Audley Shaw and Trinidadian Finance Minister Winston Dookeran signed the shareholding agreement, making Caribbean Airlines the national airline of Jamaica and access of all routes operated by the former Air Jamaica. { &quot; Air Jamaica on course for possible April 12 takeover. &quot; Caribbean 360. 4 March 2010.
