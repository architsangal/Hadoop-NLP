[ Albumen the class of proteins Albumin other uses Albumen (disambiguation) ] [ the musician Eg White ] { egg yolk surrounded by the egg white. } Egg white is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. In chicken s it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen&apos;s oviduct during the passage of the egg. { Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361 } It forms around either fertilized or unfertilized egg yolk s. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized). Egg white consists primarily of about 90% water into which is dissolved 10% protein s (including albumin s, mucoprotein s, and globulin s ). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipid s (fats), egg white contains almost no fat, and carbohydrate content is less than 1%. Egg white has many uses in food (e.g. mousse ) and also many other uses (e.g. in the preparation of vaccine s such as those for influenza ). [ Composition ] The egg white is about two-thirds of the total egg&apos;s weight out of its shell, with nearly 92% of that weight coming from water. The remaining weight of the egg white comes from protein, trace mineral s, fatty material, vitamin s, and glucose. { McGee, 77 } A raw U.S. large egg white weighs 33  grams with 3.6  grams of protein, 0.24  grams of carbohydrate and 55 milligrams of sodium. It also contains about 17 kcalories { McGee, 79 } and no cholesterol. It contains approximately 40 different proteins. { Exploratorium } Below is a list of the proteins found in egg whites by percentage, along with their natural functions.

There are two types of physical stress caused by the beating them with a whisk, the first being that the whisk drags the liquid through itself, creating a force that unfolds the protein molecules [ April 2010 ]. This process is called denaturation. The second stress comes from the mixing of air into the whites, which causes the proteins to come out of their natural state. These denatured proteins gather together where the air and water meet and create multiple bonds with the other unraveled proteins, and thus become a foam, holding the incorporated air in place. This is because the proteins consist of amino acids; some are hydrophilic (attracted to water) and some are hydrophobic (repelled by water). This process is called coagulation. { Exploratorium.edu } { McGee, 102 } When beating egg whites, they are classified in three stages according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and stiff peaks. Overbeaten eggs take on a dry appearance, and will eventually collapse. Egg whites will not beat up correctly if they are exposed to any form of fat, such as cooking oil s or the fats contained in egg yolk. [ Stabilizing egg white foam for culinary purposes ] [ Copper bowl ] Copper bowls have been used in France since the eighteenth century to stabilize egg foams. The copper in the bowl assists in creating a tighter bond in reactive sulfur items such as egg whites. The bond created is so tight that the sulfurs are prevented from reacting with any other material. A silver plated bowl will have the same result as the copper bowl as will a pinch of powdered copper supplement from a health store used in a glass bowl. Drawbacks of the copper bowl include the expense of the bowl itself, as well as the fact that the bowls are difficult to keep clean. Copper contamination from the bowl is minimal, as a cup of foam will contain a tenth of one&apos;s daily normal intake level. { McGee, 102-103 } [ Adding an acid ] Cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) is an acid ic salt that can be used to change the pH of the egg white to an acidic range. This has the effect of stabilizing the foam, and is therefore an alternative to using a copper bowl. About 1/8 teaspoon or 0.5  g of cream of tartar should be used per one egg white to create this effect. One-half teaspoon (2  ml) of lemon juice can also be used to create the same results. { McGee, 103 } [ Health issues ] Although egg whites are prized as a source of low-fat, high-protein nutrition, a small number of people cannot eat them. Egg allergy is more common among infants than adults, and most children will outgrow it by the age of five. { “Egg Allergy Facts” Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America } Allergic reaction s against egg white are more common than reactions against egg yolks. [ Arnaldo Cantani Pediatric Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Springer Berlin 2008 710–713 3-540-20768-6 ] In addition to true allergic reactions, some people experience a food intolerance to egg whites. Eggs are susceptible to Salmonella contamination. Thorough cooking eliminates the direct threat (i.e. cooked egg whites that are solid and not runny), but the threat of cross-contamination remains if people handle contaminated eggs and then touch other foods or items in the kitchen, thus spreading the bacteria. In August 2010, the FDA ordered the recall of 380 million eggs because of possible Salmonella contamination. The Los Angeles Times reported, &quot; With 380 million eggs under recall, consumers may be anxious about eating any egg or food product containing eggs. Here&apos;s the upshot: Thoroughly cooked eggs are safe, but cross-contamination could be a problem. &quot; [ http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/20/business/la-fi-eggs-qa-20100820 Eggs and salmonella: What you need to know Roan, Shari August 20, 2010 Los Angeles Times September 14, 2011 ] [ Uses ] Egg white is a fining agent that can be used in the clarification and stabilization of wine.
