A school voucher, also called an education voucher, is a certificate issued by the government, which parents can apply toward tuition at a private school (or, by extension, to reimburse home schooling expenses), rather than at the state school to which their child is assigned. An alternative to the education voucher is the education tax credit, which allows individuals to use their own money to pay for the education of their children or to donate money towards the education of other children. Under non-voucher education systems, people who currently pay for private schooling are still taxed for public schools; therefore, they fund both public and private schools simultaneously. Via offsetting the cost of private school tuition, vouchers and tax credits are intended to allow students and families to choose the school that best fits their needs. Opponents of school vouchers say allowing families the option of both public and private schools undermines the public education system through threatening its funding and enrollment.

Because some towns in these states operate neither local high schools nor elementary schools, students in these towns &quot; are eligible for a voucher to attend [either] public schools in other towns or non-religious private schools. In these cases, the &apos;sending&apos; towns pay tuition directly to the &apos;receiving&apos; schools. &quot; A system of educational vouchers was introduced in the Netherlands in 1917. Today, more than 70% of pupils attend privately run but publicly funded schools, mostly split along denominational lines.

De Vijlder ] Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that competition would improve schools and cost efficiency. The view further gained popularity with the 1980 TV broadcast of Friedman&apos;s series Free to Choose for which volume 6 was devoted entirely to promoting &quot; educational freedom &quot; through programs like school vouchers. { See Volume 6 - &quot; What&apos;s Wrong with our Schools &quot; } In some Southern states during the 1960s, school vouchers were used as a method of perpetuating segregation. In a few instances, public schools were closed outright and vouchers were issued to parents. The vouchers, in many cases, were only good at privately segregated schools, known as segregation academies.

Private school s operate privately and are funded by private money such as tuition or donations. School vouchers are subsidies given directly to parents for tuition at any school. Charter school s are publicly funded schools which operate in the public sector, but are free from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. Open enrollment is the process of allowing parents to choose which public school their child attends instead of being assigned one (provided the school has not reached its maximum capacity number for students). This is sometimes confused with vouchers as a promotion for school choice. Education tax credit, tuition tax credit, or tax-credit scholarship: Kevin G. Welner, NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling Rowman &amp; Littlefield (September 29, 2008), hardcover, 194 pages,; trade paperback, Rowman &amp; Littlefield (September 29, 2008), There are two types of education tax credits: personal use, and donation. Personal use tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers for education expenditures made on behalf of their own children. Donation tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers or businesses who donate to nonprofit organizations that give out private school scholarships. [ Controversy ] [ December 2010 ] [ Proponents ] Proponents assert that school voucher and education tax credit systems promote free market competition among both private and public schools. By allowing parents and students to &quot; vote with their feet, &quot; they incentivize schools to increase accountability and school performance. { http://mises.org/media/2349/Roads-Education-and-Waterways-The-Case-Against-Public-Services } Proponents argue that the competition spurred by vouchers and education tax credits increases the quality and efficiencies of both eligible private schools and local public schools, as they both must perpetually improve in order to maintain enrollment caused by the competitive nature of dollar voting and the swift accountability that results from increasing consumer sovereignty - allowing individuals to control what product or service they prefer to buy as opposed to a bureaucracy. { http://ingrimayne.com/econ/AllocatingRationing/DollarVoting.html } { http://ingrimayne.com/econ/government/MajorityRule.html } The argument that school vouchers increases quality and efficiencies in schools forced to compete is supported by studies such as &quot; When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement &quot; (Manhattan Institute for Policy Research&apos;s, 2003), which concluded that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements than did similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Stanford&apos;s C.M. Hoxby, who has researched the systemic effects of school choice, determined that areas with greater residential school choice have consistently higher test scores at a lower per-pupil cost than areas with very few school districts (see Hoxby, 1998). Hoxby found that the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools forced to compete made greater test score gains than schools not faced with such competition (see Hoxby, 2001), and that the so-called effect of cream skimming did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined. Hoxby&apos;s research has found that both private and public schools improved through the use of vouchers. { Hoxby, Caroline, “Rising Tide” Education Next, Winter, 2001. } { Hoxby, Caroline “Analyzing School Choice Reforms that Use America’s Traditional Forms of Parental Choice” in Paul E.

The Foundation for Educational Choice alleges that a school voucher plan &quot; embodies exactly the same principle as the GI bills that provide for educational benefits to military veterans. The veteran gets a voucher good only for educational expense and he is completely free to choose the school at which he uses it, provided that it satisfies certain standards. &quot; { http://www.edchoice.org/The-Friedmans/The-Friedmans-on-School-Choice/What-s-Wrong-with-Our-Schools-.aspx } Proponents claim that frequently institutions are forced to operate at higher efficiencies when they are allowed to compete { ( )http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/UploadedFiles/ResearchResources/Competition-%20Hoxby.pdf } and that any resulting job losses in the public sector would be offset by the increased demand for jobs in the private sector. { ( )http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=284 } Friedrich von Hayek on the privatizing of education: [ As has been shown by Professor Milton Friedman (M. Friedman, The role of government in education, 1955), it would now be entirely practicable to defray the costs of general education out of the public purse without maintaining government schools, by giving the parents vouchers covering the cost of education of each child which they could hand over to schools of their choice. It may still be desirable that government directly provide schools in a few isolated communities where the number of children is too small (and the average cost of education therefore too high) for privately run schools. But with respect to the great majority of the population, it would undoubtedly be possible to leave the organization and management of education entirely to private efforts, with the government providing merely the basic finance and ensuring a minimum standard for all schools where the vouchers could be spent.

In defense of vouchers, it cites empirical research showing that students who were randomly assigned to receive vouchers had higher academic outcomes than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them; and that vouchers improve academic outcomes at public schools, reduce racial segregation, deliver better services to special education students, and do not drain money from public schools.

(2007) Monopoly Versus Markets Friedmanfoundation.org 2011-08-11 ] The main controversy over both school vouchers and education tax credits is that they put public education in direct competition with private education, threatening to reduce and reallocate public school funding to private schools. Proponents of a voucher system are encouraged by private school sector growth as it is thier view that private schools are typically more efficient at achieving results at a much lower per pupil cost when compared to public schools. Some researchers claim that current cost efficient comparisons are not easy to make as public schools leave out major costs when calculating per pupil spending. A CATO Institute study of public and private school per pupil spending in Phoenix, Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, New York City, and Houston found that public schools spend 93% more than estimated median private schools.

In many states, members of a community&apos;s board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. Although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers are not able to vote on budgetary issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings. Kevin Welner points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit system—a policy he calls &quot; Neovouchers &quot; -- present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit. { See Welner, Kevin G. (2008) NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers } Some factions of libertarian opponents in the U.S. object to vouchers on the grounds that granting government money, even indirectly, to private and religious schools will inevitably lead to increased governmental control over non-government education, and possibly over the teachings of the sponsoring religious group (most often a church). Some individuals who oppose vouchers on these grounds call for the abolition of all state sponsorship of education. The Alliance for the Separation of School &amp; State opposes education vouchers on the grounds that &quot; if vouchers become commonplace, private and religious schools will become more and more like public schools. &quot; [ http://www.honestedu.org/misc/vouchers.php What about tax-funded vouchers, tax credits, and charter schools? 2006-04-21 ] Moreover, they suggest that if it is wrong in principle for the government to tax in order to fund public education, then one should not accept any portion of the ill-gotten money to fund private education.

[ Implementations ] [ Chile ] In Chile, there is an extensive voucher system in which the State pays private and municipal schools directly based on student attendance. This system covers nearly 90% of its students. It was introduced in 1981. [ National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education?

[ Europe ] In most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g. Belgium), parents are free to choose which school their child attends. [ Ireland ] Most schools in Ireland are state-aided parish schools, established under diocesan patronage but with capital costs, teachers salaries and a per head fee paid to the school.

(Although fee-paying schools are in the minority, there has been much criticism over the state aid they receive with opponents claiming this gives them an unfair advantage.) There is a recent trend towards multi-denominational schools established by parents, which are organised as limited companies without share capital. Parents and students are free to choose their own school. In the event of a school failing to attract students it immediately loses its per-head fee and over time loses its teaching posts- and teachers are moved to other schools which are attracting students. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children.

Critics of the latter development charge that it has not increased the number of students from economically deprived backgrounds attending university. However, studies have shown that the removal of tuition fees at third level has increased the number of students overall and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This concurs with evidence from the UK of a decrease in attendance numbers after the introduction of fees. However, since the economic crisis, there has been extensive talk and debate regarding the reintroduction of third-level fees.

[ Hong Kong ] A voucher system for children three to six years-old who attend a non-profit kindergarten was implemented in Hong Kong in 2007. Each child will get HK$13,000 pa. The $13,000 subsidy will be separated into two parts. $10,000 is used to subsidize the school fee and the remaining $3,000 is used for kindergarten teachers to pursue further education and obtain a certificate in Education. Also, there are some restrictions on the voucher system. Parents can only choose those non-profit making with yearly fee less than $24,000. The government hopes that all kindergarten teachers can obtain an Education certificate by the year 2011-2012, at which point the subsidies are to be adjusted to $16000 for each student, all of which will go toward the school fee. Milton Friedman criticised the system, saying &quot; I do not believe that [ CE ] Mr. Tsang&apos;s proposal is properly structured. &quot; He said that the whole point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive market place so should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens. After protests by parents with children enrolled in for profit kindergartens, the program was extended to children in for- profit kindergartens, but only for children enrolled in or before September 2007. The government will also provide up to HK$30,000 subsidy to for profit kindergartens wanting to convert to non profit. [ United States ] [ Introduction ] In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in the initial education-reform proposals leading up to the No Child Left Behind Act. This year, it is estimated that nearly 171,000 students will participate in 18 existing school choice programs in 10 states and the District of Columbia. Most of these programs are offered to students in low-income families, low performing schools, or special-education programs. The city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin led the way in 1990 and now has nearly 15,000 students using vouchers. The 2006-2007 school year will mark the first time in Milwaukee that more than $100 million will be paid in vouchers. [ http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id%3D533306 Vouchers to Pass $100 Million Mark, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 21, 2006 2006-11-21 ] Twenty-six percent of Milwaukee students will receive public funding to attend schools outside the traditional Milwaukee Public School system. In fact, if the voucher program alone were considered a school district, it would mark the sixth-largest district in Wisconsin. St. Anthony Catholic School, located on Milwaukee&apos;s south side, boasts 966 voucher students, meaning that it very likely receives more public money for general school support of a parochial elementary or high school than any before it in American history. Under the current state formula for paying school vouchers, however, Milwaukee residents pay more in property taxes for voucher students than for students attending public schools. This imbalance has received considerable criticism, and is the subject of 2007 legislative proposals designed to alter the formula. [ Legal challenges ] The school voucher question in the United States has also received a considerable amount of judicial review in the early 2000s. A program launched in the city of Cleveland in 1995 and authorized by the state of Ohio was challenged in court on the grounds that it violated both the federal constitutional principle of separation of church and state and the guarantee of religious liberty in the Ohio Constitution. These claims were rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court, but the federal claims were upheld by the local federal district court and by the Sixth Circuit appeals court.

Simmons-Harris, 436 U.S. 2006-04-21 ] The fact that nearly all of the families using vouchers attended Catholic schools in the Cleveland area was cited in the decisions. [ http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/27/scotus.school.vouchers/ 2006-04-21 Supreme Court affirms school voucher program Terry Friden July 27, 2002 CNN ] This was later reversed during 2002 in a landmark case before the US Supreme Court, Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, in which the divided court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled the Ohio school voucher plan constitutional and removed any constitutional barriers to similar voucher plans in the future, with moderate justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O&apos;Connor and conservative justices William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas in the majority. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the majority, stated that &quot; The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits. &quot; The Supreme Court ruled that the Ohio program did not violate the Establishment Clause, because it passed a five part test developed by the Court in this case, titled the Private Choice Test. Dissenting opinions included Justice Stevens&apos;s, who wrote &quot;...the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the government&apos;s choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible. &quot; and Justice Souter&apos;s, whose opinion questioned how the Court could keep Everson v. Board of Education on as precedent and decide this case in the way they did, feeling it was contradictory. He also found that religious instruction and secular education could not be separated and this itself violated the Establishment Clause. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down legislation known as the Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), which would have implemented a system of school vouchers in Florida. [ http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId%3D5159138 2006-04-21 Court Throws Out Florida School Voucher Program ] The court ruled that the OSP violated article IX, section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution: &quot; Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools. &quot; [ http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2006/sc04-2323.pdf 2006-11-01 Florida Supreme Court Official Opinion: SC04-2323 – John Ellis &quot; Jeb &quot; Bush, Etc., Et Al. v.

On the left/right spectrum, conservatives are more likely to support vouchers. Some state legislatures have enacted voucher laws. In New Mexico, Republican Gary Johnson made school voucher provision the major issue of his second term as Governor.

However, its preference on this matter does not appear to be strong enough to prevent the President from signing the Bill.

Majorities seem to favor improving existing schools over providing vouchers, yet as many as 40% of those surveyed admit that they do not know enough to form an opinion or do not understand the system of school vouchers. [ http://www.publicagenda.org/citizen/issueguides/education/publicview/redflags Public Agenda Online, &quot; Red Flags on Education: Lack of Knowledge About Vouchers. &quot; 2008-07-25 ] In November 2000, a voucher system proposed by Tim Draper was placed on the California ballot as Proposition 38. It was unusual among school voucher proposals in that it required neither accreditation on the part of schools accepting vouchers, nor proof of need on the part of families applying for them; neither did it have any requirement that schools accept vouchers as payment-in-full, nor any other provision to guarantee a reduction in the real cost of private school tuition. The measure was defeated by a final percentage tally of 70.6 to 29.4. A state-wide universal school voucher system providing a maximum tuition subsidy of $3000 was passed in Utah in 2007, but 62% of voters repealed it in a statewide referendum before it took effect.
