It features supercritical wing s fitted with winglets, a glass cockpit, and a fly-by-wire control system. It was first flown in 1988 and certified in 1992. The basic Il-96-300 is equipped with modern Russian avionics integrating six multi-function colour LCD displays, inertial and satellite navigation systems, and a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (including mode &quot; S &quot; ). It allows the airplane to be operated with two crew member s. The avionics correspond to modern requirements on international routes in Europe and North America (RNP-1) and allow navigation and landing under ICAO CAT III/A conditions. The Il-96 is offered in three main variants: the Il-96-300, Il-96M/T and Il-96-400. [ September 2011 ] The Il-96-300 has a standard passenger capacity of 262 seats in a two-class configuration with 18 seats with a seat pitch of [ 54 in cm ] and 244 seats with a pitch of [ 32 in cm ], of which typical seating is 3-3-3 (layout), but low density seating is 2-4-2 (layout possible). Galleys are positioned on the upper deck, and the lower deck can accommodate 18 LD-3 containers and crew rest areas. Although its list price is more than 30% lower than equivalent Western types, Russian airlines are not particularly eager to buy it. [ 2006 As of September 2006 ], there are only 17 Il-96-300s in operation with Aeroflot (6 of the 17), KrasAir (2), Domodedovo Airlines (3; actually operated by Krasair on behalf of AiRUnion alliance), Atlant-Soyuz Airlines (1; cargo version), Cubana de Aviación (3) and Rossiya (2). Two more aircraft are being readied at the plant in Voronezh for shipment to the government of Cuba. Aeroflot and Transaero received tax exemption when importing Western-built aircraft in exchange for their promising to buy a few Il-96s each. Aeroflot-Cargo initiated talks about ordering 6 Il-96-400T and ordered 6 more Il-96-300 [ September 2011 ] Meanwhile, Air Zimbabwe was planning to purchase 5 Il-96-300, making the airline the largest carrier of the type outside Russia and second largest carrier to operate the planes after Aeroflot. [ February 2007 ] However, after talks with Russian authorities, the order was cancelled (along with Tupolev orders). [ September 2011 ] Iran Air took delivery of two Ilyushin Il-96-300s on short-term leases on from Russia&apos;s Kras Air in October 2006 and will use these aircraft on a trial basis for up to one year. If they meet its operational requirements, IFC will consider placing an order for up to four aircraft. Cockpit of an Aeroflot Il-96-300 In June 2006, Syrianair announced an agreement to purchase two Il-96-400 aircraft and an Il-96-300 aircraft. [ September 2011 ] In June 2005, the Volga-Dnepr Group signed a 15-year financial agreement with Ilyushin Finance Corporation (IFC) to take delivery of two new-build Il-96-400T aircraft. The aircraft will be operated by Volga-Dnepr&apos;s subsidiary AirBridge Cargo. The first was due to have been delivered in late 2006. [ September 2011 ] Also in 2005 Atlant-Soyuz Airlines reached an agreement with Ilyushin Finance for the delivery of two Il-96-400T cargo planes in addition to the Il-96-300T the airline already operates. [ September 2011 ] The Cuba n newspaper Granma announced on 3 January 2006 the first official flight of the Cubana Il-96-300, from Havana to Buenos Aires, Argentina. [ Julio Gómez Lluciá Granma January 3, 2006 http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2006/01/03/nacional/artic05.html Realiza su primer vuelo oficial IL 96-300 de Spanish ] [ March 2010 ] As of the second quarter of 2007, the factory was to have been tuned to produce only the two latest modifications of the plane. [ July 2008 ] On August 11, 2009 Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Viktor Khristenko announced that the manufacturing of the long-range aircraft of this class would be cancelled. In particular, the Il-96-300 had been deemed inferior to counterparts from Boeing and Airbus, and the manufacturer could not arrange commercially viable mass production, making only one plane per year. [ RBC Daily August 11, 2009 Sergei Kolobkov http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2009/08/11/industry/426254 The short-lived Il-96-300 Russian 2009-08-01 ] The cargo version of the plane, Il-96T, will remain in production. This effectively means that Russia is left without a domestically manufactured long-range wide-body passenger plane. [ Variants ] There are two variants of the Il-96. The Il-96-300 was launched in 1985 with introduction into service in 1993. The Il-96M was launched in 1993 with introduction into service in 2000. [ Il-96-300 ] The Il-96-300 is the initial variant and is fitted with Aviadvigatel (Soloviev) PS90A turbofans with a thrust rating of 16,000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf ). Development started in mid-80s while the first prototype flew on 28 September 1988, with Russian certification obtained on 29 December 1992. The first Il-96 entered service with Aeroflot in 1993. [ September 2011 ] Range with 262 passengers and fuel reserves (for holding 75 minutes at an altitude of 450 m) in a two-class configuration is about 11,000  km (5,940 nmi), allowing flights from Moscow to US west coast cities, a far improvement over the Ilyushin Il-86. Two were used by Russian president Vladimir Putin, and are now used by Dmitry Medvedev as VIP planes. The VIP aircraft is operated by Rossiya Airlines. [ September 2011 ] This variant also comes in a longer-range version dubbed Il-96-300V. A highly-customized version of the Il-96-300, called Il-96-300PU is used as the primary aircraft in the Russian presidential aircraft fleet. [ Il-96M ] { Atlant-Soyuz Airlines livery at the MAKS Airshow, August 2007 } The Il-96M is a stretched variant of the Il-96-300. It features a 10  m (30  ft) fuselage stretch, is 15 tonnes (33,000  lb) heavier, is fitted with Western-style avionics, and is powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2337 engines with a thrust rating of 165  kN (37,000  lbf). Range with 312 passengers in a three-class configuration or 92 tonne (203,000  lb) payload is about 10,400  km (5,600 nmi). This turned it into a true -but vastly more capable  — Il-86 successor. The Il-96M/T is broadly comparable with the Airbus A330-300 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11CF, but is much cheaper. Development on the M/T variant stalled when the US Export-Import Bank suspended talks on financing the engines and avionics, due to Russia&apos;s economic problems.

It is designed for a crew of two. [ September 2011 ] [ Il-96T ] This is the freighter version of the Il-96M and Il-96-400. It is powered by four Aviadvigatel PS90 engines. [ September 2011 ] [ Il-96-400 ] The Il-96-400 was developed with Russian avionics and engines. It is based on the Il-96M/T fuselage and is powered by four Aviadvigatel PS90-A1 turbofans. It can carry up to 436 passengers. Typical two-class configuration will have 386 passengers. Range with 315 passengers in a three-class configuration is about 10,000  km.

Following a series of small incidents, one of which involved President Putin&apos;s jet at Turku Airport, Finland, Russian civil aviation authorities grounded all the Il-96-300s from 22 August to 3 October 2005 to examine the braking gear.
