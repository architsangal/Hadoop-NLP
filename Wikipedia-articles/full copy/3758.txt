[ Bk other uses BK (disambiguation) ] [ ] Berkelium ( [ icon b ər ˈ k iː l i ə m ] [ bər KEE lee-əm ], less commonly [ ˈ b ɜr k l i ə m ] [ BURK lee-əm ] ), is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol Bk and atomic number 97, a member of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the University of California Radiation Laboratory where it was discovered in December 1949. This was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium. The major isotope of berkelium, berkelium-249, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactor s, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. The production of the second-important isotope berkelium-247 involves the irradiation of the rare synthetic isotope curium-244 with high-energy alpha particle s. Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinide s. A 22  milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the element ununseptium for the first time in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was a culmination of the Russia—US collaboration on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118. Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy electron s and thus is relatively safe to handle. However, it decays with a half-life of 330  days to californium -249, which is a strong and hazardous emitter of alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also self-radiation damage, and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles. [ History ] alt=Black-and-white picture of heavy machinery with two operators sitting aside Although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso and Stanley G. Thompson. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and curium (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and californium (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950. [ Thompson S. Ghiorso A. Seaborg G. Element 97 Physical Review 77 838 1950 10.1103/PhysRev.77.838.2 6 1950PhRv...77..838T ] [ Thompson S. Ghiorso A. Seaborg G.

Journal of the American Chemical Society 72 2798 1950 10.1021/ja01162a538 6 ] The name choice for element 97 followed the previous tradition of the Californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered actinide and the lanthanide element positioned above it in the periodic table. Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue europium, and curium honored scientists Marie and Pierre Curie as the lanthanide above it, gadolinium, was named after the explorer of the rare earth element s Johan Gadolin. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: &quot; It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of Ytterby, Sweden, where the rare earth minerals were first found. &quot; This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, californium, was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium, but after the discovery place. [ Heiserman David L. 1992 Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds TAB Books 0-8306-3018-X Element 98: Californium CITEREFHeiserman1992 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D24l-Cpal9oIC 347 ] The most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium ( 241 Am) nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to americium dioxide (AmO 2 ). This target was irradiated with 35  MeV alpha particle s for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The (α,2n) reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the 243 Bk isotope and two free neutron s : \mathrm{^{241}_{\ 95}Am\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{243}_{\ 97}Bk\ +\ 2\ ^{1}_{0}n} After the irradiation, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The product was centrifugated and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution was added to a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the oxidation state +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of hydrofluoric acid as americium(III) fluoride ( [ AmF 3 ] ). This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide, and after centrifugation, was dissolved in perchloric acid. { Chromatographic } { elution curves revealing the similarity between Tb, Gd, Eu lanthanides and corresponding Bk, Cm, Am actinides } { alt=Graphs showing similar elution curves (metal amount vs drops) for (top vs bottom) Tb vs Bk, Gd vs Cm, Eu vs Am } Further separation was carried out in the presence of a citric acid / ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium ( pH ≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243. [ Characteristics ] [ Physical ] alt=Sequential layers of spheres arranged from top to bottom: YRYBYRYB (Y=yellow, R=red, B=blue) Berkelium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it is located to the right of the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78  g/cm 3 lies between those of curium (13.52  g/cm 3 ) and californium (15.1  g/cm 3 ), as does its melting point of 986  °C, below that of curium (1340  °C) but higher than that of californium (900  °C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2 [ 10 ] Pa). Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp fluorescence peaks at 652   nanometer s (red light) and 742  nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due to internal transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide. [ Assefa Z. Haire R.G. Stump N.A.

Volume 2 of Handbook of Elemental Speciation, John Wiley and Sons, 2005, ISBN 0-470-85598-3 p. 553 } Between 70  K and room temperature, berkelium behaves as a Curie–Weiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69   Bohr magneton s (µ B ) and a Curie temperature of 101  K. This magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of 9.72  µ B calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34  K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. [ Peterson 1984 45 ] Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600  kJ/mol −1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (Δ f H°) of aqueous Bk 3+ ions is obtained as −601  kJ/mol −1. The standard potential Bk 3+ /Bk 0 is −2.01  V. [ Fuger J A new determination of the enthalpy of solution of berkelium metal and the standard enthalpy of formation of Bk3+ (aq) Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry 43 3209 1981 10.1016/0022-1902(81)80090-5 12 ] The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23  eV. [ Peterson 1984 34 ] [ Allotropes ] At ambient conditions, berkelium assumes its most stable α form which has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P6 3 /mmc, lattice parameters of 341   pm and 1107  pm. The crystal has a double- hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7  GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fm [ 3 ] m. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. [ Peterson 1984 44 ] Upon further compression to 25  GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure similar to that of α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa. [ Benedict U Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures Journal of the Less Common Metals 100 153 1984 10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4 ] { Young, David A. Phase diagrams of the elements, University of California Press, 1991, ISBN 0-520-07483-1 p. 228 } Upon heating, α-berkelium transforms into another &quot; metastable &quot; phase (that is at ambient temperature it gradually converts back to α-berkelium). This phase has an fcc lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group Fm [ 3 ] m and the lattice constant of 500  pm; this fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point. [ Fahey J. A. Peterson J. R. Baybarz R.

Phys. 77 3 1464–68 10.1063/1.443975 1982JChPh..77.1464W ] [ Chemical ] Like all actinide s, berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This trivalent oxidation state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent and possibly divalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride - strontium chloride melts. [ Peterson 1984 55 ] [ Sullivan Jim C. Schmidt K. H. Morss L.

Pulse radiolysis studies of berkelium(III): preparation and identification of berkelium(II) in aqueous perchlorate media Inorganic Chemistry 27 597 1988 10.1021/ic00277a005 4 ] A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, terbium. Aqueous solutions of Bk 3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of the Bk 4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. [ Peterson 1984 55 ] [ Holleman 2007 1956 ] [ Greenwood 1997 1265 ] Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogen s, chalcogen s and pnictogen s to form various binary compounds. [ Peterson 1984 45 ] [ Isotopes ] [ Isotopes of berkelium ] About twenty isotopes and six nuclear isomer s (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the atomic numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All of them are radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247 Bk (1,380  years), 248 Bk (9 years) and 249 Bk (330  days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45 [ -3 ] % with respect to the β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter as most actinide isotopes. [ B. Myasoedov et al. Analytical chemistry of transplutonium elements Moscow Nauka 1972 0-470-62715-8 ] [ Audi G 10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties 1997 1 624 Nuclear Physics A http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf 1997NuPhA.624....1A ] [ Occurrence ] The longest-lived isotope of berkelium ( 247 Bk) has a half-life of only 1,380 years. Therefore, all primordial berkelium, that is berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now. On Earth, berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas, which were used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as Chernobyl disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll ), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956. [ Fields P. Studier M. Diamond H. Mech J. Inghram M. Pyle G. Stevens C. Fried S. Manning W. Transplutonium Elements in Thermonuclear Test Debris Physical Review 102 180 1956 10.1103/PhysRev.102.180 1956PhRv..102..180F ] Nuclear reactors produce mostly, among the berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage and before the fuel disposal, most of it breaks down to californium-249. The latter has a long half-life, of 351 years, [ http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/ NNDC contributors Alejandro A. Sonzogni (Database Manager) Chart of Nuclides National Nuclear Data Center, Brookhaven National Laboratory 2010-03-01 2008 Upton, New York CITEREFNNDC2008 ] and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products. A few atoms of berkelium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium -bearing deposits, thus making it the rarest naturally occurring element.

In a more common case of uranium fuel, plutonium is produced first by neutron capture (the so-called (n,γ) reaction or neutron fusion) followed by beta-decay: [ Thompson S. Ghiorso A. Harvey B. Choppin G.

The higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons, converting 239 Pu to 244 Cm and then to 249 Cm: \mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {4(n,\gamma)} \ ^{243}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [4.956 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h] {\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm} \quad; \quad \mathrm{^{244}_{\ 96}Cm\ \xrightarrow {5(n,\gamma)} \ ^{249}_{\ 96}Cm} Curium-249 has a short half-life of 64 minutes, and thus its further conversion to 250 Cm has a low probability. Instead, it transforms by beta-decay into 249 Bk: \mathrm{^{249}_{\ 96}Cm\ \xrightarrow [64.15 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{249}_{\ 97}Bk\ \xrightarrow [330 \ d] {\beta^-} \ ^{249}_{\ 98}Cf} The thus-produced 249 Bk has a long half-life of 330 days and thus can capture another neutron. However, the product, 250 Bk, again has a relatively short half-life of 3.212 hours and thus, does not yield higher actinides. Instead decays to the californium isotope 250 Cf: [ Magnusson L.

This makes 249 Bk the most accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66  grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983 [ Peterson 1984 30 ] ) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram. { Hammond C. R. &quot; The elements &quot; in } The isotope 248 Bk was first obtained in 1956 by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with 25 MeV α-particles. Although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with 245 Bk, the existence of a new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product 248 Cf which had been previously characterized. The half-life of 248 Cf was estimated as 23 ± 5 hours and a more reliable value still is not known. [ Hulet E.

These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromate s (BrO 3 – ), bismuthate s (BiO 3 – ), chromate s (CrO 4 2– and Cr 2 O 7 2– ), silver(I) thiolate ( [ Ag 2 S 2 O 8 ] ), lead(IV) oxide (PbO 2 ), ozone ( [ O 3 ] ), or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), amine s, tributyl phosphate or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains). [ Peterson 1984 32 ] A more detailed procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxide s, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one of the procedures described above. [ Peterson 1984 32 ] Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment. [ Peterson 1984 33–34 ] [ Bulk metal preparation ] In order to characterize chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target and in the first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6  micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. [ Peterson 1984 30 ] { S. G. Thompson, BB Cunningham: &quot; First Macroscopic Observations of the Chemical Properties of Berkelium and californium, &quot; supplement to Paper P/825 presented at the Second International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Geneva, 1958 } This irradiation method was, and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.

In a &quot; typical processing campaign &quot; at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium-249 and einsteinium, and picogram quantities of fermium.

The berkelium oxide system☆ Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry 30 1769 1968 10.1016/0022-1902(68)80352-5 7 ] while berkelium(III) oxide is a yellow-green solid with a melting point of 1920 °C [ Holleman 2007 1972 ] and is formed from BkO 2 by reduction with molecular hydrogen : \mathrm{2\ BkO_2\ +\ H_2\ \longrightarrow \ Bk_2O_3\ +\ H_2O} Upon heating to 1200 °C, the oxide Bk 2 O 3 undergoes a phase change; it undergoes another phase change at 1750 °C. Such three-phase behavior is typical for the actinide sesquioxides. Berkelium(II) oxide, BkO, has been reported as a brittle gray solid but its exact chemical composition remains uncertain. [ Peterson 1984 51 ] [ Halides ] In halide s, berkelium assumes the oxidation states +3 and +4. [ Holleman 2007 1969 ] The +3 state is the most stable, especially in solutions, while the tetravalent halides BkF 4 and Cs 2 BkCl 6 are only known in the solid phase. [ Peterson 1984 47 ] The coordination of berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with the coordination number of 9. In trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic (coordination 8) or octahedral (coordination 6), and in the iodide it is octahedral.

The most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride, while upon heating to between 350 and 600 °C, it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride.

It can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500  °C. This green solid has a melting point of 600 °C, [ Holleman 2007 1969 ] and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride. [ Peterson J.R. Cunningham B.B.

[ Peterson 1984 52 ] Two forms of berkelium(III) bromide are known: one with berkelium having coordination 6, and one with coordination 8. [ Peterson 1984 38 ] The latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350  °C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied on these two crystal forms: the structure of fresh and aged 249 BkBr 3 samples was probed by X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of berkelium-249 had converted to californium-249. No change in structure was observed upon 249 BkBr 3 — 249 CfBr 3 transformation. However, other differences were noted for 249 BkBr 3 and 249 CfBr 3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to 249 CfBr 2, but the former could be not – this result was reproduced on individual 249 BkBr 3 and 249 CfBr 3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Beside a chemical contamination, 249 Cf, as an alpha emitter brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice and the resulting self-heating. The chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results. [ Peterson 1984 47 ] [ Other inorganic compounds ] The pnictide s of berkelium-249 of the type BkX are known for the elements nitrogen, [ Stevenson J Peterson J Preparation and structural studies of elemental curium-248 and the nitrides of curium-248 and berkelium-249 Journal of the Less Common Metals 66 201 1979 10.1016/0022-5088(79)90229-7 2 ] phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They crystallize in the rock-salt structure and are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium(III) hydride (BkH 3 ) or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperature (about 600  °C) under high vacuum.

Preparation and lattice parameters of 249 Bk monopnictides Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry 42 995 1980 10.1016/0022-1902(80)80390-3 7 ] Berkelium(III) sulfide, Bk 2 S 3, was prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at 1130  °C, or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with elemental sulfur. These procedures yielded brownish-black crystals. [ Peterson 1984 53 ] Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) hydroxides are both stable in 1 molar solutions of sodium hydroxide. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO 4 ) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under excitation with a green light. [ Peterson 1984 39–40 ] Berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH 2+x (0 &lt; x &lt; 1). [ Peterson 1984 53 ] Several other salts of berkelium are known, including an oxysulfide (Bk 2 O 2 S), and hydrated nitrate ( [ Bk(NO 3 ) 3 ·4H 2 O ] ), chloride ( [ BkCl 3 ·6H 2 O ] ), sulfate ( [ Bk 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ·12H 2 O ] ) and oxalate ( [ Bk 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 ·4H 2 O ] ). [ Peterson 1984 47 ] Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to [ BkO 2 ] ) of [ Bk 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ·12H 2 O ] yields the crystals of berkelium(III) oxysulfate ( [ Bk 2 O 2 SO 4 ] ). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in inert atmosphere. [ Peterson 1984 54 ] [ Organoberkelium compounds ] Berkelium forms a trigonal (η 5 –C 5 H 5 ) 3 Bk metallocene complex with three cyclopentadienyl rings, which can be synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C 5 H 5 ) 2 ) at about 70  °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm 3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250  °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350  °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). [ Laubereau Peter G. Burns John H.

The optical absorption spectra of this compound are very similar to those of (η 5 –C 5 H 5 ) 3 Bk.

Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful as a source of the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR. [ Richard G. Haire Californium The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements Lester R. Morss Norman M.

This target yielded the first 6 ato ms of ununseptium at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a culmination of the Russia—US collaboration between JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989. { Collaboration Expands the Periodic Table, One Element at a Time, Science and Technology Review, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, October/November 2010 } { Nuclear Missing Link Created at Last: Superheavy Element 117, Science daily, 7 April 2010 } [ Nuclear fuel cycle ] The nuclear fission properties of berkelium are different from those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. { G. Pfennig, H. Klewe-Nebenius, W.

The JEFF evaluated nuclear data project 20082007 10.1051/ndata:07476 ] In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor. Its critical mass is relatively high at 192  kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope. { Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire: &quot; Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety. data and limits for actinides in transport &quot;, p. 16 } Berkelium-247 can maintain chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron and in a fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7  kg for a bare sphere, 41.2  kg with a water reflector and 35.2  kg with a steel reflector (30  cm thickness). [ Health issues ] Little is known about the effects of berkelium on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles and/or neutrons for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126 keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory. { Emeleus, H. J. Advances in inorganic chemistry, Academic Press, 1987, ISBN 0-12-023631-1 p. 32 } Most available berkelium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50  years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20  years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. { International Commission on Radiological Protection Limits for intakes of radionuclides by workers, Part 4, Volume 19, Issue 4, Elsevier Health Sciences, ISBN, 0080368867 p. 14 } In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible body burden for the isotope berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4  nanograms. { Pradyot Patnaik.
