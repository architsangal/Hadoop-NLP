The Lexus marque is marketed in over 70 countries and territories worldwide, [ http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/drives/2010_lexus_rx_350_rx_450h 2010 Lexus RX 350 &amp; RX 450h - First Drive Road &amp; Track 2010-05-15 Wilson Tom 2009-02-13 ] and has ranked among the ten largest Japanese global brand s in market value.

Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Torrance, California, United States. Lexus originated from a clandestine flagship sedan project, code-name d F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the original Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible, and SUV models. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted, and additional hybrid models later joined the division&apos;s lineup. In 2007, Lexus launched its own F marque performance division with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009. From the start of production, Lexus vehicles have been produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota&apos;s Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka, Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus built outside the country, the Ontario, Canada -produced RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus also operates its own design, engineering, and manufacturing centers, solely responsible for the division&apos;s vehicles. Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market in the United States through an ongoing global expansion. The division inaugurated dealership s in Japan&apos;s domestic market in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin. Further debuts in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and other export regions have since followed. The division&apos;s lineup has also been expanded to reflect regional specifications in model and powertrain configurations. [ 3 ] [ History ] [ 1980s: The F1 project ] In 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda summoned a secret meeting of company executives, to whom he posed the question, “Can we create a luxury vehicle to challenge the world&apos;s best?” [ May 2006 43 ] This question prompted Toyota to embark on a top-secret project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”). [ May 2006 42 ] The F1 project, whose finished product was ultimately the Lexus LS 400, aimed to develop a flagship sedan that would expand Toyota’s product line, giving it a foothold in the premium segment and offering both longtime and new customers an upmarket product. [ http://www.autolinedetroit.tv/autoline/watch.php?stream%3D927 How Lexus Was Successful in the U.S. (interview) 2006 WMV Press Jim 2006 Auto Line Detroit ] The F1 project followed the success of the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Cressida models. { White, John. New Route for Japanese Cars: Luxury. } { The Boston Globe. (1989-10-23) } Both the Supra and Cressida were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful &apos;&apos;7M-GE&apos;&apos;/&apos;&apos;7M-GTE&apos;&apos; inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, its domestic flagship and sole V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan. [ Dawson 2004 6–7, 63 ] [ Long 2001 16–21 ] The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market, and along with the Crown not slated for export. F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine. The opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had grown in the 1980s due to voluntary export restraints, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales. [ Dawson 2004 xix, 28 ] In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota&apos;s plans for a luxury division; [ Dawson 2004 109 ] the initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric / Gloria and Mazda Luce.

Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct focus group s and market research on luxury consumers. [ Dawson 2004 35, 41 ] During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads. [ http://www.edmunds.com/lexus/ Edmunds.com Lexus Overview Edmunds.com 2011-05-23 ] Toyota’s market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new flagship sedan, and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.

Image consulting firm Lippincott &amp; Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates. [ Mahler 2004 56–57 ] While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars (being associated with the Alexis Carrington character on the popular 1980s primetime drama &apos;&apos;Dynasty&apos;&apos; ), and as a result the first letter was removed and the &quot; i &quot; replaced with a &quot; u &quot; to morph the name to Lexus. [ Dawson 2004 111 ] The etymology of the Lexus name has been attributed to the combination of the words &quot; luxury &quot; and &quot; elegance, &quot; [ http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2005/07/26/toyota-lexus-autos-cx_cn_0726autofacescan02.html Watanabe&apos;s Toyota Rolls Out Lexus In Japan 2005-07-26 Forbes Noon Chris 2008-06-05 ] and another theory claims it is an acronym for &quot; luxury exports to the U.S. &quot; According to Team One interviews, the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image. Just prior to the release of the first vehicles, database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used as they stated it might cause confusion. [ Dawson 2004 128–30 ] The injunction threatened to delay the division&apos;s launch and marketing efforts. Upon reflection, a U.S. appeals court lifted the injunction, deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products. The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became &quot; The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection. &quot; [ Dawson 2004 113–14 ] The Lexus logo was developed by Molly Designs and Hunter Communications.

The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo, designed by Team One, appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York auto shows in 1988. [ Dawson 2004 115 ] [ Launch ] { LS 400 flagship sedan launched in 1989, introducing Lexus to the world. } { alt=Front quarter view of a sedan parked on a street. } In 1989, after an extended development process involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, around 450 prototypes, and over [ 1 billion ] in costs, the F1 project was completed. [ Dawson 2004 24 ] The resulting flagship, the Lexus LS 400, had a unique design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 gasoline engine and rear-wheel drive. [ Dawson 2004 xxi, 69 ] [ Mahler 2004 31 ] The LS 400 debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and officially went on sale the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships across the U.S. [ May 2006 47 ] The LS 400 was sold along with a smaller sibling, the Toyota Camry -based ES 250. The launch of Lexus was heralded by a multimillion dollar advertising campaign in both television and print media. [ Dawson 2004 117–18 ] At its debut, the LS 400 was widely praised for its quietness, well-appointed and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy, and value, [ Dawson 2004 68–76 ] although it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. [ Dawson 2004 72–6 ] The LS 400 debuted at [ 38,000 ] in the U.S. (in some markets, it was priced against mid-size six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models) [ http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D115368 Lexus LS 400, LS 430 and LS 460 Generations: Setting the Standard in the Most Comfortable Way Possible 2010-07-08 Edmunds.com 2003-03-13 http://web.archive.org/web/20080705230718/http%3A//www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D115368 2008-07-05 ] and was rated by Car and Driver magazine as better than both the [ 63,000 ] Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and the [ 55,000 ] BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling, and performance.

BMW&apos;s and Mercedes-Benz&apos;s U.S. sales figures dropped 29% and 19%, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35% of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac to make their purchase. { SC 400 coupe became the third Lexus model to debut. } { alt=Front quarter view of a coupe. } In December 1989, Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s sold to date, based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light. In a sweeping 20-day operation which replaced the parts on all affected vehicles, Lexus sent technicians to pick up, repair, and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flew in personnel and rented garage space for owners in remote locations. This response was lauded in media publications and helped establish the marque&apos;s early reputation for customer service.

That year, Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia. [ Long 2001 41–42 ] In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, the SC 400, which shared the LS 400’s V8 engine and rear-wheel drive design. This was followed by the second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus&apos; top seller.
