Origins of Volusia http://www.volusia.org/about/name.htm Volusia County 17 August 2011 ] The origins of the word &quot; Volusia &quot; are unclear, though there are several theories: [ Simmons William Hayne Notices of East Florida 1822 University of Florida Press (1973 reprint) Gainesville, FL 0-8130-0400-4 27, 28, 59 18 August 2011 http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00103078/00001/1j ] [ Poertner Bo While Visiting France, Volusia Man Finds Possible Link To County&apos;s Name http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-05-10/news/9705091605_1_volusia-gaby-johns-river 18 August 2011 Orlando Sentinel 10 May 1997 ] [ Gold Pleasant Daniel History of Volusia County Florida 1927 Higginson Book Company (reprint) Daytona Beach, FL 0-8328-7061-7 78–84 ] [ The Journal of American History 1917 January–March 11 1 68 17 August 2011 ] The name came from a word meaning &quot; Land of the Euchee, &quot; from the Euchee Indians who migrated into the area after the Timucua Indian cultures faded away in the early 1700s. The Euchees (or Uchees) lived in the area of Spring Gardens, about ten miles south of Volusia. The name was taken from the a British man named Voluz who owned a plantation located on the St. Johns River in the late 1700s. The name originated from the last name Veluche belonging to the French or Belgian owner of the trading post in Volusia. According to some, this was during the British regime, and according to others, it was around 1818. Over time, the name Veluche became anglicized to Volusia. The town was established by and named for Jere Volusia. The settlement was named by the Spanish after the celebrated Roman jurist Volusio, who wrote 30 books and tutored Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor and philosopher. The land area of present day Volusia County was inhabited by the indigenous Timucua, and Mayaca people. Neither group exists today as distinct racial entities, having been decimated by war and disease after contact with European settlers. Evidence of their habitation can still be seen in various areas of Volusia County such as the large shell midden s at Tomoka State Park. During the British occupation of Florida, a failed colony was started in southeast Volusia County by Andrew Turnbull, known as New Smyrna. This colony was connected to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, via the Kings Road. After the failure of the colony the settlers, many of Minorca n heritage made the [ 70 mi km on ] journey to live in St. Augustine. The Seminole Indians, descendants of the Creek tribe of Alabama and Georgia who resisted forced relocation to Indian Territory also camped in various parts of Volusia County. During the Second Seminole War (1836–1842) a large sugar plantation in what is today the city of Daytona Beach was burned by the Seminole. On the east shore of the St. Johns River in Volusia, in present day Debary, General Winfield Scott established a fort/depot in 1836 named Fort Florida.
