For the disease, see shigellosis Shigella is a genus of Gram-negative, nonspore forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacteria closely related to Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The causative agent of human shigellosis, Shigella causes disease in primate s, but not in other mammals.

George ] [ February 2012 ] It is only naturally found in humans and apes. [ 10.1007/s10669-006-8666-3 ] During infection, it typically causes dysentery. [ Mims, Playfair, Roitt, Wakelin, Williams Medical Microbiology 1st Mosby 1993 0-397-44631-4 A.24 ] The genus is named after Kiyoshi Shiga, who first discovered it in 1898. Phylogenetic studies indicate that Shigella is more appropriately treated as subgenus of Escherichia, and that certain strains generally considered E. coli – such as &apos;&apos;E. coli&apos;&apos; O157:H7 – are better placed in Shigella (see Escherichia coli#Diversity for details). [ Classification ] Shigella species are classified by four serogroups : Serogroup A: S. dysenteriae (12 serotypes) Serogroup B: S. flexneri (6 serotypes) Serogroup C: S. boydii (18 serotypes) Serogroup D: S. sonnei (1 serotype) Groups A–C are physiologically similar; S. sonnei (group D) can be differentiated on the basis of biochemical metabolism assays.

[ Levinson Warren E Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology 2006 McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division 978-0-07-146031-6 9 http://books.google.ca/books?id%3DQ_80CUAd_ikC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse February 27, 2012 30 ] Shigella causes dysentery that results in the destruction of the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa in the cecum and rectum. Some strains produce enterotoxin and shiga toxin, similar to the verotoxin of &apos;&apos;E. coli&apos;&apos; O157:H7 and other verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli. Both shiga toxin and verotoxin are associated with causing hemolytic uremic syndrome. As noted above, these supposed E. coli strains are at least in part actually more closely related to Shigella than to the &quot; typical &quot; E. coli. Shigella invade the host through the M-cells in the gut epithelia of the large intestine, as they cannot enter directly through the epithelial cells. Using a Type III secretion system acting as a biological syringe, the bacterium injects IpaD protein into cells, triggering bacterial invasion and the subsequent lysis of vacuolar membranes using IpaB and IpaC proteins. It uses a mechanism for its motility by which its IcsA protein triggers actin polymerization in the host cell (via N-WASP recruitment of Arp2/3 complexes ) in a &quot; rocket &quot; propulsion fashion for cell-to-cell spread.The most common symptoms are diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and flatulence. The stool may contain blood, mucus, or pus. In rare cases, young children may have seizure s. Symptoms can take as long as a week to show up, but most often begin two to four days after ingestion. Symptoms usually last for several days, but can last for weeks. Shigella is implicated as one of the pathogenic causes of reactive arthritis worldwide.

The Shigella chromosome s share most of their genes with those of E. coli K12 strain MG1655.

(However, S. sonnei can ferment lactose).

Shigella should also be urea hydrolysis negative. When inoculated to a triple sugar iron (TSI) slant, they react as follows: K/A, gas -, H2S -. Indole reactions are mixed, positive and negative, with the exception of S. sonnei, which is always indole negative. Growth on Hektoen enteric agar will produce bluish-green colonies for Shigella and bluish-green colonies with black centers for Salmonella. [ Prevention and Treatment ] Hand washing before handling food and thoroughly cooking all food before eating decreases the risk of getting Shigella. [ Ram PK Crump JA, Gupta SK, Miller MA, Mintz ED Analysis of Data Gaps Pertaining to Shigella Infections in Low and Medium Human Development Index Countries, 1984-2005 Epidemiology and Infection 2008 136 5 577–603 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870860/?tool%3Dpubmed 7 May 2012 ] Severe dysentery can be treated with ampicillin, TMP-SMX, or fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, and of course rehydration. Medical treatment should only be used in severe cases. Antibiotics are usually avoided in mild cases because some Shigella are resistant to antibiotics, and their use may make the germ even more resistant. Antidiarrheal agents may worsen the sickness, and should be avoided. [ How can Shigella infections be treated? http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/shigellosis/#treat Shigellosis: General Information Centers for Disease Control and Prevention February 11, 2012 ] For Shigella-associated diarrhea, antibiotics shorten the length of infection.

Insufficient data exist, but conservative estimates suggest that Shigella causes approximately 90 million cases of severe dysentery with at least 100,000 of these resulting in death each year, mostly among children in the developing world. Currently, no licenced vaccine targeting Shigella exists. Shigella has been a longstanding World Health Organization target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent the disease should be feasible. Several vaccine candidates for Shigella are in various stages of development.
