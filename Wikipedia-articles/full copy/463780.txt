Their work has won numerous awards. In 2004, a subdivision of farbrausch called &quot;.theprodukkt &quot; released a 96kB first-person shooter game named &quot;.kkrieger &quot;, and an earlier version of the tool they currently use to produce some of their demos, named &quot;.werkkzeug &quot;, or &quot; Tool &quot;. Farbrausch is known for giving all of their releases a &quot; product code &quot;, in the format &quot; fr-0# &quot;. The numbers do not specify the order of release — the members have stated that they allocate the numbers as they start working on the project, not when they finish it. They give &quot; minus &quot; numbers to their non-serious releases. Since then they have periodically released ever-improving compositions such as &quot; fr-019: Poem to a Horse &quot;, &quot; fr-030: Candytron &quot; or &quot; fr-025: The.Popular.Demo &quot;. The.Popular.Demo and debris. are among the most highly favored demos on the comprehensive demoscene index, Pouet. The.Popular.Demo is also the recipient of the &quot; Public Choice Award &quot; from the 2003 scene.org awards, and debris. won the 2007 scene.org award for best direction. In 2009, Farbrausch, again under the name.theprodukkt, released.detuned, an interactive demo for the PlayStation 3.
