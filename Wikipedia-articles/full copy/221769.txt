[ BirdLife International 2004 144569 Falco subbuteo 12 May 2006 ] { Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concern } { Animal ia } { Chordata } { Aves } { Falconiformes } { Falconidae } { Falco } { F. subbuteo } { Falco subbuteo } { Linnaeus, 1758 } &apos;&apos;Falco subbuteo&apos;&apos; from Kadzidlowo The Eurasian Hobby (Falco subbuteo), or just simply Hobby, is a small slim falcon. It belongs to a rather close-knit group of similar falcons often considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis. { Helbig et al. (1994), Wink et al. (1998), Nittinger et al. (2005) } [ Description ] Adults are slate-grey above with a dark crown and 2 short black moustachial stripes. The throat is unstreaked white, thighs and undertail coverts are unstreaked rufous and rest of the underparts are whitish with black streaks. Close views enable the red &quot; trousers &quot; and vent to be seen. Sexes are similar. Juveniles are generally much browner, with scaled upper parts and streaked buffy thighs and undertail coverts. [ Rasmussen PC &amp; JC Anderton 2005 Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide. Volume 2 114–115 Smithsonian Institution &amp; Lynx Edicions ] The Hobby has a distinct first-summer plumage. { Small, Brian (1992): First-summer Hobbies in the New Forest } { British Birds 85(5): 251–5 } [ Taxonomy and systematics ] This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Falco subbuteo. [ Linnaeus C Carolus Linnaeus Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I. Editio decima, reformata. Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). 1758 F. cera pedibusque flavis, dorso fusco, nucha alba abdomine pallido maculis oblongis fuseis. 89 ] Currently two subspecies are recognized: subbuteo – the nominate race is resident in Africa, Europe and Central and East Asia, winters in Central and South Africa and South Asia streichi, described by Hartert and Neumann in 1907, is smaller in size and is found further east of subbuteo&apos;s distribution range [ Distribution and status ] This species breeds across Africa, Europe and Asia. It is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa and Asia. [ Behaviour and ecology ] It is a bird of open country such as farmland, marshes, taiga and savannah. They are widespread in lowlands with scattered small woods. It is an elegant bird of prey, appearing sickle-like in flight with its long pointed wings and square tail, often resembling a swift when gliding with folded wings. It flies powerfully and fast. It will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which it transfers from talons to beak and eats while soaring slowly in circles. [ Butler, EA, 1875 Notes on the Avifauna of Mount Aboo and Northern Guzerat Stray Feathers 3 443–444 http://www.archive.org/stream/strayfeathersjou31875hume#page%2F443%2Fmode%2F1up ] It also captures small bats and small birds like swallows, swifts, pipits etc. in flight. Its speed and aerobatic skills enable it to take swallows and even swift s on the wing, and Barn Swallow s or House Martin s have a characteristic &quot; hobby &quot; alarm call. It is known to harass swallows while they are roosting and dispersing from roosts. When not breeding, it is crepuscular, hawking principally in the mornings and evenings. While on migration, they may move in small groups. Hobbies nest in old nests of crows and other birds. The tree selected is most often one in a hedge or on theextreme edge of a spinney, whence the bird can observe intruders from a considerable distance. It lays 2–4 eggs. Incubation is said to take 28 days and both parents share in this duty, though the female does the greater part.

Volume 5 2 ] It is a very bold and courageous bird and was used in falconry, trained to hawk birds like quails, larks, hoopoes, drongos etc. [ The birds of India.
