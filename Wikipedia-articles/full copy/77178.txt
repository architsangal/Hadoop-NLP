{ Proton rocket launching } { Zvezda Service Module for the } { International Space Station in 2000 } Spaceflight (also written space flight) is ballistic flight into or through outer space. Spaceflight can occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board. Examples of human spaceflight include the Russia n Soyuz program, the U.S. Space shuttle program, as well as the ongoing International Space Station. Examples of unmanned spaceflight include space probe s which leave Earth &apos;s orbit, as well as satellite s in orbit around Earth, such as communication satellite s. These operate either by telerobotic control or are fully autonomous. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellite s and other earth observation satellite s. A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. [ 4 ] [ History ] [ History of spaceflight Timeline of spaceflight ] { Tsiolkovsky, early space theorist } The realistic proposal of space travel goes back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. His most famous work, &quot; [ ru Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами ] &quot; (The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices), was published in 1903, but this theoretical work was not widely influential outside of Russia. Spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard &apos;s publication in 1919 of his paper &apos; A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes &apos;; where his application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid fuel rocket s gave sufficient power that interplanetary travel became possible. He also proved in the laboratory that rockets would work in the vacuum of space; not all scientists of that day believed they would. This paper was highly influential on Hermann Oberth and Wernher Von Braun, later key players in spaceflight. The first rocket to reach space, an altitude of 100  km, was the German V-2 Rocket, on a test flight in June 1944. [ January 2011 ] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, which became the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth. The first human spaceflight was Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961, aboard which Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made one orbit around the Earth. The lead architects behind the Soviet space program &apos;s Vostok 1 mission were the rocket scientists Sergey Korolyov and Kerim Kerimov. { Peter Bond, Obituary: Lt-Gen Kerim Kerimov, } { The Independent, 7 April 2003. } Rockets remain the only currently practical means of reaching space. Other non-rocket spacelaunch technologies such as scramjet s still fall far short of orbital speed. [ Phases of spaceflight ] Saturn V on the launch pad before the launch of Apollo 4 [ Launch ] [ Rocket launch ] A rocket launch for a spaceflight usually starts from a spaceport (cosmodrome), which may be equipped with launch complexes and launch pad s for vertical rocket launches, and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft. Spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons. ICBM s have various special launching facilities. A launch is often restricted to certain launch window s. These windows depend upon the position of celestial bodies and orbits relative to the launch site. The biggest influence is often the rotation of the Earth itself. Once launched, orbits are normally located within relatively constant flat planes at a fixed angle to the axis of the Earth, and the Earth rotates within this orbit. A launch pad is a fixed structure designed to dispatch airborne vehicles. It generally consists of a launch tower and flame trench. It is surrounded by equipment used to erect, fuel, and maintain launch vehicles. [ Reaching space ] The most commonly used definition of outer space is everything beyond the Kármán line, which is [ 100 km mi us ] above the Earth&apos;s surface. (The United States sometimes defines outer space as everything beyond [ 50 mi km us ] in altitude.) Rocket s are the only currently practical means of reaching space. Conventional airplane engines cannot reach space due to the lack of oxygen. Rocket engines expel propellant to provide forward thrust that generates enough delta-v (change in velocity) to reach orbit. Propulsion systems for different applications include: Expendable launch system Single stage to orbit For manned launch systems launch escape system s are frequently fitted to allow astronauts to escape in the case of catastrophic failures. [ Other ways of reaching space ] [ Non-rocket spacelaunch ] Many ways other than rockets to reach space have been proposed. Ideas such as the space elevator and rotovators require new materials much stronger than any currently known. [ August 2011 ] Electromagnetic launchers such as launch loop s might be feasible with current technology. Other ideas include rocket assisted jet planes such as Reaction Engines Skylon or the trickier scramjet s. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo. [ Leaving orbit ] [ Escape velocity Direct injection (disambiguation) ] { Luna 1 was the first known man-made object to achieve escape velocity from the Earth. http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1959-012A } { &apos;&apos;Museum replica pictured&apos;&apos; } Achieving a closed orbit is not essential to lunar and interplanetary voyages. Early Russia n space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit. NASA considered launching Apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory. This costs additional propellant because the parking orbit perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee because it will never be reached. However, the parking orbit approach greatly simplified Apollo mission planning in several important ways. It substantially widened the allowable launch window s, increasing the chance of a successful launch despite minor technical problems during the countdown. The parking orbit was a stable &quot; mission plateau &quot; that gave the crew and controllers several hours to thoroughly check out the spacecraft after the stresses of launch before committing it to a long lunar flight; the crew could quickly return to earth, if necessary, or an alternate earth-orbital mission could be conducted. The parking orbit also enabled translunar trajectories that avoided the densest parts of the Van Allen radiation belts. Apollo missions minimized the performance penalty of the parking orbit by keeping its altitude as low as possible. For example, Apollo 15 used an unusually low parking orbit (even for Apollo) of 92.5 by 91.5 nautical miles (171x169 km) where there was significant atmospheric drag. But it was partially overcome by continuous venting of hydrogen from the third stage of the Saturn V, and was in any event tolerable for the short stay. Robotic missions do not require an abort capability or radiation minimization, and because modern launchers routinely meet &quot; instantaneous &quot; launch windows, space probes to the moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance. Although some might coast briefly during the launch sequence, they do not complete one or more full parking orbits before the burn that injects them onto an earth escape trajectory. Note that the escape velocity from a celestial body decreases with altitude above that body. However, it is more fuel-efficient for a craft to burn its fuel as close to the ground as possible; see Oberth effect and reference. { Escape Velocity of Earth. Van.physics.uiuc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-10-05. } This is anotherway to explain the performance penalty associated with establishing the safe perigee of a parking orbit. Plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in Earth orbit, such as NASA&apos;s Project Orion and Russia&apos;s Kliper / Parom tandem. [ Astrodynamics ] [ Astrodynamics ] Astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories, particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects. Astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use. An orbital maneuvering system may be needed to maintain or change orbits. Non-rocket orbital propulsion methods include solar sail s, magnetic sail s, plasma-bubble magnetic systems, and using gravitational slingshot effects. [ Reentry ] [ Atmospheric reentry ] Ionized gas trail from Shuttle re-entry Vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy. This energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. The theory behind reentry is due to Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle and the heat energy instead ends up in the atmosphere. [ Landing ] The Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules all splashed down in the sea. These capsules were designed to land at relatively slow speeds.Russian capsules for Soyuz make use of braking rockets as were designed to touch down on land.The Space Shuttle and Buran glide to a touchdown at high speed. [ Recovery ] { Discoverer  14 return capsule by a } { C-119 airplane } After a successful landing the spacecraft, its occupants and cargo can be recovered. In some cases, recovery has occurred before landing: while a spacecraft is still descending on its parachute, it can be snagged by a specially designed aircraft. This mid-air retrieval technique was used to recover the film canisters from the Corona spy satellites. [ Types of spaceflight ] [ Human spaceflight ] [ Human spaceflight ] The first human spaceflight was Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961, on which cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin of the USSR made one orbit around the Earth. In official Soviet documents, there is no mention of the fact that Gagarin parachuted the final seven miles. { Vostok 1. Astronautix.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-05. } The international rules for aviation records stated that &quot; The pilot remains in his craft from launch to landing &quot;. This rule, if applied, would have &quot; disqualified &quot; Gagarin&apos;s spaceflight. Currently the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight is the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The U.S. Space Shuttle fleet has been retired. Each of those space programs have used other craft in the past. Recently, the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft has been used three times for human spaceflight, and SpaceShipOne twice. { International Space Station in earth } { orbit after a visit from the crew of } { STS-119. } [ Sub-orbital spaceflight ] [ Sub-orbital spaceflight ] On a sub-orbital spaceflight the spacecraft reaches space and then returns to the atmosphere after following a (primarily) ballistic trajectory. This is usually because of insufficient specific orbital energy, in which case a suborbital flight will last only a few minutes, but it is also possible for an object with enough energy for an orbit to have a trajectory that intersects the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, sometimes after many hours. Pioneer 1 was NASA&apos;s first space probe intended to reach the Moon. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of [ 113854 km mi us ] before reentering the Earth&apos;s atmosphere 43 hours after launch. The most generally recognized boundary of space is the Kármán line (actually a sphere) 100  km above sea level. (NASA alternatively defines an astronaut as someone who has flown more than [ 50 mi km ] or 80  km above sea level.) It is not generally recognized by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the Kármán line is only about 3% of the orbital energy (potential plus kinetic energy) required by the lowest possible earth orbit (a circular orbit just above the Kármán line.) In other words, it is far easier to reach space than to stay there. On May 17, 2004, Civilian Space eXploration Team launched the GoFast Rocket on a suborbital flight, the first amateur spaceflight. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne was used for the first privately-funded human spaceflight. [ Orbital spaceflight ] [ Orbital spaceflight ] A minimal orbital spaceflight requires much higher velocities than a minimal sub-orbital flight, and so it is technologically much more challenging to achieve. To achieve orbital spaceflight, the tangential velocity around the Earth is as important as altitude. In order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space, the spacecraft must reach the minimal orbital speed required for a closed orbit. [ Interplanetary spaceflight ] [ Interplanetary spaceflight ] Interplanetary travel is travel between planets within a single planetary system. In practice, the use of the term is confined to travel between the planets of the Solar System. [ Interstellar spaceflight ] [ Interstellar travel ] Five spacecraft are currently leaving the Solar System on escape trajectories. The one farthest from the Sun is Voyager 1, which is more than 100 AU distant and is moving at 3.6 AU per year. [ http://www.heavens-above.com/solar-escape.asp Spacecraft escaping the Solar System Heavens-Above GmbH ] In comparison Proxima Centauri, the closest star other than the Sun, is 267,000 AU distant. It will take Voyager 1 over 74,000 years to reach this distance. Vehicle designs using other techniques, such as nuclear pulse propulsion are likely to be able to reach the nearest star significantly faster. An artist&apos;s imaginative impression of a vehicle entering a wormhole Another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of time dilation, as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little, in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on-board time. However, attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new, advanced method of propulsion. [ Intergalactic spaceflight ] [ Intergalactic travel ] Intergalactic travel involves spaceflight between galaxies, and is considered much more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel and, by current engineering terms, is considered science fiction. [ Point-to-point sub-orbital spaceflight ] Point-to-point sub-orbital spaceflight is a category of spaceflight in which a spacecraft uses a sub-orbital flight for transportation. This can provide a two-hour trip from London to Sydney. Today, no company offers this type of spaceflight for transportation. However, Virgin Galactic is planning to build a spaceplane called SpaceShipThree, which will offer this service in the future. [ Spacecraft and launch systems ] [ Spacecraft ] An Apollo Lunar Module on the lunar surface Spacecraft are vehicles capable of controlling their trajectory through space. The first &apos;true spacecraft&apos; is sometimes said to be Apollo Lunar Module, { Apollo Expeditions to the Moon: Chapter 10. History.nasa.gov (1969-03-03). Retrieved on 2011-10-05. } since this was the only manned vehicle to have been designed for, and operated only in space; and is notable for its non aerodynamic shape. [ Spacecraft propulsion ] [ Spacecraft propulsion ] Spacecraft today predominantly use rocket s for propulsion, but other propulsion techniques such as ion drive s are becoming more common, particularly for unmanned vehicles, and this can significantly reduce the vehicle&apos;s mass and increase its delta-v. [ Expendable launch systems ] [ Expendable launch system ] All current spaceflight except NASA &apos;s Space Shuttle and the SpaceX Falcon 1 use multi-stage expendable launch systems to reach space. [ Reusable launch systems ] [ Reusable launch system ] The &apos;&apos;Space Shuttle Columbia&apos;&apos; seconds after engine ignition on mission STS-1 The first reusable spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963. The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin &apos;s flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. The Enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was the Columbia, followed by the Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. The Endeavour was built to replace the Challenger, which was lost in January 1986. The Columbia broke up during reentry in February 2003. The first (and so far only) automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the Buran (Snowstorm), launched by the USSR on November 15, 1988, although it made only one flight. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the U. S. Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran. Per the Vision for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle is due to be retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age and high cost of the program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle&apos;s human transport role is to be replaced by the partially reusable Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) no later than 2014. The Shuttle&apos;s heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) or a Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle. Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company will build its successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers ( space tourists ) in 2008, but this was delayed due to an accident in the propulsion development. { Launch aircraft development continues while suborbital ship awaits investigation into fatal explosion in California, retrieved 2012-01-27. } [ Challenges associated with spaceflight ] [ Effect of spaceflight on the human body ] [ Space disasters ] [ Space accidents and incidents ] All launch vehicles contain a huge amount of energy that is needed for some part of it to reach orbit. There is therefore some risk that this energy can be released prematurely and suddenly, with significant effects. When a Delta II rocket exploded 13 seconds after launch on January 17, 1997, there were reports of store windows [ 10 mi km ] away being broken by the blast. [ http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9701/17/rocket.explosion/index.html Unmanned rocket explodes after liftoff CNN ] Space is a fairly predictable environment, but there are still risks of accidental depressurisation and the potential failure of equipment, some of which may be very newly developed. In 2004 the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety was established in the Netherlands to further international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety. [ http://www.congrex.nl/07a02/ The second IAASS: Introduction 3 January 2009 Congrex European Space Agency ] [ Weightlessness ] [ Weightlessness ] { ISS in weightless conditions. } { Michael Foale can be seen exercising in the foreground. } In a microgravity environment such as that provided by a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth, humans experience a sense of &quot; weightlessness. &quot; Short-term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health issues. The most significant is bone loss, some of which is permanent, but microgravity also leads to significant deconditioning of muscular and cardiovascular tissues. [ Radiation ] Once above the atmosphere, radiation due to the Van Allen belts, solar radiation and cosmic radiation issues occur and increase. Further away from the Earth, solar flare s can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes, and the health threat from cosmic radiation significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade exposure or more. { Super Spaceships, } { NASA, 16 September 2002, Retrieved 25 October 2011. } [ Life support ] [ Life support system ] In human spaceflight, the life support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space. NASA often uses the phrase Environmental Control and Life Support System or the acronym ECLSS when describing these systems for its human spaceflight missions. [ http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm Breathing Easy on the Space Station NASA ] The life support system may supply: air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body&apos;s waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques. [ Space weather ] [ Space weather ] [[Image:Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Aurora australis and &apos;&apos;Discovery&apos;&apos;, May 1991.]]Space weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in outer space. It is distinct from the concept of weather within a planetary atmosphere, and deals with phenomena involving ambient plasma, magnetic fields, radiation and other matter in space (generally close to Earth but also in interplanetary, and occasionally interstellar medium ). &quot; Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems. Our space weather is a consequence of the behavior of the sun, the nature of Earth&apos;s magnetic field, and our location in the solar system. &quot; { Space Weather: A Research Perspective, } { National Academy of Science, 1997 } Space weather exerts a profound influence in several areas related to space exploration and development. Changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. Geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors aboard spacecraft, or interfere with on-board electronics. An understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for manned spacecraft. [ Environmental considerations ] Rockets as a class are not inherently grossly polluting. However, some rockets use toxic propellants, and most vehicles use propellants that are not carbon neutral. Many solid rockets have chlorine in the form of perchlorate or other chemicals, and this can cause temporary local holes in the ozone layer. Re-entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer. Most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction. In addition to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. There is the possibility that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles ( Kessler syndrome ). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use. [ Applications of spaceflight ] [ List of private spaceflight companies ] ISS habitant stores samples Current spaceflights are frequently, but not invariably paid for by governments; but there are strong launch markets such as satellite television that is purely commercial, although the launchers themselves are often at least partly funded by governments. Uses for spaceflight include: Earth observation satellite s such as Spy satellite s, weather satellite s Space exploration Space tourism is a small market at present Communication satellite s Satellite navigation There is growing interest in spacecraft and flights paid for by commercial companies and even private individuals. It is thought that some of the high cost of access to space is due to governmental inefficiencies; and certainly the costs of the governmental paperwork surrounding NASA is legendary [ October 2009 ]. If a commercial company were able to be more efficient, costs could come down significantly. Space launch vehicles such as Falcon I have been wholly developed with private finance, and the quoted costs for launch are lower.
