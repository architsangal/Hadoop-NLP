[ yes ] [ November 2009 ] A meme ( [ icon ˈ m iː m ]; [ meem &apos; ] ) [ Dawkins Richard Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene Oxford University Press 1989 2 0-19-286092-5 192 http://books.google.com/?id%3DWkHO9HI7koEC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA192 We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. &apos;Mimeme&apos; comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like &apos;gene&apos;. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to &apos;memory&apos;, or to the French word même. It should be pronounced to rhyme with &apos;cream&apos;. ] ) is &quot; an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. &quot; { Meme. Merriam-Webster Dictionary } A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practices, which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate and respond to selective pressures. [ Graham 2002 ] The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα [ míːmɛːma ] mīmēma, &quot; something imitated &quot;, from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, &quot; to imitate &quot;, from μῖμος mimos &quot; mime &quot; ) { The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition, 2000 } and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) [ Millikan 2004 16 ] {; Varieties of meaning &quot; Richard Dawkins invented the term &apos;memes&apos; to stand for items that are reproduced by imitation rather than reproduced genetically. &quot; } as a concept for discussion of evolution ary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion and the technology of building arches. [ Dawkins 1989 352 ] Proponents theorize that memes may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition and inheritance, each of which influence a meme&apos;s reproductive success. Memes spread through the behaviors that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts. [ Kelly 1994 p.360 ] { : &quot; But if we consider culture as its own self organizing system,—a system with its own agenda and pressure to survive—then the history of humanity gets even more interesting. As Richard Dawkins has shown, systems of self-replicating ideas or memes can quickly accumulate their own agenda and behaviours. I assign no higher motive to a cultural entity than the primitive drive to reproduce itself and modify its environment to aid its spread. One way the self organizing system can do this is by consuming human biological resources. &quot; } A field of study called memetics [ Heylighen Chielens 2009 ] arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirical ly. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. [ McNamara 2011 ] Some commentators [ September 2010 ] question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units. Others, including Dawkins himself, have argued that this usage of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal. { Burman, J. T. (2012). The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999. } { Perspectives on Science, 20(1), 75-104. doi:10.1162/POSC_a_00057 (This is an } { open access article, made freely available courtesy of } { MIT Press.) } [ History ] [ Origins ] The word meme originated with Dawkins&apos; 1976 book The Selfish Gene. To emphasize commonality with gene s, Dawkins coined the term &quot; meme &quot; by shortening &quot; mimeme &quot;, which derives from the Greek word mimema ( &quot; something imitated &quot; ). He said that he wanted &quot; a monosyllable that sounds a bit like &apos;gene&apos; &quot;. Dawkins wrote that evolution depended not on the particular chemical basis of genetics, but only on the existence of a self-replicating unit of transmission—in the case of biological evolution, the gene. For Dawkins, the meme exemplified another self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution. [ Concept ] Dawkins used the term to refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator. He hypothesised that one could view many cultural entities as replicators, and pointed to melodies, fashions and learned skills as examples. Memes generally replicate through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient copiers of information and behaviour. Because humans do not always copy memes perfectly, and because they may refine, combine or otherwise modify them with other memes to create new memes, they can change over time. Dawkins likened the process by which memes survive and change through the evolution of culture to the natural selection of genes in biological evolution. Dawkins defined the meme as a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation and replication, but later definitions would vary. Memes, analogously to genes, vary in their aptitude to replicate; memes which are good at getting themselves copied tend to spread and remain, whereas the less good ones have a higher probability of being ignored and forgotten. Thus &quot; better &quot; memes are selected. The lack of a consistent, rigorous, and precise understanding of what typically makes up one unit of cultural transmission remains a problem in debates about memetics. [ Blackmore 1999 ] In contrast, the concept of genetics gained concrete evidence with the discovery of the biological functions of DNA. Meme transmission does not necessarily require a physical medium, unlike genetic transmission. [ Transmission ] Life-forms can transmit information both vertically (from parent to child, via replication of genes) and horizontally (through viruses and other means). Malcolm Gladwell wrote, &quot; A meme is an idea that behaves like a virus --that moves through a population, taking hold in each person it infects. &quot; Memes can replicate vertically or horizontally within a single biological generation. They may also lie dormant for long periods of time. Memes spread by the behaviors that they generate in their hosts. Imitation counts as an important characteristic in the propagation of memes. Imitation often involves the copying of an observed behaviour of another individual, but memes may transmit from one individual to another through a copy recorded in an inanimate source, such as a book or a musical score. McNamara has suggested that memes can be thereby classified as either internal or external memes, (i-memes or e-memes). Researchers have observed memetic copying in just a few species on Earth, including hominid s, dolphin s and bird s (that learn how to sing by imitating their parent s or neighbors). [ Blackmore 1998 ] Some commentators have likened the transmission of memes to the spread of contagions. [ Blackmore 1998 ] {; &quot; The term &apos;contagion&apos; is often associated with memetics. We may say that certain memes are contagious, or more contagious than others. &quot; } Social contagions such as fads, hysteria, copycat crime, and copycat suicide exemplify memes seen as the contagious imitation of ideas. Observers distinguish the contagious imitation of memes from instinctively contagious phenomena such as yawning and laughing, which they consider innate (rather than socially learned) behaviors. Aaron Lynch described seven general patterns of meme transmission, or &quot; thought contagion &quot; : [ Lynch 1996 ] Quantity of parenthood: an idea that influences the number of children one has. Children respond particularly receptively to the ideas of their parents, and thus ideas that directly or indirectly encourage a higher birthrate will replicate themselves at a higher rate than those that discourage higher birthrates. Efficiency of parenthood: an idea that increases the proportion of children who will adopt ideas of their parents. Cultural separatism exemplifies one practice in which one can expect a higher rate of meme-replication—because the meme for separation creates a barrier from exposure to competing ideas. Proselytic: ideas generally passed to others beyond one&apos;s own children. Ideas that encourage the proselytism of a meme, as seen in many religious or political movements, can replicate memes horizontally through a given generation, spreading more rapidly than parent-to-child meme-transmissions do. Preservational: ideas that influence those that hold them to continue to hold them for a long time. Ideas that encourage longevity in their hosts, or leave their hosts particularly resistant to abandoning or replacing these ideas, enhance the preservability of memes and afford protection from the competition or proselytism of other memes. Adversative: ideas that influence those that hold them to attack or sabotage competing ideas and/or those that hold them. Adversative replication can give an advantage in meme transmission when the meme itself encourages aggression against other memes. Cognitive: ideas perceived as cogent by most in the population who encounter them. Cognitively transmitted memes depend heavily on a cluster of other ideas and cognitive traits already widely held in the population, and thus usually spread more passively than other forms of meme transmission. Memes spread in cognitive transmission do not count as self-replicating. Motivational: ideas that people adopt because they perceive some self-interest in adopting them. Strictly speaking, motivationally transmitted memes do not self-propagate, but this mode of transmission often occurs in association with memes self-replicated in the efficiency parental, proselytic and preservational modes. [ Memes as discrete units ] Richard Dawkins initially defined meme as a noun that &quot; conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation &quot;. John S. Wilkins retained the notion of meme as a kernel of cultural imitation while emphasizing the meme&apos;s evolutionary aspect, defining the meme as &quot; the least unit of sociocultural information relative to a selection process that has favourable or unfavourable selection bias that exceeds its endogenous tendency to change. &quot; [ Wilkins John S. What&apos;s in a Meme? Reflections from the perspective of the history and philosophy of evolutionary biology Journal of Memetics 1998 2 http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/ ] The meme as a unit provides a convenient means of discussing &quot; a piece of thought copied from person to person &quot;, regardless of whether that thought contains others inside it, or forms part of a larger meme. A meme could consist of a single word, or a meme could consist of the entire speech in which that word first occurred. This forms an analogy to the idea of a gene as a single unit of self-replicating information found on the self-replicating chromosome. While the identification of memes as &quot; units &quot; conveys their nature to replicate as discrete, indivisible entities, it does not imply that thoughts somehow become quantized or that &quot; atom ic &quot; ideas exist that cannot be dissected into smaller pieces. A meme has no given size. Susan Blackmore writes that melodies from Beethoven&apos;s symphonies are commonly used to illustrate the difficulty involved in delimiting memes as discrete units. She notes that while the first four notes of Beethoven&apos;s Fifth Symphony ( [ Beet5mov1bars1to5.ogg listen ] ) form a meme widely replicated as an independent unit, one can regard the entire symphony as a single meme as well. The inability to pin an idea or cultural feature to quantifiable key units is widely acknowledge as a problem for memetics. It has been argued however that the traces of memetic processing can be quantified utilizing neuroimaging techniques which measure changes in the connectivity profiles between brain regions. &quot; [ McNamara Adam Can we Measure Memes Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience 2011 3 10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001 2011 ] Blackmore meets such criticism by stating that memes compare with genes in this respect: that while a gene has no particular size, nor can we ascribe every phenotypic feature directly to a particular gene, it has value because it encapsulates that key unit of inherited expression subject to evolutionary pressures. To illustrate, she notes evolution selects for the gene for features such as eye color; it does not select for the individual nucleotide in a strand of DNA. Memes play a comparable role in understanding the evolution of imitated behaviors. The 1981 book Genes, Mind, and Culture: The Coevolutionary Process by Charles J. Lumsden and E. O. Wilson proposed the theory that genes and culture co-evolve, and that the fundamental biological units of culture must correspond to neuronal networks that function as nodes of semantic memory. They coined their own term, &quot; culturgen &quot;, which did not catch on. Coauthor Wilson later acknowledged the term meme as the best label for the fundamental unit of cultural inheritance in his 1998 book Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, which elaborates upon the fundamental role of memes in unifying the natural and social sciences. [ Wilson 1998 ] [ Evolutionary influences on memes ] Richard Dawkins noted the three conditions that must exist for evolution to occur: [ Dennett 1991 ] variation, or the introduction of new change to existing elements; heredity or replication, or the capacity to create copies of elements; differential &quot; fitness &quot;, or the opportunity for one element to be more or less suited to the environment than another. Dawkins emphasizes that the process of evolution naturally occurs whenever these conditions co-exist, and that evolution does not apply only to organic elements such as genes. He regards memes as also having the properties necessary for evolution, and thus sees meme evolution as not simply analogous to genetic evolution, but as a real phenomenon subject to the laws of natural selection. Dawkins noted that as various ideas pass from one generation to the next, they may either enhance or detract from the survival of the people who obtain those ideas, or influence the survival of the ideas themselves. For example, a certain culture may develop unique designs and methods of tool -making that give it a competitive advantage over another culture. Each tool-design thus acts somewhat similarly to a biological gene in that some populations have it and others do not, and the meme&apos;s function directly affects the presence of the design in future generations. In keeping with the thesis that in evolution one can regard organisms simply as suitable &quot; hosts &quot; for reproducing genes, Dawkins argues that one can view people as &quot; hosts &quot; for replicating memes. Consequently, a successful meme may or may not need to provide any benefit to its host. Unlike genetic evolution, memetic evolution can show both Darwinian and Lamarckian traits. Cultural memes will have the characteristic of Lamarckian inheritance when a host aspires to replicate the given meme through inference rather than by exactly copying it. Take for example the case of the transmission of a simple skill such as hammering a nail, a skill that a learner imitates from watching a demonstration without necessarily imitating every discrete movement modeled by the teacher in the demonstration, stroke for stroke. [ Dawkins 2004 ] Susan Blackmore distinguishes the difference between the two modes of inheritance in the evolution of memes, characterizing the Darwinian mode as &quot; copying the instructions &quot; and the Lamarckian as &quot; copying the product. &quot; Clusters of memes, or memeplex es (also known as meme complexes or as memecomplexes), such as cultural or political doctrines and systems, may also play a part in the acceptance of new memes. Memeplexes comprise groups of memes that replicate together and coadapt. Memes that fit within a successful memeplex may gain acceptance by &quot; piggybacking &quot; on the success of the memeplex.As an example, John D. Gottsch discusses the transmission, mutation and selection of religious memeplexes and the theistic memes contained. { &quot; Mutation, Selection, And Vertical Transmission Of Theistic Memes In Religious Canons &quot; in Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission, Volume 5, Issue 1, 2001. Online version retrieved 2008-01-27. } Theistic memes discussed include the &quot; prohibition of aberrant sexual practices such as incest, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, castration, and religious prostitution &quot;, which may have increased vertical transmission of the parent religious memeplex. Similar memes are thereby included in the majority of religious memeplexes, and harden over time; they become an &quot; inviolable canon &quot; or set of dogma s, eventually finding their way into secular law. This could also be referred to as the propagation of a taboo. [ Memetics ] [ Memetics ] The discipline of memetics, which dates from the mid 1980s, provides an approach to evolutionary model s of cultural information transfer based on the concept of the meme. Memeticist s have proposed that just as memes function analogously to gene s, memetics functions analogously to genetics. Memetics attempts to apply conventional scientific methods (such as those used in population genetics and epidemiology ) to explain existing patterns and transmission of cultural ideas. Principal criticisms of memetics include the claim that memetics ignores established advances in other fields of cultural study, such as sociology, cultural anthropology, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. Questions remain whether or not the meme concept counts as a validly disprovable scientific theory. This view regards memetics as a theory in its infancy: a protoscience to proponents, or a pseudoscience to some detractors. [ Criticism of meme theory ] An objection to the study of the evolution of memes in genetic terms (although not to the existence of memes) involves a perceived gap in the gene/meme analogy: the cumulative evolution of genes depends on biological selection-pressures neither too great nor too small in relation to mutation-rates. There seems no reason to think that the same balance will exist in the selection pressures on memes. [ Sterelny Griffiths 1999 ] {; p.333 } Luis Benitez-Bribiesca M.D., a critic of memetics, calls the theory a &quot; pseudoscientific dogma &quot; and &quot; a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of consciousness and cultural evolution &quot;. As a factual criticism, Benitez-Bribiesca points to the lack of a &quot; code script &quot; for memes (analogous to the DNA of genes), and to the excessive instability of the meme mutation mechanism (that of an idea going from one brain to another), which would lead to a low replication accuracy and a high mutation rate, rendering the evolutionary process chaotic. [ Benitez Bribiesca Luis 2001 January Memetics: A dangerous idea Interciencia: Revista de Ciencia y Technologia de América 26 1 29–31 Asociación Interciencia Venezuela 0378-1844 http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf PDF 2010-02-11 If the mutation rate is high and takes place over short periods, as memetics predict, instead of selection, adaptation and survival a chaotic disintegration occurs due to the accumulation of errors.. ] British political philosopher John Gray has characterized Dawkins&apos; memetic theory of religion as &quot; nonsense &quot; and &quot; not even a theory... the latest in a succession of ill-judged Darwinian metaphors &quot;, comparable to Intelligent Design in its value as a science. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/mar/15/society London The Guardian John Gray John Gray on secular fundamentalists 2008-03-15 ] Another critique comes from semiotic theorists such as Deacon { Terrence Deacon, &quot; The trouble with memes (and what to do about it) &quot;. The Semiotic Review of Books 10(3). } and Kull { Kalevi Kull (2000), &quot; Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality &quot;. European Journal for Semiotic Studies 12(1), 101–120. } This view regards the concept of &quot; meme &quot; as a primitivized concept of &quot; sign &quot;. The meme is thus described in memetics as a sign lacking a triadic nature. Semioticians can regard a meme as a &quot; degenerate &quot; sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs. [ February 2009 This last paragraph could be better explained. I&apos;m familiar with the subject but was confused. &quot; Triadic nature &quot; &quot; degenerate sign &quot; the article would benefit from clarification of these terms. This may not be the proper place to put this but I don&apos;t know, if there is a discussion page for this article. ] Fracchia and Lewontin regard memetics as reductionist and inadequate. [ 10.1111/j.1468-2303.2005.00305.x Fracchia Joseph R C Lewontin 2005 February The price of metaphor History and theory 44 44 14–29 Weleyan University 0018-2656 3590779 The selectionist paradigm requires the reduction of society and culture to inheritance systems that consist of randomly varying, individual units, some of which are selected, and some not; and with society and culture thus reduced to inheritance systems, history can be reduced to &quot; evolution. &quot; [...] [W] e conclude that while historical phenomena can always be modeled selectionistically, selectionist explanations do no work, nor do they contribute anything new except a misleading vocabulary that anesthetizes history.. ] Burman, by contrast, has shown that the misunderstanding that memes are &quot; real &quot; is a result of a popularization based on a confused interpretation of Dawkins&apos; The Selfish Gene. Instead, for him, the idea of an &quot; infectious idea &quot; can be a useful conceit if used under certain conditions. He explained this in a subsequent discussion regarding his article:...you can&apos;t take the meme seriously as &quot; a thing that jumps. &quot; You can only ask what insights are derived if we adopt a stance in which we accept jumping as a shortcut to get to the more interesting problem. Memes, in this sense, are a philosophical method; they aren&apos;t a scientific object. { Discussion between Jeremy Burman and Tim Tylor, &quot; Was there a misunderstanding of memes? &quot; On Memetics } [ Potential lack of philosophical depth ] In his chapter titled &quot; Truth &quot; published in the Encyclopedia of Phenomenology, Dieter Lohmar questions the memeticists&apos; reduction of the highly complex body of ideas (such as religion, politics, war, justice, and science itself) to a putatively one-dimensional series of memes. He sees memes as an abstraction and such a reduction as failing to produce greater understanding of those ideas. The highly interconnected, multi-layering of ideas resists memetic simplification to an atomic or molecular form; as does the fact that each of our lives remains fully enmeshed and involved in such &quot; memes &quot;. Lohmar argues that one cannot view memes through a microscope in the way one can detect genes. The leveling-off of all such interesting &quot; memes &quot; down to some neutralized molecular &quot; substance &quot; such as &quot; meme-substance &quot; introduces a bias toward &quot; scientism &quot; and abandons the very essence of what makes ideas interesting, richly available, and worth studying. { Dieter Lohmar - &quot; Truth &quot;, in Lester Embree, Encyclopedia of phenomenology, Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997 } [ Applications ] Opinions differ as to how best to apply the concept of memes within a &quot; proper &quot; disciplinary framework. One view sees memes as providing a useful philosophical perspective with which to examine cultural evolution. Proponents of this view (such as Susan Blackmore and Daniel Dennett ) argue that considering cultural developments from a meme&apos;s-eye view—as if memes themselves respond to pressure to maximise their own replication and survival—can lead to useful insights and yield valuable predictions into how culture develops over time. Others such as Bruce Edmonds and Robert Aunger have focused on the need to provide an empirical grounding for memetics to become a useful and respected scientific discipline. { See } [ http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/2002/vol6/edmonds_b_letter.html Edmonds Bruce 2002-09 6 2 Three Challenges for the Survival of Memetics Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission 2009-02-03 ] [ Aunger 2000 ] A third approach, described [ September 2009 ] as &quot; radical memetics &quot;, seeks to place memes at the centre of a materialistic theory of mind and of personal identity. [ Poulshock 2002 ] Prominent researchers in evolutionary psychology and anthropology, including Scott Atran, Dan Sperber, Pascal Boyer, John Tooby and others, argue the possibility of incompatibility between modularity of mind and memetics. [ December 2010 ] In their view, minds structure certain communicable aspects of the ideas produced, and these communicable aspects generally trigger or elicit ideas in other minds through inference (to relatively rich structures generated from often low-fidelity input) and not high-fidelity replication or imitation. Atran discusses communication involving religious beliefs as a case in point. In one set of experiments he asked religious people to write down on a piece of paper the meanings of the Ten Commandments. Despite the subjects&apos; own expectations of consensus, interpretations of the commandments showed wide ranges of variation, with little evidence of consensus. In another experiment, subjects with autism and subjects without autism interpreted ideological and religious sayings (for example, &quot; Let a thousand flowers bloom &quot; or &quot; To everything there is a season &quot; ). People with autism showed a significant tendency to closely paraphrase and repeat content from the original statement (for example: &quot; Don&apos;t cut flowers before they bloom &quot; ). Controls tended to infer a wider range of cultural meanings with little replicated content (for example: &quot; Go with the flow &quot; or &quot; Everyone should have equal opportunity &quot; ). Only the subjects with autism—who lack the degree of inferential capacity normally associated with aspects of theory of mind —came close to functioning as &quot; meme machines &quot;. [ Atran 2002 ] In his book The Robot&apos;s Rebellion, Stanovich uses the memes and memeplex concepts to describe a program of cognitive reform that he refers to as a &quot; rebellion &quot;. Specifically, Stanovich argues that the use of memes as a descriptor for cultural units is beneficial because it serves to emphasize transmission and acquisition properties that parallel the study of epidemiology. These properties make salient the sometimes parasitic nature of acquired memes, and as a result individuals should be motivated to reflectively acquire memes using what he calls a &quot; Neurathian bootstrap &quot; process. { Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). The Robot&apos;s Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-77089-3. } [ Religion ] [ Evolutionary psychology of religion ] Although social scientists such as Max Weber sought to understand and explain religion in terms of a cultural attribute, Richard Dawkins called for a re-analysis of religion in terms of the evolution of self-replicating ideas apart from any resulting biological advantages they might bestow. [ As an enthusiastic Darwinian, I have been dissatisfied with explanations that my fellow-enthusiasts have offered for human behaviour. They have tried to look for &apos;biological advantages&apos; in various attributes of human civilization. For instance, tribal religion has been seen as a mechanism for solidifying group identity, valuable for a pack-hunting species whose individuals rely on cooperation to catch large and fast prey. Frequently the evolutionary preconception in terms of which such theories are framed is implicitly group-selectionist, but it is possible to rephrase the theories in terms of orthodox gene selection. Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene ] He argued that the role of key replicator in cultural evolution belongs not to genes, but to memes replicating thought from person to person by means of imitation. These replicators respond to selective pressures that may or may not affect biological reproduction or survival. In her book The Meme Machine, Susan Blackmore regards religions as particularly tenacious memes. Many of the features common to the most widely practiced religions provide built-in advantages in an evolutionary context, she writes. For example, religions that preach of the value of faith over evidence from everyday experience or reason inoculate societies against many of the most basic tools people commonly use to evaluate their ideas. By linking altruism with religious affiliation, religious memes can proliferate more quickly because people perceive that they can reap societal as well as personal rewards. The longevity of religious memes improves with their documentation in revered religious texts. Aaron Lynch attributed the robustness of religious memes in human culture to the fact that such memes incorporate multiple modes of meme transmission. Religious memes pass down the generations from parent to child and across a single generation through the meme-exchange of proselytism. Most people will hold the religion taught them by their parents throughout their life. Many religions feature adversarial elements, punishing apostasy, for instance, or demonizing infidels. In Thought Contagion Lynch identifies the memes of transmission in Christianity as especially powerful in scope. Believers view the conversion of non-believers both as a religious duty and as an act of altruism. The promise of heaven to believers and threat of hell to non-believers provide a strong incentive for members to retain their belief. Lynch asserts that belief in the Crucifixion of Jesus in Christianity amplifies each of its other replication advantages through the indebtedness believers have to their Savior for sacrifice on the cross. The image of the crucifixion recurs in religious sacrament s, and the proliferation of symbols of the cross in homes and churches potently reinforces the wide array of Christian memes. Although religious memes have proliferated in human cultures, the modern scientific community has been relatively resistant to religious belief. Robertson (2007) [ Robertson, Lloyd Hawkeye 2007 Reflections on the use of spirituality to privilege religion in scientific discourse: Incorporating considerations of self Journal of Religion and Health 46 3 449–461 10.1007/s10943-006-9105-y ] reasoned that if evolution is accelerated in conditions of propagative difficulty, [ Dennett Daniel C. 1995 Darwin&apos;s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the meanings of life Simon and Schuster New York ] then we would expect to encounter variations of religious memes, established in general populations, addressed to scientific communities. Using a memetic approach, Robertson deconstructed two attempts to privilege religiously held spirituality in scientific discourse. Advantages of a memetic approach as compared to more traditional &quot; modernization &quot; and &quot; supply side &quot; theses in understanding the evolution and propagation of religion were explored. [ Memetic explanations of racism ] In Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology, Jack Balkin argued that memetic processes can explain many of the most familiar features of ideological thought. His theory of &quot; cultural software &quot; maintained that memes form narrative s, networks of cultural associations, metaphoric and metonymic models, and a variety of different mental structures. Balkin maintains that the same structures used to generate ideas about free speech or free markets also serve to generate racist beliefs. To Balkin, whether memes become harmful or maladaptive depends on the environmental context in which they exist rather than in any special source or manner to their origination. Balkin describes racist beliefs as &quot; fantasy &quot; memes that become harmful or unjust &quot; ideologies &quot; when diverse peoples come together, as through trade or competition. [ Balkin 1998 ] [ Architectural memes ] In A Theory of Architecture, Nikos Salingaros speaks of memes as “freely propagating clusters of information” which can be beneficial or harmful. He contrasts memes to patterns ” and true knowledge, characterizing memes as “greatly simplified versions of patterns” and as “unreasoned matching to some visual or mnemonic prototype”. { Nikos Salingaros : Theory of Architecture, chapter 12: Architectural memes in a universe of information, ISBN 978-3-937954-07-4 } [ Check digit (4) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] {, Umbau-Verlag, 2006, 2008, pages 243 and 260 } Taking reference to Dawkins, Salingaros emphasizes that they can be transmitted due to their own communicative properties, that “the simpler they are, the faster they can proliferate”, and that the most successful memes “come with a great psychological appeal”. { Nikos Salingaros : Theory of Architecture, chapter 12: Architectural memes in a universe of information, ISBN 978-3-937954-07-4 } [ Check digit (4) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] {, Umbau-Verlag, 2006, 2008, pages 243–245 } Architectural memes, so Salingaros, can have destructive power. “Images portrayed in architectural magazines representing buildings that could not possibly accomodate everyday uses become fixed in our memory, so we reproduce them unconsciously.” { Nikos Salingaros : Theory of Architecture, chapter 12: Architectural memes in a universe of information, ISBN 978-3-937954-07-4 } [ Check digit (4) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] {, Umbau-Verlag, 2006, 2008, page 249 } He lists various architectural memes that circulated since the 1920s and which, in his view, have led to contemporary architecture becoming quite decoupled from human needs. They lack connection and meaning, thereby preventing “the creation of true connections necessary to our understanding of the world”. He sees them as no different from antipattern s in software design – as solutions that are false but are re-utilized nonetheless. { Nikos Salingaros : Theory of Architecture, chapter 12: Architectural memes in a universe of information, ISBN 978-3-937954-07-4 } [ Check digit (4) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] {, Umbau-Verlag, 2006, 2008, page 259 } [ Internet culture ] [ Internet meme ] The term &quot; Internet meme &quot; refers to a concept that spreads rapidly from person to person via the Internet, largely through Internet-based email, blog s, forums, Imageboard s, social networking site s, instant messaging and video streaming sites such as YouTube.

[ Paull, John 2009 Meme Maps: A Tool for Configuring Memes in Time and Space http://orgprints.org/15752/1/15752.pdf European Journal of Scientific Research 31 1 11–18. ] Such a meme map uses a figure-8 diagram (an analemma ) to map the gestation (in the lower loop), birth (at the choke point), and development (in the upper loop) of the selected meme. Such meme maps are non-scalar, with time mapped onto the y-axis and space onto the x-axis transect. One can read the temporal progress of the mapped meme from south to north on such a meme map. Paull has published a worked example using the &quot; organics meme &quot; (as in organic agriculture ). Robertson (2010) [ Robertson, Lloyd Hawkeye 2010 Mapping the self with units of culture Psychology http://www.scirp.org/journal/psych/ 1 3 185–193 10.4236/psych.2010.13025 ] used a second technique of meme mapping to create two-dimensional representations of the selves of eleven participants drawn from both individualist and collectivist cultures. Participant narratives were transcribed, segmented and coded using a method similar to grounded theory. Coded segments exhibiting referent, connotative, affective and behavioral dimensions were declared to be memes. Memes that shared connotative, affective or behavioral qualities were linked. All of the maps in Robertson&apos;s sample evidenced volition, constancy, uniqueness, production, intimacy, and social interest. This method of mapping the self was successfully used in therapy to treat a youth who had attempted suicide on five occasions (Robertson 2011). [ Robertson, Lloyd Hawkeye 2011 Self-mapping in treating suicide ideation: A case study Death Studies 35 3 267–180 10.1080/07481187.2010.496687 ] The youth and psychotherapist co-constructed a plan to change the youth&apos;s presenting self, and her progress in making those changes was tracked in subsequent self-maps.
