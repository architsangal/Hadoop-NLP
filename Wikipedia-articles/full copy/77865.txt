[ the real-life battleship Russian battleship Potemkin ] Battleship Potemkin ( [ Броненосец «Потёмкин» ], [ ru Bronenosets Potyomkin ] ), sometimes rendered as Battleship Potyomkin, is a 1925 silent film directed by Sergei Eisenstein and produced by Mosfilm. It presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship &apos;&apos;Potemkin&apos;&apos; rebelled against their officers of the Tsar ist regime. Battleship Potemkin has been called one of the most influential propaganda film s of all time, [ http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1925/battleship-potemkin/ Battleship Potemkin 2010-11-28 ] and was named the greatest film of all time at the Brussels World&apos;s Fair in 1958. { What&apos;s the Big Deal?: Battleship Potemkin (1925).

[ http://www.silentsaregolden.com/HAV%20Bulleid/Battleship%20Potemkin.html Battleship Potemkin 2010-11-28 ] The revolutionary Soviet filmmakers of the Kuleshov school of filmmaking were experimenting with the effect of film editing on audiences, and Eisenstein attempted to edit the film in such a way as to produce the greatest emotion al response, so that the viewer would feel sympathy for the rebellious sailor s of the Battleship Potemkin and hatred for their cruel overlords. In the manner of most propaganda, the characterization is simple, so that the audience could clearly see with whom they should sympathize. Eisenstein&apos;s experiment was a mixed success; he &quot; was disappointed when Potemkin failed to attract masses of viewers &quot;, [ Neuberger Joan 2003 Ivan the Terrible I.B. Tauris &amp; Co. Ltd New York ] but the film was also released in a number of international venues, where audiences responded more positively. In both the Soviet Union and overseas, the film shocked audiences, but not so much for its political statements as for its use of violence, which was considered graphic by the standards of the time.

[ The Odessa Steps sequence ] The boots of the Tsarist soldiers shown marching down the &quot; Odessa Steps &quot; The most celebrated scene in the film is the massacre of civilians on the Odessa Steps (also known as the Primorsky or Potemkin Stairs ). In this scene, the Tsar &apos;s soldiers in their white summer tunics march down a seemingly endless flight of steps in a rhythmic, machine-like fashion, firing volleys into a crowd. A separate detachment of mounted Cossack s charges the crowd at the bottom of the stairs. The victims include an older woman wearing Pince-nez, a young boy with his mother, a student in uniform and a teenage schoolgirl. A mother pushing an infant in a baby carriage falls to the ground dying and the carriage rolls down the steps amidst the fleeing crowd. A baby in a carriage falling down the &quot; Odessa Steps &quot; A wide shot of the massacre on the &quot; Odessa Steps &quot;. The massacre on the steps, which never took place, was presumably inserted by Eisenstein for dramatic effect and to demonise the Imperial regime.

Saint Petersburg, 1991. } The scene is perhaps the best example of Eisenstein&apos;s theory on montage, and many films pay homage to the scene, including Terry Gilliam&apos;s Brazil, Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s The Godfather, Brian De Palma&apos;s The Untouchables, Tibor Takacs&apos; Deathline, Laurel and Hardy&apos;s The Music Box, George Lucas&apos;s Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Chandrashekhar Narvekar&apos;s Hindi film Tezaab, Shukō Murase&apos;s anime Ergo Proxy and Peter Sellers &apos; The Magic Christian. Several films spoof it, including Woody Allen&apos;s Bananas and Love and Death, Australia, Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker &apos;s Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult (though actually a parody of The Untouchables), Soviet-Polish comedy Deja Vu, Jacob Tierney &apos;s The Trotsky and the Italian comedy Il secondo tragico Fantozzi. The 2011 November 7 Parade in Moscow also features an homage to the film. The Irish born painter Francis Bacon (1909–1992) was profoundly influenced by Eisenstein&apos;s images, particularly the Odessa Steps shot of the nurse&apos;s broken glasses and open mouthed scream. The open mouth image appeared first in his Abstraction from the Human Form, in Fragment of a Crucifixion, and other works including his famous Head series.

It was shown in an edited form in Germany, with some scenes of extreme violence edited out by its German distributors. A written introduction by Leon Trotsky was cut from Soviet prints after he ran afoul of Joseph Stalin. The film was banned in West Germany, Britain (until 1954 and X-rated [ http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Battleship_Potemkin Case Study: Battleshgip Potemkin, Students&apos; British Board of Film Classification website Sbbfc.co.uk 2010-03-06 ] until 1978), France, and other countries for its revolutionary zeal. It was even banned in the Soviet Union for a short period when the Comintern, under Stalin&apos;s Socialism in One Country policy, ceased promoting world revolution. Today, the film is widely available in various DVD editions. However, in 2004, a three-year restoration of the film was completed. Many excised scenes of violence were restored, as well as the original written introduction by Trotsky. The previous titles, which had toned down the mutinous sailors&apos; revolutionary rhetoric, were corrected so that they would now be an accurate translation of the original Russian titles in the film. [ Soundtracks ] To retain its relevance as a propaganda film for each new generation, Eisenstein hoped the score would be rewritten every 20 years. The original score was composed by Edmund Meisel. A salon orchestra performed the Berlin premiere in 1926. The instruments were flute/piccolo, trumpet, trombone, harmonium, percussion and strings without viola. Meisel wrote the score in twelve days because of the late approval of film censors. As time was so short Meisel repeated sections of the score. Composer/conductor Mark-Andreas Schlingensiepen has reorchestrated the original piano score to fit the version of the film available today. Nikolai Kryukov composed a new score in 1950 for the 25th anniversary. In 1986 Eric Allaman wrote an electronic score for a showing that took place at the 1986 Berlin Film Festival. The music was commissioned by the organizers who wanted to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the picture&apos;s German premiere. The score was played only at this premiere and has not been released on CD or DVD. Contemporary reviews were largely positive apart from negative comment because the music was electronic. Allaman also wrote an opera about Battleship Potemkin, which is musically separate from the film score. In its commercial format, on DVD for example, the film is usually accompanied by classical music added for the 50th anniversary edition re-released in 1975. Dmitri Shostakovich and Nikolai Kryukov are two composers whose works have been used. In 2007 Del Rey &amp; The Sun Kings also recorded this soundtrack. It is commercially available on CD and DVD. In an attempt to make the film relevant to the 21st century, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe (of the Pet Shop Boys ) composed a soundtrack in 2004 with the Dresden Symphonic Orchestra. Their soundtrack, released in 2005 as Battleship Potemkin, premiered in September 2004 at an open-air concert in Trafalgar Square, London. There were four further live performances of the work with the Dresdner Sinfoniker in Germany in September 2005 and one at the Swan Hunter ship yard in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2006. The avant-garde jazz ensemble Club Foot Orchestra has also re-scored the film, and performed live accompanying the film. For the 2005 restoration of the film, under the direction of Enno Patalas in collaboration with Anna Bohn, released on DVD and Blu-ray, the Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum fur Film und Fernsehen, commissioned a re-recording of the original Edmund Meisel score, performed by the Babelsberg Orchestra, conducted by Helmut Imig. In 2011 the most recent restoration was completed with an entirely new soundtrack by members of the Apskaft group. Contributing members were: AER20-200, awaycaboose, Ditzky, Drn Drn, Foucault V, fydhws, Hox Vox, Lurholm, mexicanvader, Quendus, Res Band, -Soundso- and speculativism. The entire film was digitally restored to a sharper image by Gianluca Missero (who records under the name Hox Vox). The new version is available at the Internet Archive [ Critical reaction ] Since its release, The Battleship Potemkin has often been renowned as one of the finest propaganda films ever made and considered amongst the greatest films of all time. The film was named the greatest film of all time at the Brussels World&apos;s Fair in 1958. Similarly, in 1952, Sight &amp; Sound magazine cited The Battleship Potemkin as the fourth greatest film of all time and has been voted within the top ten in every poll ever since.
