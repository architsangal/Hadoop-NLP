The MEK opposed the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, considering him corrupt and oppressive and considered the Liberation Movement moderate and ineffective. { Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, Princeton University Press, 1982, p.489 } It&apos;s membership has been described as part of the Iranian generation &quot; shaken by the events of June 1963 &quot; and the radical generation Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Vo Nguyen Giap, the Tupamaros in South America, the Algerian Mojahedin, and the Palestinian fedayeen. They were more &quot; religious, radical, anti-American &quot; than the earlier generation of Iranian leftists. { The Iranian Mojahedin By Ervand Abrahamian, p.84 } In its first five years, the group primarily engaged in ideological work, [ May 2010 ] their interpretation of Islam and economic and political ideas, though the group &quot; never once &quot; used the terms socialist, communist, Marxist or eshteraki to describe itself. { The Iranian Mojahedin By Ervand Abrahamian, p.2 } Its first military activities, a bombing of the Tehran electrical works and unsuccessful airplane hijacking, were conducted in August 1971 in protest against the Pahlavi&apos;s extravagant 2,500 year celebration of Iran&apos;s monarchy. Nine Mujahedin were arrested and under torture one member gave out information leading to the arrests of another 66 members. Within a few months SAVAK had eliminated &quot; the whole of its original leadership through executions or street battles. &quot; Other members remained incarcerated for many years, with the last group, including Massoud Rajavi, being released just before Khomeini arrived in Tehran in January 1979. However, in the mean time, the group survived and continued to carry out violent attacks on the regime. { Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, Princeton University Press, 1982, p.491 } [ Schism ] In October 1975 the MEK underwent an ideological split.While the remaining primary members of MEK were imprisoned, some of the original low-level members of MEK formed a new organization that followed Marxist, not Islamic, ideals; these members appropriated the MEK name to establish and enhance their own legitimacy. { Ervand Abrahamian, Yale University Press, The Iranian Mojahedin, p.137 } This was expressed in a book entitled Manifesto on Ideological Issues, in which the central leadership declared &quot; that after ten years of secret existence, four years of armed struggle, and two years of intense ideological rethinking, they had reached the conclusion that Marxism, not Islam, was the true revolutionary philosophy. &quot; Mujtaba Taleqani, son of Ayatallah Taleqani, was one of these converts to Marxism. Thus after May 1975 there were two rival Mujahedin, each with its own publication, its own organization, and its own activities. { Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, Princeton University Press, 1982, p.493-4 } A few months before the Iranian Revolution the majority of the Marxist Mujahedin renamed themselves &quot; Peykar &quot;, on December 7, 1978 (16 Azar, 1357), the full name is: Organization of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class.This name was after the &quot; St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class &quot;, which was a left wing group in St. Petersburg, Russia. It was founded by Lenin in the autumn of 1895. { Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, (1999), p.151 } [ Anti-American Campaign ] It has been alleged that MEK killed six Americans in 1973, 1975, and 1976. { SeeMEK Profile – MIPT, supranote 405 } [ Afkhami Gholam Reza The Life and Times of the Shah 398 University of California Press 2009 ] [ Borowiec Andrew Iran leftists Gun Down Two A.F.

USAF Brig. Gen. Harold Price was wounded in a May 1972 assassination attempt. The first success in the assassination campaign was the murder of Lt. Col. Louis Lee Hawkins, a U.S. Army comptroller. He was shot to death in front of his home in Tehran by two men on a motorcycle on 1973-06-02. A car carrying U.S. Air Force officers Col. Paul Shaffer and Lt. Col. Jack Turner was trapped between two cars carrying armed men. They told the Iranian driver to lie down and then shot and killed the Americans. Six hours later a woman called reporters to claim the MEK carried out the attack as retaliation for the recent death of prisoners at the hands of Iranian authorities. A car carrying three American employees of Rockwell International was attacked in May 1976. William Cottrell, Donald Smith, and Robert Krongard were killed. They had been working on the Ibex system for gathering intelligence on the neighboring USSR. Leading up to the Islamic Revolution the Marxist wing of the MEK conducted attacks and assassinations against both Iranian and Western targets. According to the U.S. Department of State and the presentation of the MEK by the Foreign Affairs group of the Australian Parliament, the group conducted several assassinations of U.S. military personnel and civilians working in Iran during the 1970s. After the revolution the group actively supported the U.S. embassy takeover in Tehran in 1979, and opposed the release of the diplomats in 1981 by the Iranian regime, and called for their execution instead. As a result they staged a large demonstration. [ Ideology ] [ Before 1979 Iranian Revolution ] The MEK&apos;s ideology of revolutionary Shiaism is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of Ali Shariati that &quot; many concluded &quot; they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it&apos;s clear that &quot; in later years &quot; that Shariati and &quot; his prolific works &quot; had &quot; indirectly helped the Mujahedin. &quot; { Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, Princeton University Press, 1982, p.490 } According to the U.S. Department of State &apos; presentation of the MEK, the philosophy of the MEK is a combination of Marxism, Nationalism and Islam. In the group&apos;s &quot; first major ideological work, &quot; Nahzat-i Husseini or Hussein &apos;s Movement, authored by one of the groups founders, Ahmad Reza&apos;i, it was argued that Nezam-i Towhid (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. &quot; Shiism, particularly Hussein&apos;s historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture. &quot; [ After the revolution ] In more recent years under the guidance of Maryam Rajavi the organization has adopted strong principles in favor of women. Women have now assumed some senior positions of responsibility within the ranks of the MEK and although women make up only a third of fighters, two-thirds of its commanders are women. Rajavi ultimately believes that women should enjoy equal rights with men. { Maryam Rajavi Freedom and democracy for Iran is best achieved by the Iranian people and their Resistance } In 1981, the MEK formed the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) with the stated goal of uniting the opposition to the Iranian government under one umbrella organization. The MEK claims that in the past 25 years, the NCRI has evolved into a 540-member parliament-in-exile, with a specific platform that emphasizes free elections, gender equality and equal rights for ethnic and religious minorities. The MEK claims that it also advocates a free-market economy and supports peace in the Middle East. However, the FBI claims that the NCRI &quot; is not a separate organization, but is instead, and has been, an integral part of the [MEK] at all relevant times &quot; and that the NCRI is &quot; the political branch &quot; of the MEK, rather than vice versa. Although the MEK is today the main organization of the NCRI, the latter previously hosted other organizations, such as the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran. According to the publicly stated ideology of the PMI, elections and public suffrage are the sole indicators of political legitimacy. According to their publications, the Word of God and Islam are meaningless without freedom and respect for individual volition and choice. Their interpretation of Islam the Quran says that the most important characteristic distinguishing man from animals is his free will. It is on this basis that human beings are held accountable. Without freedom, no society can develop or progress. Although its leaders presents themselves as Muslims, the MEK describes itself as a secular organization: &quot; The National Council of Resistance believes in the separation of Church and State. &quot; { National Council of Resistance of Iran } [ Armed conflict with the Islamic government ] Following the 1979 revolution, the newly established theocratic government of Ayatollah Khomeini moved to squash dissent. Khomeini attacked the MEK as elteqati (eclectic), contaminated with Gharbzadegi ( &quot; the Western plague &quot; ), and as monafeqin (hypocrites) and kafer (unbelievers). { Moin Khomeini, 2001, p.234, 239 } In February 1980 concentrated attacks by hezbollahi pro-Khomeini militia began on the meeting places, bookstores and newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists { Bakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs, (1984) p. 123. } driving the Left underground in Iran. Hundreds of MEK supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested. { http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 } The MEK responded in turn, and on 28 June 1981, bombs were detonated at the headquarters of the since-dissolved Islamic Republic Party. Around 70 high-ranking officials, including Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti (who was the second most powerful figure in the revolution after Ayatollah Khomeini at the time), cabinet members, and elected members of parliament, were killed. The Mujahedin never publicly confirmed or denied any responsibility for the deed, but stated the attack was `a natural and necessary reaction to the regime&apos;s atrocities.` The bomber was identified as a Mujahedin operative by the name of Mohammad Reza Kolahi, who had secured a job in the building disguised as a sound engineer. { http://www.shahsawandi.com/index.php?option=com_zoom &amp; Itemid=39 &amp; page=view &amp; catid=8 &amp; PageNo=1 &amp; key=16 &amp; hit=1 } Khomeini accused them of culpability and, according to BBC journalist Baqer Moin, the Mujahedin were &quot; generally perceived as the culprits &quot; for it in Iran. { Moin, Baqer, Khomeini, Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.241 } Two months later on August 30, another bomb was detonated killing the popularly elected President Rajai and Premier Mohammad Javad Bahonar. An active member of the Mujahedin, Massoud Kashmiri, was identified as the perpetrator, and according to reports came close to killing the entire government including Khomeini. { Moin, Baqer, Khomeini, Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.242-3 } The reaction following both bombings was intense with many arrests and executions of Mujahedin and other leftist groups, but &quot; assassinations of leading officials and active supporters of the regime by the Mujahedin were to continue for the next year or two. &quot; { Moin, Baqer, Khomeini, Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243 } This occurred following Saddam&apos;s invasion as the Iranian regime focused more resources on national defense than confronting dissidents. Eventually, the majority of the MEK leadership and members fled to France, where it operated until 1986, when tension arose between Paris and Tehran over the Eurodif nuclear stake and the French citizens kidnapped in the Lebanon hostage crisis. After Rajavi flew to Baghdad, French hostages were released. [ Relations with Iraq under Saddam Hussein ] The MEK transferred its headquarters to Iraq in 1986, during the Iran–Iraq War. According to the US State Department, the MEK received all of its military support and most of its financial assistance from Saddam&apos;s government until the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The MEK also has used front organization s to solicit contributions from expatriate Iranian communities. MEK&apos;s main economic development is based on tributes and endowments from its supporters all over the world. As a result of the MEK&apos;s decision to move its headquarters to Iraq at the height of the Iran-Iraq War, the group is believed to have lost most of its supporters among Iranians, regardless of their views towards the Iranian government.

On July 26, 1988, six days after the Ayatollah Khomeini had announced his acceptance of the UN brokered ceasefire resolution, the NLA advanced under heavy Iraqi air cover, crossing the Iranian border from Iraq. It seized and razed to the ground the Iranian town of Islamabad-e Gharb. As it advanced further into Iran, Iraq ceased its air support and Iranian forces cut off NLA supply lines and counterattacked under cover of fighter planes and helicopter gunships. On July 29 the NLA announced a voluntary withdrawal back to Iraq. The MEK claims it lost 1400 dead or missing and the Islamic Republic sustained 55,000 casualties (either IRGC, Basij forces, or the army). The Islamic Republic claims to have killed 4500 NLA and Iraqi troops during the operation. { Hiro, Dilip, The Longest War, (1999), p.246-7 } The operation was called Foroughe Javidan (Eternal Light) by the MEK and the counterattack Operation Mersad by the Iranian forces. [ 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners ] [ 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners ] A large number of prisoners from the MEK, and a lesser number from other leftist opposition groups (somewhere between 1,400 and 30,000), { Iranian party demands end to repression } were executed in 1988, following Operation Eternal Light. { 1988 massacre } { In this operation MEK penetrated as deep as 170 km into Iranian soil and very close to Kermanshah, the most important city in western Iran. 1988 massacre } { Memories of a slaughter in Iran } { Nasrin Alavi (2005), We Are Iran. } { Khomeini fatwa &apos;led to killing of 30,000 in Iran&apos;, } { The Telegraph, February 2, 2001 } Dissident Ayatollah Montazeri has written in his memoirs that this massacre, deemed a crime against humanity, was ordered by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and carried out by several high-ranking members of Iran&apos;s current government. Recently The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights violations for Iran, to take action on such actions since 1988. { Mass Execution of Political Prisoners in Iran Left Unanswered } [ Relations with France in the mid-1980s ] In 1986, after French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac struck a deal with Tehran for the release of French hostages held prisoners by the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the MEK was forced to leave France and relocated in Iraq. Investigative journalist Dominique Lorentz has related the 1986 capture of French hostages to an alleged blackmail of France by Tehran concerning the nuclear program. { Lorentz, Dominique and Carr-Brown, David, La République atomique ( &quot; The Atomic Republic &quot; ), broadcast on November 14, 2001 on } { Arte TV } [ Post-war ] According to presentations of the MEK by the U.S. Department of State and the Foreign Affairs group of the Australian Parliament, the MEK assisted the Iraqi Republican Guard in suppressing the Kurdish and Shiite uprisings in Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Maryam Rajavi, who assumed the leadership role of the MEK after a series of years as co-leader alongside her husband Massoud Rajavi, has been reported by former members of the MEK as having said: &quot; Take the Kurds under your tanks, and save your bullets for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. &quot; In the following years the MEK conducted several high-profile assassinations of political and military figures inside Iran, including Asadollah Lajevardi, the former warden of the Evin prison, in 1998 and deputy chief of the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff, Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi, who was assassinated on the doorsteps of his house on April 10, 1999. [ In Iraq after the 2003 invasion ] After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, MEK camps were bombed by coalition forces because of its alliance with Saddam Hussein. On April 15, U.S. Special Forces brokered a ceasefire agreement with the leaders of the MEK and entered into a ceasefire agreement with the coalition after the attack.
