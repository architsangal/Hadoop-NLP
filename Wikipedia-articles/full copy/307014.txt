He is best known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) under the ring name s Little Guido Maritato and Nunzio. [ Career ] [ Starting out ] While attending Nanuet Senior High School (located in Rockland County, New York ), Maritato competed in football (as part of the school&apos;s 1989 team that went undefeated, untied, and unscored upon) and wrestling. He was later trained as a professional by Billy Robinson, debuting in the professional ranks in the early 1990s, with his first match against a wrestler known as Parsippany Smith Fields (real name Eric Fox), according to his shoot interview. Maritato then went to Japan to compete in the shoot style UWF International promotion. He also competed in Amarillo, TX promotion USWF under the name James Stone. { http://mma.sbnation.com/2011/8/11/2357153/uswf-mma-history-evan-tanner-mma-news } [ Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–2001) ] He stayed in UWF until 1995 where he joined Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) under the name Damian Stone. He was later given the gimmick of Little Guido and put in the comedy stable the Full Blooded Italians (F.B.I.), alongside an African American named &quot; The Italian Stallion &quot; J.T. Smith, Tracy Smothers, and &quot; The Big Don &quot; Tommy Rich. None of whom, with the exception of Maritato, were really Italian. During 1999, he became a &quot; serious wrestler &quot;, although still accompanied by Sal E. Graziano and proclaiming himself to be an F.B.I. member (though only the two of them were left). After his turn he was involved in some intense singles matches until late 2000, when he formed a tag team with Tony Mamaluke. The duo won the World Tag Team Championship on August 26, 2000 and held them until December when they lost them to Danny Doring and Roadkill. They continued to wrestle together until ECW folded in January 2001. [ World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2008) ] [ SmackDown! ] When ECW closed, Maritato wrestled for several independent promotions, mostly in the New York Tri-State area; he often teamed with former partner Tony Mamaluke. They had a notable run in Ring of Honor before Maritato was signed by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002. Maritato was introduced on WWE television as Nunzio, a possible reference to the mob / bodyguard characters Guido and Nunzio in the MythAdventures series of books by Robert Asprin.
