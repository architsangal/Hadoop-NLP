Well-known marsupials include kangaroo s, koala s, possum s, opossum s, wombat s and the Tasmanian devil.Marsupials represent the clade originating with the last common ancestor of extant metatheria ns. Like other mammals in the Metatheria, they are characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young, often residing in a pouch with the parent for a certain time after birth. Close to 70% of the 334 extant species occur in Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands, with the remaining 100 found in the Americas, primarily in South America, but with thirteen in Central America, and one in North America, north of Mexico.

Most genetic and molecular evidence also supports grouping marsupials and placental mammals as a single clade, subclass Theria.

About 100 mya, the supercontinent Pangaea was in the process of splitting into the northern continent Laurasia and the southern continent Gondwana, with what would become China and Australia already separated by the Tethys Ocean. Marsupials spread westward into modern North America (still attached to Eurasia) and then to South America, which was connected to North America until around 65 mya. Laurasian marsupials eventually died off, possibly due to competition from placental mammals for their ecological niche s. In South America, the opossums retained a strong presence, and the Tertiary saw the evolution of shrew opossum s (Paucituberculata) and metatherian predators such as the borhyaenid s and the saber-toothed Thylacosmilus. South American niches for mammalian carnivores were dominated by these marsupial and sparassodont metatherians. While placental predators were absent, the metatherians did have to contend with avian ( terror bird ) and terrestrial crocodilian competition. South America and Antarctica remained connected until 35 mya, as shown by the unique fossils found there. North and South America were disconnected until about three million years ago, when the Isthmus of Panama formed. This led to the Great American Interchange. Competition from placental mammals from the north drove sparassodonts to extinction, while didelphimorphs (opossums) invaded Central America, with the Virginia opossum reaching as far north as Canada. Marsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya, shortly after Australia had split off. This suggests a single dispersion event of just one species, most likely a relative to South America&apos;s monito del monte (a microbiothere, the only New World australidelphia n ). This progenitor may have rafted across the widening, but still narrow, gap between Australia and Antarctica. In Australia, they radiated into the wide variety we see today, island hopping some way through the Indonesian archipelago.

The branching sequence of marsupial orders indicated by the study puts Didelphimorphia in the most basal position, followed by Paucituberculata, then Microbiotheria, and ending with the radiation of Australian marsupials. This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America, and reached Australia after Microbiotheria split off.

Extant native Australian terrestrial placental mammals (such as hopping mice ) are relatively recent immigrants, arriving via island hopping from southeast Asia. [ Description ] { Koala (&apos;&apos;Phascolarctos cinereus&apos;&apos;) } [ Early development ] An early birth removes a developing marsupial from its parent&apos;s body much sooner than in placental mammals, and thus marsupials have not developed a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother&apos;s immune system. Though early birth places the tiny newborn marsupial at a greater environmental risk, it significantly reduces the dangers associated with long pregnancies, as there is no need to carry a large fetus to full-term in bad seasons. Because newborn marsupials must climb up to their mother&apos;s nipples, their front limbs are much more developed than the rest of the body at the time of birth. It is possible that this requirement has resulted in the limited range of locomotor adaptations in marsupials compared to placentals. Marsupials must develop a grasping forepaw during their early youth, making the transition from this limb into a hoof, wing, or flipper, as some groups of placental mammals have done, far more difficult. An infant marsupial is known as a joey. Marsupials have an extremely short gestation period (about 4–5 weeks), and the joey is &apos;born&apos; essentially in a fetal state. The blind, furless, miniature newborn, the size of a jelly bean, crawls across its mother&apos;s fur to make its way into the pouch, where it latches onto a teat for food. It will not re-emerge for several months, during which time it develops fully. After this period, the joey begins to spend increasing lengths of time out of the pouch, feeding and learning survival skills. However, it returns to the pouch to sleep, and if danger threatens it will seek refuge in its mother&apos;s pouch for safety. Joeys stay in the pouch for up to a year in some species, or until the next joey is born. A marsupial joey is unable to regulate its own body temperature, and thus relies upon an external heat source. Until the joey is well-furred and old enough to leave the pouch, a pouch temperature between [ 30 - 32 C F ] must be constantly maintained. [ Reproductive system ] Marsupials&apos; reproductive systems differ markedly from those of placental mammals ( Placentalia ). Females have two lateral vagina s, which lead to separate uteri but both open externally through the same orifice. A third canal, the median vagina, is used for birth. This canal can be transitory or permanent. The males generally have a two-pronged penis, which corresponds to the females&apos; two vaginas. { Iowa State University Biology Dept. Discoveries about Marsupial Reproduction Anna King 2001. webpage] (note shows code, html extension omitted) } The penis is used only for discharging semen into females, while a urogenital sac stores waste before expulsion. [ what is this waste that is being referred to in relation to the reproductive system? October 2011 ] Pregnant females develop something similar to a yolk sac in their wombs, which delivers nutrients to the embryo. Marsupials give birth at a very early stage of development (about 4–5 weeks); after birth, newborn marsupials crawl up the bodies of their mothers and attach themselves to a nipple, which is located on the underside of the mother either inside a pouch called the marsupium or open to the environment. To crawl to the nipple and attach to it, the marsupial must have well developed forelimbs and facial structures. [ 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00690.x Sears K.

K. 2001 Early development of the neural plate, neural crest and facial region of marsupials Journal of Anatomy 199 Pt 1–2 121–131 11523813 1594995 ] This is accomplished by accelerating forelimb and facial development in marsupials compared to placental mammals. As a result, there is decelerated development of such structures as the hindlimb and brain. There they remain for a number of weeks, attached to the nipple. The offspring are eventually able to leave the marsupium for short periods, returning to it for warmth, protection and nourishment. [ Characteristics ] Marsupials are characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young. They lack a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother&apos;s immune system. They have a front pouch containing multiple nipples for protection and sustenance of the young. Some common structural features can be found among marsupials. Ossified patella e are absent. Epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and also monotreme s ) also lack a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.
