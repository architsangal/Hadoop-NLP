President Jimmy Carter Democratic Party (United States) Ronald Reagan Republican Party (United States) ] The United States presidential election of 1980 featured a contest between incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter and his Republican opponent, former California Governor Ronald Reagan, as well as Republican Congressman John B. Anderson, who ran as an independent. Reagan, aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home, won the election in a landslide, receiving the highest number of electoral votes ever won by a nonincumbent presidential candidate, and became the 40th President of the United States. Carter, after defeating Ted Kennedy for the Democratic nomination, attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing radical. For his part, Reagan, the former Governor of California, repeatedly ridiculed Carter, and won a decisive victory; in the simultaneous Congressional elections, Republicans won control of the United States Senate for the first time in 28 years. This election marked the beginning of what is popularly called the &quot; Reagan Revolution. &quot; [ A historic victory. A changed nation. Now, can Obama deliver?

[ How We Got Here: The &apos;70s Frum David David Frum 2000 Basic Books New York, New York 0-465-04195-7 292 ] Added to this was a sense of malaise that in both foreign and domestic affairs, certain people perceived that the nation was headed downward. By the beginning of the election season, the prolonged Iran hostage crisis had sharpened public perceptions of a national crisis. [ October 2009 ] Jimmy Carter was blamed for the Iran hostage crisis, in which the followers of the Ayatollah Khomeni burned American flag s and chanted anti-American slogans, parading the captured American hostages in public, and burning effigies of Carter. Carter&apos;s critics saw him as an inept leader who had failed to solve the worsening economic problems at home. His supporters defended the president as a decent, well-intentioned man being unfairly attacked for problems that had been building for years.

Kennedy of Massachusetts in 24 of 34 primaries, President Carter entered the party&apos;s convention in New York in August 1980 with 60 percent of the delegates pledged to him on the first ballot. Despite this, Kennedy refused to drop out, and the 1980 Democratic National Convention was one of the nastiest on record. There was a short-lived “Draft Muskie” movement in the summer of 1980 that was seen as a favorable alternative to a deadlocked convention. One poll showed that Secretary of State Edmund Muskie would be a more popular alternative to Carter than Kennedy, implying that the attraction was not so much to Kennedy as to the fact that he was not Carter. Muskie was polling even with Ronald Reagan at the time, while Carter was seven points down. { &quot; Clinton Campaign Reminiscent of 1980 Race &quot;, The CBS News. } Although the underground &quot; Draft Muskie &quot; campaign failed, it became a political legend. { &quot; Steenland: Odd man out? &quot;, The Star Tribune. } After a futile last-ditch attempt by Kennedy to alter the rules to free delegates from the first-ballot pledge, Carter was renominated with 2,129 votes to 1,146 for Kennedy. Vice President Walter Mondale was also renominated. In his acceptance speech, Carter warned that Reagan&apos;s conservatism posed a threat to world peace and progressive social welfare programs from the New Deal to the Great Society. { William DeGregorio, The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents, Gramercy 1997 } [ Republican Party ] [ Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1980 ] Republican candidates Former Governor Ronald Reagan of California Former CIA director and United States Representative George H.

He won the nomination on the first round at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan, in July, then chose George H. W. Bush, his top rival, as his running mate. [ Other candidates ] [ John Anderson ] John Bayard Anderson, after being defeated in the Republican primaries, entered the general election as an independent candidate, campaigning as a moderate Republican alternative to Reagan&apos;s conservatism. However, his campaign appealed primarily to frustrated anti-Carter voters. { Kornacki, Steve (2011-04-05) The myths that just won&apos;t die, } { Salon.com } His support progressively evaporated through the campaign season as his supporters were pulled away by Carter and Reagan. His running mate was Patrick Lucey, a Democratic former Governor of Wisconsin and then Ambassador to Mexico, appointed by President Carter. [ Edward Clark ] The Libertarian Party nominated Edward Clark for President and David H. Koch for Vice President. They received almost one million votes and were on the ballot in all 50 states. Clark published a book on his programs, entitled A New Beginning. The book&apos;s introduction was by Eugene McCarthy. During the campaign, Clark positioned himself as a peace candidate and tailored his appeal to liberals and progressives unhappy with the resumption of Selective Service registration and the arms race with the Soviet Union. When asked in a television interview to summarize libertarianism, Clark used the phrase &quot; low-tax liberalism, &quot; causing some consternation among traditional libertarian theorists, most notably economist Murray Rothbard. Ed Clark&apos;s running mate in 1980 was David H. Koch of Koch Industries, who pledged part of his personal fortune to the campaign. The Clark-Koch ticket was endorsed by the Peoria Journal Star in Peoria, Illinois, { Doherty, Brian. } { Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement, pg. 414 } and received 921,128 votes (1.06% of the total nationwide).

His strongest support was in Alaska, where he came in third place with 11.66% of the vote, finishing ahead of independent candidate John Anderson and receiving almost half as many votes as Jimmy Carter. [ Other ] The Socialist Party USA nominated David McReynolds for President and Sister Diane Drufenbrock for Vice President, making McReynolds the first openly gay man to run for President and Drufenbrock the first nun to be a candidate for national office in the U.S. The Citizens Party ran Barry Commoner for President and La Donna Harris for Vice President. The Communist Party USA ran Gus Hall for President and Angela Davis for Vice President. The American Party nominated Percy L. Greaves, Jr. for President and Frank L. Varnum for Vice President. Rock star Joe Walsh ran a mock campaign as a write-in candidate, promising to make his song &quot; Life&apos;s Been Good &quot; the new national anthem if he won, and running on a platform of &quot; Free Gas For Everyone. &quot; Though the 33-year-old Walsh was not old enough to actually assume the office, he wanted to raise public awareness of the election. (In 1992, Walsh recorded a song called &quot; Vote For Me, &quot; in which he declared his candidacy for the vice -presidency.) [ General election ] [ Campaign ] Interest rate crisis of 1980 Under federal election laws, Carter and Reagan received $29.4 million each, and Anderson was given a limit of $18.5 million with private fund-raising allowed for him only. They were not allowed to spend any other money. Carter and Reagan each spent about $15 million on television advertising, and Anderson under $2 million. Reagan ended up spending $29.2 million in total, Carter $29.4 million, and Anderson spent $17.6 million— partially because he (Anderson) didn&apos;t get Federal Election Commission money until after the election. The 1980 election is considered by some to be a realigning election. Reagan&apos;s supporters praise him for running a campaign of upbeat optimism.

Reagan&apos;s platform also emphasized the importance of peace, as well as a prepared self-defense. Immediately after the conclusion of the primaries, a Gallup poll held that Reagan was ahead, with 58% of voters upset by Carter&apos;s handling of the Presidency. One analysis of the election has suggested that &quot; Both Carter and Reagan were perceived negatively by a majority of the electorate. &quot; { Wayne, Stephen J. (1984). The Road to the White House (2nd ed.), p. 210. New York: St. Martin&apos;s Press. ISBN 0-312-68526-2. } While the three leading candidates (Reagan, Anderson and Carter) were religious Christians, Carter had the most support of evangelical Christians according to a Gallup poll. However, in the end, Jerry Falwell &apos;s Moral Majority lobbying group is credited with giving Reagan two-thirds of the white evangelical vote.

It signaled the new electoral power of the suburbs and the Sun Belt. Reagan&apos;s success as a conservative would initiate a realigning of the parties, as liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats would either leave politics or change party affiliations through the 1980s and 1990s to leave the parties much more ideologically polarized. While during Barry Goldwater &apos;s 1964 campaign, many voters saw his warnings about a too-powerful government as hyperbolic and only 30% of the electorate agreed that government was too powerful, by 1980 a majority of Americans believed that government held too much power.

[ How We Got Here: The &apos;70s Frum David David Frum 2000 Basic Books New York, New York 0-465-04195-7 344 ] Reagan also promised an end to &quot; &apos;trust me&apos; government &quot; and to restore economic health by implementing a supply-side economic policy. Reagan promised a balanced budget within three years (which he said would be &quot; the beginning of the end of inflation &quot; ), accompanied by a 30% reduction in tax rates over those same years. With respect to the economy, Reagan famously said, &quot; A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his. &quot; Reagan also criticized the &quot; windfall profit tax &quot; that Carter and Congress enacted that year in regards to domestic oil production and promised to attempt to repeal it as president.

After a bitter Convention fight between Republican feminists and antifeminists the Republican Party dropped their forty-year endorsement of the ERA.

Reagan was convinced to give an endorsement of women&apos;s rights in his nomination acceptance speech. Carter was criticized by his own aides for not having a &quot; grand plan &quot; for the recovery of the economy, nor did he ever make any campaign promises; he often criticized Reagan&apos;s economic recovery plan, but did not create one of his own in response. [ Campaign events ] { Strom Thurmond in Columbia, South Carolina, 10 October 1980 } In August, after the Republican National Convention, Ronald Reagan gave a campaign speech at the annual Neshoba County Fair on the outskirts of Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers were murdered in 1964. He was the first presidential candidate ever to campaign at the fair. { Kornacki, Steve (2011-02-03) The &quot; Southern Strategy, &quot; fulfilled, } { Salon.com } Reagan famously announced, &quot; Programs like education and others should be turned back to the states and local communities with the tax sources to fund them. I believe in states’ rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can at the community level and the private level. &quot; Reagan also stated, &quot; I believe we have distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended to be given in the Constitution to that federal establishment. &quot; He went on to promise to &quot; restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them. &quot; [ Douglas E.

This commitment is interwoven into every phase of the plans I will propose. &quot; He then said that he would develop &quot; enterprise zones &quot; to help with urban renewal. Reagan made some gaffes during the campaign. When Carter appeared in a small Alabama town, Tuscumbia, Reagan incorrectly claimed the town had been the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan —it was actually the home of the KKK&apos;s national headquarters. Reagan was widely ridiculed by Democrats for saying that trees caused pollution; he later said that he meant only certain types of pollution and his remarks had been misquoted. [ Here We Go Again! Andrew Bridges CBS News 2003-03-17 http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/17/tech/main544188.shtml 2008-10-20 ] Meanwhile, Carter was burdened by a continued weak economy and the Iran hostage crisis. Inflation, high interest rates, and unemployment continued through the course of the campaign, and the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran became, to many, a symbol of American impotence during the Carter years. John Anderson&apos;s independent candidacy, aimed at liberals, was also seen as hurting Carter more than Reagan, especially in such Democratic states as Massachusetts and New York. [ The debates ] [ June 2010 ] [ 210px right Reagan-Carter presidential debate, October 28, 1980 ] The most important event of the entire 1980 presidential campaign was the second presidential debate, which was held one week to the day before the election (October 28). Over the course of two hours, the entire race changed drastically, and what was considered an extremely tight race with the President slightly ahead became a comfortable Republican victory for Reagan. Nothing of that magnitude has happened since in any televised confrontations. The League of Women Voters, which had sponsored the 1976 Ford/Carter debate series, announced that it would do so again for the next cycle in the spring of 1979. However, Carter was not eager to participate with any debate. He had repeatedly refused to a debate Senator Edward M. Kennedy during the primary season, and had given ambivalent signals as to his participation in the fall. The LWV had announced a schedule of debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had much of a problem with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. The first debate was moderated by Bill Moyers and took place in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 21. President Carter was nowhere to be found. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, could, according to many in the media, manage only a draw. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and at the time of the debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, and the two spent a good portion of the debate simply criticizing Carter for refusing to participate. As September turned into October, the situation remained essentially the same. Governor Reagan insisted Anderson be allowed to participate, and the President remained steadfastly opposed to this. As the standoff continued, the second round was canceled, as was the vice presidential debate. With two weeks to go to the election, the Reagan campaign decided that the best thing to do at that moment was to accede to all of President Carter&apos;s demands, and LWV agreed to exclude Congressman Anderson from the final debate, which was rescheduled for October 28 in Cleveland, Ohio. Moderated by Howard K. Smith and presented by the League of Women Voters, the presidential debate between President Carter and Governor Reagan ranked among the highest ratings of any television show in the previous decade. Debate topics included the Iranian hostage crisis, and nuclear arms treaties and proliferation. Carter&apos;s campaign sought to portray Reagan as a reckless &quot; war hawk, &quot; as well as a &quot; dangerous right-wing radical &quot;. Gov. Reagan would have none of it, and it came as no surprise then, when the candidates repeatedly clashed over the nuclear weapons issue in their debate. But it was President Carter&apos;s reference to his consultation with 12-year-old daughter Amy concerning nuclear weapons policy that became the focus of post-debate analysis and fodder for late-night television joke s. President Carter said he had asked Amy what the most important issue in that election was and she said, &quot; the control of nuclear arms. &quot; A famous political cartoon, published the day after Reagan&apos;s landslide victory, showed Amy Carter sitting in Jimmy&apos;s lap with her shoulders shrugged asking &quot; the economy? the hostage crisis? &quot; In contrast to Carter&apos;s serious and distained attitude, Reagan&apos;s demeanor, on the other hand, was calm, sunny, tolerant, and almost folksy, somewhat like Andy Griffith &apos;s Andy Taylor character. When President Carter made another verbal attack against Regan by making a reference to what he saw as the governor&apos;s record, which include voting against Medicare and Social Security benefits, Governor Reagan sighed and replied with a calm and nonchalant: &quot; There you go again &quot;. [ The Second 1980 Presidential Debate PBS http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/80debates/cart1.html 2008-10-20 ] In describing the national debt that was approaching 1 trillion dollars, Reagan stated &quot; a billion is a thousand millions, and a trillion is a thousand billions. &quot; When Carter would attack the content of Reagan&apos;s campaign speeches, Reagan began his counter with with words: &quot; well, I don&apos;t know that I said that. I really don&apos;t. &quot; In his closing remarks, Reagan asked the viewers a simple yet devastating question that would resonate with voters in 1980 and beyond: &quot; Are you better off now than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we&apos;re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions &apos;yes&apos;, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don&apos;t agree, if you don&apos;t think that this course that we&apos;ve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have. &quot; According to President Carter&apos;s Press Secretary Jody Powell &apos;s memoirs, internal tracking polls showed the President&apos;s tiny lead turning into a major Reagan landslide over the final weekend. [ Endorsements ] In September 1980, former Watergate scandal prosecutor Leon Jaworski accepted a position as honorary chairman of Democrats for Reagan. Five months earlier, Jaworski had harshly criticized Reagan as an &quot; extremist; &quot; he said after accepting the chairmanship, &quot; I would rather have a competent extremist than an incompetent moderate. &quot; Former Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota (who in 1968 had challenged Lyndon Johnson from the left, causing the then-President to all but abdicate) endorsed Reagan; he would later call Carter &quot; the worst president we&apos;ve ever had &quot;. { MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour (2005-12-12). Online NewsHour: Remembering Sen. Eugene McCarthy — December 12, 2005. } { PBS. } Three days before the November 4 voting in the election, the National Rifle Association endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time in its history, backing Reagan. Reagan had received the California Rifle and Pistol Association&apos;s Outstanding Public Service Award. Carter had appointed Abner J.

Bush beat Carter by almost 10 percentage points in the popular vote. Republican s also gained control of the Senate for the first time in twenty-five years on Reagan&apos;s coattails. The electoral college vote was a landslide, with 489 votes (representing 44 states) for Reagan and 49 votes for Carter (representing 6 states and the District of Columbia). NBC News projected Reagan as the winner at 8:15 pm EST (5:15 PST), before voting was finished in the West, based on exit polls. (It was the first time a broadcast network used exit polling to project a winner, and took the other broadcast networks by surprise.) Carter conceded defeat at 9:50 pm EST. { Facts on File Yearbook 1980 p865 } { Facts on File Yearbook 1980 p838 } Carter&apos;s loss was the worst defeat for an incumbent President since Herbert Hoover lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 by a margin of 18%. Carter&apos;s defeat is the most lopsided defeat for any incumbent president in an election where only two candidates won electoral votes. Also, Jimmy Carter is the first incumbent Democrat to serve only one full term since James Buchanan and fail to secure re-election since Andrew Johnson ( Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms while Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson served one full term in addition to taking over after the deaths of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy respectively). John Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote and failed to win any state outright. He found the most support in New England, fueled by liberal Republicans who felt Reagan was too far to the right; his best showing was in Massachusetts, where he won 15% of the popular vote. Conversely, Anderson performed worst in the South. Anderson failed to achieve the spoiler effect, due to Reagan&apos;s strong showing and the fact that he arguably attracted at least as many Democrats to his ticket as Republicans. Libertarian Party candidate Ed Clark received 921,299 popular votes (1.1%). The Libertarians succeeded in getting Clark on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Clark&apos;s best showing was in Alaska, where he received 12% of the vote. As of 2008, this is the best performance by a Libertarian presidential candidate. Reagan won 53% of the vote in reliably Democratic South Boston. Reagan&apos;s electoral college victory of 489 electoral votes (90.9% of the electoral vote) is the most lopsided electoral college victory for a non-incumbent President. This was also the last election in which an incumbent president was defeated in two elections in a row. The only other time this happened was in 1892.
