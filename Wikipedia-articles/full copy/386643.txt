The main centre in the township is the namesake community of Uxbridge. Other communities within the township include Coppins Corners, Goodwood, { For a complete history of Goodwood, see Eleanor Todd, Burrs and Blackberries from Goodwood (Goodwood, ON: 1980). } Leaskdale, Roseville, Sandford, Sandy Hook, Siloam, Victoria Corners and Zephyr. [ History ] Uxbridge was surveyed in 1805 as part of York County. It was named for Uxbridge, England, of which the name is derived from &quot; Wixan&apos;s Bridge &quot;. { Uxbridge, } { English Place-Name Society database at Nottingham University } The Wixan were a 7th-century Saxon tribe from Lincolnshire who also began to settle in what became Middlesex. { Cotton 1994, p.8 } Anglo-Saxons began to settle and farm in the area of Uxbridge, England in the 5th century, clearing the dense woodland and remaining there for around 500 years. Uxbridge, UK became part of the Elthorne Hundred with other villages in the area. The town later appears in records from 1107 as &quot; Woxbrigge &quot;. { Sherwood 2007, p.5 } The first settlers in the area were Quakers who started arriving in 1806 from the Catawissa area of Pennsylvania. The community&apos;s oldest building, the Uxbridge Friends Meeting House, was built in 1820 and overlooks the town from Quaker Hill, a kilometre to the west. The township was incorporated as a municipality in 1850 and became part of the newly formed Ontario County two years later. The first passenger carrying narrow gauge railway in North America, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway arrived in Uxbridge in June 1871, and for over a decade Uxbridge was the headquarters of the railway. In 1872, the Village of Uxbridge was separated from the Township and incorporated as a separate entity. With the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham in 1974, Uxbridge Township was amalgamated with the Town of Uxbridge and Scott Township to create an expanded Township of Uxbridge. [ Uxbridge today ] Today, Uxbridge serves as a mostly suburban community in northern Durham Region. Major manufacturing employers include Pine Valley Packaging (packaging, containers and portable shelters), Koch-Glitsch Canada (mass transfer systems) and Hela Canada (spice and ingredient manufacture). Many residents commute to other centres in Durham and York Regions and beyond. The 30-bed Uxbridge Cottage Hospital is a site of the Markham Stouffville Hospital Corporation. Uxbridge is twinned with Catawissa, Pennsylvania, in the United States, from which many of its settlers originated. Uxbridge has three community newspapers, the Uxbridge Standard, the Uxbridge Times Journal and the Cosmos. It is also served by a monthly community magazine and events guide, Uxbridge Town Talk.
