The territory consists of two atoll s and 27 coral island s, of which two, West Island and Home Island, are inhabited with a total population of approximately 600. [ Geography ] The Cocos (Keeling) Islands consist of two flat, low-lying coral atolls with an area of [ 14.2 km2 sqmi ], [ 26 km mi ] of coastline, a highest elevation of [ 5 m ft ] and thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation. The climate is pleasant, moderated by the southeast trade winds for about nine months of the year and with moderate rainfall. [ May 2009 ] Cyclone s may occur in the early months of the year. North Keeling Island is an atoll consisting of just one C-shaped island, a nearly closed atoll ring with a small opening into the lagoon, about [ 50 m ft ] wide, on the east side. The island measures [ 1.1 km2 acre ] in land area and is uninhabited. The lagoon is about [ 0.5 km2 acre ]. North Keeling Island and the surrounding sea to [ 1.5 km mi 2 on ] from shore form the Pulu Keeling National Park, established on 12 December 1995. It is home to the only surviving population of the endemic, and endangered, Cocos Buff-banded Rail. South Keeling Islands is an atoll consisting of 24 individual islets forming an incomplete atoll ring, with a total land area of [ 13.1 km2 sqmi ]. Only Home Island and West Island are populated. The Cocos Malays maintain weekend shacks, referred to as pondoks, on most of the larger islands.

Fresh water resources are limited to water lenses on the larger islands, underground accumulations of rainwater lying above the seawater. These lenses are accessed through shallow bores or wells. Cocos (Keeling) Island is located on almost exactly the opposite side of the globe from Cocos Island, Costa Rica. [ Fauna ] [ Fauna of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands ] [ Demographics ] In 2010, the population of the islands is estimated at just over 600. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island (estimated population 100) and the ethnic Malays on Home Island (estimated population 500). A Cocos dialect of Malay and English are the main languages spoken, and 80% of Cocos Islanders are Sunni Muslim. [ History ] In 1609 Captain William Keeling was the first European to see the islands, while serving in the East India Company, { Joshua Slocum, &quot; Sailing Alone Around the World &quot;, p. 212 } but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. In 1814, a Scottish merchant seaman named Captain John Clunies-Ross stopped briefly at the islands on a trip to India, nailing up a Union Jack and planning to return and settle on the islands with his family in the future. However, a wealthy Englishman named Alexander Hare had similar plans, and hired a captain, coincidentally Clunies-Ross&apos; brother, to bring him and a harem of forty Malay women to the islands where he hoped to set up his own private residence. Hare had previously served as governor of a colony in Borneo and found that &quot; he could not confine himself to the tame life that prosy civilisation affords &quot;. When Clunies-Ross returned two years later with his wife, children and mother-in-law, and found Hare already established on the island and living with a private harem, a feud grew instantly between the two men. Clunies-Ross&apos; eight sailors, &quot; began at once the invasion of the new kingdom to take possession of it, women and all &quot;. After some time, Hare&apos;s women began deserting him, and instead finding themselves mates amongst Clunies-Ross&apos; sailors. { The Clunies-Ross Chronicle } Disheartened, Hare left the island and went to Batavia where he later died. Clunies-Ross&apos; workers were paid in a currency called the Cocos rupee, a currency John Clunies-Ross minted himself that could only be redeemed at the company store. { End of a kingdom } An 1840 chart of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands { Emden leaves Cocos (Keeling) Islands via this jetty on } { Direction Island. } On 1 April 1836, [ Beagle ] under Captain Robert FitzRoy arrived to take soundings establishing the profile of the atoll as part of the survey expedition of the &apos;&apos;Beagle&apos;&apos;. To the young naturalist Charles Darwin, who was on the ship, the results supported a theory he had developed of how atolls formed, which he later published as The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. He studied the natural history of the islands and collected specimens. [ Keynes Richard Richard Keynes 2001 Charles Darwin&apos;s Beagle Diary Cambridge University Press 413–418 2009-01-20 ] Darwin&apos;s assistant Syms Covington noted, &quot; an Englishman [he was of course Scottish] and HIS family, with about sixty or seventy mulatto s from the Cape of Good Hope, live on one of the islands. Captain Ross, the governor, is now absent at the Cape. &quot; [ Annexation by the British Empire ] The islands were annexed by the British Empire in 1857. This annexation was carried out by Captain Stephen Grenville Fremantle in command of [ Juno 1844 6 ]. Fremantle claimed the islands for the British Empire and appointed Ross II as Superintendent. [ The Cocos Islands The Chambers&apos;s Journal 1899 76 187–190 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DddUXAQAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA187 ] In 1867, their administration was placed under the Straits Settlements, which included Penang, Malacca and Singapore. Queen Victoria granted the islands in perpetuity to the Clunies-Ross family in 1886. The Cocos Islands under the Clunies-Ross family have been cited as an example of a 19th-century micronation. [ February 2010 ] [ World War I ] [ Battle of Cocos ] On the morning of 9 November 1914, the islands became the site of the Battle of Cocos, one of the first naval battles of World War I. A landing party from the German cruiser [ Emden 1906 6 ] captured and disabled the wireless and cable communications station on Direction Island, but not before the station was able to transmit a distress call. An Allied troop convoy was passing nearby, and the Australian cruiser [ Sydney 1912 6 ] was detached from the convoy escort to investigate. Sydney spotted the island and Emden at 09:15, with both ships preparing for combat. The longer range of Emden s guns meant she was able to fire first, but the German ship was unable to inflict disabling damage to the Australian cruiser before Sydney closed into range and opened up with her more powerful main guns. At 11:20, the heavily damaged Emden beached herself on North Keeling Island. The Australian warship broke to pursue Emden s supporting collier, which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, Emden s battle ensign was still flying: usually a sign that a ship intends to continue fighting. After no response to instructions to lower the ensign, two salvoes were shot into the beached cruiser, after which the Germans lowered the flag and rose a white sheet. Sydney had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans. 134 personnel aboard Emden were killed, and 69 were wounded, compared to only 4 killed and 16 wounded aboard Sydney. The German survivors were taken aboard the Australian cruiser, which caught up to the troop convoy in Colombo on 15 November, then transported to Malta and handed over to the British Army. An additional 50 German personnel from the shore party, unable to be recovered before Sydney arrived, commandeered a schooner and escaped from Direction Island, eventually arriving in Constantinople. Emden was the last active Central Powers warship in the Indian or Pacific Oceans, which meant troopships from Australia and New Zealand could sail without naval escort, and Allied ships could be deployed elsewhere. [ World War II ] During World War II, the cable station was once again a vital link. Allied planners noted that the islands might be seized as a base for German raider cruisers operating in the Indian Ocean. Following Japan &apos;s entry into the war, Japanese forces occupied neighbouring islands. To avoid drawing their attention to the Cocos cable station and its islands&apos; garrison, the seaplane anchorage between Direction and Horsburgh islands was not used. Radio transmitters were also kept silent, except in emergencies. [ December 2009 ] After the Fall of Singapore in 1942, the islands were administered from Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ), and West and Direction Islands were placed under Allied military administration. The islands&apos; garrison initially consisted of a platoon from the British Army&apos;s King&apos;s African Rifles, located on Horsburgh Island, with two [ 6 in mm on 4 ] guns to cover the anchorage. The local inhabitants all lived on Home Island. Despite the importance of the islands as a communication centre, the Japanese made a lot of attempts either to raid or to occupy them and contented themselves, with sending over a reconnaissance aircraft about once a month, but one battle stood out of them all the battle of Keeling it took Place in keeling in 1943. Forces from Fiji, Australia, Solomon Islands and New Zealand were hit with bombs for two hours and when it was done over half of the soldier&apos;s were dead. When the Australia general saw the size of the Japanese army he dicovered that he was out numbered three to one. But though he was out numbered he was able to win [ December 2009 ] On the night of 8–9 May 1942, 15 members of the garrison, from the Ceylon Defence Force, mutinied, under the leadership of Gratien Fernando. The mutineers were said to have been provoked by the attitude of their British officers and were also supposedly inspired by anti-imperialist beliefs. They attempted to take control of the gun battery on the islands. The Cocos Islands Mutiny was crushed, but the mutineers killed one non-mutinous soldier and wounded one officer. Seven of the mutineers were sentenced to death at a trial that was later alleged to have been improperly conducted. Four of the sentences were commuted, but three men were executed, including Fernando. These were to be the only British Commonwealth soldiers executed for mutiny during the Second World War. [ Cruise Noel The Cocos Islands Mutiny Fremantle Arts Centre Press 2002 Fremantle 248 1-86368-310-0 ] On 25 December 1942, the Japanese submarine &apos;&apos;I-166&apos;&apos; bombarded the islands but caused no damage. { Combinedfleet.com } Later in the war, two airstrips were built, and three bomber squadrons were moved to the islands to conduct raids against Japanese targets in South East Asia and to provide support during the planned reinvasion of Malaya and reconquest of Singapore. The first aircraft to arrive were Supermarine Spitfire Mk VIIIs of No. 136 Squadron RAF. They included some Liberator bombers from No. 321 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF (members of exiled Dutch forces serving with the Royal Air Force ), which were also stationed on the islands. When in July 1945 No. 99 and No. 356 RAF squadrons arrived on West Island, they brought with them a daily newspaper called Atoll which contained news of what was happening in the outside world. Run by airmen in their off-duty hours, it achieved fame when dropped by Liberator bombers on POW camps over the heads of the Japanese guards. In 1946 the administration of the islands reverted to Singapore. [ October 2010 ] [ Transfer to Australia ] On 23 November 1955, the islands were transferred to Australian control under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 (an Australian Act) pursuant to the Cocos Islands Act, 1955 (a UK Act). [ http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/jun/28/cocos-keeling-islands#S5CV0934P0-05978 House of Commons 28 June 1977 ] Mr H J Hull was appointed the first Official Representative (now Administrator) of the new Territory. He had been a Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Australian Navy and was released for the purpose. Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, Mr Hull&apos;s appointment was terminated and John William Stokes was appointed on secondment from the Northern Territory Police. A media release at the end of October 1958 by the Minister for Territories, Mr Hasluck, commended Mr Hull&apos;s three years of service on Cocos. Mr Stokes served in the position from 31 October 1958 to 30 September 1960. Mr C.I. Buffett MBE from Norfolk Island succeeded him and served from 28 July 1960 to 30 June 1966, and later acted as Administrator back on Cocos and on Norfolk Island. In 1974, Ken Mullen wrote a small book { Cocos Keeling, the islands time forgot (1974). Ken Mullen. published by Angus &amp; Robertson, Sydney. 122 pages. } about his time with wife and son from 1964 to 1966 working at the Cable Station on Direction Island. In the 1970s, the Australian government&apos;s dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of A$6,250,000, using the threat of compulsory acquisition. By agreement, the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. However, in 1983 the Australian government reneged this agreement, and told John Clunies-Ross that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the High Court of Australia ruled that resumption of Oceania House was unlawful, but the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be granted to Clunies-Ross&apos;s shipping company, an action that contributed to his bankruptcy. John Clunies-Ross now lives in Perth, Western Australia. However, some members of the Clunies-Ross family still live on the Cocos. Extensive preparations were undertaken by the government of Australia to prepare the Cocos Malays to vote in their referendum of self-determination. Discussions began in 1982, with an aim of holding the referendum - under United Nations supervision - in mid-1983. Under guidelines developed by the UN Decolonization Committee, residents were to be offered 3 choices: full independence, free association, or integration with Australia. The latter was preferred by both the islanders and the Australian government. However, a change in government in Canberra following the March 1983 Australian elections delayed the vote by one year. While the Home Island Council stated a preference for a traditional communal consensus &quot; vote &quot;, the UN insisted on a secret ballot. The vote was held on 6 April 1984, with all 261 eligible islanders participating, including the Clunies-Ross family: 229 voted for integration, 21 for Free Association, 9 for independence, and 2 failed to indicate a preference. { Kenneth Chen, &quot; Pacific Island Development Plan: Cocos (Keeling) Islands- The Political Evolution of a Small Island Territory in the Indian Ocean &quot; (1987): Mr Chen was Administrator, Cocos Islands, from December 1983-November 1985. } The 2004 earthquake and tsunami centered off the western shore of Sumatra, Indonesia, prompted early worries about the Cocos, but no casualties were reported. { Main article: } { Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake } [ Government ] The capital of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands is West Island while the largest settlement is the village of Bantam [ August 2010 ] ( Home Island ). Governance of the islands is based on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 { WebLaw – full resource metadata display } { ComLaw Act Compilations – Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 (34) } and depends heavily on the laws of Australia.

The current Administrator is Brian Lacy, who was appointed on 18 September 2009 and is also the Administrator of Christmas Island. These two Territories comprise Australia&apos;s Indian Ocean Territories. The Australian Government provides Commonwealth-level government services through the Christmas Island Administration and the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. As per the Federal Government&apos;s Territories Law Reform Act 1992, which came into force on 1 July 1992, Western Australia n laws are applied to the Cocos Islands, &quot; so far as they are capable of applying in the Territory. &quot;; non-application or partial application of such laws is at the discretion of the federal government. The Act also gives Western Australian courts judicial power over the islands. The Cocos Islands remain constitutionally distinct from Western Australia, however; the power of the state to legislate for the territory is power delegated by the federal government. The kind of services typically provided by a state government elsewhere in Australia are provided by departments of the Western Australian Government, and by contractors, with the costs met by the federal government. There also exists a unicameral Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council with seven seats. A full term lasts four years, though elections are held every two years; approximately half the members retire each two years. Federally, Cocos (Keeling) Islanders form the electorate of Lingiari with Christmas Island and outback Northern Territory. The islands have a five-person police force but their defence remains the responsibility of Australia. [ Economy ] There is a small and growing tourist industry focused on water-based or nature activities. Small local gardens and fishing contribute to the food supply, but most food and most other necessities must be imported from Australia or elsewhere. The Cocos Islands Cooperative Society Ltd. employs construction workers, stevedore s, and lighterage worker operations. Tourism employs others. The unemployment rate was 11.3% in 2006. { 2006 Census, Australian Bureau of Statistics } [ Strategic Importance ] The Cocos Islands are geostrategically important because of their proximity to Indian Ocean and South China Sea shipping lanes. The United States Armed Forces have planned to construct airbases on the Cocos Islands, capable of supporting drone-based espionage and surveillance over the South China Sea. { Whitlock, Craig, &quot; U.S., Australia to broaden military ties amid Pentagon pivot to SE Asia &quot;, } { The Washington Post, 26 March 2012. } Euronews described the plan as providing Australian support for increased American presence in Southeast Asia, but likely to upset Chinese officials. { Grubel, James, &quot; Australia open to US spy flights from Indian Ocean. &quot; } { Euronews, 28 March 2012. } James Cogan has written for the World Socialist Web Site that airbase construction at Cocos is one component of Obama&apos;s &quot; pivot &quot; towards Asia, facilitating control the sea lanes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans and potentially allowing US forces to enforce a blockade against China. { Cogan, James, &quot; US Marines begin operations in northern Australia. &quot; } { World Socialist Web Site, 14 April 2012. } After plans to construct airbases were leaked to the Washington Post, Australian defense minister Stephen Smith stated that the Australian government views &quot; Cocos as being potentially a long-term strategic location, but that is down the track. &quot; { McGuirk, Rod, &quot; Australia to Welcome 250 US Marines next Month, Plays down Proposal for Indian Ocean Air Base. &quot; } { Associated Press, 27 March 2012. } [ Communications and transport ] The islands are connected within Australia&apos;s telecommunication system (with number range +61 8 9162 xxxx) and postal system ( post code : 6799). Public phones are located on both West Island and Home Island. A GSM mobile phone network operates on Cocos (Keeling) Islands which is &quot; on its last legs &quot; according to the Government. { APH.gov.au } Phones must be registered through the Telecentre to access this service. There is one paved airport on the West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island International Airport, to which Virgin Australia operates scheduled jet services from Perth, Western Australia. There is also a lagoon anchorage. In the 1950s and 1960s the airport at Cocos Islands was a key stop for commercial airline flights between Australia and South Africa, and Qantas and South African Airways stopped there to refuel. The arrival of long range jet aircraft ended this requirement. [ Media ] Cocos (Keeling) Islands has access to a range of modern communication services. Four television stations broadcast from Western Australia via satellite. These are ABC, SBS, WIN and GWN. A local radio station, 6CKI – Voice of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, is staffed by community volunteers and provides some local content. As television and radio stations broadcast through a satellite service, rainfall may cause interference. [ Television ] [ Australian ] Cocos Island received four channels from Western Australia via Satellite: ABC1 SBS One WIN Television (Affiliated of Nine Network Perth) GWN7 (Affiliated of Seven Network Perth) Cocos Island only receives four channels because digital television is not available yet. [ Malaysian ] From 2013 onwards, Cocos Island will receive 4 Malaysian channels via Satellite: TV3 ntv7 8TV TV9 [ Education ] There are two schools in the archipelago, located on the two inhabited islands. One is on West Island, and the other on Home Island. School instruction is in English, and efforts are made to discourage students from speaking the local language ( Cocos Islands Malay, a Malay dialect) on school premises. { Paige Taylor, Crime in paradise lost in translation &quot; The Australian &quot;, 17 August 2009 } [ Gallery ] Sunset over the islands Palm trees on the islands [ See also ] [ Geography Asia Southeast Asia Australia ] Index of Cocos (Keeling) Islands-related articles Banknotes of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Cocos Malays King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Pearl Islands Isla de Cocos, Panama and Cocos Island, Costa Rica Transport in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands [ References ] [ 2 ] [ External links ] [ Cocos (Keeling) Islands ] Shire of Cocos (Keeling) Islands homepage Areas of individual islets Atoll Research Bulletin vol. 403 Cocos (Keeling) Islands Tourism website Noel Crusz, &apos;&apos;The Cocos Islands mutiny&apos;&apos;, Reviewed by: Peter Stanley, Principal Historian, Australian War Memorial History of Cocos (Keeling) Islands The man who lost a &quot; coral kingdom &quot; [ 12 07 S 96 54 E region:CC title ] [ History of Australia History of Victoria ] [ Geography of Australia Geography of Victoria ] [ background:#ddf; ] [ autocollapse ] [ Climate of ] Category:Archipelagoes of the Indian Ocean Category:British rule in Singapore Category:States and territories of Australia Category:States and territories established in 1955 af:Kokoseilande ar:جزر كوكس az:Kokos adaları zh-min-nan:Cocos (Keeling) Kûn-tó be:Какосавыя астравы be-x-old:Какосавыя астравы bg:Кокосови острови bs:Kokosova ostrva br:Inizi Cocos (Keeling) ca:Illes Cocos cs:Kokosové ostrovy cy:Ynysoedd Cocos da:Cocosøerne de:Kokosinseln et:Kookossaared el:Νησιά Κόκος es:Islas Cocos eo:Kokosinsuloj eu:Cocos (Keeling) uharteak fa:جزایر کوکوس hif:Cocos (Keeling) Islands fr:Îles Cocos gv:Ellanyn Cocos (Keeling) gl:Illas Cocos gu:કોકોસ (કીલીંગ) દ્વીપ ko:코코스 제도 hi:कोकोस (कीलिंग) द्वीपसमूह hr:Kokosovi otoci bpy:কোকোস (কিলিং) দ্বীপমালা id:Kepulauan Cocos (Keeling) is:Kókoseyjar it:Isole Cocos e Keeling he:איי קוקוס jv:Kapuloan Cocos (Keeling) pam:Cocos (Keeling) Islands ka:ქოქოსის კუნძულები kw:Ynysow Cocos (Keeling) rw:Ibirwa bya Koko sw:Visiwa vya Cocos (Keeling) lv:Kokosu (Kīlinga) Salas lt:Kokosų (Kilingo) Salos lij:Isoe Cocos hu:Kókusz (Keeling)-szigetek mk:Кокосови Острови mr:कोकोस द्वीपसमूह ms:Kepulauan Cocos (Keeling) mn:Кокос (Кийлинг) Арлууд nl:Cocoseilanden ja:ココス諸島 no:Kokosøyene nn:Kokosøyane pl:Wyspy Kokosowe pt:Ilhas Cocos (Keeling) ro:Insulele Cocos ru:Кокосовые острова simple:Cocos (Keeling) Islands sk:Kokosové ostrovy cu:Кокосовꙑ острова ckb:دوورگەکانی کۆکۆس sr:Кокосова острва sh:Kokosovi Otoci su:Kapuloan Cocos (Keeling) fi:Kookossaaret sv:Kokosöarna ta:கொக்கோசு (கீலிங்) தீவுகள் th:หมู่เกาะโคโคส tr:Cocos Adaları uk:Кокосові острови ug:كەئەلىڭ كوكوس تاقىم ئاراللىرى vi:Quần đảo Cocos (Keeling) zh-classical:科科斯（基林）群島 war:Kapuropud-an Cocos (Keeling) wo:Dunu Kokos wuu:科科斯群岛 yo:Àwọn Erékùṣù Kókósì zh-yue:可可斯 (基林) 群島 zh:科科斯（基林）群島
