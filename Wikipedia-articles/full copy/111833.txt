The first development by a European settler within what is now the city limits was made by Preston Brickey in 1820. He constructed a log cabin a few yards north of where the depot now stands, and here cultivated a farm. In 1839 James Pollock placed a small stock of goods in the log cabin built by Henry Simmons, where he did business for about a year. This was situated about a quarter mile east of today&apos;s Catholic Church building. The next year he moved his stock of goods into a log building erected by John C. Crozier, which was situated on the ground now occupied by Henry O&apos;Harra&apos;s lumber yard. He continued the business there about three years, when he moved to Preston. In 1840 R.D. Dufree became the first permanent merchant in Red Bud. Two years later he built a frame store house on the southeast corner of Main and Market streets. The first brick school house was erected in 1854, in the east part of town. { &apos;Combined History of Randolph, Monroe, and Perry Counties, Illinois. } [ Incorporation and charter ] The village of Red Bud was organized on April 19,1866, with officers as follows: John Brickey – president of board, Gerhard Boekhoff, William Schuck, Gerhard Ortgeisen, and John Brunner.
