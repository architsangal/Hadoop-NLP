[ modern ethnic groups Pygmy (disambiguation) ] African pygmies and a European explorer. Baka dancers in the East Province of Cameroon Pygmy is a term used for various ethnic group s worldwide whose average height is unusually short; anthropologist s define pygmy as any group whose adult men grow to less than 150  cm (59  inches) in average height. { Encyclopædia Britannica: Pygmy. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-11. } A member of a slightly taller group is termed &quot; pygmoid. &quot; { pygmoid (people) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-11. } The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efé and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, { The Semang by George Weber. Chapter 35: The Negrito of Malaysia. } Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. { Darwin&apos;s Children. The Economist. December 13, 2007 } The term also includes the Negrito s of Southeast Asia. The term &quot; pygmy &quot; is sometimes considered pejorative. However, there is no single term to replace it. { Hewlett, Barry S. &quot; Cultural diversity among African pygmies. &quot; In: Cultural Diversity Among Twentieth-Century Foragers. Susan Kent, ed. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1996. } Many so-called pygmies prefer instead to be referred to by the name of their various ethnic group s, or names for various interrelated groups such as the Aka (Mbenga), Baka, Mbuti, and Twa. { Forest peoples in the central African rain forest: focus on the pygmies. } The term Bayaka, the plural form of the Aka/Yaka, is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. Likewise, the Kongo word Bambenga is used in Congo. [ Etymology ] [ Pygmy (Greek mythology) ] The term pygmy, as used to refer to diminutive people, derives from Greek πυγμαίος Pygmaios via Latin Pygmaei (sing. Pygmaeus), derived from πυγμή – a fist, or a measure of length corresponding to the distance between the elbow and knuckles. (See also Greek pechus ). In Greek mythology the word describes a tribe of dwarfs, first described by Homer, and reputed to live in India and south of modern day Ethiopia. { pygmy. Online Etymology Dictionary. } [ Origins ] Various theories have been proposed to explain the short stature of pygmies. Evidence of heritability has been established [ 10.1002/ajpa.21512 Indirect evidence for the genetic determination of short stature in African Pygmies 2011 Becker Noémie S.A. Verdu Paul Froment Alain Le Bomin Sylvie Pagezy Hélène Bahuchet Serge Heyer Evelyne American Journal of Physical Anthropology 145 3 390–401 21541921 ] which may have evolved as an adaptation to low ultraviolet light levels in rainforest s. [ Ultraviolet light levels in the rainforest http://julianodea.blogspot.com/2009/12/ultraviolet-light-levels-in-rainforest.html Dr Julian O&apos;Dea December 21, 2009 ] This might mean that relatively little vitamin D can be made in human skin, thereby limiting calcium uptake from the diet for bone growth and maintenance, and leading to the evolution of the small skeletal size characteristic of pygmies. { O&apos;Dea, JD. Possible contribution of low ultraviolet light under the rainforest canopy to the small stature of Pygmies and Negritos. Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology, Vol. 44, No.3, pp. 284–7, 1994. } Other explanations include lack of food in the rainforest environment, low calcium levels in the soil, the need to move through dense jungle, adaptation to heat and humidity, and most recently, as an association with rapid reproductive maturation under conditions of early mortality. { Short lives, short size – why are pygmies small? « Not Exactly Rocket Science. } Other evidence points towards unusually low levels of expression of the genes encoding the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone relative to the related tribal groups, associated with low serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 and short stature.

Most Pygmy communities are partially hunter-gatherers, living partially but not exclusively on the wild products of their environment. They trade with neighbouring farmers to acquire cultivated foods and other material items; no group lives deep in the forest without access to agricultural products. It is estimated that there are between 250,000 and 600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest. { World Bank accused of razing Congo forests, The Guardian. } However, although Pygmies are thought of as forest people, the groups called Twa may live in open swamp or desert. [ Groups ] [ Classification of Pygmy languages ] There are at least a dozen Pygmy groups, sometimes unrelated to each other, the best known being the Mbenga (Aka and Baka) of the western Congo basin, which speak Bantu and Ubangian languages; the Mbuti (Efe etc.) of the Ituri Rainforest, which speak Bantu and Central Sudanic languages, and the Twa of the African Great Lakes, which speak Bantu Rundi and Kiga. [ Relationship with other Africans ] [ Ancestral relationship ] A commonly held belief is that African Pygmies are the direct descendants of the Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer peoples of the central African rainforest, who were partially absorbed or displaced by later immigration of agricultural peoples, and adopted their Central Sudanic, Ubangian, and Bantu languages. This view has no archaeological support, and ambiguous support from genetics and linguistics. { R. Blench and M. Dendo. &apos;&apos;Genetics and linguistics in sub-Saharan Africa&apos;&apos;, Cambridge-Bergen, June 24, 2004. } { Klieman, Kairn A.

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with honey collecting, or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. It has been proposed that this is the remnant of an independent western Pygmy (Mbenga or &quot; Baaka &quot; ) language. However, this type of vocabulary is subject to widespread borrowing among the Pygmies and neighboring peoples, and the &quot; Baaka &quot; language is only reconstructed to the 15th century. { Serge Bahuchet, 1993, History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.

ISBN 1-85070-380-9 } [ Genetic evidence for origins ] Genetically, the pygmies are extremely divergent from all other human populations, suggesting they have an ancient indigenous lineage. Their uniparental markers [ May 2012 ] represent the most ancient divergent ones right after those typically found in Khoisan peoples. African pygmy populations possess high levels of genetic diversity; [ Tishkoff The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans The American Association for the Advancement of Science 2009 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5930/1035.abstract 1 19407144 10.1126/science.1172257 SA Reed FA Friedlaender FR Ehret C Ranciaro A Froment A Hirbo JB Awomoyi AA Bodo JM 324 5930 1035–44 2947357 ] { Also see Supplementary Data } recent advances in genetics shed some light on the origins of the various pygmy groups.

In neighbouring North Kivu province there has been cannibalism by a group known as Les Effaceurs ( &quot; the erasers &quot; ) who wanted to clear the land of people to open it up for mineral exploitation.

Although they have been targeted by virtually all the armed groups, much of the violence against Pygmies is attributed to the rebel group, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, which is part of the transitional government and still controls much of the north, and their allies.

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master&apos;s whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all. As a result of pressure from UNICEF and human-rights activists, a law that would grant special protections to the Pygmy people is awaiting a vote by the Congo parliament.

Kristof June 16, 1997 New York Times ] [ Music ] [ Pygmy music ] The African Pygmies are particularly known for their usually vocal music, usually characterised by dense contrapuntal communal improvisation. Simha Arom says that the level of polyphonic complexity of Pygmy music was reached in Europe in the 14th century, yet Pygmy culture is unwritten and ancient; some Pygmy groups being the first known cultures in some areas of Africa. { African Rhythms (2003). Music by } { Aka Pygmies, performed by Aka Pygmies, } { György Ligeti and } { Steve Reich, performed by } { Pierre-Laurent Aimard. Teldec Classics: 8573 86584-2. Liner notes by Aimard, Ligeti, Reich, and Simha Arom and Stefan Schomann. } Music permeates daily life and there are songs for entertainment as well as specific events and activities. Polyphonic music is found among the Aka–Baka and the Mbuti, but not among the Gyele (Kola) or the various groups of Twa. [ Systematic discrimination ] Raja James Sheshardi of the American University conducted a case study on the Pygmies of Africa and concluded that deforestation has greatly affected their everyday lives. Pygmy culture is threatened today by the forces of political and economic change. In recent times, this has manifested itself into an open conflict over the resources of the tropical rain-forest, it is a conflict that the Pygmy are losing. Historically, the Pygmy have always been viewed as inferior by both colonial authorities and the village dwelling Bantu tribes. { Sheshadri, Raja. &quot; Pygmies in the Congo Basin and Conflict. &quot; no.163 (2005): ICE Case Studies, American University (Mar 24, 2010). } This has translated into systematic discrimination. One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world&apos;s fair in the United States in 1907. Pygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive deforestation have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished and abused by the dominant culture. Today there are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa. This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation all gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their genetic uniqueness. The greatest environmental problem the Pygmies seem to be facing is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In several countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to cash in on quick profits from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement. Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy. A family from a Ba Aka pygmy village Along with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases. { Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008 } This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group. Since poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities. Human rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities. [ Nyang&apos;ori Ohenjo, Ruth Willis, Dorothy Jackson, Clive Nettleton, Kenneth Good, Benon Mugarura Health of Indigenous people in Africa The Lancet 367 9526 2006 1937–1946 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68849-1 ] According to the report, even where health care facilities exist, many people do not use them because they cannot pay for consultations and medicines, they do not have the documents and identity cards needed to travel or obtain hospital treatment, and they are subjected to humiliating and discriminatory treatment. Studies in Cameroon and ROC in the 1980s and 1990s showed a lower prevalence of HIV in pygmy populations than among neighboring ones, but recent increases have been recorded. One study found that the HIV prevalence among the Baka pygmies in eastern Cameroon went from 0.7 percent in 1993 to 4 percent in 2003. [ Asia ] [ Negritos ] [ Negrito ] { Ati woman of the Philippines } Negritos in Southeast Asia (including the Batak and Aeta of the Philippines, the Andamanese of the Andaman Islands, and the Semang of the Malay Peninsula ) are sometimes called pygmies (especially in older literature). Negritos share some common physical features with African pygmy populations, including short stature and dark skin. The name &quot; Negrito &quot;, from the Spanish adjective meaning &quot; small black person &quot;, was given by early explorers. The explorers who named the Negritos assumed the Andamanese they encountered were from Africa. This belief was, however, discarded by anthropologists who noted that apart from dark skin and curly hair, the Andamanese had little in common with any African population, including the African pygmies. { Liu, James J.Y. The Chinese Knight Errant. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967 ISBN 0-226-48688-5. } Their resemblance to some Africans, it is generally believed, is due to adaptation to a similar environment, rather than shared origins. The remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently (as of 2011) found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.

A Burmese survey done in the 1960s reported a mean height of an adult male T&apos;rung at 1.43 m (4&apos;6 &quot; ) and that of females at 1.40 m (4&apos;5 &quot; ). These are the only &quot; pygmies &quot; noted of clearly East Asia n origin. The cause of their diminutive size is unknown, but diet and endogamous marriage practices have been cited. The population of T&apos;rung pygmies has been steadily shrinking, and is now down to only a few individuals. [ P.
