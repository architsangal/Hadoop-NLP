It was the 10th and final manned Gemini flight, the 18th manned American flight and, including X-15 flights over [ 100 km ], the 26th spaceflight of all time.

Gemini 12 tethered stationkeeping. (NASA) At the completion of the previous Gemini flight, the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft. In preparation for Gemini XII new, improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule, and a new technique—underwater training—was introduced, which would become a staple of future space-walk simulation. Aldrin&apos;s two-hour, 20-minute tethered space-walk, during which he photographed star fields, retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores, at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity. Two more stand-up EVAs also went smoothly, as did the by-now routine rendezvous and docking with an Agena which was done &quot; manually &quot; using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed. The climb to a higher orbit, however, was canceled because of a problem with the Agena booster. Many documentaries afterward largely credit the spacewalk innovations, including the underwater training, to Aldrin himself. Gemini 12 was designed to perform rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to conduct three Extravehicular Activity (EVA) operations, to conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise, to perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, and demonstrate an automatic reentry.

Two micrometeorite collection experiments, as well as three space phenomena photography experiments, were not fully completed. [ Reentry ] The capsule was controlled on reentry by computer and splashed down 4.8 kilometers from its target. The Gemini 12 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources; 9,775 personnel, 65 aircraft and 12 ships. [ Insignia ] The patch&apos;s unique orange and black colors are a link to the flight&apos;s original scheduled date close to Halloween. The Roman numeral XII is located at the 12 o&apos;clock position on the face of a clock, with the Gemini spacecraft pointing to it like the hour hand of a clock. This represents the position of Gemini 12 as the last flight of the Gemini program. With the Apollo project following this last flight of the Gemini program, the ultimate objective—the moon—is symbolized by the crescent on the left. [ Spacecraft location ] After several years at the Museum of Transport and Technology, in Auckland, New Zealand, the spacecraft was returned to the United States. It is now on display at the Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois. Lovell and Aldrin were reunited with the spacecraft November 9, 2006 during the opening for Adler&apos;s &quot; Shoot for the Moon &quot; exhibit, almost 40 years after the mission launched. Lovell and Aldrin&apos;s voices are used for the exhibit&apos;s recorded narration.
