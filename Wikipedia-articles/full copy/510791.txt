[ June 2010 ] A cognitive bias describes a replicable pattern in perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.

Thinking and deciding (4th ed.). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. } { Ariely, D. (2008). } { Predictably irrational : The hidden forces that shape our decisions. New York, NY: HarperCollins. } They are the result of distortions in the human mind that always lead to the same pattern of poor judgment, often triggered by a particular situation. Identifying &quot; poor judgment, &quot; or more precisely, a &quot; deviation in judgment, &quot; requires a standard for comparison, i.e. &quot; good judgment &quot;. In scientific investigations of cognitive bias, the source of &quot; good judgment &quot; is that of people outside the situation hypothesized to cause the poor judgment, or, if possible, a set of independently verifiable facts. The existence of most of the particular cognitive biases listed below has been verified empirical ly in psychology experiments. Cognitive biases are influenced by evolution and natural selection pressure. Some are presumably adaptive and beneficial, for example, because they lead to more effective actions in given contexts or enable faster decisions, when faster decisions are of greater value for reproductive success and survival. Others presumably result from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms, i.e. a general fault in human brain structure, from the misapplication of a mechanism that is adaptive (beneficial) under different circumstances, or simply from noisy mental processes. Despite several decades of effort, no comprehensive theory of what creates these biases has emerged. This is why it is not straightforward to group and categorize them, and this results in what has been called &quot; a grab bag of heuristics and biases, with no quantitative psychological theory describing the underlying processes &quot;. { Dougherty, M. R. P., Gettys, C. F., &amp; Ogden, E. E. (1999). MINERVA-DM: A memory processes model for judgments of likelihood. Psychological Review, 106(1), 180–209. } A 2012 Psychological Bulletin article suggested that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same information-theoretic generative mechanism that assumes noisy information processing during storage and retrieval of information in human memory. { Martin Hilbert (2012) &quot; Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making &quot;. Psychological Bulletin, 138(2), 211–237; Also at http://www.martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf } [ Decision-making, belief and behavioral biases ] Many of these biases affect belief formation, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general. They arise as a replicable result to a specific condition: when confronted with a specific situation, the deviation from what is normatively expected can be characterized by: [ Baron 1994 372 ] [ Sanna Lawrence J.

Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 36(3), 406–416. Experimenter&apos;s or Expectation bias – the tendency for experimenters to believe, certify, and publish data that agree with their expectations for the outcome of an experiment, and to disbelieve, discard, or downgrade the corresponding weightings for data that appear to conflict with those expectations. Functional fixedness - limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used Focusing effect – the tendency to place too much importance on one aspect of an event; causes error in accurately predicting the utility of a future outcome. Framing effect – drawing different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented.

Hindsight bias – sometimes called the &quot; I-knew-it-all-along &quot; effect, the tendency to see past events as being predictable at the time those events happened.(sometimes phrased as &quot; Hindsight is 20/20 &quot; ) Hostile media effect – the tendency to see a media report as being biased due to one&apos;s own strong partisan views. Hyperbolic discounting – the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs, where the tendency increases the closer to the present both payoffs are. Illusion of control – the tendency to overestimate one&apos;s degree of influence over other external events.

Defensive attribution hypothesis – defensive attributions are made when individuals witness or learn of a mishap happening to another person. In these situations, attributions of responsibility to the victim or harm-doer for the mishap will depend upon the severity of the outcomes of the mishap and the level of personal and situational similarity between the individual and victim. More responsibility will be attributed to the harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe, and as personal or situational similarity decreases. Dunning–Kruger effect an effect in which incompetent people fail to realise they are incompetent because they lack the skill to distinguish between competence and incompetence Egocentric bias – occurs when people claim more responsibility for themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would. Extrinsic incentives bias – an exception to the fundamental attribution error, when people view others as having (situational) extrinsic motivations and (dispositional) intrinsic motivations for oneself Forer effect (aka Barnum effect) – the tendency to give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. For example, horoscope s. False consensus effect – the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them. Fundamental attribution error – the tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior (see also actor-observer bias, group attribution error, positivity effect, and negativity effect ). Halo effect – the tendency for a person&apos;s positive or negative traits to &quot; spill over &quot; from one area of their personality to another in others&apos; perceptions of them (see also physical attractiveness stereotype ). Illusion of asymmetric insight – people perceive their knowledge of their peers to surpass their peers&apos; knowledge of them. Illusion of external agency – when people view self-generated preferences as instead being caused by insightful, effective and benevolent agents Illusion of transparency – people overestimate others&apos; ability to know them, and they also overestimate their ability to know others. Illusory superiority – overestimating one&apos;s desirable qualities, and underestimating undesirable qualities, relative to other people. (Also known as &quot; Lake Wobegon effect, &quot; &quot; better-than-average effect, &quot; or &quot; superiority bias &quot; ). Ingroup bias – the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups. Just-world phenomenon – the tendency for people to believe that the world is just and therefore people &quot; get what they deserve. &quot; Moral luck – the tendency for people to ascribe greater or lesser moral standing based on the outcome of an event rather than the intention Naive cynicism – expecting more egocentric bias in other than in oneself Outgroup homogeneity bias – individuals see members of their own group as being relatively more varied than members of other groups. Projection bias – the tendency to unconsciously assume that others (or one&apos;s future selves) share one&apos;s current emotional states, thoughts and values. Self-serving bias – the tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests (see also group-serving bias ). System justification – the tendency to defend and bolster the status quo. Existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred, and alternatives disparaged sometimes even at the expense of individual and collective self-interest. (See also status quo bias.) Trait ascription bias – the tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior, and mood while viewing others as much more predictable. Ultimate attribution error – similar to the fundamental attribution error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an entire group instead of the individuals within the group. Worse-than-average effect – a tendency to believe ourselves to be worse than others at tasks which are difficult Kruger, J. (1999). Lake Wobegon be gone! The “below-average effect” and the egocentric nature of comparative ability judgments. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(2) [ Memory errors and biases ] In psychology and cognitive science, a memory bias is a cognitive bias that either enhances or impairs the recall of a memory (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many types of memory bias, including: [ Schacter Daniel L. 1999 The Seven Sins of Memory: Insights From Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience American Psychologist 54 3 182–203 10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182 10199218 ] [ Walker W.

Context effect : that cognition and memory are dependent on context, such that out-of-context memories are more difficult to retrieve than in-context memories (e.g., recall time and accuracy for a work-related memory will be lower at home, and vice versa) Cross-race effect : the tendency for people of one race to have difficulty identifying members of a race other than their own Cryptomnesia : a form of misattribution where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory. Egocentric bias : recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g., remembering one&apos;s exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a caught fish as bigger than it really was Fading affect bias: a bias in which the emotion associated with unpleasant memories fades more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events. False memory – a form of misattribution where imagination is mistaken for a memory. Generation effect (Self-generation effect): that self-generated information is remembered best. For instance, people are better able to recall memories of statements that they have generated than similar statements generated by others. Google effect : the tendency to forget information that can be easily found online. Hindsight bias : the inclination to see past events as being predictable; also called the &quot; I-knew-it-all-along &quot; effect. Humor effect: that humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor. Illusion-of-truth effect: that people are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. In other words, a person is more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one. Illusory correlation – inaccurately remembering a relationship between two events. Fiedler, K. (1991). The tricky nature of skewed frequency tables: An information loss account of distinctiveness-based illusory correlations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60(1), 24-36. Lag effect: see spacing effect Leveling and Sharpening: memory distortions introduced by the loss of details in a recollection over time, often concurrent with sharpening or selective recollection of certain details that take on exaggerated significance in relation to the details or aspects of the experience lost through leveling. Both biases may be reinforced over time, and by repeated recollection or re-telling of a memory. Levels-of-processing effect : that different methods of encoding information into memory have different levels of effectiveness (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972). List-length effect : a smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well. Misinformation effect : that misinformation affects people&apos;s reports of their own memory. Misattribution: when information is retained in memory but the source of the memory is forgotten. One of Schacter&apos;s (1999) Seven Sins of Memory, Misattribution was divided into Source Confusion, Cryptomnesia and False Recall/False Recognition. Modality effect : that memory recall is higher for the last items of a list when the list items were received via speech than when they were received via writing. Mood congruent memory bias: the improved recall of information congruent with one&apos;s current mood. Next-in-line effect: that a person in a group has diminished recall for the words of others who spoke immediately before or after this person. Osborn effect: that being intoxicated with a mind-altering substance makes it harder to retrieve motor patterns from the Basal Ganglion. (e.g., Shushaka, 1958). Part-list cueing effect : that being shown some items from a list makes it harder to retrieve the other items (e.g., Slamecka, 1968). Peak-end rule : that people seem to perceive not the sum of an experience but the average of how it was at its peak (e.g. pleasant or unpleasant) and how it ended. Persistence: the unwanted recurrence of memories of a traumatic event. Picture superiority effect : that concepts are much more likely to be remembered experientially if they are presented in picture form than if they are presented in word form. Placement bias – tendency to remember ourselves to be better than others at tasks at which we rate ourselves above average (also Illusory superiority or Better-than-average effect ) Kruger, J., &amp; Dunning, D. (1999). Unskilled and unaware of it: How difficulties in recognizing one’s own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(6), 1121-1134. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121 and tendency to remember ourselves to be worse than others at tasks at which we rate ourselves below average (also Worse-than-average effect Positivity effect : that older adults favor positive over negative information in their memories. Primacy effect, Recency effect &amp; Serial position effect : that items near the end of a list are the easiest to recall, followed by the items at the beginning of a list; items in the middle are the least likely to be remembered. Processing difficulty effect Reminiscence bump : the recalling of more personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than personal events from other lifetime periods (Rubin, Wetzler &amp; Nebes, 1986; Rubin, Rahhal &amp; Poon, 1998). Rosy retrospection : the remembering of the past as having been better than it really was. Self-relevance effect: that memories relating to the self are better recalled than similar information relating to others. Self-serving bias – perceiving oneself responsible for desirable outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones. Source Confusion: misattributing the source of a memory, e.g. misremembering that one saw an event personally when actually it was seen on television. Spacing effect : that information is better recalled if exposure to it is repeated over a longer span of time. Stereotypical bias: memory distorted towards stereotypes (e.g. racial or gender), e.g. &quot; black-sounding &quot; names being misremembered as names of criminals. Suffix effect: the weakening of the recency effect in the case that an item is appended to the list that the subject is not required to recall (Morton, Crowder &amp; Prussin, 1971). Suggestibility : a form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory. Subadditivity effect – the tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components. Tversky, A., &amp; Koehler, D. J. (1994). Support theory: A nonextensional representation of subjective probability. Psychological Review, 101(4), 547-567. Telescoping effect : the tendency to displace recent events backward in time and remote events forward in time, so that recent events appear more remote, and remote events, more recent. Testing effect : that frequent testing of material that has been committed to memory improves memory recall. Tip of the tongue phenomenon: when a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought an instance of &quot; blocking &quot; where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other. Verbatim effect: that the &quot; gist &quot; of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording (Poppenk, Walia, Joanisse, Danckert, &amp; Köhler, 2006). Von Restorff effect : that an item that sticks out is more likely to be remembered than other items (von Restorff, 1933). Zeigarnik effect : that uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.
