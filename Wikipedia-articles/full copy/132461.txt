[ Paper mill ] The major industry in Johnsonburg is paper, with the largest mill owned by the Domtar Corporation. It was built more than a century ago, originally owned by Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post. By 1950, it was believed to be the largest coated paper mill in the world. [ Paper Mill paperage.com http://www.paperage.com/02_2001willamette.html ] By the 1960s, Curtis Publishing was questioning its ownership of the mill due to financial concerns, and by 1969, had closed down the Johnsonburg mill. Six months later, a group of investors, including industrialist George S. Petty, formed a group called Penntech Papers, purchased the mill assets, and continued it in operation for the next 20 years. In 1990, Penntech sold the mill to Willamette Industries, the company that would later be acquired by Weyerhaeuser in February 2002 in a hostile takeover and then in 2007 was acquired by Domtar.
