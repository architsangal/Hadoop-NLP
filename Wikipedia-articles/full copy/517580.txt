It is located [ 6.4 km mi on ] from the center of Paris. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. Its post code is 93500. Pantin was once the site of Motobecane &apos;s operations. Pantin was portrayed in the award-winning French movie So Long, Stooge (French title: Tchao Pantin) (1983), starring French comedian Coluche. [ Geography ] Pantin borders the Paris inner ring road (périphérique) and is traversed by national routes N2 and N3, as well as the Paris-Strasbourg railway line and the Ourcq canal. [ Name ] The name Pantin was recorded for the first time in 1067 as Pentini, perhaps from the Roman patronym Pentinus, a variant of Pantaenus or Repentinus, but this etymology is not certain. [ History ] On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, a small part of the commune of Pantin was annexed to Paris. On 24 July 1867, a part of the territory of Pantin was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Romainville and a part of the territory of Bagnolet to create the commune of Les Lilas. By 1875, the Ourcq canal and new railway lines served to divide the town into two parts—the &quot; Village &quot; and the &quot; Quatre Chemins &quot;. [ Heraldry ] [ Blason_ville_fr_Pantin_(Seine-Saint-Denis).svg arms of Pantin The arms of Pantin are blazoned : Argent a cross between four mullets pierced all gules. Hardy Pantin en avant(forward Hardy Pantin) ] [ Future ] The recent construction of a science park along the Bassin de la Villette on the former site of city abattoirs has improved pedestrian access to Paris, as well as encouraging urban regeneration in Pantin itself. A key policy discussed since the 2008 mayoral election has been the possibility of integrating the ten banlieue towns of Bagnolet, Les Lilas, Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, Romainville, Pantin, Noisy-le-Sec, Montreuil, Bobigny, Bondy and Rosny-sous-Bois into an &quot; intercommune &quot; of around 440,000 people. This new municipality could be created as early as January 2010.
