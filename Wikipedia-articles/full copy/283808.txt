Colding &apos;s (1815–1888) neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the brilliant contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr (1885–1962) indicate the range of Danish scientific achievement. The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the short stories of Karen Blixen (penname Isak Dinesen, (1885–1962), the plays of Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), the modern authors such as Herman Bang and Nobel laureate Henrik Pontoppidan and the dense, aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein (1905–1996), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of Carl Nielsen (1865–1931). From the mid 1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars Von Trier. Indeed, the country has always had a strong tradition of movie making and Carl Theodor Dreyer is recognised as having been one of the world&apos;s greatest film directors. [ Hygge ] Danish Christmas tree with homemade decorations One of the fundamental aspects of Danish culture is &quot; hygge &quot; : relaxing with good friends or loved ones, often while enjoying good food and something to drink or creating a more friendly atmosphere by lighting a few candles. Christmas time, when loved ones sit close together on a cold rainy night, is a true moment of hygge, as is grilling a pølse (Danish sausage) and drinking an Øl (Danish beer) on a long summer evening. { The Danish Art of Hygge from Visit Denmark. Retrieved 4 December 2008. } [ Danish Christmas ] [ Jul (Denmark) ] The Danish word for the Christmas holiday is Jul, from the Old Norse jól, the term for &quot; midwinter &quot;, itself cognate with the English word, yule. { Den Store Danske, Jul (in Danish). Retrieved 31 July 2009. } Midwinter celebrations were an important part of Scandinavian culture since prehistoric times, and the term was retained to refer to &quot; Christmas &quot; after Christianization. { Iulia Kolesnicov, &quot; Danish Christmas &quot;, ForeignersIndenmark.dk. Retrieved 29 November 2011. } In many countries Christmas is celebrated on the 25th of December, but in Denmark, and in the other Scandinavian countries, the most important day for celebrations is Christmas Eve on the 24th when the family comes together. The morning can be spent in various ways but most often it is the time when preparations are made for the evening. { Danish Christmas traditions from VisitDenmark. Retrieved 25 July 2009. } Juleaften (Danish for Christmas Eve) or Yule Eve starts around 6 p.m. when a traditional dinner is served. The menu is: White (boiled) and sugar-browned potatoes, red cabbage and brown sauce (gravy) accompanying either roast duck or goose depending on the size of the family. Some families enjoy a special Danish version of roast pork, called flæskesteg complete with crackling or maybe a special sausage called medisterpølse. For dessert, ris á l&apos;amande is served, a name that suggests a French origin - but it is Danish. Sometimes it is confused with rice pudding, since they share the main ingredient (rice). Ris á l&apos;amande needs to be prepared a day in advance, and then on serving, chopped almond and vanilla can be added, among other things. It is served cold, with hot cherry sauce. An unchopped almond can also be added and hidden in the dessert. The person who finds it in his portion receives a small prize. Afterwards, the candles on the Christmas tree are lit and the family dance around it singing Christmas songs and carols and subsequently exchange presents. [ Folklore ] [ Danish folklore ] Frederik Christian Lund: Girl from Skovshoved Danish folklore is made up of folk tales, legend s, songs, music, dancing, popular beliefs and traditions, mostly comuminicated by the inhabitants of towns and villages across the country. Many of these were passed on from generation to generation by word of mouth. As in neighbouring countries, interest in folklore grew with an emerging feeling of national consciousness in 19th century Denmark. Researchers travelled across the country collecting innummerable folktales, songs and sayings while observing traditional dress in the various regions. Folklore today is part of the national heritage, represented in particular by national and local traditions, songs, folk dances and literature. Today&apos;s folk dancing in Denmark dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, when there was renewed interest in the national heritage. A number of groups began to revive the music, dances and costumes of past generations. In 1901, the Society for the Promotion of Danish Folk Dancing (Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme) was founded in Copenhagen, leading to local dancing societies throughout the country. { &quot; Dans &quot;, Dansk Folkemindesamlings arkiv. Retrieved 24 November 2011. } Today there are some over 12,000 folk dancers belonging to 219 local clubs which provide courses in music, dancing and dressmaking. { &quot; National dress and folk dancing &quot;, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark. Retrieved 22 November 2011. } { &quot; The National Association of Danish Folk Dancers &quot;, Landsforeningen Danske Folkedansere. Retrieved 22 November 2011. } The traditional costumes of Denmark, though varying from region to region, date back roughly to the period between 1750 and 1900 when clothes were often home-made from yarn spun from wool or flax. In rural communities, the fabrication of garments for both family members and servants was an important part of everyday life. The artist Frederik Christian Lund, who had travelled across Denmark as a soldier in the First Schleswig War, took an interest in sketching people in local costumes in various parts of the country. He completed his collection of 31 coloured sketches in 1864, publishing them as coloured lithographs in Danske Nationaldragter (Danish National Costumes). { Frits Lilbæk, &quot; Historiemaler F C Lund: Danske Nationaldragter &quot;. Retrieved 24 November 2011. } Numerous Danish folktales contain mythical figures such as troll s, elves, goblin s, and wight s as well as figures borrowed from Nordic mythology. The nisse is a particularly well-known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian times when it was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed red cap, he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The nisse would be helpful if treated properly, for instance by giving him a bowl of porridge with a clump of butter at night, but, failing such treatment, he could become quite troublesome. { &quot; Nisse &quot;, Den Store Danske, Retrieved 23 November 2011. } { &quot; Julenissen &quot;, Den Store Danske.

Right: Egg, prawns, lemon and mayonnaise on white bread. } Perhaps the most typically Danish contribution to the meals of the day is the traditional lunch or smørrebrød consisting of open sandwiches, usually on thinly sliced rye bread. The meal usually begins with fish such as marinated herring, smoked eel, crab, or breaded plaice filets with remoulade and moves on with slices of roast pork or beef, frikadeller (meatballs), hams and liver paté. The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsely, remoulade and mayonnaise. { Danish Culture from PortlandDanes.org. Retrieved 4 December 2008. } The meal is often accompanied by beer, sometimes also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit. In the evening, hot meals are usually served. Traditional dishes include fried fish, roast pork with red cabbage (perhaps the national dish), pot-roasted chicken, or pork chops. Game is sometimes served in the autumn. Steaks are now becoming increasingly popular. A popular traditional Danish dessert, especially around Christmas, consists of æbleskiver, rather like small pancake doughnuts which are fried in butter in a special pan and are served hot with jam and sugar. Traditionally, they were made with small pieces of apple in the middle which is why the are called æbleskiver, literally &quot; apple slices &quot;. In recent years, development of the New Danish cuisine based on the rediscovery of local ingredients presented in interesting new recipes has led to a significant number of new, highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the provinces, several with Michelin stars. This in turn has led to new developments in food production with a series of new products based on organic farming. { &quot; Denmark Special &quot;, &apos;&apos;Food &amp; design, #9 2011.

There are lots of National and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark. They are all marked and include rest areas with benches and other necessities. [ Fine arts ] [ Painting ] { Christen Købke, 1836 } [ Danish art ] Danish painting goes back hundreds of years. Earlier work is often manifested in churches, for example in the form of frescos such as those from the 16th century artist known as the Elmelunde Master. But it was not until the beginning of the 19th century that the Golden Age of Danish Painting emerged with a marked increase in truly Danish art inspired by the country itself with its lifestyle and traditions. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was an important influence on the following generation’s study of nature, in which landscape painting came to the fore. He had many successful students, including Wilhelm Bendz (1804–1832), Christen Købke (1810–48), Martinus Rørbye (1803–1848), Constantin Hansen (1804–1880), Jørgen Roed (1808–1888), Wilhelm Marstrand (1810–1873), Constantin Hansen (1804–80), C.A. Jensen (1792–1870), J.Th. Lundbye (1818–1848), and P.C. Skovgaard (1817–1875). { Visual Arts from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Denmark. Retrieved 4 December 2008. } Some years later, a number of painters including P.S. Krøyer (1851–1909) and Michael (1849–1927) and Anna Ancher (1859–1935) moved to Skagen in the far north of Jutland to paint the natural surroundings and local people. In due course, the town developed into an artists&apos; colony. A little later, a similar phenomenon developed on Funen with artists such as Johannes Larsen (1867–1961). Vilhelm Hammershoi is an important painter too. Collections of modern art enjoy unusually attractive settings at the Louisiana Museum north of Copenhagen, at the North Jutland Art Museum in Aalborg and at the ARoS art museum in Aarhus. The National Museum of Art and the Glyptotek, both in Copenhagen, contain treasures of Danish and international art. { Hans Christian Andersen } [ Literature ] [ Danish literature ] The principal contributors to Danish literature are undoubtedly Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), storyteller Karen Blixen (1885–1962), playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), and modern authors such as Henrik Pontoppidan and Herman Bang. Among today&apos;s Danish writers, probably the best-known to international readers is Peter Høeg ( Smilla&apos;s Sense of Snow; Borderliners ). Benny Andersen writes poems, short stories, and music. Poems by both writers have been translated into English by the Curbstone Press. Klaus Rifbjerg has published over 100 novels as well as poetry, short stories and TV plays. Two of his works have been translated into English: Witness to the Future and War. Kirsten Thorup &apos;s novel Baby, winner of the 1980 Pegasus Prize, is published in English by the University of Louisiana Press. The psychological thrillers of Anders Bodelsen also appear in English as do some of the novels of intrigue by Leif Davidsen. Suzanne Brøgger and Vita Andersen focus largely on the changing roles of women in society. [ Architecture ] [ Architecture of Denmark ] { Grundtvig&apos;s Church, Copenhagen } The architecture of Denmark has its origins in the Viking period but became recognizable in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. Inspired by French castles and with the assistance of Dutch designers, architecture during the Renaissance flourished with magnificent royal palaces. Neoclassicism came to Denmark from France and, in the 19th century, slowly merged into the National Romantic style when Danish designers came into their own. It was, however, not until the last half of the 20th century that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class designers such as Johann Otto von Spreckelsen who designed the Grande Arche in Paris. Internationally, perhaps the most celebrated of all is the architect who designed the iconic Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon, but within Danish borders, it is the architect Arne Jacobsen who is perhaps held in highest esteem for developing the &apos; Danish Modern &apos; style and furniture/interior design, such as the now world-famous and much sought-after Swan and Egg chairs. { &apos;Ægget&apos; fejrer 50 år med en særlig stol. Politiken 9. jan 2008 kl. 07:41. link title } A new wave of young Danish architects are rising into international prominence, like Bjarke Ingels with works such as the Danish National Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 Expo. [ Photography ] [ Photography in Denmark ] { Peter Faber : } { Ulfeldts Plads, Copenhagen (1840).

Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century while both artistic and press photographers have since made internationally recognised contributions. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world. { Contemporary Danish Photography.

The name of Georg Jensen (1866–1935) is known the world over for modern design in silver. The Danish Porcelain Factory ( &quot; Royal Copenhagen &quot; ), including Bing &amp; Grøndahl, is famous for the quality of its porcelain and ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen, Poul Kjærholm, Hans Wegner, Poul Henningsen and Arne Jacobsen. The Danish Museum of Art &amp; Design in Copenhagen exhibits the best in Danish design. [ Performing arts ] { Copenhagen Opera House } [ Music ] [ Music of Denmark ] Denmark&apos;s most famous composer is Carl Nielsen who is best known outside of Denmark for his six symphonies, but whose medlodies for popular songs are cherished among Danes. Other well-known pieces of his are the incidental music for Adam Oehlenschläger &apos;s drama Aladdin (Nielsen), the operas Saul og David and Maskarade, the concertos for flute, violin, and clarinet, the Wind Quintet, and the Helios Overture, which depicts the passage of the sun in the sky from dawn to nightfall. The Royal Danish Ballet specializes in the work of Danish choreographer August Bournonville (1805–79). Hans Abrahamsen, Per Nørgård and Poul Ruders are successful composers of contemporary classical music. Danish interest in classical music is exemplified by the prestigious Opera House completed in 2000. Strategically set on Copenhagen&apos;s waterfront, it has presented operas and musicals to full houses ever since its opening. Danes have also distinguished themselves in rhythmical music, with world famous jazz musicians such as Svend Asmussen, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Niels Lan Doky and Marilyn Mazur. The Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired an international reputation. The modern pop and rock scene has produced some bands of note (for example, Laid Back, Michael leanrs to Rock, D-A-D, Aqua and Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, The Raveonettes, Kashmir, Junior Senior and Mew ). Danish musicians and solo performers international reputation on the Hard Rock scene include and King Diamond and Mike Tramp and particularly Lars Ulrich of Metallica, the first Dane in the Rock and Roll hall of Fame. [ Cinema ] [ Cinema of Denmark ] In recent years, Danish films have gained increasing recognition at home and abroad. Gabriel Axel &apos;s film based on Karen Blixen&apos;s Babette&apos;s Feast was awarded an Oscar in 1987. In 1988, Bille August also received an Oscar with Pelle the Conqueror based on the novel by Martin Andersen Nexø. In 1992, August went on to win the Palme d&apos;Or in Cannes with Ingmar Bergman &apos;s autobiography, The Best Intentions. Since the late 1990s, the Dogme movement and figures such as Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, Søren Kragh-Jacobsen and Lone Scherfig have continued to contribute to the international success of Danish cinema. { Cinema fact sheet from Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.

[ Theatre ] [ Theatre in Denmark ] The Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen The theatre in Denmark continues to thrive thanks to the many theatres in Copenhagen and across the country which put on a wide variety of Danish and foreign performances. The flagship Royal Danish Theatre presents drama, opera, ballet and music. Since the 18th century, Danish playwrights have been successful in attracting wide public interest. Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) is considered by many to be the founder of the Danish theatre. Satirical comedies such as Jean de France and Jeppe of the Hill are still performed today. { Theatre from Denmark.dk. Retrieved 22 December 2008. } Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850) introduced romanticism to the Danish theatre. Especially successful was his Earl Hakon the Mighty, premiered in 1808. The Norwegian Henrik Ibsen (1828–1906) also travelled to Copenhagen where he produced numerous plays such as A Doll’s House (1879). { Theatre from Golden Days in Copenhagen. Retrieved 22 December 2008. } In recent years, there has been something of a revival in Danish theatre. Many new playwrights and producers have appeared including Astrid Saalbach (b.1955), winner of the Nordic Drama Award in 2004, and Peter Asmussen (b.1957), who wrote the film script for Lars von Trier &apos;s Breaking the Waves. Danish musicals have also been a particularly successful feature of the modern theatre. Knud Christensen, commonly known as Sebastian, was particularly successful with Cyrano (1992), based on Rostand ’s play and Klokkeren fra Notre Dame (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) (2001). Bent Fabricius-Bjerre &apos;s musical Matador (2007) is based on a successful TV series of the same name. { Matador-stjerner er enige: Det betød alt from Avisen.dk (in Danish). Retrieved 23 December 2008. } Another popular Danish theatrical tradition is the revue which has been thriving since the mid 19th century. Today revues are performed every summer to full houses in theatres across Denmark, poking fun at the politics of the day and even the monarchy. Among the most popular are Circusrevyen in Copenhagen with Lisbet Dahl, and the Nykøbing Revy directed by Flemming Krøll in Nykøbing Falster. { &quot; Danmark - revy &quot;, Den store Danske.

The LBL (Landsforeningen for Bøsser og Lesbiske, a national organisation for gay men and lesbians) was established in 1948, and in 1989 Denmark became the first country in Europe to offer gay partners most of the same legal rights as heterosexual couples. Adoption laws are liberal compared to other Western countries and public displays of affection between people of the same sex are unlikely to provoke ire. Lesbians wishing to have access to artificial insemination do not provoke the sort of scandals that can occur in other societies, { Gay Copenhagen - Tolerant and Relaxed from Copenhagen Lodgings.
