[ the bird Prion (bird) the theoretical subatomic particle Preon ] [ 046 ] A prion [ Pronunciation prion.ogg ˈ p r iː ɒ n ] [ Prion ] is an infectious agent composed of protein in a misfolded form. [ Ryan KJ, Ray CG, et al Sherris Medical Microbiology 4th McGraw Hill 2004 0-8385-8529-9 624–8 ] This is in contrast to all other known infectious agents ( virus / bacteria / fungus / parasite ) which must contain nucleic acid s (either DNA, RNA, or both). The word prion, coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner, is derived from the words protein and infection. [ http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/prusiner-autobio.html Stanley B. Prusiner  — Autobiography NobelPrize.org 2007-01-02 ] Prions are responsible for the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in a variety of mammal s, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as &quot; mad cow disease &quot; ) in cattle and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. All known prion diseases affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue and all are currently untreatable and universally fatal. [ Prusiner SB Prions Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 95 23 13363–83 1998 November 9811807 33918 10.1073/pnas.95.23.13363 http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D9811807 2010-02-28 ] Prions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state. When a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form; the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more protein into prion form. These newly formed prions can then go on to convert more proteins themselves; this triggers a chain reaction that produces large amounts of the prion form. [ Aguzzi A Unraveling prion strains with cell biology and organic chemistry Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105 1 11–2 2008 January 18172195 2224168 10.1073/pnas.0710824105 http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D18172195 2010-02-28 ] All known prions induce the formation of an amyloid fold, in which the protein polymerises into an aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheet s. Amyloid aggregates are fibrils, growing at their ends, and replicating when breakage causes two growing ends to become four growing ends. The incubation period of prion diseases is determined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication, which is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates. [ 10.1016/S0301-4622(99)00016-2 Masel J, Jansen VAA, Nowak MA Quantifying the kinetic parameters of prion replication Biophysical Chemistry 77 2–3 139–152 1999 March 10326247 ] (Note that the propagation of the prion depends on the presence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding; animals which do not express the normal form of the prion protein cannot develop or transmit the disease.) This altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. [ Christopher M. Dobson The structural basis of protein folding and its links with human disease Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences 356 1406 133–45 2001 February 11260793 1088418 10.1098/rstb.2000.0758 http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/356/1406/133.full.pdf%2Bhtml?sid%3Db4dec236-78b0-44b9-8d64-3b37b1ddc0c9 pdf 2011-11-09 ] This structural stability means that prions are resistant to denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prions come in different strains, each with a slightly different structure, and most of the time, strains breed true. Prion replication is nevertheless subject to occasional epimutation and then natural selection just like other forms of replication. [ Li J, Browning S, Mahal SP, Oelschlegel AM, Weissmann C Darwinian evolution of prions in cell culture Science 327 5967 869–72 2010 February 20044542 2848070 10.1126/science.1183218 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D20044542 2010-02-28 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8435320.stm ] However, the number of possible distinct prion strains is likely far smaller than the number of possible DNA sequences, so evolution takes place within a limited space. All known mammalian prion diseases are caused by the so-called prion protein, PrP. The endogenous, properly folded, form is denoted PrP C (for C&apos;ommon or C&apos;ellular) while the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrP Sc (for &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Sc&apos;&apos;&apos;rapie&apos;&apos;, after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) [ Laurén J, Gimbel DA, Nygaard HB, Gilbert JW, Strittmatter SM Cellular prion protein mediates impairment of synaptic plasticity by amyloid-beta oligomers Nature 457 7233 1128–32 2009 February 19242475 2748841 10.1038/nature07761 ] The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrP C, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Interestingly, fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.

[ Alper T, Cramp WA, Haig DA, Clarke MC Does the agent of scrapie replicate without nucleic acid? Nature 214 5090 764–6 1967 May 4963878 10.1038/214764a0 ] [ Griffith JS Self-replication and scrapie Nature 215 5105 1043–4 1967 September 4964084 10.1038/2151043a0 ] Their theory was developed to explain the discovery that the mysterious infectious agent causing the diseases scrapie and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease resisted ionizing radiation. A single ionizing &quot; hit &quot; normally destroys an entire infectious particle, and the dose needed to hit half the particles depends on the size of the particles. The data suggested that the infectious agent was too small to be a virus. Francis Crick recognized the potential importance of the Griffith protein-only hypothesis for scrapie propagation in the second edition of his &quot; Central dogma of molecular biology &quot; : while asserting that the flow of sequence information from protein to protein, or from protein to RNA and DNA was &quot; precluded &quot;, he noted that Griffith&apos;s hypothesis was a potential contradiction (although it was not so promoted by Griffith). [ Crick F Central dogma of molecular biology Nature 227 5258 561–3 1970 August 4913914 10.1038/227561a0 1970Natur.227..561C ] The revised hypothesis was later formulated, in part, to accommodate discovery of reverse transcription by Howard Temin and David Baltimore. Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco announced in 1982 that his team had purified the hypothetical infectious prion, and that the infectious agent consisted mainly of a specific protein  – though they did not manage to isolate the protein until two years after Prusiner&apos;s announcement. [ Taubes Gary Gary Taubes The game of name is fame. But is it science? Discover 7 12 28–41 December 1986 ] Prusiner coined the word &quot; prion &quot; as a name for the infectious agent. While the infectious agent was named a prion, the specific protein that the prion was composed of is also known as the Prion Protein (PrP), though this protein may occur both in infectious and non-infectious forms. Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his research into prions. [ http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1997 2010-02-28 NobelPrize.org ] [ Structure ] [ PrP structure ] [ Isoforms ] The protein that prions are made of (PrP) is found throughout the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to protease s, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrP C, while the infectious form is called PrP Sc  — the C refers to &apos;cellular&apos; or &apos;common&apos; PrP, while the Sc refers to &apos; scrapie &apos;, a prion disease occurring in sheep. [ Priola SA, Chesebro B, Caughey B Biomedicine. A view from the top--prion diseases from 10,000 feet Science 300 5621 917–9 2003 May 12738843 10.1126/science.1085920 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D12738843 2010-02-28 ] While PrP C is structurally well-defined, PrP Sc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, and their relationship to the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear. [ PrP C ] PrP C is a normal protein found on the membranes of cells. It has 209 amino acid s (in humans), one disulfide bond, a molecular mass of 35-36 kDa and a mainly alpha-helical structure. Several topological forms exist; one cell surface form anchored via glycolipid and two transmembrane forms. [ Hegde RS, Mastrianni JA, Scott MR, et al. A transmembrane form of the prion protein in neurodegenerative disease Science 279 5352 827–34 1998 February 9452375 10.1126/science.279.5352.827 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D9452375 2010-02-28 ] The normal protein is not sedimentable; meaning it cannot be separated by centrifuging techniques. [ Krull, Ira S.; Brian K. Nunnally Prions and mad cow disease Marcel Dekker New York, N.Y 2004 6 0-8247-4083-1 http://books.google.com/?id%3DWjeuaHopV5UC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA6%26amp%3Bdq%3DPrions%2Band%2Bmad%2Bcow%2Bdisease%2Bsedimentable%26amp%3Bcd%3D1#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D 2010-02-28 ] Its function is a complex issue that continues to be investigated. PrP C binds copper (II) ion s with high affinity. [ Brown DR, Qin K, Herms JW, et al. The cellular prion protein binds copper in vivo Nature 390 6661 684–7 1997 9414160 10.1038/37783 ] The significance of this finding is not clear, but it presumably relates to PrP structure or function. PrP C is readily digested by proteinase K and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycolipid anchor. [ Weissmann C The state of the prion Nature Reviews. Microbiology 2 11 861–71 2004 November 15494743 10.1038/nrmicro1025 ] PrP has been reported to play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling in vivo, and may therefore be involved in cell-cell communication in the brain. [ Málaga-Trillo E, Solis GP, Schrock Y, et al.

Although the exact 3D structure of PrP Sc is not known, it has a higher proportion of β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. [ Pan KM, Baldwin M, Nguyen J, et al. Conversion of alpha-helices into beta-sheets features in the formation of the scrapie prion proteins Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 90 23 10962–6 1993 December 7902575 47901 10.1073/pnas.90.23.10962 ] Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear if these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side effect of the underlying disease process. { Baker, Harry F., and Rosalind M. Ridley, eds. Prion diseases. Totowa, N.J: Humana, 1996 } The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrP Sc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible. In a different prion, sup35p was shown to be able to be incorporated into existing aggregations even when three of the five oligopeptide repeats normally present were deleted. { http://www.nature.com/emboj/journal/v20/n9/full/7593711a.html } [ Prion replication mechanism ] Heterodimer model of prion propagation Fibril model of prion propagation. The first hypothesis that tried to explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the heterodimer model. [ Cohen FE, Pan KM, Huang Z, Baldwin M, Fletterick RJ, Prusiner SB Structural clues to prion replication Science 265 5178 530–531 1994 7909169 10.1126/science.7909169 ] This model assumed that a single PrP Sc molecule binds to a single PrP C molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrP Sc. The two PrP Sc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more PrP C. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrP Sc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing the rate of the conversion reaction by a factor of around 10 15. [ Eigen M Prionics or the kinetic basis of prion diseases Biophysical Chemistry 63 1 A1–18 1996 8981746 10.1016/S0301-4622(96)02250-8 ] This problem does not arise if PrP Sc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrP Sc has never been isolated. An alternative model assumes that PrP Sc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrP C and convert it into PrP Sc. If this were all, then the quantity of prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrP Sc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease.

The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrP C concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins. [ 10.1126/science.1178250 Knowles TPJ, Waudby CA, Devlin GL, Cohen SIA, Aguzzi A, Vendruscolo M, Terentjev EM, Welland ME, Dobson CM An Analytical Solution to the Kinetics of Breakable Filament Assembly Science 326 5959 1533–1537 2009 20007899 ] The mechanism of prion replication has implications for designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug does not need to eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that the most effective way to achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.

However, the physiological function of the prion protein remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In recent research done in mice, it was found that the cleavage of prions in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann Cells and that the lack of prions caused demyelination in those cells.

One idea, the &quot; Protein X &quot; hypothesis, is that an as-yet unidentified cellular protein (Protein X) enables the conversion of PrP C to PrP Sc by bringing a molecule of each of the two together into a complex.

It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals. [ Johnson CJ, Pedersen JA, Chappell RJ, McKenzie D, Aiken JM Oral transmissibility of prion disease is enhanced by binding to soil particles PLoS Pathogens 3 7 e93 2007 July 17616973 1904474 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030093 http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030093 2010-02-28 ] A University of California research team, led by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner, has proven that infection can occur from prions in manure.

It was reported in January 2011 that researchers had discovered prions spreading through airborne transmission on aerosol particles, in an animal testing experiment focusing on scrapie infection in laboratory mice. Preliminary evidence supporting the notion that prions can be transmitted through use of urine-derived human menopausal gonadotropin, administered for the treatment of infertility, was published in 2011. [ Sterilization ] Infectious particles possessing nucleic acid are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by their effect on normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions therefore involves the denaturation of the protein to a state where the molecule is no longer able to induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. Prions are generally quite resistant to protease s, heat, radiation, and formalin treatments, [ Qin K, O&apos;Donnell M, Zhao RY Doppel: more rival than double to prion Neuroscience 141 1 1–8 2006 August 16781817 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.057 http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-4522%2806%2900510-0 2010-02-28 ] although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure.

[ Debate ] Whether prions are the agent which causes disease or merely a symptom caused by a different agent is still debated by a minority of researchers. The following sections describe several hypotheses: some pertain to the composition of the infectious agent (protein-only, protein with other components, virus, or other), while others pertain to its mechanism of reproduction. [ Protein-only hypothesis ] Prior to the discovery of prions, it was thought that all pathogen s used nucleic acid s to direct their replication. The &quot; protein-only hypothesis &quot; states that a protein structure can replicate without the use of nucleic acid. This was initially controversial as it contradicts the so-called &quot; central dogma of molecular biology &quot;, which describes nucleic acid as the central form of replicative information. Evidence in favor of a protein-only hypothesis includes: No virus particles, bacteria, or fungi have been conclusively associated with prion diseases, although Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been known to be associated with infectious, yet non-lethal prions, such as Sup35p. No nucleic acid has been conclusively associated with infectivity; agent is resistant to ultraviolet radiation. No immune response to infection. PrP Sc experimentally transmitted between one species and another results in PrP Sc with the amino-acid sequence of the recipient species, suggesting that replication of the donor agent does not occur. Familial prion disease occurs in families with a mutation in the PrP gene, and mice with PrP mutations develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented. Animals lacking PrP C do not contract prion disease. Infectious prions can be formed de novo from purified non-infectious components, in the absence of gene-coding nucleic acids. [ Genetic factors ] A gene for the normal protein has been identified: the PRNP gene. [ Oesch B, Westaway D, Wälchli M, et al. A cellular gene encodes scrapie PrP 27-30 protein Cell 40 4 735–46 1985 April 2859120 10.1016/0092-8674(85)90333-2 http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0092-8674%2885%2990333-2 2010-02-28 ] In all inherited cases of prion disease, there is a mutation in the PRNP gene. Many different PRNP mutations have been identified and these proteins are more likely to fold into abnormal prion. [ Goldmann W PrP genetics in ruminant transmissible spongiform encephalopathies Veterinary Research 39 4 30 2008 18284908 10.1051/vetres:2008010 http://publications.edpsciences.org/10.1051/vetres%3A2008010 2010-03-02 ] Although this discovery puts a hole in the general prion hypothesis, that prions can only aggregate proteins of identical amino acid make up. These mutations can occur throughout the gene. Some mutations involve expansion of the octapeptide repeat region at the N-terminal of PrP. Other mutations that have been identified as a cause of inherited prion disease occur at positions 102, 117 &amp; 198 (GSS), 178, 200, 210 &amp; 232 (CJD) and 178 ( Fatal Familial Insomnia, FFI). The cause of prion disease can be sporadic, genetic, and infectious, or a combination of these factors.

[ Multi-component hypothesis ] In 2007, biochemist Surachai Supattapone and his colleagues at Dartmouth College produced purified infectious prions de novo from defined components (PrP C, co-purified lipids, and a synthetic polyanionic molecule). [ Deleault NR, Harris BT, Rees JR, Supattapone S Formation of native prions from minimal components in vitro Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104 23 9741–6 2007 June 17535913 1887554 10.1073/pnas.0702662104 http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D17535913 2010-02-28 ] These researchers also showed that the polyanionic molecule required for prion formation was selectively incorporated into high-affinity complexes with PrP molecules, leading them to hypothesize that infectious prions may be composed of multiple host components, including PrP, lipid, and polyanionic molecules, rather than PrP Sc alone. [ Geoghegan JC, Valdes PA, Orem NR, et al.

Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrP C in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease associated PrP Sc form as the cause of brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrP Sc due to sequestration of PrP C -associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrP Sc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrP C -metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrP C -metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrP C to a PrP Sc -like form. [ Singh N et al. 2010 Prion Protein and Metal Interaction: Physiological and Pathological Implications The Prion Protein Savanna Press 978-0-9543335-2-2 ] [ Viral hypothesis ] The protein-only hypothesis has been criticised by those who feel that the simplest explanation of the evidence to date is viral.

In January 2007, she and her colleagues published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.

Many TSEs, including scrapie and BSE, show strains with specific and distinct biological properties, a feature which supporters of the virion hypothesis feel is not explained by prions. Evidence in favor of a viral hypothesis includes: [ Prion Disease Baker &amp; Ridley Humana Press 1996 New Jersey 0-89603-342-2 ] Strain variation: differences in prion infectivity, incubation, symptomology and progression among species resembles that seen between viruses, especially RNA virus es The long incubation and rapid onset of symptoms resembles lentivirus es, such as HIV -induced AIDS Viral-like particles that do not appear to be composed of PrP have been found in some of the cells of scrapie- or CJD-infected cell lines. Recent studies propagating TSE infectivity in cell-free reactions [ Castilla J, Saá P, Hetz C, Soto C In vitro generation of infectious scrapie prions Cell 121 2 195–206 2005 April 15851027 10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.011 http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674%2805%2900156-X 2010-02-28 ] and in purified component chemical reactions strongly suggest against TSE viral nature. More recently, using a similar defined recipe of multiple components (PrP, POPG lipid, RNA), Jiyan Ma and colleagues generated infectious prions from recombinant PrP expressed from E. coli, casting further doubt on the viral hypothesis. [ Fungi ] [ Fungal prions ] Fungal proteins exhibiting templated conformational change were discovered in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Reed Wickner in the early 1990s. For their mechanistic similarity to mammalian prions, they were termed yeast prions. Subsequently, a prion has also been found in the fungus Podospora anserina. These prions behave similarly to PrP, but are generally nontoxic to their hosts. Susan Lindquist &apos;s group at the Whitehead Institute has argued some of the fungal prions are not associated with any disease state, but may have a useful role; however, researchers at the NIH have also provided arguments suggesting fungal prions could be considered a diseased state. [ Dong J, Bloom JD, Goncharov V, et al. Probing the role of PrP repeats in conformational conversion and amyloid assembly of chimeric yeast prions The Journal of Biological Chemistry 282 47 34204–12 2007 November 17893150 2262835 10.1074/jbc.M704952200 http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D17893150 2010-02-28 ] Thus, the issue of whether fungal proteins are diseases, or have evolved for some specific functions, still remains unresolved. [ Halfmann R, Alberti S, Lindquist S Prions, protein homeostasis, and phenotypic diversity Trends in Cell Biology 20 3 125–33 2010 20071174 2846750 10.1016/j.tcb.2009.12.003 ] As of 2012, there are eight known prion proteins in fungi, seven in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sup35, Rnq1, Ure2, Swi1, Mot3, Cyc8 and Mod5) and one in Podospora anserina (HET-s). The article that reported the discovery of a prion form the Mca1 protein has recently been retracted due to the fact that the data could not be reproduced [ Nemecek J Nakayashiki, T, Wickner, RB Retraction for Nemecek et al.: A prion of yeast metacaspase homolog (Mca1p) detected by a genetic screen. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2011 Jun 14 108 24 10022 21628591 ]. Notably, most of the fungal prions are based on glutamine/asparagine-rich sequences, with the exception of HET-s and Mod5. Research into fungal prions has given strong support to the protein-only concept, since purified protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also shed some light on prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g. characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions. [ Rogoza, T. et al.

They have an incubation period of months to decades during which there are no symptoms, even though the pathway of converting the normal brain PrP protein into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, there is virtually no way to detect PrP Sc reliably except by examining the brain using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods after death. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrP Sc form of the PrP protein is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids like blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrP Sc, but there are still no fully accepted methods for use in materials such as blood. In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP Sc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred thousand million (10 −11 ) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrP Sc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP Sc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP Sc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP Sc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared.
