After spending many years working as director of an orphanage in Warsaw, he refused freedom and stayed with his orphans when the institution was sent from the Ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp, during the Grossaktion Warsaw of 1942.

Spacious apartments – first along Miodowa street, then Świętojerska – had to be given up. Henryk worked as a tutor after school. [ Henryk zwany Januszem.

The name originated from the book Janasz Korczak and the Pretty Swordsweeperlady (O Janaszu Korczaku i pięknej Miecznikównie) by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski.

During the years 1898–1904 Korczak studied medicine at the University of Warsaw and also wrote for several Polish language newspapers. After graduation he became a pediatric ian. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1905–1906 he served as a military doctor. Meanwhile his book Child of the Drawing Room (Dziecko salonu) gained him some literary recognition. After the war he continued his practice in Warsaw. { attic } In 1907–1908 Korczak went to study in Berlin. While working for the Orphan&apos;s Society in 1909 he met Stefania Wilczyńska, his future closest associate. [ http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page%3Dsh%26amp%3BGRid%3D14753952%26amp%3B Stefania Wilczyńska (1886 –August 6, 1942) Findagrave.com Biography and photographs 2006 May 25, 2012 Carrie-Anne ] In 1911–1912 he became a director of Dom Sierot in Warsaw, the orphanage of his own design for Jewish children. He took Wilczyńska as his assistant. There he formed a kind-of-a- republic for children with its own small parliament, court, and a newspaper. He reduced his other duties as a doctor. Some of his descriptions of the summer camp for Jewish children in this period and subsequently, were later published in his Fragmenty Utworów and have been translated into English. During World War One, in 1917 Korczak became a military doctor with the rank of Lieutenant. He served again as a military doctor in the Polish Army with the rank of Major during the Polish-Soviet War, but after a brief stint in Łódź was assigned to Warsaw. [ Sovereign Poland ] In 1926 Korczak arranged for the children of the Dom Sierot to begin their own newspaper, the Mały Przegląd (Little Review), as a weekly attachment to the daily Polish-Jewish Newspaper Nasz Przegląd (Our Review). In these years, his secretary was the noted Polish novelist Igor Newerly. During the 1930s he had his own radio program where he promoted and popularized the rightes of children. In 1933 he was awarded the Silver Cross of the Polonia Restituta. Between 1934–1936 Korczak traveled every year to Mandate Palestine and visited its kibbutz im, which led to some anti-semitic commentaries in the Polish press. It additionally spurred his estrangement with the non-Jewish orphanage he had also been working for. Still, he refused to move to Palestine even when Stefania Wilczyńska went to live there in 1938. [ The Holocaust ] In 1939, when World War II erupted, Korczak volunteered for duty in the Polish Army but was refused due to his age. He witnessed the Wehrmacht takeover of Warsaw. When the Germans created the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940, his orphanage was forced to move from its building, Dom Sierot at Krochmalna 92 to the Ghetto (first to Chłodna 33 and later to Sienna 16 / Śliska 9). [ http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/korczak/photos/krochmal/default.htm#24 Dom Sierot. Krochmalna 92 Swedish Holocaust Memorial Association 27 January 2012 ] Korczak moved in with them. In July, Janusz Korczak decided that the children in the orphanage should put on Rabindranath Tagore ’s play, The Post Office. { Yad Vashem } { Warsaw } On August 5 or 6, 1942, German soldiers came to collect the 192 orphans (there is some debate about the actual number: it may have been 196), and about one dozen staff members, to transport them to Treblinka extermination camp. Korczak had been offered sanctuary on the “ Aryan side ” by Żegota but turned it down repeatedly, saying that he could not abandon his children. On August 5, he again refused offers of sanctuary, insisting that he would go with the children. The children were dressed in their best clothes, and each carried a blue knapsack and a favorite book or toy. Joshua Perle, an eyewitness, described the procession of Korczak and the children through the ghetto to the Umschlagplatz (deportation point to the death camps): [ Holocaust Chronicles: Individualizing the Holocaust Through Diaries and Other Contemporaneous Personal Accounts KTAV Publishing House Robert Moses Shapiro 1999 0881256307 ] According to a popular legend, when the group of orphans finally reached the Umschlagplatz, an SS officer recognized Korczak as the author of one of his favorite children&apos;s books and offered to help him escape. By another version, the officer was acting officially, as the Nazi authorities had in mind some kind of &quot; special treatment &quot; for Korczak (some prominent Jews with international reputations got sent to Theresienstadt ). Whatever the offer, Korczak once again refused. He boarded the trains with the children and was never heard from again. Korczak&apos;s evacuation from the Ghetto is also mentioned in Władysław Szpilman &apos;s book The Pianist : [ I happened to see Janusz Korczak and his orphans leaving the ghetto. The evacuation of the Jewish orphanage run by Janusz Korczak had been ordered for that morning. The children were to have been taken away alone. He had the chance to save himself, and it was only with difficulty that he persuaded the Germans to take him too. He had spent long years of his life with children and now, on this last journey, he could not leave them alone. He wanted to ease things for them. He told the orphans they were going out in to the country, so they ought to be cheerful. At last they would be able to exchange the horrible suffocating city walls for meadows of flowers, streams where they could bathe, woods full of berries and mushrooms. He told them to wear their best clothes, and so they came out into the yard, two by two, nicely dressed and in a happy mood. The little column was led by an SS man... &quot; Władysław Szpilman The Pianist Jerzy Waldorff, Władysław Szpilman, The Pianist. Page 96. ] Some time after, there were rumors that the trains had been diverted and that Korczak and the children had survived. There was, however, no basis to these stories. Most likely, Korczak, along with Wilczyńska and most of the children, was killed in a gas chamber upon their arrival at Treblinka. A differing account of Korczak&apos;s death is given in Mary Berg&apos;s Warsaw Ghetto diary: [ Dr. Janusz Korczak’s children’s home is empty now. A few days ago we all stood at the window and watched the Germans surround the houses. Rows of children, holding each other by their little hands, began to walk out of the doorway. There were tiny tots of two or three years among them, while the oldest ones were perhaps thirteen. Each child carried the little bundle in his hand. All of them wore white aprons. They walked in ranks of two, calm, and even smiling. They had not the slightest foreboding of their fate. At the end of the procession marched Dr. Korczak, who saw to it that the children did not walk on the sidewalk.” Mary Berg The Diary Mary Berg, The Diary of Mary Berg: Growing Up in the Warsaw Ghetto, Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 1996, pages 169-170. ] There is a cenotaph for him at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. [ Writings ] Korczak&apos;s best known writing is his fiction and pedagogy, and his most popular works have been widely translated. His main pedagogical texts have been translated into English, but of his fiction, as of 2011 only King Matt the First has been translated into English, though Kaytek the Wizard is scheduled for a June, 2012 release in English. The copyright to all works by Korczak was acquired by The Polish Book Institute as of January 8, 2010. { ©Korczak } As of late 2011, they have embarked on an initiative to publish or re-publish many of Korczak&apos;s books, both in Polish and in other languages. { &quot; The film adaptation of &apos;Kajtuś the Wizard&apos; &quot;, Book Institute } As Korczak died in 1942, it is likely that his works will be available in the public domain as of January 1, 2013. [ http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1%2C114877%2C11296484%2CGauden__mozliwe__ze_dziela_Korczaka_trafia_za_rok.html Gauden: możliwe, że dzieła Korczaka trafią za rok do domeny publicznej Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl Polish 2012-03-07 ] Korczak&apos;s overall literary oeuvre covers the period 1896 to August 8, 1942. It comprises works for both children and adults, and includes literary pieces, social journalism, articles and pedagogical essays, together with some scrappy unpublished work, in all totaling over twenty books, over 1,400 texts published in around 100 publications, and around 300 texts in manuscript or typescript form. A complete edition of his works is planned for 2012. { &quot; Janusz Korczak &quot;, Book Institute } [ Children&apos;s books ] Korczak often employed the form of the fairy tale in order to actually prepare his young readers for the dilemmas and difficulties of real adult life, and the need to take responsible decisions. In the 1923 King Matt the First (Król Maciuś Pierwszy) and its sequel King Matt on the Desert Island (Król Maciuś na wyspie bezludnej) Korczak depicted a child prince who is catapulted to the throne by the sudden death of his father, and who must learn from various mistakes. He tries to read and answer all his mail by himself and finds that the volume is too much and he needs to rely on secretaries; he is exasperated with his ministers and has them arrested, but soon realises that he does not know enough to govern by himself, and is forced to release the ministers and institute constitutional monarchy; when a war breaks out he does not accept being shut up in his palace, but slips away and joins up, pretending to be a peasant boy - and narrowly avoids becoming a POW; he takes the offer of a friendly journalist to publish for him a &quot; royal paper &quot; -and finds much later that he gets carefully edited news and that the journalist is covering up the gross corruption of the young king&apos;s best friend; he tries to organise the children of all the world to hold processions and demand their rights - and ends up antagonising other kings; he falls in love with a black African princess and outrages racist opinion (by modern standards, however, Korczak&apos;s depiction of blacks is itself not completely free of stereotype s which were current at the time of writing); finally, he is overthrown by the invasion of three foreign armies and exiled to a desert island, where he must come to terms with reality - and finally does. The later Kajtuś the Wizard (Kajtuś czarodziej) (1935) anticipated Harry Potter in depicting a schoolboy who gains magic powers, and it was very popular during the 1930s, both in Polish and in translation to several other languages. Kajtuś has, however, a far more difficult path than Harry Potter: he has no Hogwarts -type School of Magic where he could be taught by expert mages, but must learn to use and control his powers all by himself - and most importantly, to learn his limitations. [ Pedagogical books ] In his pedagogical works, Korczak shares much of his experience dealing with difficult children. Korczak&apos;s ideas were further developed by many other pedagogues such as Simon Soloveychik and Erich Dauzenroth.
