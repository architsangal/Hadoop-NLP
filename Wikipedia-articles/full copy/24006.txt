[ December 2010 ] [ the fuel called &quot; paraffin &quot; in the United Kingdom and South Africa Kerosene medical uses Liquid paraffin (medicinal) ] Paraffin wax In chemistry, paraffin is a term that can be used synonymously with &quot; alkane &quot;, indicating hydrocarbon s with the general formula C n H 2n+2. Paraffin wax refers to a mixture of alkanes that falls within the 20 ≤ n ≤ 40 range; they are found in the solid state at room temperature and begin to enter the liquid phase past approximately [ 37 °C °F ]. [ Freund Mihály Mózes Gyula Jakab, E. (trans) Paraffin products: properties, technologies, applications 1982 Elsevier Amsterdam, Netherlands 0-444-99712-1 121 ] The simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane, CH 4, a gas at room temperature. Heavier members of the series, such as octane, C 8 H 18, and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature. The solid forms of paraffin, called paraffin wax, are from the heaviest molecules from C 20 H 42 to C 40 H 82. Paraffin wax was identified by Carl Reichenbach in 1830. { Britannica (1911) } Paraffin, or paraffin hydrocarbon, is also the technical name for an alkane in general, but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear, or normal alkane — whereas branched, or isoalkanes are also called isoparaffins. It is distinct from the fuel known in the United Kingdom, Ireland and South Africa as paraffin oil or just paraffin, which is called kerosene in most of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The name is derived from Latin parum ( &quot; barely &quot; ) + affinis, meaning &quot; lacking affinity &quot; or &quot; lacking reactivity &quot; indicating paraffin&apos;s unreactive nature [ Oxford English Dictionary Oxford University Press Oxford, England March 2009 Paraffin, n ] ) [ Paraffin wax ] Paraffin wax (or simply &quot; paraffin &quot;, but see alternative name for kerosene, above) is mostly found as a white, odorless, tasteless, waxy solid, with a typical melting point between about [ 46 and 68 °C °F ], [ Nasser William E McKetta, John J Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design 67 1999 Marcel Dekker New York 0-8247-2618-9 17 Waxes, Natural and Synthetic ] { This can vary widely, even outside the quoted range, according to such factors as oil content and crystalline structure. } and having a density of around 0.9 g/cm 3.

Paraffin is unaffected by most common chemical reagent s but burns readily. [ Seager Spencer L. Slabaugh Michael Chemistry for Today: General, Organic, and Biochemistry Cengage Belmont, CA 978-0-538-73332-8 364 Alkane reactions ] Pure paraffin wax is an excellent electrical insulator, with an electrical resistivity of between 10 13 and 10 17 ohm metre.

It is an effective neutron moderator and was used in James Chadwick &apos;s 1932 experiments to identify the neutron.

The modification is usually done with additives, such as EVA copolymers, microcrystalline wax, or forms of polyethylene. The branched properties result in a modified paraffin with a higher viscosity, smaller crystalline structure, and modified functional properties. Pure paraffin wax is rarely used for carving original models for casting metal and other materials in the lost wax process, as it is relatively brittle at room temperature and presents the risks of chipping and breakage when worked. Soft and pliable waxes, like beeswax, may be preferred for such sculpture, but &quot; investment casting waxes, &quot; often paraffin-based, are expressly formulated for the purpose. [ August 2011 ] [ Mineral oil ] [ Mineral oil ] Liquid paraffin, or mineral oil, is a mixture of heavier alkanes, and has a number of names, including nujol, adepsine oil, alboline, glymol, medicinal paraffin, or saxol. It has a density of around 0.8 g/cm 3. [ Mechanical properties of materials Kaye and Laby Tables of Physical and Chemical Constants National Physical Laboratory http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_2/2_2_1.html 2008-03-06 ] Medicinal liquid paraffin is used to aid bowel movement in persons suffering chronic constipation; it passes through the gastrointestinal tract without itself being taken into the body, but it limits the amount of water removed from the stool. In the food industry, where it may be called &quot; wax &quot;, it can be used as a lubricant in mechanical mixing, applied to baking tins to ensure that loaves are easily released when cooked and as a coating for fruit or other items requiring a &quot; shiny &quot; appearance for sale.

When the sample to be tested is made into a mull (a very thick paste), liquid paraffin is added so it can be spread on the transparent (to infrared) mounting plates to be tested.Mineral oil has also seen widespread use in biotechnology for preventing the evaporation of small volumes of liquid during heating. Polymerase chain reaction samples may need to be overlaid with a layer of mineral oil to prevent evaporation [ Hayat M. A.
