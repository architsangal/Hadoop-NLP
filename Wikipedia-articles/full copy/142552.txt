Inc. [ Early life ] Born in Taipei, Taiwan on November 6, 1968, Yang moved to San Jose, California at the age of ten with his mother and younger brother. His father died when Yang was two. He claimed that despite his mother being an English teacher, he only knew one English word (shoe) on his arrival. Becoming fluent in three years, he was placed into an Advanced Placement English class.

Retrieved July 13, 2011. } { Phi Kappa Psi Mass Beta – Famous Phi Psi&apos;s Phi Kappa Psi Massachusetts Beta. Retrieved July 13, 2011. } [ Career ] While Yang studied in Electrical Engineering at Stanford, he co-created in April 1994 with David Filo an Internet website called &quot; Jerry and Dave&apos;s Guide to the World Wide Web &quot; consisting of a directory of other websites. It was renamed &quot; Yahoo! &quot; (an exclamation). Yahoo! became very popular, and Yang and Filo realized the business potential and co-founded Yahoo! Inc. in April 1995. { Yahoo! Inc. – Company History. yhoo.client.shareholder.com } They took leaves of absence and postponed their doctoral programs indefinitely. Yahoo! started off as a web portal with a web directory providing an extensive range of products and services for online activities. It is now one of the leading internet brands and, due to partnerships with telecommunications firms, has the most trafficked network on the internet. [ September 2011 ] In 1999, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

Yahoo!&apos;s stock price plummeted after it rejected a takeover from Microsoft, a bid that Yang strongly opposed. On November 17, 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported Jerry Yang would step down as CEO as soon as the company found a replacement. { Yang to Step Down as Yahoo CEO, The Wall Street Journal, November 18, 2008 } On January 13, 2009, Yahoo! named Silicon Valley veteran Carol Bartz as its new chief executive, effectively replacing Yang. { Yahoo names new chief executive, BBC News, January 14, 2009 } Yang regained his former position as &quot; Chief Yahoo &quot; and remained on Yahoo&apos;s board of directors.

The company also announced his resignation from the boards of Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Corp. { Yahoo announces resignation of Jerry Yang, ‘’Marketwatch News&apos;&apos;, January 17, 2012 } [ Personal life ] Yang is married to Akiko Yamazaki, a Japanese woman who was raised in Costa Rica. Yamazaki graduated from Stanford University with a degree in industrial engineering and is a director with the Wildlife Conservation Network. The couple met at Stanford University in the Kyoto overseas program in 1992.

Retrieved on 2012-01-09. } a multi-disciplinary research, teaching and lab building, the first to be realized on Stanford&apos;s new Science and Engineering Quad. [ Criticism ] [ China ] Jerry Yang was criticized for a statement regarding the role of Yahoo! in the arrest of Chinese journalist Shi Tao by Chinese authorities. While in China, Shi Tao used a Yahoo email address to notify a pro-democracy website that the Chinese government ordered the Chinese media not to cover the fifteenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 on June 4. Yahoo! provided the Chinese security agencies with the IP addresses of the senders, the recipients and the time of the message. Tao was subsequently convicted for &quot; divulging state secrets abroad. &quot; Yang was heavily criticized and Reporters Without Borders called Yahoo! &quot; a Chinese police informant &quot; whose actions led to the conviction of a journalist and writer. Yang declared, &quot; To be doing business in China, or anywhere else in the world, we have to comply with local law[s]. &quot; This was controversial, as critics claimed Yahoo! violated international law as well as a 1989 decision by the U.S. Congress to prohibit U.S. companies from selling &quot; crime control and detection &quot; equipment or software to the Chinese Government. { Xue Li: Human Rights Lawyer Questions Yahoo!&apos;s Aid to China in Arresting a Journalist, Epoch Times, Sep 23, 2005 Obeying Orders, Washington Post, September 18, 2005 } The New York Times reported that political prisoner Wang Xiaoning and other journalists had brought a civil suit against Yahoo for allegedly aiding and abetting the Chinese government which, it was claimed, resulted in torture that included beatings and imprisonment. { Chinese political prisoner sues in U.S. court, New York Times, April 18, 2007 Chinese political } In October 2007 Jerry Yang was summoned to Washington to answer for Yahoo&apos;s comments regarding its role in the arrests of Shi Tao and other journalists in China. { Yahoo summoned to Washington over Chinese arrests, c/net news blog, October 16, 2007 } [ http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_7392987?nclick_check%3D1 Lawmaker scolds Yahoo: &apos;Morally you are pygmies&apos; Mercury News 2007-11-07 2007-11-14 John Boudreau ] On November 14, 2007, Yahoo agreed to settle with affected Chinese dissidents, paying them undisclosed compensation. Yang stated, &quot; After meeting with the families, it was clear to me what we had to do to make this right for them, for Yahoo, and for the future. &quot; In response, Democratic Congressman Tom Lantos, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, stated, &quot; It took a tongue-lashing from Congress before these high-tech titans did the right thing and coughed up some concrete assistance for the family of a journalist whom Yahoo had helped send to jail. What a disgrace. &quot; [ http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f%3D%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F11%2F14%2FBUN4TBJNV.DTL Yahoo settles with jailed Chinese journalists SFGate 2007-11-14 2007-11-14 Verne Kopytoff ] Jerry Yang wrote a letter to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice requesting her assistance in freeing the jailed dissidents.

Human Rights Fund, a fund to provide &quot; humanitarian and legal support &quot; to online dissidents. [ http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/PRESS/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID%3D302980 Press Release: Yahoo! Inc Reaches Settlement On Lawsuit Works To Establish Human Rights Fund 12 December 2008 Yahoo! ] One of the first public projects of the fund was financing the establishment of the Laogai Museum, a museum opened by noted Chinese dissident Harry Wu to showcase China&apos;s laogai penal system.

The complaint alleges, &quot; violation of international law including torture and prolonged detention, as well as unfair business practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment and assault. &quot; [ http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9881042-7.html?tag%3Dnewsmap Yahoo sued by jailed dissidents again CNET News 2007-02-27 2007-02-27 Elinor Mills ] [ Microsoft ] As CEO, Yang rejected a hostile takeover offer from Microsoft in May 2008. Microsoft had wanted to purchase Yahoo! to increase its market share and compete more effectively against Google in online search and advertising. During negotiations with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Yang threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, &quot; They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place &quot; (possibly a reference to Yahoo!&apos;s shareholders rights plan that had been in place since 2001). [ Yahoo weighs up options http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6445d618-d293-11dc-8636-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check%3D1 Financial Times 2008-02-03 ] Analysts suggested that Microsoft&apos;s raised offer of US$33 per share that would have valued Yahoo! at $44.6 billion was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith. Yahoo&apos;s stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid. Yang and board chairman Roy Bostock were strongly criticized by investors for their handling of negotiations, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from Carl Icahn.

Microsoft CEO Ballmer has since remarked that he was lucky that the bid for Yahoo! in 2008 didn&apos;t succeed, as the deal would have closed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown and collapse of Lehman Brothers.

While providing Yahoo! with a steady stream of revenue, the deal gave Microsoft what it had been seeking at a much cheaper price than its 2008 unsolicited bid. [ http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/yahoo_inc/yahoo-microsoft-deal/index.html The New York Times Verne G.
