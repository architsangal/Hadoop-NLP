{ Self-portrait,&apos;&apos; 1865–1866, oil on canvas, } { Art Institute of Chicago } Jean Frédéric Bazille (December 6, 1841 – November 28, 1870) was a French Impressionist painter. Many of Bazille&apos;s major works are examples of figure painting in which Bazille placed the subject figure within a landscape painted en plein air.

He became interested in painting after seeing some works of Eugène Delacroix. His family agreed to let him study painting, but only if he also studied medicine. Bazille began studying medicine in 1859, and moved to Paris in 1862 to continue his studies. There he met Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley, was drawn to Impressionist painting, and began taking classes in Charles Gleyre &apos;s studio. After failing his medical exam in 1864, he began painting full-time. His close friends included Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Édouard Manet. Bazille was generous with his wealth, and helped support his less fortunate associates by giving them space in his studio and materials to use. Bazille was just twenty-three years old when he painted several of his best known works, including The Pink Dress (ca. 1864, Musée d&apos;Orsay, Paris). This painting combines a portrait-like depiction of Bazille&apos;s cousin, Thérèse des Hours, who is seen from behind—and the sunlit landscape at which she gazes. { Rosenblum, 1989, p. 225 } His best known painting is Family Reunion of 1867–1868 (Musée d&apos;Orsay, Paris). Frédéric Bazille joined a Zouave regiment in August 1870, a month after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. On November 28 of that year he was with his unit at the Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande when, his officer having been injured, he took command and led an assault on the German position. He was hit twice in the failed attack and died on the battlefield at the age of twenty eight. His father travelled to the battlefield a few days later to take his body back for burial at Montpellier over a week later. { Burlington magazine entry } [ Main works ] La Robe rose, (1864) - 147 x 110  cm, Musée d&apos;Orsay, Paris Atelier de la rue Furstenberg, - 80 x 65  cm, Musée Fabre, Montpellier Aigues-Mortes, - 46 x 55  cm, Musée Fabre, Montpellier Autportrait, (1865) - 109x72 cm, Art Institute of Chicago Réunion de Famille, (1867) - 152 x 230  cm, Musée d&apos;Orsay, Paris Le Pécheur à l&apos;épervier, (1868) - 134 x 83  cm, Fondation Rau pour le tiers-monde, Zürich Vue de village, (1868) - 130 x 89  cm, Musée Fabre, Montpellier Scène d&apos;été, 1869 - 158 x 158  cm, Cambridge, Harvard University La Toilette, (1870) - 132 x 127  cm., Musée Fabre, Montpellier L&apos;Atelier de la rue Condamine, (1870) - 98 x 128.5  cm, Musée d&apos;Orsay, Paris Paysage au bord du Lez, (1870) - 137.8 x 202.5  cm, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis [ Selected paintings ] Bazille&apos;s Studio; 9 Rue de la Condamine, 1870, Musée d&apos;Orsay, Paris Le Petit Jardinier (The Little Gardener), c. 1866-67, oil on canvas Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Paysage au bord du Lez, 1870, oil on canvas, Minneapolis Institute of Arts Portrait of Renoir, 1867, oil on canvas, Musée d&apos;Orsay Scène d&apos;été, 1869, Oil on canvas, Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts The Pink Dress (View of Castelnau-le-Lez, Hérault), 1864, oil on canvas, Musée d&apos;Orsay La Toilette, 1870, Musée Fabre Self Portrait, 1867-1868 Studio in the Rue de Furstenberg, 1865, Musée Fabre View of the Village, 1868, Musée Fabre Family Reunion, c. 1867, Musée d&apos;Orsay [ Notes ] [ Frédéric Bazille ] [ References ] Pitman, Dianne W.
