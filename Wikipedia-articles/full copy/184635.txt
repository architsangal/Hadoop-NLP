In ring theory, a branch of modern algebra, a quotient ring, also known as factor ring or residue class ring, is a construction quite similar to the factor group s of group theory and the quotient space s of linear algebra. [ Dummit David S. Foote Richard M. Abstract Algebra John Wiley &amp; Sons 2004 3rd 0-471-43334-9 ] [ Lang Serge Serge Lang Algebra Springer Graduate Texts in Mathematics 2002 0-387-95385-X ] One starts with a ring R and a two-sided ideal I in R, and constructs a new ring, the quotient ring R/I, essentially by requiring that all elements of I be zero. Intuitively, the quotient ring R/I is a &quot; simplified version &quot; of R where the elements of I are &quot; ignored &quot;. Quotient rings are distinct from the so-called &apos;quotient field&apos;, or field of fractions, of an integral domain as well as from the more general &apos;rings of quotients&apos; obtained by localization. [ Formal quotient ring construction ] Given a ring R and a two-sided ideal I in R, we may define an equivalence relation ~ on R as follows: a ~ b if and only if a − b is in I. Using the ideal properties, it is not difficult to check that ~ is a congruence relation.In case a ~ b, we say that a and b are congruent modulo I.The equivalence class of the element a in R is given by [a] = a + I := { a + r : r in I }. This equivalence class is also sometimes written as a mod I and called the &quot; residue class of a modulo I &quot;. The set of all such equivalence classes is denoted by R/I; it becomes a ring, the factor ring or quotient ring of R modulo I, if one defines (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I; (a + I)(b + I) = (a b) + I. (Here one has to check that these definitions are well-defined. Compare coset and quotient group.) The zero-element of R/I is (0 + I) = I, and the multiplicative identity is (1 + I). The map p from R to R/I defined by p(a) = a + I is a surjective ring homomorphism, sometimes called the natural quotient map or the canonical homomorphism. [ Examples ] The most extreme examples of quotient rings are provided by modding out the most extreme ideals, {0} and R itself. R/{0} is naturally isomorphic to R, and R/R is the trivial ring {0}. This fits with the general rule of thumb that the smaller the ideal I, the larger the quotient ring R/I. If I is a proper ideal of R, i.e. I ≠ R, then R/I won&apos;t be the trivial ring. Consider the ring of integer s Z and the ideal of even number s, denoted by 2Z. Then the quotient ring Z/2Z has only two elements, zero for the even numbers and one for the odd numbers. It is naturally isomorphic to the finite field with two elements, F 2. Intuitively: if you think of all the even numbers as 0, then every integer is either 0 (if it is even) or 1 (if it is odd and therefore differs from an even number by 1). Modular arithmetic is essentially arithmetic in the quotient ring Z/n&apos;&apos;Z (which has n&apos;&apos; elements). Now consider the ring R[X] of polynomial s in the variable X with real coefficients, and the ideal I = (X 2 + 1) consisting of all multiples of the polynomial X 2 + 1. The quotient ring R[X]/(X 2 + 1) is naturally isomorphic to the field of complex number s C, with the class [X] playing the role of the imaginary unit i. The reason: we &quot; forced &quot; X 2 + 1 = 0, i.e. X 2 = −1, which is the defining property of i. Generalizing the previous example, quotient rings are often used to construct field extension s. Suppose K is some field and f is an irreducible polynomial in K[X]. Then L = K[X] /(f) is a field whose minimal polynomial over K is f, which contains K as well as an element x = X + (f). One important instance of the previous example is the construction of the finite fields. Consider for instance the field F 3 = Z/3Z with three elements. The polynomial f(X) = X 2  +  1 is irreducible over F 3 (since it has no root), and we can construct the quotient ring F 3 [X] /(f). This is a field with 3 2 =9 elements, denoted by F 9. The other finite fields can be constructed in a similar fashion. The coordinate ring s of algebraic varieties are important examples of quotient rings in algebraic geometry. As a simple case, consider the real variety V = {(x,y) | x 2 = y 3 } as a subset of the real plane R 2. The ring of real-valued polynomial functions defined on V can be identified with the quotient ring R[X,Y]/(X 2  −  Y 3 ), and this is the coordinate ring of V. The variety V is now investigated by studying its coordinate ring. Suppose M is a C ∞ - manifold, and p is a point of M. Consider the ring R = C ∞ (M) of all C ∞ -functions defined on M and let I be the ideal in R consisting of those functions f which are identically zero in some neighborhood U of p (where U may depend on f). Then the quotient ring R/I is the ring of germ s of C ∞ -functions on M at p. Consider the ring F of finite elements of a hyperreal field *R. It consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, or equivalently: of all hyperreal numbers x for which a standard integer n with −n &lt; x &lt; n exists. The set I of all infinitesimal numbers in *R, together with 0, is an ideal in F, and the quotient ring F/I is isomorphic to the real numbers R. The isomorphism is induced by associating to every element x of F the standard part of x, i.e. the unique real number that differs from x by an infinitesimal. In fact, one obtains the same result, namely R, if one starts with the ring F of finite hyperrationals (i.e. ratio of a pair of hyperinteger s ), see construction of the real numbers. [ Alternative complex planes ] The quotients R[X]/(X), R[X] /(X  +  1), and R[X] /(X  −  1) are all isomorphic to R and gain little interest at first. But note that R[X] /(X 2 ) is called the dual number plane in geometric algebra. It consists only of linear binomials as &quot; remainders &quot; after reducing an element of R[X] by X 2. This alternative complex plane arises as a subalgebra whenever the algebra contains a real line and a nilpotent. Furthermore, the ring quotient R[X]/(X 2  −  1) does split into R[X] /(X  +  1) and R[X] /(X  −  1), so this ring is often viewed as the direct sum R   \oplus  R.Nevertheless, an alternative complex number z = x + y j is suggested by j as a root of X 2 &amp; minus; 1, compared to i as root of X 2 + 1 = 0. This plane of split-complex number s normalizes the direct sum R \oplus R by providing a basis {1, j } for 2-space where the identity of the algebra is at unit distance from the zero. With this basis a unit hyperbola may be compared to the unit circle of the ordinary complex plane. [ Quaternions and alternatives ] Hamilton’s quaternion s of 1843 can be cast as R[X,Y]/(X 2 + 1, Y 2 + 1, XY + YX). If Y 2  −  1 is substituted for Y 2  +  1, then one obtains the ring of split-quaternion s. Substituting minus for plus in both the quadratic binomials also results in split-quaternions. The anti-commutative property YX = −XY implies that XY has for its square (XY)(XY) = X(YX)X = −X(XY)Y = − XXYY = −1. The three types of biquaternion s can also be written as quotients by conscripting the three-indeterminate ring R[X,Y,Z] and constructing appropriate ideals. [ Properties ] Clearly, if R is a commutative ring, then so is R/I; the converse however is not true in general. The natural quotient map p has I as its kernel; since the kernel of every ring homomorphism is a two-sided ideal, we can state that two-sided ideals are precisely the kernels of ring homomorphisms. The intimate relationship between ring homomorphisms, kernels and quotient rings can be summarized as follows: the ring homomorphisms defined on R/I are essentially the same as the ring homomorphisms defined on R that vanish (i.e. are zero) on I. More precisely: given a two-sided ideal I in R and a ring homomorphism f : R → S whose kernel contains I, then there exists precisely one ring homomorphism g : R/I → S with gp = f (where p is the natural quotient map). The map g here is given by the well-defined rule g([a]) = f(a) for all a in R. Indeed, this universal property can be used to define quotient rings and their natural quotient maps. As a consequence of the above, one obtains the fundamental statement: every ring homomorphism f : R → S induces a ring isomorphism between the quotient ring R/ker(f) and the image im(f). (See also: fundamental theorem on homomorphisms.) The ideals of R and R/I are closely related: the natural quotient map provides a bijection between the two-sided ideals of R that contain I and the two-sided ideals of R/I (the same is true for left and for right ideals). This relationship between two-sided ideal extends to a relationship between the corresponding quotient rings: if M is a two-sided ideal in R that contains I, and we write M/I for the corresponding ideal in R/I (i.e. M/I = p(M)), the quotient rings R/M and (R/I)/(M/I) are naturally isomorphic via the (well-defined!) mapping a + M ↦ (a+I) + M/I. In commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, the following statement is often used: If R ≠ {0} is a commutative ring and I is a maximal ideal, then the quotient ring R/I is a field; if I is only a prime ideal, then R/I is only an integral domain. A number of similar statements relate properties of the ideal I to properties of the quotient ring R/I. The Chinese remainder theorem states that, if the ideal I is the intersection (or equivalently, the product) of pairwise coprime ideals I 1,...,I k, then the quotient ring R/I is isomorphic to the product of the quotient rings R/I p, p=1,...,k.
