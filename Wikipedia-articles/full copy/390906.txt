[ UFO religion ] Ufology ( [ icon juː ˈ f ɒ l ə dʒ iː ] ) is the title used for the array of subject matter and activities associated with an interest in unidentified flying object s (UFOs). UFOs have been subject to various investigations over the years by governments, independent groups, and scientists. The term derives from UFO, which is pronounced as an acronym, and the suffix -logy, which comes from the Ancient Greek λογία (logiā). [ Etymology ] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the first documented uses of the word ufology can be found in the Times Literary Supplement from January 23, 1959, in which it writes, &quot; The articles, reports, and bureaucratic studies which have been written about this perplexing visitant constitute &apos;ufology&apos;. &quot; This article was printed eight years after Edward J. Ruppelt of the United States Air Force (USAF) coined the word UFO in 1951. [ Historical background ] { Swedish Air Force officer searches for a &quot; ghost rocket &quot; in Lake Kölmjärv, } { Norrland, } { Sweden, in July 1946. } The modern UFO mythology has three traceable roots: the late 19th century &quot; mystery airships &quot; reported in the newspapers of western United States, &quot; foo fighter s &quot; reported by Allied airmen during World War II, and the Kenneth Arnold &quot; flying saucer &quot; sighting near Mt. Rainier, Washington on June 24, 1947. [ On the plurality of inhabited worlds;a brief history of extraterrestrialism International Journal of Astrobiology June 2006 Mark Brake 5 2 104 10.1017/S1473550406002989 ] UFO reports between &quot; The Great Airship Wave &quot; and the Arnold sighting were limited in number compared to the post-war period: notable cases include reports of &quot; ghost fliers &quot; in Europe and North America during the 1930s and the numerous reports of &quot; ghost rockets &quot; in Scandinavia (mostly Sweden) from May to December 1946. [ Denzler, Brenda The lure of the edge: scientific passions, religious beliefs, and the pursuit of UFOs University of California Press 2003 6–7 0-520-23905-9 ] Media hype in the late 1940s and early 1950s following the Arnold sighting brought the concept of flying saucers to the public audience. { Denzler (2003), pp. 9 } As the public&apos;s preoccupation in UFOs grew, along with the number of reported sightings, the United States military began to take notice of the phenomenon. The UFO explosion of the early post-war era coincides with the escalation of the Cold War and the Korean War. The U.S. military feared that secret aircraft of the Soviet Union, possibly developed from captured German technology, were behind the sightings.

October 28, 1947 May 3, 2010 ] If correct, the craft causing the sightings were thus of importance to national security [ http://www.roswellfiles.com/FOIA/AFIntellRpt.htm The Air Force Intelligence Report To implement this policy it was directed that Hq, Air Material Command set up a project with the purpose of collecting, collating, evaluating, and distributing to interested government agencies and contractors, all information concerning sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which could be construed to be of concern to the national security. May 3, 2010 ] and of need of systematic investigation. By 1952, however, the official US government interest in UFOs began to fade as the USAF projects Sign and Grudge concluded, along with the CIA &apos;s Robertson Panel that UFO reports indicated no direct threat to national security.

It also recommended the termination of the USAF special unit Project Blue Book. As the U.S. government ceased officially studying UFO sightings, the same became true for most governments of the world. A notable exception is France, which still maintains the GEIPAN, { GEIPAN stands for Groupe d&apos;Études et d&apos;Informations sur les Phénomènes Aérospatiaux Non-identifiés ( &quot; unidentified aerospace phenomenon research and information group &quot; ) } formerly known as GEPAN (1977–1988) and SEPRA (1988–2004), a unit under the French Space Agency CNES.

The lack of acceptance of ufology by academia as a field of study means that people can claim to be &quot; UFO researchers &quot;, without the sorts of scientific consensus building and, in many cases peer review, that otherwise shape and influence scientific paradigm s. Even among scientifically inclined UFO research efforts, data collecting is often done by amateur investigators. Famous mainstream scientists who have shown interest in the UFO phenomenon include Stanford physicist Peter A. Sturrock, [ Sturrock, Peter A.

[ Hansson Sven Ove http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/ Science and Pseudo-Science September 3, 2008 May 8, 2010 ] { Denzler (2003), pp. 91 } Feist thinks that ufology can be categorized as a pseudoscience because, he says, its adherents claim it to be a science while being rejected as being one by the scientific community and because, he says, the field lacks a cumulative scientific progress; ufology has not, in his view, advanced since the 1950s. { Feist (2006), pp. 219-220 } Cooper states that the fundamental problem in ufology is not the lack of scientific methodology, as many ufologists have striven to meet standards of scientific acceptability, but rather the fact that the assumptions on which the research is often based are considered highly speculative. [ Cooper Rachel Matthew Broome Lisa Bortolotti Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives Oxford University Press 2009 19 Chapter 1: Is psychiatric research scientific? 0-19-923803-0 ] [ Methodological issues ] Scientific UFO research suffers from the fact that the phenomena under observation do not usually make predictable appearances at a time and place convenient for the researcher. { Denzler (2003), pp. 35 } Ufologist Diana Palmer Hoyt argues, [ Hoyt, Diana Palmer UFOCRITIQUE: UFO&apos;s, Social Intelligence and the Condon Committees Master&apos;s Thesis Virginia Polytechnic Institute 2000-04-20 http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05082000-09580026/unrestricted/UFOCRITIQUE.pdf 2007-05-25 ] { (page 13) } On the other hand, skeptics have argued that UFOs are not a scientific problem at all, as there is no tangible physical evidence to study. Barry Markovsky argues that, under scrutiny by qualified investigators, the vast majority of UFO sightings turn out to have mundane explanations. { Markovsky B., &quot; UFOs &quot;, in The Skeptic&apos;s Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience, edited by Michael Shermer, 2002 Skeptics Society, p260 } Astronomer Carl Sagan stated on UFO sightings, &quot; The reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable. Unfortunately there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting. &quot; [ Sagan, Carl Other Worlds 113 Bantam 1975 0-552-66439-1 ] Peter A. Sturrock states that UFO studies should be compartmentalized into at least &quot; the following distinct activities &quot; { Sturrock (2000) pp. 163 } : Field investigations leading to case documentation and the measurement or retrieval of physical evidence; Laboratory analysis of physical evidence; The systematic compilation of data (descriptive and physical) to look for patterns and so extract significant facts; The analysis of compilations of data (descriptive and physical) to look for patterns and so extract significant facts; The development of theories and the evaluation of those theories on the basis of facts. Denzler states that ufology as a field of study has branched into two different mindsets: the first group of investigators wants to convince the unbelievers and earn intellectual legitimacy through systematic study using the scientific method, and the second group sees the follow-up questions concerning the origin and &quot; mission &quot; of the UFOs as more important than a potential academic standing. { Denzler (2003), pp. 35-36 } [ UFO categorization ] J. Allen Hynek (left) and Jacques Vallée The &quot; UFO &quot; is unidentified flying object. Because it is unidentified, the classification and categorization are impossible. However, ufologists have proposed different systems for the classification. [ Hynek system ] Developed in the 1970s, J. Allen Hynek&apos;s original system of description divides sightings into six categories. [ Hynek, J. Allen The UFO experience: a scientific enquiry Corgi 1974 0-552-09430-7 ] It first separates sightings into distant- and close-encounter categories, arbitrarily setting five-hundred feet as the cutoff point. It then subdivides these close and distant categories based on appearance or special features: Nocturnal Lights (NL): Anomalous lights seen in the night sky. Daylight Discs (DD): Any anomalous object, generally but not necessarily &quot; discoidal &quot;, seen in the distant daytime sky. Radar/Visual cases (RV): Objects seen simultaneously by eye and on radar. Hynek also defined three close encounter (CE) subcategories: CE1: Strange objects seen nearby but without physical interaction with the environment. CE2: A CE1 case that leaves physical evidence, e.g. soil depressions, vegetation damage, or causes electromagnetic interference. CE3: CE1 or CE2 cases where occupants or entities are seen. Later, Hynek introduced a fourth category, CE4, which is used to describe cases where the witness feels he was abducted by a UFO. [ Tumminia, Diana G. Alien worlds: social and religious dimensions of extraterrestrial contact Syracuse University Press 2007 0-8156-0858-6 ] Some ufologists have adopted a fifth category, CE5, which involves conscious human-initiated contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. [ Vallée system ] Jacques Vallée has devised a UFO classification system, where the UFO sightings of four different categories are divided into five subcategories [ Physical Analyses in Ten Cases of Unexplained Aerial Objects with Material Samples Journal of Scientific Exploration 1998 Jacques F. Vallée 12 3 360–361 ] : Close Encounter (CE): As per Hynek. Maneuver (MA): Trajectory discontinuity in flight. Fly-by (FB): No observed discontinuity in flight. Anomaly (AN): Unusual lights or unexplained entities. The five subcategories can apply to all previous categories of sightings: Sighting Physical effects: for example, radar sighting Life form or living entity Reality transformation: witnesses experienced a transformation of their sense of reality (often corresponding to the popular characterization of the incident as an abduction) Physiological impact: Such as death or serious injury Thus, the Vallée categorization categorizes cases as MA-2, AN-1, CE-4, for example. [ Alleged academic ridicule ] Stanton Friedman considers the general attitude of mainstream academics as arrogant and dismissive, or bound to a rigid world view that disallows any evidence contrary to previously held notions. [ Friedman, Stanton T. Flying Saucers and Science: A Scientist Investigates the Mysteries of UFOs Franklin Lakes, NJ New Page Books 2008 978-1-60163-011-7 ] Denzler states that the fear of ridicule and a loss of status has prevented scientists of pursuing a public interest in UFOs. { Denzler (2003), pp. 72-73 } J. Allen Hynek&apos;s also commented, &quot; Ridicule is not part of the scientific method and people should not be taught that it is. &quot; [ Unusual Aerial Phenomena Journal of the Optical Society of America April 1953 Josef Allen Hynek 43 4 311–314 10.1364/JOSA.43.000311 ] Hynek said of the frequent dismissal of UFO reports by astronomers that the critics knew little about the sightings, and should thus not be taken seriously. [ Josef Allen Hynek Special report on conferences with astronomers on unidentified aerial objects Close questioning revealed they knew nothing of the actual sightings, of their frequency or anything much about them, and therefore cannot be taken seriously. This is characteristic of scientists in general when speaking about subjects which are not in their own immediate field of concern. NARA 1952-08-06 http://www.cufon.org/cufon/stork1-7a.htm 2007-05-25 ] Peter A. Sturrock suggests that a lack of funding is a major factor in the institutional disinterest in UFOs. { Sturrock (2000) pp. 155: &quot; If the Air Force were to make available, say, $50 million per year for ten years for UFO research, it is quite likely that the subject would look somewhat less disreputable... however, an agency is unlikely to initiate such a program at any level until scientists are supportive of such an initiative. We see that there is a chicken-and-egg program. It would be more sensible, and more acceptable to the scientific community, if research began at a low level. &quot; } [ Ufology and UFO reports ] In addition to UFO sightings, certain supposedly related phenomena are of interest to some in the field of ufology, including crop circles, [ Andrews, Colin; Spignesi, Stephen J.

Cambridge: North Cambridge Press. Pp. 382-388. } He claims a trend of increasingly sensational ideas steadily gaining popularity within ufology. Sheaffer remarked, &quot; the kind of stories generating excitement and attention in any given year would have been rejected by mainstream ufologists a few years earlier for being too outlandish. &quot; Likewise, James McDonald has expressed the view that extreme groups undermined serious scientific investigation, stating that a &quot; bizarre &apos;literature&apos; of pseudo-scientific discussion &quot; on &quot; spaceships bringing messengers of terrestrial salvation and occult truth &quot; had been &quot; one of the prime factors in discouraging serious scientists from looking into the UFO matter to the extent that might have led them to recognize quickly enough that cultism and wishful thinking have nothing to do with the core of the UFO problem. &quot; { McDonald (1968) } In the same statement, McDonald said that, &quot; Again, one must here criticize a good deal of armchair-researching (done chiefly via the daily newspapers that enjoy feature-writing the antics of the more extreme of such subgroups). A disturbing number of prominent scientists have jumped all too easily to the conclusion that only the nuts see UFOs &quot;. [ Surveys of scientists and amateur astronomers concerning UFOs ] In 1973, Peter A. Sturrock conducted a survey among members of the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where 1175 questionnaires were mailed and 423 were returned, and found no consensus concerning the nature and scientific importance of the UFO phenomenon, with views ranging equally from &quot; impossible &quot; to &quot; certain &quot; in reply to the question, &quot; Do UFOs represent a scientifically significant phenomenon? &quot; [ Sturrock, Peter A. UFO Reports from AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) Members UFO Evidence May 1974 http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc592.htm 2010-05-04 ] In a later larger survey conducted among the members of the American Astronomical Society, where 2611 were questionnaires mailed and 1356 were returned, Sturrock found out that opinions were equally diverse, with 23% replying &quot; certainly &quot;, 30% &quot; probably &quot;, 27% &quot; possibly &quot;, 17% &quot; probably not &quot;, and 3% &quot; certainly not &quot;, to the question of whether the UFO problem deserves scientific study.

In 1980, a survey of 1800 members of various amateur astronomer associations by Gert Herb and J. Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) found that 24% responded &quot; yes &quot; to the question, &quot; Have you ever observed an object which resisted your most exhaustive efforts at identification? &quot; [ Herb, Gert &amp; J.

After less than a year, the directorate, named the &quot; Flying Saucer Working Party &quot; (FSWP), concluded that most observations were either cases of mistaken identity, optical illusions, psychological delusions, or hoaxes, and recommended that no further investigation on the phenomena should be undertaken.

[ Robertson Panel (USA, 1953) ] [ Robertson Panel ] Before the final Battelle report was published, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had developed an interest in UFOs as a national security issue, and set up a committee to examine existing UFO data. The panel, headed by mathematician and physicist Howard Percy Robertson, met from January 14 to 17, 1953. It concluded unanimously that the UFO sightings posed no direct threat to national security, but did find that a continued emphasis on UFO reporting might threaten government functions by causing the channels of communication to clog with irrelevant reports and by inducing mass hysteria. Also, the panel worried that nations hostile to the US might use the UFO phenomena to disrupt air defenses. To meet these problems, the panel stated that a policy of public education on the lack of evidence behind UFOs was needed, to be done through the mass media and schools, among others. It also recommended monitoring private UFO groups for subversive activities. The recommendations of the Roberson Panel were partly implemented through a series of special military regulations. { Denzler (2003), pp. 14 } The December 1953 Joint-Army-Navy-Air Force Publication 146 (JANAP 146) made publication of UFO sightings a crime under the Espionage Act. The Air Force Regulation 200-2 (AFR 200-2) revision of 1954 made all UFO sightings reported to the USAF classified. AFR 200-2 revision of February 1958 allowed the military to deliver to the FBI names of those who were &quot; illegally or deceptively &quot; bringing UFOs to public attention. [ Condon Committee (USA, 1966–1968) ] Edward U. Condon [ Condon Committee ] After the recommendations of the Robertson Panel, the USAF wanted to end its involvement in UFOs, and pass Project Blue Book to another agency. { Denzler (2003), pp. 15 } In October 1966, the USAF contracted the University of Colorado, under the leadership of physicist Edward U. Condon, for $325,000 to conduct more scientific investigations of selected UFO sightings and to make recommendations about the project&apos;s future.
