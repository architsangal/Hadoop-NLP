[ the mixture of leaf and nut Paan the biblical place Bethel ] [ Piper betle plant.jpg Plant ae Angiosperm ae Magnoliidae Piperales Piperaceae Piper P. betle Piper betle L. ] The Betel (Piper betle) is the leaf of a vine belonging to the Piperaceae family, which includes pepper and Kava. It is valued both as a mild stimulant [ Betelnut - stimulant http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/betelnut_stimulant.html ] and for its medicinal properties. Betel leaf is mostly consumed in Asia, and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, as betel quid or paan, with or without tobacco, in an addictive psycho-stimulating and euphoria-inducing formulation with adverse health effects. The betel plant is an evergreen and perennial creeper, with glossy heart-shaped leaves and white catkin. The betel plant originated from South and South East Asia ( India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka ). [ Cultivation ] Betel leaf and Areca nut consumption in the world. The betel leaf is cultivated in most of South and Southeast Asia. Since it is a creeper, it needs a compatible tree or a long pole for support. Betel requires high land and especially fertile soil. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation. In Bangladesh, farmers called barui [ Banglapedia 27 September 2006 http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/P_0052.HTM Pan 2006-09-27 ] prepare a garden called a barouj in which to grow betel. The barouj is fenced with bamboo sticks and coconut leaves. The soil is plowed into furrows of 10 to 15 metres&apos; length, 75 centimetres in width and 75 centimetres&apos; depth. Oil cakes, manure, and leaves are thoroughly incorporated with the topsoil of the furrows and wood ash. The creeper cuttings are planted at the beginning of the monsoon season. Betel Plant cultivation in West Bengal Proper shade and irrigation are essential for the successful cultivation of this crop. Betel needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Irrigation is frequent and light, and standing water should not remain for more than half an hour. Dried leaves and wood ash are applied to the furrows at fortnightly intervals and cow dung slurry is sprinkled. Application of different kinds of leaves at monthly intervals is believed advantageous for the growth of the betel. In 3 to 6 months the vines reach 150 to 180 centimeters in height and they will branch. Harvest begins, with the farmer plucking the leaf and its petiole with his right thumb. The harvest lasts 15 days to one month. The harvested leaves are consumed locally or exported to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the United States. Betel is an important part of the economy in rural Bangladesh. Varieties include &apos;Magadhi&apos; from Bihar, Gundi, Rasi &amp; Bada varieties from Hinjilicut, Orissa which is more popular in Benaras, Mirzapur, Tunda, Agra &amp; southern districts of Orissa, in India, and &apos;Venmony Vettila&apos; from Kerala.

The leaves are folded in different ways according to the country and generally feature some calcium hydroxide daubed inside.

The pouch on the lower right contains tobacco, a relatively recent introduction. { phoenix wing shaped- betel leaf plate in } { Vietnam. } An extensive ca. 2004 research monograph by the World Health Organization, [ Betel-quid and areca-nut chewing and some areca-nut-derived Nitrosamines IARC Working Group The World Health Organization http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol85/mono85.pdf ] reports that betel leaf is consumed, in southeast Asian community worldwide, predominantly as a betel quid (synonymous with pan or paan). The betel quid contains betel leaf, areca nut and slaked lime, and may contain tobacco. Other substances are often added to the betel quid, in particular spices, such as cardamom, saffron, cloves, aniseed, turmeric, mustard or sweeteners according to local preferences. Numerous commercially produced mixtures containing some or all of these ingredients are also available in various parts of the world. The betel quid is thus a mixture of substances, placed in the mouth; and betel leaf is not consumed alone. For a predominant majority, the paan usually contains the betel leaf with two basic ingredients, either tobacco or areca nut or both, in raw or any processed form. The betel quid, or paan, as consumed in various parts of the world, consists of, : betel leaf with areca nut and slaked lime betel leaf with areca nut, slaked lime and tobacco betel leaf with tobacco, but without any areca nut betel leaf with areca nut and other spices or ingredients, but without tobacco betel leaf with areca nut, tobacco and other spices or ingredients There is archaeological evidence that the betel leaves have been chewed along with the areca nut since very ancient times. It is not known when these two different stimulant substances were first put together. In most countries, the mixture of both has a ceremonial and highly symbolic value [ July 2011 ]. In India, Burma, Nepal, Sri Lanka and other parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia, the leaves are chewed together in a wrapped package along with the areca nut (which, by association, is often inaccurately called the &quot; betel nut &quot; ) and mineral slaked lime ( calcium hydroxide ). Catechu, called Kattha in Hindi, and other flavoring substances and spices might be added. The lime acts to keep the active ingredient in its freebase or alkaline form, thus enabling it to enter the bloodstream via sublingual absorption. The areca nut contains the alkaloid arecoline, which promotes salivation (the saliva is stained red), and is itself a stimulant. This combination, known as a &quot; betel quid &quot;, has been used for several thousand years. Tobacco is sometimes added. Betel leaves are used as a stimulant, an antiseptic and a breath-freshener. Betel quid is also strongly carcinogenic. [ 10.1093/carcin/4.2.169 A study of betel quid carcinogenesis. 1.

[ January 2012 ] Many traditional ceremonies governing the lives of Hindus use betel and areca. For example, when paying money to a priest one might place money in a betel leaf. [ January 2012 ] The betel and areca also play an important role in Vietnamese culture. In Vietnamese there is a saying that &quot; the betel begins the conversation &quot;, referring to the practice of people chewing betel in formal occasions or &quot; to break the ice &quot; in awkward situations. The betel leaves and areca nut s are used ceremonially in traditional Vietnamese wedding s. [ January 2012 ] Per tradition a groom might offer the bride&apos;s parents betel and areca, the leaf and the nut symbolizing the ideal married couple bound together. In Vietnamese the phrase &quot; matters of betel and areca &quot; (chuyện trầu cau) is synonymous with marriage. [ January 2012 ] In Papua New Guinea, betel is prepared with a mustard stick dipped in lime powder and acts as a stimulant to suppress hunger, reduce stress and heighten the senses. Most families have backyard gardens and many grow betel there. The lime must be purchased. It is processed from coral s, especially the fast-growing staghorn corals of genus Acropora.

[ Health effects ] The betel leaf is predominantly consumed in the world as betel quid or paan, which is a mixture of substances. The paan almost always contains a betel leaf with two basic ingredients, either areca nut or tobacco or both, with lime ( calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate ).

In many descriptive studies, investigators have obtained histories of chewing betel quid with tobacco from series of patients with oral cancer; and in all these studies the percentage of patients who practice betel leaf chewing was found to be extremely large. Researchers also noted that the cancer generally develops at the place where the betel quid is kept. In an earlier ca. 1985 study, scientists linked malignant tumors to the site of skin or subcutaneous administration of aqueous extracts of betel quid in mice. In hamsters, forestomach carcinomas occurred after painting of the cheek-pouch mucosa with aqueous extracts or implantation of a wax pellet containing powdered betel quid with tobacco into the cheek pouch; carcinomas occurred in the cheek pouch following implantation of the wax pellets. In human populations, they report observing elevated frequencies of micronucleated cells in buccal mucosa of people who chew betel quid in Philippines and India. The scientists also found that the proportion of micronucleated exfoliated cells is related to the site within the oral cavity where the betel quid is kept habitually and to the number of betel quids chewed per day. This proportion, they report, could be reduced by administration for two to three months of vitamin A or β-carotene or a mixture of the two. In related studies, the scientists reported that oral leukoplakia shows a strong association with habits of betel-quid chewing in India. Some follow-up studies have shown malignant transformation of a proportion of leukoplakias. Oral submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, which are generally accepted to be precancerous conditions, appear to be related to the habit of chewing betel quid, that is paan. In a study conducted in Papua New Guinea, scientists found [ Thomas and MacLennan 1992 Slaked lime and betel nut cancer in Papua New Guinea The Lancet Oncology 340 8819 577–578 10.1016/0140-6736(92)92109-S http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014067369292109S ] oral squamous cell cancer as the most common malignant tumour in Papua New Guinea. They report that the oral cancer is concentrated at the corner of the mouth and cheek, and corresponds precisely with chewing site of betel leaf with lime in 77% of 169 cases. Powdered slaked lime applied to the chewed areca nut placed inside a betel leaf causes the mean pH to rise to 10, at which reactive oxygen species are generated from betel quid ingredients in vitro. Reactive oxygen species, together with sustained lime-induced cell proliferation, the scientists claim suggest a possible mechanism of carcinogenesis for this tumor. In a study conducted in Taiwan, scientists found [ Wen-Yuan Lin et al. 2009 Betel Nut Chewing Is Strongly Associated With General and Central Obesity in Chinese Male Middle-aged Adults Obesity 17 6 1247–1256 10.1038/oby.2009.38 http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v17/n6/abs/oby200938a.html ] betel chewing increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In this study, they investigated the association between betel nut chewing and general obesity (BMI 25  kg/m2) and central obesity. Using multiple linear regression analyses, after adjusting for potential confounders, they claim betel consumption was statistically significantly associated with obesity. The reas on for this link between obesity and betel leaf chewing, the scientists admit is unclear.

In addition to oral cancer, significant increases were seen among chewers for cancer of the esophagus, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, and all cancer. Chewing and smoking, as combined by most betel chewers, interacted synergistically and was responsible for half of all cancer deaths in this group. Chewing betel leaf quid and smoking, the scientists claim shortened the life span by nearly 6 years. A Lancet Oncology publication claims that betel leaf quid, or paan masala, may cause tumours in different parts of the body and not just the oral cavity as previously thought.

After screening for various causes, the scientists report betel-quid chewing being the major risk factor, with or without tobacco. In October, 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including betel leaf quid with areca nut, and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. They concluded there is sufficient evidence that betel quid without tobacco leads to tumor in oral cavity and oesophagus, and that betel quid with added tobacco is a carcinogen to oral cavity, pharynx and oesophagus.

Scientific studies that evaluate the health effects of betel leaves by itself are however limited, in contrast to extensive medical studies on betel quid or paan, because betel leaf is neither consumed as food nor routinely chewed by itself; it is chewed as paan or betel quid, which always includes betel leaf with additional substances such as those discussed above.
