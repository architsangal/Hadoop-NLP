[ 946 5 26 y ] { Pucklechurch, } { Wessex, England } { Glastonbury Abbey } { yes } { Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury } { Æthelflæd of Damerham } { Eadwig, King of England } { Edgar, King of England } { Edward, King of Wessex } { Eadgifu of Kent } Edmund I ( [ Ēadmund ]; 922 – 26 May 946), called the Elder, the Deed-doer, the Just, or the Magnificent, was King of England from 939 until his death. He was a son of Edward the Elder and half-brother of Athelstan. Athelstan died on 27 October 939, and Edmund succeeded him as king. [ Military threats ] Edmund came to the throne as the son of Edward the Elder, grandson of Alfred the Great, great-grandson of Ethelwulf of Wessex, great-great grandson of Egbert of Wessex and great-great-great grandson of Ealhmund of Kent. Shortly after his proclamation as king, he had to face several military threats. King Olaf III Guthfrithson conquered Northumbria and invaded the Midlands. When Olaf died in 942, Edmund reconquered the Midlands. In 943, he became the god-father of King Olaf of York. In 944, Edmund was successful in reconquering Northumbria. In the same year, his ally Olaf of York lost his throne and left for Dublin in Ireland. Olaf became the king of Dublin as Olaf Cuaran and continued to be allied to his god-father. In 945, Edmund conquered Strathclyde but ceded the territory to King Malcolm I of Scotland in exchange for a treaty of mutual military support. Edmund thus established a policy of safe borders and peaceful relationships with Scotland. During his reign, the revival of monasteries in England began. [ Louis IV of France ] One of Edmund&apos;s last political movements of which there is some knowledge is his role in the restoration of Louis IV of France to the throne. Louis, son of Charles the Simple and Edmund&apos;s half-sister Eadgifu, had resided at the West-Saxon court for some time until 936, when he returned to be crowned King of France. In the summer of 945, he was captured by the Norsemen of Rouen and subsequently released to Duke Hugh the Great, who held him in custody. The chronicler Richerus claims that Eadgifu wrote letters both to Edmund and to Otto I in which she requested support for her son. Edmund responded to her plea by sending angry threats to Hugh, who brushed them aside. { Richerus, Historiae, Book 2, chapters 49–50. See MGH online. } Flodoard &apos;s Annales, one of Richerus&apos; sources, report: [ Edmund, king of the English, sent messengers to Duke Hugh about the restoration of King Louis, and the duke accordingly made a public agreement with his nephews and other leading men of his kingdom. [...] Hugh, duke of the Franks, allying himself with Hugh the Black, son of Richard, and the other leading men of the kingdom, restored to the kingdom King Louis. Dorothy Whitelock (tr.), English Historical Documents c. 500–1042. 2nd ed. London, 1979. p. 345. Edmundus, Anglorum rex, legatos ad Hugonem principem pro restitutione Ludowici regis dirigit: et idem princeps proinde conventus publicos eumnepotibus suis aliisque regni primatibus agit. [...] Hugo, dux Francorum, ascito secum Hugo Nneigro, filio Richardi, ceterisque regni primatibus Ludowicum regem, [...] in regnum restituit. (Flodoard, Annales 946.) ] [ Death and succession ] &quot; The Murder of King Edmund at Pucklechurch &quot;, drawn by R. Smirke, published in Ashburton&apos;s History of England, 1793 On 26 May 946, Edmund was murdered by Leofa, an exiled thief, while attending St Augustine &apos;s Day mass in Pucklechurch (South Gloucestershire). { &quot; Here King Edmund died on St Augustine’s Day [26 May]. It was widely known how he ended his days, that Liofa stabbed him at Pucklechurch. And Æthelflæd of Damerham, daughter of Ealdorman Ælfgar, was then his queen. &quot; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, MS D, tr. Michael Swanton. } John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury add some lively detail by suggesting that Edmund had been feasting with his nobles, when he spotted Leofa in the crowd. He attacked the intruder in person, but in the event, Edmund and Leofa were both killed. { John of Worcester, Chronicon AD 946; William of Malmesbury, Gesta regum, book 2, chapter 144. The description of the circumstances remained a popular feature in medieval chronicles, such as } { Higden &apos;s } { Polychronicon : &quot; But William, libro ij° de Regibus, seyth (says) that this kyng kepyng a feste at Pulkirchirche, in the feste of seynte Austyn, and seyng a thefe, Leof by name, sytte [th]er amonge hys gestes, whom he hade made blynde afore for his trespasses – (quem rex prios propter scelera eliminaverat, whom the King previously due to his crimes did excile) –, arysede (arrested) from the table, and takenge that man by the heire of the hedde, caste him unto the grownde. Whiche kynge was sleyn – (sed nebulonis arcano evisceratus est) – with a lyttle knyfe the [th] e man hade in his honde [hand]; and also he hurte mony men soore with the same knyfe; neverthelesse he was kytte (cut) at the laste into smalle partes by men longyng to the kynge. &quot; } { Polychronicon, 1527. See Google Books } Edmund&apos;s sister Eadgyth, wife to Otto I, died (earlier) the same year, as Flodoard &apos;s Annales for 946 report. { Edmundus rex Transmarinus defungitur, uxor quoque regis Othonis, soror ipsius Edmundi, decessit. &quot; Edmund, king across the sea, died, and the wife of King Otto, sister of the same Edmund, died also. &quot; (tr. Dorothy Whitelock, English Historical Documents c. 500–1042. 2nd ed. London, 1979. p. 345). } Edmund was succeeded as king by his brother Edred, king from 946 until 955. Edmund&apos;s sons later ruled England as: Eadwig of England, King from 955 until 957, king of only Wessex and Kingdom of Kent from 957 until his death on 1 October 959. Edgar of England, king of only Mercia and Northumbria from 957 until his brother&apos;s death in 959, then king of England from 959 until 975.
