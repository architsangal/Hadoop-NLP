[ November 2007 ] [ Early Miocene Recent ] { Animal ia } { Chordata } { Mammal ia } { Carnivora } { Caniformia } { Musteloidea } { Mustelidae } { G. Fischer de Waldheim, 1817 } { Subfamilies } { Lutrinae } { Melinae } { Mellivorinae } { Taxideinae } { Mustelinae } Mustelidae (from Latin mustela, weasel ), commonly referred to as the weasel family, are a family of carnivorous mammal s. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora, at least partly because in the past it has been a catch-all category for many early or poorly differentiated taxa. [ February 2011 ] The internal classification seems to be still quite unsettled, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study published in 2008 questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests Mustelidae consists of four major clade s and three much smaller lineages. [ Variety ] { American Museum of Natural History ) } The Mustelidae in general are phylogenetically relatively primitive, so were difficult to classify until genetic evidence became available. The increasing availability of such evidence may well result in some members of the family being moved to their own separate families, as has already happened with the skunk s, previously considered to be members of the mustelid family. Mustelids vary greatly in size and behavior. The least weasel is not much larger than a mouse, while the giant otter can measure up to [ 2.4 m ft ] in total length and sea otter s can exceed [ 45 kg lb ]. The wolverine can crush bones as thick as the femur of a moose to get at the marrow, and has been seen attempting to drive bear s away from its kill. The sea otter uses rocks to break open shellfish to eat. The marten is largely arboreal, while the badger digs extensive networks of tunnels, called sett s. Some mustelids have been domesticated. The ferret and the tayra are kept as pets (although the tayra requires a Dangerous Wild Animals licence in the UK), or as working animals for hunting or vermin control. Others have been important in the fur trade. The mink is often raised for its fur. As well as being one of the most species-rich families in the order Carnivora, Mustelidae is one of the oldest. Mustelid-like forms first appeared about 40 million years ago, roughly coinciding with the appearance of rodent s. The direct ancestors of the modern mustelids first appeared about 15 million years ago. [ Characteristics ] Within a large range of variation, the mustelids exhibit some common characteristics. They are typically small animals with short legs, short, round ears, and thick fur. Most mustelids are solitary, nocturnal animals, and are active year-round. [ Macdonald, D. King, Carolyn 1984 The Encyclopedia of Mammals Facts on File New York 108–109 0-87196-871-1 ] With the exception of the sea otter, [ The Sea Otter in the Eastern Pacific Ocean Kenyon Karl W. 1969 U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife Washington, D.C. ] they have anal scent gland s that produce a strong-smelling secretion the animals use for sexual signaling and for marking territory. Most mustelid reproduction involves embryonic diapause. The embryo does not immediately implant in the uterus, but remains dormant for a period of time. No development takes place as long as the embryo remains unattached to the uterine lining. As a result, the normal gestation period is extended, sometimes up to a year. This allows the young to be born under more favorable environmental conditions. Reproduction has a large energy cost and it is to a female&apos;s benefit to have available food and mild weather. The young are more likely to survive if birth occurs after previous offspring have been wean ed. Mustelids are predominantly carnivorous, although some will sometimes eat vegetable matter. While not all mustelids share an identical dentition, they all possess teeth adapted for eating flesh, including the presence of shearing carnassial s. With variation between species, the most common dental formula is: [ 3.1.3.1 3.1.3.2 ] [ Ecology ] { Stoat killing a } { European rabbit } Several members of the family are aquatic to varying degrees, ranging from the semiaquatic mink, to the river otters, and to the highly aquatic sea otter. The sea otter is one of the few nonprimate mammals known to use a tool while foraging. It uses &quot; anvil &quot; stones to crack open the shellfish that form a significant part of its diet. It is a &quot; keystone species &quot;, keeping its prey populations in balance so some do not outcompete the others and they do not destroy the kelp in which they live. The black-footed ferret is entirely dependent on another keystone species, the prairie dog. A family of four ferrets will eat 250 prairie dogs in a year. The ferrets require a prairie dog colony of [ 500 acre km2 ] to maintain a stable population to support their predation. The mongoose and the meerkat bear a striking resemblance to many mustelids, but belong to a distinctly different suborder - the Feliformia (all those carnivores sharing more recent origins with the Felidae ) and not the Caniformia (those sharing more recent origins with the Canidae ). Because the mongoose and the mustelids occupy similar ecological niche s, convergent evolution has led to some similarity in form and behavior. [ July 2010 ] [ Human uses ] { Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s &quot; } { Lady with an ermine &quot; (actually a } { ferret ) } Several mustelids, including the mink, the sable (a type of marten) and the stoat (ermine), boast exquisite and valuable furs and have been accordingly hunted since prehistoric times. Since the early Middle Ages, the trade in furs was of great economic importance for northern and eastern European nations with large native populations of fur-bearing mustelids, and was a major economic impetus behind Russian expansion into Siberia and French and English expansion in North America. In recent centuries, fur farming, notably of mink, has also become widespread and provides the majority of the fur brought to market. One species, the sea mink (Neovison macrodon) of New England and Canada, was driven to extinction by fur trappers. Its appearance and habits are almost unknown today because no complete specimens can be found and no systematic contemporary studies were conducted. The sea otter, which has the densest fur of any animal, { Perrin, William F., Wursig, Bernd, and Thewissen, J.G.M. Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, 2nd ed. Academic Press; 2 edition (December 8, 2008). Page 529. } narrowly escaped the fate of the sea mink. The discovery of large populations in the North Pacific was the major economic driving force behind Russia n expansion into Kamchatka, the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, as well as a cause for conflict with Japan and foreign hunters in the Kuril Islands. Together with widespread hunting in California and British Columbia, the species was brought to the brink of extinction until an international moratorium came into effect in 1911. Today, some mustelids are threatened for other reasons. Sea otters are vulnerable to oil spill s and the indirect effects of overfishing; the black-footed ferret, a relative of the European polecat, suffers from the loss of American prairie; and wolverine populations are slowly declining because of habitat destruction and persecution. The rare European mink Mustela lutreola is one the most endangered mustelid species. [ Thierry Lodé Thierry Lodé J. P. Cornier D. Le Jacques 2001 Decline in endangered species as an indication of anthropic pressures: the case of European mink Mustela lutreola western population Environmental management 28 6 727–735 10.1007/s002670010257 ] One mustelid, the domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo), has been domesticated since ancient times, originally for hunting rabbits and pest control. [ Systematics ] Genetic analysis suggests the Mustelidae should be divided into eight subfamilies: [ Lutrinae Mustela, Neovison (Subfamily Mustelinae) ] [ Eira, Gulo, Martes (Subfamily Martinae) Arctonyx, Meles (Subfamily Melinae) ] [ Lutrinae Mustela, Neovison (Subfamily Mustelinae) ] [ Eira, Gulo, Martes (Subfamily Martinae) Arctonyx, Meles (Subfamily Melinae) ] Galictis, Vormela, Ictonyx, Poecilogale (Subfamily Galictinae) Melogale (Subfamily Helictidinae) Mellivora (Subfamily Mellivorinae) Taxidea (Subfamily Taxideinae) Mustelidae Galictis, Vormela, Ictonyx, Poecilogale (Subfamily Galictinae) Melogale (Subfamily Helictidinae) Mellivora (Subfamily Mellivorinae) Taxidea (Subfamily Taxideinae) The genetic studies on which this scheme was based did not include the genus Lyncodon, which is therefore unplaced, but probably allied with Mustela and Neovison. [ Wilson, D.E. &amp; Mittermeier, R.A. 2009 Handbook of the Mammals of the World, vol. 1 Lynx Ediciones Barcelona 656 978-84-96553-49-1 ] Older reference works generally suggest the Mustelidae should be divided into just two extant subfamilies, denoted Lutrinae and Mustelinae, [ http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?id%3D14001075 Wilson &amp; Reeder&apos;s Mammal Species of the World, Third Edition 2008-07-31 ] although the latter now appears paraphyletic as originally described. Instead, the Mustelidae are now thought to be divided into four major clade s and three, much smaller, lineage s. The early mustelids appear to have undergone two rapid bursts of diversification in Eurasia, with the resulting species only spreading to other continents later.

Slater G.J. Begg C. Begg K. Grassman L. Lucherini M. Veron G. Wayne R.K. 2276185 ] Examination of the mitochondrial DNA suggests the Taxidiinae diverged first, followed by the Melinae. [ Yu L, Peng D, Liu J, Luan P, Liang L, Lee H, Lee M, Ryder OA, Zhang Y 2011 On the phylogeny of Mustelidae subfamilies: analysis of seventeen nuclear non-coding loci and mitochondrial complete genomes BMC Evol Biol 11 1 92 10.1186/1471-2148-11-92 ] Lutrinae and Mustelinae are sister clades. The position of the Helictidinae is unclear because the mitochondrial evidence suggests they are related to Lutrinae-Mustelinae clade but the intron data suggest a relationship to Martinae.
