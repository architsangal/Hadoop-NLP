{ country code top-level domain in non- } { Latin alphabet } An internationalized domain name (IDN) is an Internet domain name that contains at least one label that is displayed in software applications, in whole or in part, in a language-specific script or alphabet, such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Tamil or the Latin alphabet -based characters with diacritics, such as French. These writing system s are encoded by computers in multi- byte Unicode. Internationalized domain names are stored in the Domain Name System as ASCII strings using Punycode transcription. The Domain Name System, which performs a lookup service to translate user-friendly names into network addresses for locating Internet resources, is restricted in practice { RFC 2181, Clarifications to the DNS Specification: section 11 explicitly allows any binary string } to the use of ASCII characters, a practical limitation that initially set the standard for acceptable domain names. The internationalization of domain names is a technical solution to translate names written in language-native scripts into an ASCII text representation that is compatible with the Domain Name System. Internationalized domain names can only be used with applications that are specifically designed for such use, and they require no changes in the infrastructure of the Internet. IDN was originally proposed in December 1996 by Martin Dürst [ Dürst, Martin J. Internet Draft: Internationalization of Domain Names http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-duerst-dns-i18n-00 December 10, 1996 The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Society (ISOC) 2009-10-31 ] [ Dürst, Martin J. URLs and internationalization http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/1996Dec/0038.html December 20, 1996 World Wide Web Consortium 2009-10-30 ] and implemented in 1998 by Tan Juay Kwang and Leong Kok Yong under the guidance of T.W. Tan. After much debate and many competing proposals, a system called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) { RFC 3490, IDN in Applications, Faltstrom, Hoffman, Costello, Internet Engineering Task Force (2003) } was adopted as a standard, and has been implemented in several top-level domain s. In IDNA, the term internationalized domain name means specifically any domain name consisting only of labels to which the IDNA ToASCII algorithm (see below) can be successfully applied. In March 2008, the IETF formed a new IDN working group to update [ http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idnabis-protocol Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol John Klensin IETF IDNAbis WG 2008 ] the current IDNA protocol. In October 2009, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) approved the creation of internationalized country code top-level domain s (IDN ccTLDs) in the Internet that use the IDNA standard for native language scripts. [ ICANN Bringing the Languages of the World to the Global Internet http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-30oct09-en.htm October 30, 2009 Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 2009-10-30 ] [ Internet addresses set for change http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8333194.stm October 30, 2009 BBC News 2009-10-30 ] In May 2010 the first IDN ccTLD were installed in the DNS root zone. [ First IDN ccTLDs now available http://blog.icann.org/2010/05/idn-cctlds/ May 5, 2010 Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 2010-05-06 ] [ Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications ] Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) is a mechanism defined in 2003 for handling internationalized domain names containing non- ASCII characters. These names either are Latin letters with diacritics ( ñ, é ) or are written in languages or scripts which do not use the Latin alphabet: Arabic, Hangul, Hiragana and Kanji for instance.Although the Domain Name System supports non-ASCII characters, applications such as e-mail and web browser s restrict the characters which can be used as domain names for purposes such as a hostname. Strictly speaking it is the network protocols these applications use that have restrictions on the characters which can be used in domain names, not the applications that have these limitations or the DNS itself. To retain backwards compatibility with the installed base the IETF IDNA Working Group decided that internationalized domain names should be converted to a suitable ASCII-based form that could be handled by web browser s and other user applications. IDNA specifies how this conversion between names written in non-ASCII characters and their ASCII-based representation is performed. An IDNA-enabled application is able to convert between the internationalized and ASCII representations of a domain name. It uses the ASCII form for DNS lookups but can present the internationalized form to users who presumably prefer to read and write domain names in non-ASCII scripts such as Arabic or Hiragana. Applications that do not support IDNA will not be able to handle domain names with non-ASCII characters, but will still be able to access such domains if given the (usually rather cryptic) ASCII equivalent. ICANN issued guidelines for the use of IDNA in June 2003, and it was already possible to register.jp domains using this system in July 2003 and.info { Mohan, Ram, German IDN, German Language Table, March 2003 } domains in March 2004. Several other top-level domain registries started accepting registrations in 2004 and 2005. IDN Guidelines were first created { Dam, Mohan, Karp, Kane &amp; Hotta, IDN Guidelines 1.0, ICANN, June 2003 } in June 2003, and have been updated { Karp, Mohan, Dam, Kane, Hotta, El Bashir, IDN Guidelines 2.0, ICANN, November 2005 } to respond to phishing concerns in November 2005. An ICANN working group focused on country code domain names at the top level was formed in November 2007 [ Jesdanun, Anick (Associated Press) http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id%3D3813334 Group on Non-English Domains Formed 2 November 2007 2 November 2007 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] and promoted jointly by the country code supporting organization and the Governmental Advisory Committee. Mozilla 1.4, Netscape 7.1, Opera 7.11 were among the first applications to support IDNA. A browser plugin is available for Internet Explorer 6 to provide IDN support. Internet Explorer 7.0 { What&apos;s New in Internet Explorer 7 } { International Domain Name Support in Internet Explorer 7 } and Windows Vista &apos;s URL APIs provide native support for IDN. { Handling Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) } [ ToASCII and ToUnicode ] The conversions between ASCII and non-ASCII forms of a domain name are accomplished by algorithms called ToASCII and ToUnicode. These algorithms are not applied to the domain name as a whole, but rather to individual labels. For example, if the domain name is www.example.com, then the labels are www, example, and com. ToASCII or ToUnicode are applied to each of these three separately. The details of these two algorithms are complex, and are specified in RFC 3490. The following gives an overview of their function. ToASCII leaves unchanged any ASCII label, but will fail if the label is unsuitable for the Domain Name System.If given a label containing at least one non-ASCII character, ToASCII will apply the Nameprep algorithm, which converts the label to lowercase and performs other normalization, and will then translate the result to ASCII using Punycode { RFC 3492, Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), A. Costello, The Internet Society (March 2003) } before prepending the four-character string &quot; [ xn-- y ] &quot;. { IANA e-mails explaining the final choice of ACE prefix } This four-character string is called the ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) prefix, and is used to distinguish Punycode encoded labels from ordinary ASCII labels.The ToASCII algorithm can fail in several ways; for example, the final string could exceed the 63-character limit of a DNS name. A label for which ToASCII fails cannot be used in an internationalized domain name. The function ToUnicode reverses the action of ToASCII, stripping off the ACE prefix and applying the Punycode decode algorithm. It does not reverse the Nameprep processing, since that is merely a normalization and is by nature irreversible. Unlike ToASCII, ToUnicode always succeeds, because it simply returns the original string if decoding fails. In particular, this means that ToUnicode has no effect on a string that does not begin with the ACE prefix. [ Example of IDNA encoding ] IDNA encoding may be illustrated using the example domain Bücher.ch. “Bücher” is German for “books”, and.ch is the ccTLD of Switzerland. This domain name has two labels, Bücher and ch. The second label is pure ASCII, and is left unchanged. The first label is processed by Nameprep to give bücher, and then converted to Punycode to result in bcher-kva. It is then prepended with [ xn-- y ] to produce [ xn-- y ] bcher-kva. The resulting label suitable for use in the DNS is therefore [ xn-- y ] bcher-kva.ch. [ Top-level domain implementation ] In 2009, ICANN decided to implement a new class of top-level domains, assignable to countries and independent regions, similar to the rules for country code top-level domains. However, the domain names may be any desirable string of characters, symbols, or glyphs in the language-specific, non-Latin alphabet or script of the applicant&apos;s language, within certain guidelines to assure sufficient visual uniqueness. The process of installing IDN country code domains began with a long period of testing in a set of subdomains in the test top-level domain. Eleven domains used language-native scripts or alphabets, such as δοκιμή, { IANA Report on Delegation of Eleven Evaluative Internationalised Top-Level Domains } meaning test in Greek. These efforts culminated in the creation of the first internationalized country code top-level domain s (IDN ccTLDs) for production use in 2010. In the Domain Name System, these domains use an ASCII representation consisting of the prefix xn-- followed by the Punycode translation of the Unicode representation of the language-specific alphabet or script glyphs. For example, the Cyrillic name of Russia&apos;s IDN ccTLD is рф. In Punycode representation, this is plai, and its DNS name is xn--plai. [ Non-IDNA or non-ICANN registries that support non-ASCII domain names ] There are other registries that support non-ASCII domain names. The company ThaiURL.com in Thailand supports.com registrations via its own IDN encoding, ThaiURL. However, since most modern browsers only recognize IDNA/punycode IDNs, ThaiURL-encoded domains must be typed in or linked to in their encoded form, and they will be displayed thus in the address bar. This limits their usefulness; however, they are still valid and universally accessible domains. [ ASCII spoofing concerns ] [ IDN homograph attack ] The use of Unicode in domain names makes it potentially easier to spoof web sites visited by World Wide Web users as the visual representation of an IDN string in a web browser may appear identical to another, depending on the font used. For example, Unicode character U+0430, Cyrillic small letter a, can look identical to Unicode character U+0061, Latin small letter a, used in English. [ Top-level domains accepting IDN registration ] Many top-level domains have started to accept domain name registrations at the second or lower levels. DotAsia, the registrar for the TLD asia, conducted a 70-day sunrise period starting May 11, 2011 for second-level domain registrations in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts. { Dot-Asia releases IDN dates, Managing Internet IP, April 14, 2011. } [ Timeline ] [ http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-duerst-dns-i18n-00 draft-duerst-dns-i18n-00.txt draft-duerst-dns-i18n-00 - Internationalization of Domain Names Tools.ietf.org 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.connect-world.com/articles/old_articles/Dr-TanTinWee.htm the leading Telecom magazine, ICT magazine, Telecom magazine, ICT and Telecom Connect-World 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.apng.org APNG APNG 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.apstar.org The community of Asia Pacific Internet Organization Apstar.Org 2010-07-29 ] [ July 2010 ] [ July 2010 ] [ July 2010 ] [ http://www.delphion.com/details?%26amp%3Bpn%3DUS06182148__ Method and system for internationalizing domain names (US6182148) Delphion.com 2010-07-29 ] [ http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jseng-utf5-00 draft-jseng-utf5-00 - UTF-5, a transformation format of Unicode and ISO 10646 Tools.ietf.org 1999-07-27 2010-07-29 ] [ http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jseng-utf5-01 draft-jseng-utf5-01 - UTF-5, a transformation format of Unicode and ISO 10646 Tools.ietf.org 2000-01-28 2010-07-29 ] [ July 2010 ] [ July 2010 ] [ July 2010 ] [ http://www.apricot.net/apricot2000/index2.html APRICOT 2000 in Seoul Apricot.net 2010-07-29 ] [ July 2010 ] [ http://www.minc.org Multilingual Internet Names Consortium MINC 2010-07-29 ] [ July 2010 ] [ http://www.cdnc.org/english/introduction/index.html Chinese Domain Name Consortium CDNC 2000-05-19 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.cdnc.org/english/news/index.html Chinese Domain Name Consortium CDNC 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.nap.edu/books/0309096405/html/390.html Signposts in Cyberspace: The Domain Name System and Internet Navigation Nap.edu 2001-11-07 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.itu.int/md/T05-SG17-050330/sum/en ITU-T SG17 Meeting Documents Itu.int 2010-07-29 ] [ http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/Multilingual%2BInternet%2BWork%2BProgresses.aspx ITU-T Newslog - Multilingual Internet Work Progresses Itu.int 2006-05-04 2010-07-29 ] [ May 2008 ] [ http://icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-21jan10-en.htm First IDN ccTLDs Requests Successfully Pass String Evaluation 2010-01-21 ICANN ] 1996-12: Martin Dürst&apos;s original Internet Draft proposing UTF5 (the first example of what is known today as an ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE)) – UTF-5 was first defined by Martin Dürst at the University of Zürich http://archive.minc.org/about/history/ 1998-03: Early Research on IDN at National University of Singapore (NUS), Center for Internet Research (formerly Internet Research and Development Unit – IRDU) led by Prof. Tan Tin Wee (T.W.Tan) (IDN Project team – Lim Juay Kwang and Leong Kok Yong) and subsequently continued under a team at Bioinformatrix Pte.
