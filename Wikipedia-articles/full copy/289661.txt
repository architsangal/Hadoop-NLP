According to Cloud, the two were &quot; war buddies, &quot; having worked together on previous missions prior to the one in Nibelheim. [ Final Fantasy VII Square SCE America September 7, 1997 PlayStation Cloud:......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.

But, those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life. They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return! Those are your ancestors. / Cloud:Sephiroth… / Sephiroth:Long ago, disaster struck this planet. Your ancestors escaped… They survived because they hid. The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra.

Finding Tifa wounded by Sephiroth at the Mt. Nibel Mako Reactor, Cloud discovers Sephiroth releasing Jenova, an extraterrestrial life-form and Sephiroth&apos;s &quot; mother, &quot; from imprisonment. Cloud relates to the group that he then confronted Sephiroth, but he is unable to remember the events directly following. [ Final Fantasy VII Square SCE America September 7, 1997 PlayStation Aeris:What happened to Sephiroth? / Cloud:In terms of skill, I couldn&apos;t have killed him. / Tifa:Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper. / Aeris:Shinra, Inc. owns the newspaper, so you can&apos;t rely on that information. / Cloud:......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then. I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn&apos;t he kill me? ] In fact, these events did not occur as Cloud describes; rather, they are an amalgamation of Cloud&apos;s actual past (as a member of the Shinra army who failed to enter SOLDIER) along with his friend Zack &apos;s own past, mixed with memories gleaned from Tifa&apos;s mind, created out of a combination of shame, Jenova cells and manipulation by Sephiroth. [ Final Fantasy VII Square SCE America September 7, 1997 PlayStation Cloud:I never was in SOLDIER. I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, about being in SOLDIER. I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to SOLDIER...... I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from my friend Zack... And I greated an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life..... And I continued to play the charade as if it were true. ] [ Final Fantasy VII Square SCE America September 7, 1997 PlayStation Cloud:You see, someone in SOLDIER isn&apos;t simply exposed to Mako energy. Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells...... For better or for worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER. It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion. But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing. The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth&apos;s strong will, and my own weaknesses are what created me. Everyone knew that. I&apos;m...... Cloud.......the master of my own illusionary world. But I can&apos;t remain trapped in an illusion any more...... I&apos;m going to live my life without pretending. ] The effects of this self-fabrication are made noticeable to the player prior to Cloud&apos;s discovery of the truth—Cloud, at mention of names from the past or moments related thereto, will experience a brief flashback and collapse momentarily, suffering from apparent physical pain, [ Final Fantasy VII Square SCE America September 7, 1997 PlayStation Cloud:Fine, be my guest. / Watch out! This isn&apos;t just a reactor!! / Barret:...What&apos;s wrong? / Cloud:Huh? / Barret:What&apos;s wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up! ] [ Final Fantasy VII Square SCE America September 7, 1997 PlayStation Cloud:It&apos;s about the Ancients. / In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients.

[ Kingdom Hearts coded Square Enix Square Enix, Disney Interactive Studios November 8, 2008 Mobile phone Olympus Coliseum ] [ Concept and creation ] Cloud was one of the first two characters designed for Final Fantasy VII by Tetsuya Nomura with influences from Yoshinori Kitase, Kazushige Nojima and Hironobu Sakaguchi. Originally conceptualized by Sakaguchi as one of only three playable characters in early planning stages for Final Fantasy VII, Cloud&apos;s character saw greater oversight by Nomura than with other characters in previous Final Fantasy projects. [ Interivew with Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura from Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue #196, October 2005. http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml Final Fantasy VII Citadel October 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly October 9, 2007 ] Nomura was called upon to supervise Cloud&apos;s various lines and personality traits. Kitase and Nojima, meanwhile, were in charge of developing Cloud&apos;s background and his relationship with the character of Sephiroth. [ FFVII Not Being Remade – Nomura. http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html IGN June 4, 2008 July 5, 2008 ] When being appointed to write the scenario, Cloud&apos;s false persona was already determined, with Nojima inspired by the character&apos;s first appearance in the story. As the story continued, Nojima focused in making Cloud more mature hoping it could be noticed by the players. Nojima incorporated the character of Zack Fair to the game to expand the mysteries behind Cloud&apos;s background which still were not decided. In expanding Cloud&apos;s character individuality, the staff wanted him to be interesting to players, and focused in working in all his manners and his phrase &quot; Not interested &quot; which is repeated various times in the game. When first reading Nojima&apos;s scenario, Kitase was surprised by Cloud&apos;s persona as he was not simple-minded, feeling him fresh. The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa Lockhart and Aerith Gainsborough was also an aspect the staff found new in the series. Nojima deceived such aspect based on the &quot; high school romance comedy &quot; concept he thought was simple. In early drafts, Cloud was meant to act as an alter ego for Sephiroth when he is influenced to believe he was not the real Cloud, but a creation born from Sephiroth&apos;s will. As in Final Fantasy VII, Cloud would later realize he is the real Cloud, and the reason why Sephiroth could control his mind and body were because of Shinra&apos;s experiments and a weakening within his will. [ 2005 Studio BentStuff Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω Japanese Square-Enix 4-7575-1520-0 528–529 ] Additionally, he was meant to have scarred Tifa prior to the game&apos;s events though the reasons for such an action were unknown. [ 2005 Studio BentStuff Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω Japanese Square-Enix 4-7575-1520-0 518 ] Another scene, implying both of them having sex, was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated none of them thought it would be something so important at the time. [ Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] { Japanese } { Square-Enix } { 8–13 } Nomura has said the original parameters of Cloud&apos;s character design called for slicked-back, black hair with no spikes. This depiction was to serve as a contrast to the long, flowing silver hair of the game&apos;s lead antagonist, Sephiroth. However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role in the game as the lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud&apos;s design to give him spiky, bright, blonde hair. [ McLaughlin, Rus April 30, 2008 IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII http://retro.ign.com/articles/870/870770p1.html IGN August 15, 2010 ] Cloud&apos;s appearance is also marked in Final Fantasy VII with his dark blue SOLDIER outfit, blue eyes and standing 5 feet 8  inches (173 cms). Cloud&apos;s weapon, the Buster Sword, was originally smaller from its final form in the game, but its height increased as Nomura redesigned Cloud. Nomura nicknamed it &quot; the Giant Kitchen Knife &quot; because how he originally envisioned it. [ 2006 SoftBank Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files Japanese/English Square-Enix 4-7973-3498-3 ] The sword was also meant to be held on his back with the use of magnets and have a small chain. Kitase said of the character: [ There wasn&apos;t really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That&apos;s one of the game&apos;s main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn&apos;t a straightforward hero like Superman; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side. Mr. Nomura was also very good at designing a character like that. Yoshinori Kitase Electronic Gaming Monthly, October 2005 ] Nojima has expressed the dynamic of the relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title is something he always puts thought into, and with Final Fantasy VII, Cloud&apos;s subdued nature led him to write scenes with the character in such a way the players would be placed in the position of deciding for themselves what the character was thinking. [ Final Fantasy X Square Co Square EA 2002-01-31 PlayStation 2 Beyond Final Fantasy: Event ] Nomura believes the reason why Cloud has become popular within gamers is due to the impact from his personality made in Nojima&apos;s scenario. [ Further development ] For Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, Nomura agreed to direct the project, largely in part because of his attachment to the character of Cloud. [ Interivew with Kazushige Nojima and Tetsuya Nomura from FLAREgamer. http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p%3D109%26amp%3Bmore%3D1 FLAREgamer October 10, 2005 July 5, 2008 ] Although Nomura stated Cloud was a more upbeat character in Final Fantasy VII, he chose a Cloud whose personality would be more familiar to gamers, and the script was written to explain the reasons for Cloud&apos;s state. Nomura, on explaining Cloud&apos;s situation in the film, said &quot; Cloud tried to lead his life positively after the end of FF7 but he cracked... The sin which Cloud thinks he owns is not anyone&apos;s fault in particular. It is something Cloud has to overcome by himself. &quot; Nojima said the theme of the story is one of redemption. &quot; If you want to be forgiven, you have to take the hard path in life. &quot; Cloud, in choosing to fight against Sephiroth once again, is finally &quot; given healing and forgiveness. &quot; Nomura concluded, &quot; Cloud seems to be a weak guy. Generally, heroes are strong, cool and don&apos;t have any weaknesses... It&apos;s through redemption from his friends and having children to protect that he becomes stronger. &quot; Cloud&apos;s feelings of guilt and regret for not being able to save his friends Zack and Aerith which are symbolized through a grey wolf that appears in scenes in which Cloud thinks about them. The wolf disappears in the film&apos;s end as Cloud comes in terms with his feelings. [ 2006 SoftBank Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files Japanese/English Square-Enix 4-7973-3498-3 86 ] One of the staff&apos;s favorite scenes was the one in which Cloud smiles in an embarrassing way towards a group of children. Nomura liked it as there was almost no dialogue, and the expression in his face already gave viewers his feeling. Composer Nobuo Uematsu commented &quot; It sounds cool! &quot; considering the fact that gamers who have finished Final Fantasy VII would find it hard to imagine how Cloud smiles and that by reading the script to such a scene, he was inspired to write the score. Cloud&apos;s design in the film is a combination of a total of eight designs the staff made which were from deformed to realistic designs. In contrast to his hair, Cloud&apos;s clothes were difficult to make in the film. [ Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Prologue 2005 4-08-779339-7 Japanese Square-Enix ] Cloud&apos;s new weaponry in the film was created based on jokes by fans who commented that because Cloud&apos;s weapon in the original game had an enormous height, in the sequel, he goes with sheer numbers. Although it does not have an official name, the staff named it the Fusion Swords during the film&apos;s development. The concept was to have Cloud hold six swords totally that he would carry on his back, but it then changed to six interlocking swords. Although the film&apos;s staff thought doing sequences with the Fusion Swords was impossible, they decided to make it as they then found as an interesting twist to the battles. Cloud&apos;s new motorcycle, [ Fenrir フェンリル ], was designed by Takayuki Takeya who was asked by the staff to have an upgraded version of Cloud&apos;s &quot; Hardy-Daytona &quot; motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger with Takeya feeling its heaviness gave an impact that worked well within the movie. [ Tetsuya Nomura (Director) April 25, 2006 Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Distance: The Making of Advent Children DVD Square Enix ] Cloud&apos;s Japanese voice actor, Takahiro Sakurai, first voiced his character in Kingdom Hearts with the idea Cloud was a different character from the one of Final Fantasy VII game, which he was a fan of. For Advent Children Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent&apos;s voices to contrast with each other because of their similarities. [ 2006 SoftBank Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files Japanese/English Square-Enix 4-7973-3498-3 49 ] Sakurai expressed pressure for voicing Cloud as it was the sequel from the Final Fantasy VII. Although he did not mind whether critical response regarding his work was positive or not, Sakurai claims he only received praise. When voicing him, Sakurai has in mind that his silence is more expressive than his dialogues and that because of his burdens, he notes Cloud is shown to be a weak person. For Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Cloud was noted by Sakurai to be more normal and more expressive. The final scene in which Cloud screams over Zack&apos;s death was the one in which Sakurai worked the most on, as it left the biggest impression on him. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as a very important character in the series as it reminds him of his own past, and he is still impressed he was able to contribute as his voice actor because he considers himself to be a Final Fantasy VII fan. [ Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] { Japanese } { Square-Enix } In the English adaptations, Cloud has been voiced by Steve Burton who enjoyed dubbing the character and was surprised by how fans recognized him for his work.
