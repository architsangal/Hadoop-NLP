[ the given name and surname ] Magnus, meaning &quot; Great &quot; in Latin, was sometimes used as a first name among Romans but was not particularly common among them. The best-known Roman bearing the name was the third-century usurper. The name gained wider popularity in the Middle Ages, various European peoples, and their royal houses, being introduced to it upon being converted to the Latin-speaking Catholic Christianity. This was especially the case with Scandinavia n royalty and nobility. As a Scandinavian forename, it was extracted from the Frankish ruler Charlemagne &apos;s Latin name &quot; Carolus Magnus &quot; and re-analyzed as Old Norse magn-hús = &quot; house of might/power &quot;.
