[ http://www.carautoportal.com/audi/audi-a6.php Audi A6 Reference 2009-06-22 CarAutoPortal.com ] In 1994, the latest generation (C4) of the Audi 100 was facelifted and re-badged as the Audi A6, to fit in with Audi&apos;s new alphanumeric nomenclature (as the full-size A8 had just been introduced). The exterior was changed only slightly from the &quot; C4 &quot; Audi 100 – new front and rear lights, new radiator grille, similarly with chassis and engine and transmission choices. The United Kingdom was the first market to receive the A6, as stock of right-hand-drive Audi 100s had run out before expected, and before the rest of mainland Europe. The new engines for the A6 were 1.8-litre 20v inline four-cylinder, and 2.8-litre 30v V6 petrol engine s, with the 2.3-litre inline five engine being dropped on most markets. For the diesel engine s, an inline four 1.9 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI), and the inline five (R5) 2.5 TDI ( [ 103 kW PS bhp 0 on on ] ) were available. Until 1997, the A6 came with several different engines, two of them turbodiesel, and most of them available with Audi&apos;s Torsen -based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The A6 was available with saloon and Avant bodies. [ C4 engines ] The C4 design was available with the following engines : [ 92 kW PS bhp 0 on on ] [ 74 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 85 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 103 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 98 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 110 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 128 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 142 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 66 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 85 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 103 kW PS bhp 0 on ] engine configuration Max. motive power petrol engine s 1.8 20v Inline 4 DOHC 2.0 8v Inline 4 SOHC 2.0 8v Inline 4 SOHC 2.0 16v Inline 4 DOHC 2.3 10v Inline 5 SOHC 2.6 12v V6 SOHC 2.8 12v V6 SOHC 2.8 30v V6 DOHC diesel engine s 1.9 TDI 8v Inline 4 SOHC 2.5 TDI 10v Inline 5 SOHC 2.5 TDI 10v Inline 5 SOHC [ http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid%3Dc95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD%26amp%3Bvgnextrefresh%3D1%26amp%3BID%3D6056 NHTSA crash test; Audi A6 NHTSA ] [ 5 5 ] [ 5 5 ] [ http://www.safecarguide.com/mak/audi/idx.htm Folksam crash testing: Audi A6 Folksam ] Crash testing NHTSA Frontal impact; Driver side: NHTSA Frontal impact; Passenger side: Folksam overall frontal crash test: Good [ S6 ] [ Audi S6 ] A higher performance version of the C4 A6, called the Audi S6 was produced.

This new A6 moved up a notch in quality, and was marketed in the same categories as the BMW 5-Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The Italian-redesigned body presented a modern design, with a fastback styling which set the trend for the Audi lineup, and gave the relatively large saloon an aerodynamic shell with a low coefficient of drag of 0.28. In 2000 and 2001, the &quot; C5 &quot; A6 was on Car and Driver magazine&apos;s Ten Best list. This new A6 was available with a wide range of engines and configurations. The 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre V6 engine s represented the bulk of the A6&apos;s development programme, with a multitude of other engine configurations available throughout the globe. As an alternative to the manual transmission, a five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was also available. The C5 saloon variant arrived in late 1997, and the Avant in 1998 in Europe. In the United States, the C4 continued for 1997, with the C5 saloon available in 1998, and the C5 Avant available in 1999. In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi&apos;s name for an estate/wagon ) available at all in 1998 – Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 model year, and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1999 in conjunction with its release in the US. As a result of complying with FMVSS, the North American models were equipped with front and rear bumper s that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received daytime running lights as standard equipment. North American C5 A6 models received the 2.8-litre, 30-valve V6 engine, the 2.7-litre &quot; biturbo &quot; V6 (also found in the B5 platform S4), and the 4.2-litre 40-valve V8 petrol engine s. The V8 models arrived with significantly altered exterior body panels, with slightly more flared wheel arches (fenders), revised headlamp s and grille design (before being introduced in 2002 to all other A6 models), larger roadwheels (8Jx17-inch), larger brake s and Torsen -based quattro permanent four-wheel drive as standard. In 2002, the A6 received a facelift, with revised headlight and grille design, exposed exhaust tips, and slight changes to accessory body molding s, and taillight colour from red to amber in North American models. A new host of engines were also introduced. The 1.8-litre engine was deleted and replaced by a 2.0-litre powerplant with [ 96 kW PS bhp 0 on ]. The 1.9-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) was tweaked to produce a maximum motive power output of [ 96 kW PS bhp 0 ], and [ 310 Nm 0 on ] of torque, receiving a six-speed manual gearbox in the process. The 2.4-litre V6 gained an extra 5  hp and better balancing, and the 2.8-litre V6 engine was replaced by a 3.0-litre engine with [ 162 kW PS bhp 0 ]. The turbocharged 2.7-litre was revised, resulting in [ 184 kW PS bhp 0 ] and [ 330 Nm 0 ], controlled by standard quattro. The V6 diesel was also slightly modified resulting in [ 120 kW PS bhp 0 ] (after the second modification) and [ 350 Nm 0 ]. A new more powerful V6 diesel was also introduced with [ 132 kW PS bhp 0 ] and [ 370 Nm 0 ]. The 4.2-litre V8 engine which arrived in 2001 remained unchanged. Also new was the revolutionary multitronic continuously variable transmission, available in most front-wheel drive models. All models, except the 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-litre TDI, were available with Audi&apos;s trademark four-wheel-drive system, quattro. A four-wheel-drive version of the Avant, with raised ground clearance and slightly altered styling was sold as the Audi allroad quattro, Audi&apos;s first crossover SUV. Regarding this C5 generation, Car and Driver magazine stated, &quot; It is one of the most winsome mid-sizers to meet pavement, with some of the nicest handling this side of a BMW. In 2000, the moderate performance of this otherwise excellent, 3.0-litre V6-powered, sedan was improved by the addition of two higher-performance versions: the [ 250 PS kW hp on ], 2.7-litre bi-turbo V6 and the [ 300 PS kW hp on ], 4.2-litre V8, both with Audi&apos;s quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. In mid-2003, major muscle came along in the limited-run RS6 – powered by a [ 450 PS kW bhp 0 on ], twin-turbo V8 engine – which immediately finished first in a C/D comparison test &quot;. [ May 2009 ] The second-generation A6 was on Car and Driver magazine&apos;s Ten Best list for 2000 and 2001. The updated 2005 A6 won the World Car of the Year award for 2005. In addition, the facelifted third-generation A6 3.0T won two Car and Driver &quot; comparos &quot; that pitted it against other sedans like the BMW 5-Series, the Mercedes E-Class, the Jaguar XF, and the Infinti M.

It was available as a saloon and Avant. [ Audi RS6 ] In the late years of the A6 C5 design, an ultra-high-performance limited-run Audi RS6 model was presented. Weighing in excess of [ 1840 kg 0 on ] and producing [ 331 kW PS bhp 0 on ] and [ 560 Nm 0 on ], it propels the RS6 from 0- [ 100 km/h 1 ] in 4.5  seconds, and on to [ 200 km/h 1 on ] in under 17  seconds. Initially available as only an Avant, a saloon variant was later added. [ Allroad quattro (1999–2005) ] Audi allroad quattro 2.5 TDI (Germany) Audi allroad quattro 2.5 TDI (Germany) Audi&apos;s C5 series A6 Avant formed the basis for an semi-offroad model in 1999, labeled &quot; Audi allroad quattro &quot;. Compared to the regular A6, the allroad featured an advanced air suspension system, allowing for increased ground clearance; larger wheels with all-terrain tyres, and flared and unpainted bumper s, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain. As the name &quot; allroad quattro &quot; suggests, Audi&apos;s Torsen -based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system was standard equipment for all versions. The standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide [ 208 mm in 0 on ] of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing. Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only [ 142 mm in 0 on ] above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension. Audi&apos;s 2.7-litre, twin-turbo V6 petrol engine with [ 250 PS kW hp 0 on ] of power and [ 350 Nm lbft 0 on ] of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5-litre TDI diesel unit with [ 132 kW hp 0 on ] and [ 370 Nm lbft 0 on ] of torque. A variant of the corporate 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine, was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163  bhp) followed in 2004. Audi stopped production of the Allroad in July 2005. Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America. [ C5 engines ] The C5 design was available with the following engines : [ 100 km/h 0 on ] [ 1781 cc 1 on on ] [ 92 kW PS bhp 0 on on ] [ 168 Nm 0 on on ] [ 203 km/h 0 on ] [ 1781 cc 1 on ] [ 110 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 210 Nm 0 on ] [ 207 km/h 0 on ] [ 1984 cc 1 on ] [ 96 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 195 Nm 0 on ] [ 203 km/h 0 on ] [ 2393 cc 1 on ] [ 121 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 230 Nm 0 on ] [ 220 km/h 0 on ] [ 2393 cc 1 on ] [ 125 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 230 Nm 0 on ] [ 224 km/h 0 on ] [ 2671 cc 1 on ] [ 169 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 310 Nm 0 on ] [ 247 km/h 0 on ] [ 2671 cc 1 on ] [ 184 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 350 Nm 0 on ] [ 248 km/h 0 on ] [ 2771 cc 1 on ] [ 142 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 280 Nm 0 on ] [ 236 km/h 0 on ] [ 2976 cc 1 on ] [ 162 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 300 Nm 0 on ] [ 243 km/h 0 on ] [ 4172 cc 1 on ] [ 225 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 400 Nm 0 on ] [ 250 km/h 0 on ] [ 4172 cc 1 on ] [ 339 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 550 Nm 0 on ] [ 4172 cc 1 on ] [ 339 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 550 Nm 0 on ] [ 1896 cc 1 on on ] [ 81 kW PS bhp 0 on on ] [ 235 Nm 0 on on ] [ 194 km/h 0 on ] [ 1896 cc 1 on ] [ 85 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 285 Nm 0 on ] [ 196 km/h 0 on ] [ 1896 cc 1 on ] [ 96 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 285 Nm 0 on ] [ 203 km/h 0 on ] [ 1896 cc 1 on ] [ 96 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 310 Nm 0 on ] [ 203 km/h 0 on ] [ 2496 cc 1 on ] [ 110 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 310 Nm 0 on ] [ 215 km/h 0 on ] [ 2496 cc 1 on ] [ 114 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 310 Nm 0 on ] [ 219 km/h 0 on ] [ 2496 cc 1 on ] [ 120 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 310 Nm 0 on ] [ 222 km/h 0 on ] [ 2496 cc 1 on ] [ 120 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 350 Nm 0 on ] [ 222 km/h 0 on ] [ 2496 cc 1 on ] [ 132 kW PS bhp 0 on ] [ 370 Nm 0 on ] [ 221 km/h 0 on ] engine name displacement engine configuration Max. motive power at rpm (Directive 80/1269/EEC) max. torque at rpm 0- (saloon) top speed (saloon) years petrol engine s all multi-point sequential fuel injection 1.8 20v Inline 4 DOHC @ 5,800 @ 3,500 11.3   sec 1997– 2001 1.8 20v Turbo Inline 4 DOHC @ 5,700 @ 1,750–4,600 9.3  sec 1997– 2002 2.0 20v Inline 4 DOHC @ 5,700 @ 3,300 10.5  sec 2001– 2005 2.4 30v V6 2xDOHC @ 6,000 @ 3,200 9.2  sec 1997– 2001 2.4 30v V6 2xDOHC @ 6,000 @ 3,200 9.3  sec 2001– 2005 2.7 30v Turbo V6 2xDOHC @ 5,800 @ 1,700 7.5  sec 1999– 2001 2.7 30v Turbo V6 2xDOHC @ 5,800 @ 1,800 6.8  sec 2000– 2005 2.8 30v V6 2xDOHC @ 6,000 @ 3,200 8.1  sec 1997– 2001 3.0 30v V6 2xDOHC @ 6,300 @ 3,200 7.5  sec 2001– 2005 4.2 40v V8 2xDOHC @ 6,200 @ 3,000 6.7  sec (elec. limited) 1999– 2005 4.2TT 40v V8 2xDOHC @ 2,800 @ 2,000 4.5  sec 168  mph (unlimited) 2003– 2004 4.2TT 40v V8 2xDOHC @ 2,800 @ 2,000 4.5  sec 174  mph (unlimited) 2005 diesel engine s all Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) 1.9 TDI 8v Inline 4 SOHC @ 4,150 @ 1,900 12.6   sec 1997– 2000 1.9 TDI 8v Inline 4 SOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,900 11.6  sec 1998– 2001 1.9 TDI 8v Inline 4 SOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,750–2,500 10.5  sec 2001– 2005 1.9 TDI 8v Inline 4 SOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,900 10.5  sec 2001– 2005 2.5 TDI 24v V6 2x DOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,500–3,200 10.0  sec 1997– 2001 2.5 TDI 24v V6 2xDOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,400–3,500 9.7  sec 2001– 2002 2.5 TDI 24v V6 2xDOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,400–3,600 9.3  sec 2002– 2005 2.5 TDI 24v V6 2xDOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,500–3,000 9.3  sec 2003– 2005 2.5 TDI 24v V6 2xDOHC @ 4,000 @ 1,500–2,500 8.9  sec 1999– 2005 [ C6 4F ] [ C6 (Typ 4F, 2004–2011) ] [ 2843 mm 1 on ] { LWB: } [ 2945 mm 1 on ] [ 4927 mm 1 on ] { LWB: } [ 5035 mm 1 on ] [ 1855 mm 1 on ] { saloon: } [ 1459 mm 1 on ] { Avant: } [ 1463 mm 1 on ] { LWB: } [ 1485 mm 1 on ] [ 1520 - 1845 kg 1 on on ] { Audi S6 (2006–2011) } { Audi RS6 (2008–2010) } { Walter de&apos;Silva } { uk } Audi A6 (C6) 3.2 FSI quattro saloon (Australia) Audi A6 (C6) Avant (Germany) The Typ 4F A6 was released in 2004. Designed by Walter de&apos;Silva, this model was visually an evolution of the C5, but was lengthened to [ 4927 mm 1 ], and incorporates the new Audi trademark &quot; single-frame grille &quot;. Like other contemporary Audis, the A6 had a &quot; tornado line &quot; that ram just below the sheetmetal&apos;s shoulders and joins the front and rear light clusters. [ http://autos.aol.com/cars-Audi-A6-2009/expert-review/ 2009 Audi A6 Reviews, Expert Car Reviews on AOL Autos Autos.aol.com 2012-03-24 ] The C6 iteration of the A6 features more sophisticated technology. Most notable is the Multi Media Interface (MMI), which is a system controlling in-car entertainment, satellite navigation, climate control, car settings such as suspension configuration and optional electronic accessories through a central screen interface. This has the advantage of minimising the wealth of buttons normally found on a dashboard by replacing them with controls which operate multiple devices using the integrated display. On the internal combustion engine s, the new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The multitronic continuously variable transmission continues as an alternative for front-wheel drive models, alongside a new six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission available in the four-wheel drive models. Audi&apos;s &quot; trademark &quot; Torsen -based quattro permanent four-wheel drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. quattro is not available on the multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and tiptronic gear systems. Conversely the tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre V6 engine, but not for the North American market. In 2005, the A6 won the World Car of the Year award, and has also won the Practical Caravan &quot; Towcar of the Year &quot; awards, due to its array of towing features such as adjustable suspension height and damping, and the presence of a Trailer Stability Programme. Like the previous model, the A6 is available with other body options. The Avant arrived during the course of 2005, while in China, a long wheelbase version was introduced in the same year, named A6L. [ http://www.audiworld.com/news/05/chinaa6/content.shtml New Audi A6 presented as a Long-Wheelbase version exclusively for China 2005-03-08 AudiWorld.com 2009-02-03 ] The allroad variant (now called A6 allroad quattro) made its debut in 2006, and as before, is an off-road ready version of the Avant, available with either a 2.7-litre V6 or 3.0-litre V6 Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engine s, or a 3.2-litre V6 or 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine. Interior Centre console of C6 A6, showing tiptronic gear shift lever, Multi Media Interface (MMI) controls, and electronic parking brake [ S6 and RS6 ] [ Audi S6 ] The Audi S6 performance variant was introduced in the Frankfurt Motor Show, and produced from early 2006 until 2011. It is powered by a 5.2-litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V10 engine producing a [ 320 kW PS bhp 0 on ] and [ 540 Nm 0 on ]. The S6 reaches [ 100 km/h 1 ] from a standstill in 5.2  seconds, and the quarter mile 13.5  seconds. [ http://www.jbcarpages.com/audi/a6/ Audi A6 &amp; S6 Reviews &amp; Specs JB car pages ] [ Audi RS6 ] The latest version of ultra-high-performance Audi RS6 was launched in September 2008 and produced until the third quarter of 2010. Based upon the V10 engine powering the S6, the RS6 features an all- aluminium alloy 5.0-litre ( [ 4991 cc on ] ) 90° V10 twin-turbo charged, Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), with a dry sump lubrication system. It produces a power output of [ 426 kW PS bhp 0 on ], and [ 650 Nm 0 on ] of torque, making it the most powerful vehicle ever produced by Audi. Initially available only as an Avant, the saloon version was released in late 2008. [ A6 allroad quattro (2006–2011) ] Pre-facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TDI Facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TFSI Audi announced the C6 series allroad in the spring of 2005 and released it in the summer of 2006. This model was called the Audi A6 allroad quattro (unlike the previous version, which was merely called Audi allroad quattro, with no reference to the A6 nomenclature). The Audi A6 allroad quattro again featured adaptive air suspension and quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The A6 allroad was powered by a choice of two Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) petrol engine s, a 3.2-litre V6 and a 4.2-litre V8, and two TDI diesel engine s, a 180  PS (132  kW) 2.7  L and a 233  PS (171  kW) 3.0  L. The tiptronic gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI. The 6-speed tiptronic transmission system converted high-torque engine power into both sporty performance and operating convenience, with crisp, fast gear changes. Advanced electronics respond efficiently to all driver input in both D (Drive) and S (Sport) programmes, helping to prevent unwanted upshifts when cornering. The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to 60  mm (2.36  in) to provide ground clearance of 185  mm (7.28  in) which is better than the older four-mode. The car featured a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills. In some European markets, this A6 allroad quattro was more expensive than the larger Audi Q7, but air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7. In its native country, Germany, it costed a few hundred Euros less than the Q7. [ C6 facelift ] Audi (C6) A6 Avant (facelifted) Audi (C6) A6 sedan (facelifted) Audi unveiled a facelifted &quot; C6 &quot; Audi A6 on 12 August 2008, at the Moscow International Motor Show. The refresh incorporates some modern Audi design cues to keep the A6 current with the rest of the Audi lineup. There are minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear lights which now have daytime running LEDs, the taillights extend towards the center of the trunk lid and pinch off at the license plate mount, however their shape remains rectangular compared to the more sculpted light clusters found in the 2008 Audi A5, 2009 Audi A4, and 2009 Audi Q5 (the latter three being all-new generations). The intakes below the headlamps are inspired by the Audi RS5. The A6&apos;s six (per side) front light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights (DRLs) are located within the main headlamp housing, similar to RS6&apos;s placement of the LEDs (ten per side), whereas on the S6 these front LEDs (five per side) are found adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper. The RS6, which was unveiled in April 2008, already sported the new front and rear fascias that would feature on the facelifted A6 and S6 lineup. Also updated for 2009 is the Quattro all-wheel drive setup, which is already found on the 2008 Audi A5 and 2009 Audi A4. This new system features a 40/60 front-to-rear torque split and offers a more balanced feel, reducing the understeer that comes from 50/50 AWD platforms. There are now six petrol and four diesel engines available for the upgraded A6.

There is a new petrol engine, a [ 300 PS kW bhp 0 on on ] 3.0-litre supercharged V6, badged as 3.0 TFSI or 3.0T. This new engine is shared with the 2010 Audi S4 and S5 Cabriolet, although in the latter two applications in a higher state of tune and mated to a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. The new engine and revised quattro system give the 2009 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI almost equivalent performance to the Audi S6 5.2 FSI (which is unchanged except for receiving the cosmetic tweaks like the rest of the Audi A6 lineup). Moreover, the S6&apos;s weight is 4,500 pounds and 59 percent of weight is distributed to the front which increases understeer.
