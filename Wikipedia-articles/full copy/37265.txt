The family is not as well known to history, as is the junior Franconia n branch. (The Franconian branch became Burgraves of Nuremberg and later ruled Brandenburg-Prussia and the German Empire.) The senior branch ruled, and the dynasty took its name from, the Swabian County of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ( [ Grafschaft Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ] ), which later became a principality (Fürstentum Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen). [ History ] The County of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was created in 1576, upon the partition of the County of Hohenzollern, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. When the last count of Hohenzollern, Charles I (1512–1579) died, the territory was to be divided up between his three sons: Eitel Frederick IV of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1545–1605) Charles II of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1547–1606) Christopher of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch (1552–1592) The Princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ruled over a small principality in southwest Germany, with a seat at Sigmaringen Castle. Unlike the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg and Prussia, the Hohenzollern of Sigmaringen, and their cousins of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, the seniormost branch of the Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollern, and Hohenzollern of Haigerloch, remained Roman Catholic. The principality became an independent state in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. Its ruler was deposed in the revolutions of 1848. His son, Karl Anton, succeeded him, and turned to Prussia for aid. Prussian troops arrived in August 1849, and in a treaty signed in December Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was annexed by Prussia, effective in March 1850. The annexation of their state did not, however, mean the end of the importance of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Arms The last prince, Karl Anton, served as Minister-President of Prussia from 1858-61. Karl Anton&apos;s second son, Karl Eitel Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became prince (1866 –1881) and then king (1881 –1914) of the Romanians, under the name Carol and the house remained on the throne until the end of the Romanian monarchy in 1947. Because the Hohenzollern-Hechingen line died out in 1869 with the death of Constantine of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, the head of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, took the title of prince (Fürst) of Hohenzollern instead of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. French opposition to the candidacy of Carol&apos;s elder brother Prince Leopold for the throne of Spain triggered the Franco-Prussian War (1870 –1871), which led to the founding of the German Empire in January 1871. [ Noble jurisdictions, titles and styles ] [ Southern Germany ] Hohenzollern region (Württemberg, Germany). [ Noble jurisdiction ] The head of the Swabian branch, of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, ruled over the following noble jurisdictions held in a personal union : countship of Hohenzollern (1061) burgraviate of Nuremberg (1192) countship of Veringen (1535) lordship of Haigerloch (1634) lordship of Wehrstein (1634) County of Berg (1781) From 1061 until 1806 the six fiefs were an imperial immediacy of the Holy Roman Empire and the count of Zollern, and his successors, was a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor. From 1806 until 1813 the fiefs were a province of the Confederation of the Rhine, a short-lived state set up by Napoleon I Bonaparte. From 1815 until 1849 the principality was a sovereign country, who was a member of the German Confederation. In 1849 it lost its independence, and was incorporated into the kingdom of Prussia as the province of Hohenzollern. The German Confederation was succeeded in 1866 by the North German Confederation, which itself was succeeded by the German Empire in 1871. In 1918, the kingdom of Prussia became the Free State of Prussia, and the German Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. In 1933 the republic was replaced by the Third Reich. After the defeat of the national-socialists in 1945 the province of Hohenzollern was merged with other territories into the state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern. This state was part of the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany until 1952. In that year, the state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern was merged into Baden-Württemberg, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Prince Karl Eitel of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and descendants of his nephew Ferdinand ruled over the Kingdom of Romania, as Karl Eitel did not have children. As monarch, the king of the Romanians was a sovereign and head of state. The modern state of Romania was formed by the merging of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 under the Moldavian domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He was replaced by Karl Eitel of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in 1866, who became known as Prince Carol I of Romania. During the Russo-Turkish War, Romania fought on the Russian side. In the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, Romania was subsequently recognized as an independent state by the Great Powers. In return for ceding to Russian Empire the three southern districts of Bessarabia that had been regained by Moldavia after the Crimean War in 1852, Northern Dobruja was acquired. In 1881, the principality was raised to a kingdom and Prince Carol became King Carol I. In 1947 the king was deposed and a people&apos;s republic proclaimed. In 1989 the communist regime fell and was succeeded by a democratic republic. In 1918 Transylvania and Bessarabia are incorporated. In 1918-19, confirmed by the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 and the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, most of the Banat became part of Romania. Also Bukovina was incorporated in 1918. On 10 May 2011, on a background of lawsuits in Germany brought against his family by his German relatives regarding the former name Hohenzollern-Veringen of his son in law, Radu, King Michael of Romania severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, changed the name of his family to &quot; of Romania &quot;, and gave up all princely titles conferred to him and to his family by the German Hohenzollerns. { King Michael I announces the severance of all historical and dynastic ties to the House of Hohenzollern, } { Adevarul, May 11, 2011 } { The history of the conflicts between the Royal House of Romania and the Princely House of Hohenzollern, } { Adevarul, May 11, 2011 } [ Noble titles ] The head of the Romanian branch is a pretender to the title of: King of the Romanians The first degree descendants of the head of the Romanian branch&apos;&apos;&apos; born within holy matrimony and in good standing are pretenders to the title of: Prince or Princess of Romania During the reign of Carol II of Romania his son, Michael was styled &quot; Măria Sa (M.S.) Marele Voievod de Alba Iulia &quot; or the English translation &quot; His Grace (H.G.) The Grand Voievod Of Alba Iulia &quot;. This was done because being a former King, Michael could not be styled again Crown Prince, so his father solved the problem with this agreement.
