[ February 2009 ] [ Pope Felix III Felix3.jpg ??? 13 March 483 3 January 492 Simplicius Gelasius I ??? Rome, Western Roman Empire 492 Rome, Kingdom of Odoacer Felix ] [ Pope Felix III His Holiness Your Holiness Holy Father Saint ] Pope Saint Felix III (though as Antipope Felix the &quot; II &quot; was not actually pope, he could also be called &quot; Pope St. Felix II &quot; ) was pope from 13 March 483 to 3 January 492. His repudiation of the Henoticon is considered the beginning of the Acacian schism. [ Biography ] Felix was born into a Roman senatorial family and was a great-great-grandfather of Pope Gregory I. { R.A. Markus, Gregory the Great and his world (Cambridge: University Press, 1997), p. 8 } He was a widower with two children when he was elected to succeed Pope Simplicius in 483. It is said that Felix appeared as an apparition to one of his descendants, his great-granddaughter Trasilla (an aunt of Pope Gregory I), and asked her to enter Heaven through death, and on the eve of Christmas Trasilla died, seeing Jesus Christ beckoning. [ 15026a Sts. Trasilla and Emiliana ] [ As Pope ] His first act was to repudiate the Henoticon, a deed of union originating with Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople and published by Emperor Zeno with the view of allaying the strife between the Miaphysite Christians and Chalcedonian Christians. He also addressed a letter of remonstrance to Acacius. The latter proved refractory and sentence of deposition was passed against Acacius. In his first synod, Felix excommunicated Peter the Fuller, who had assumed the See of Antioch against papal wishes. In 484, Felix also excommunicated Peter Mongus, who had taken the See of Alexandria, an act that brought about a schism between East and West that was not healed until 519. [ 06030b Pope St. Felix III ] Felix is often quoted as saying “Not to oppose error is to approve it; and not to defend truth is to suppress it, and, indeed, to neglect to confound evil men—when we can do it—is no less a sin than to encourage them.” [ March 2009 ] [ References ] [ ca ] [ Simplicius ] [ Pope 483–492 ] [ Gelasius I ] [ Felix III Pope Rome, Western Roman Empire 492 Rome, Kingdom of Odoacer ] Category:492 deaths Felix 03 Felix 03 Category:5th-century archbishops Category:5th-century Christian saints Category:Ancient Christian controversies Category:5th-century Italian people af:Pous Felix III bg:Феликс III br:Feliks III ca:Fèlix III ceb:Félix III cs:Felix II. da:Pave Felix 2. de:Felix II.
