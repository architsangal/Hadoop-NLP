It also nationalised the Australian Broadcasting Company which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations. On 1 July 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia&apos;s capital cities. { Perth headquarters in 1937. } Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy.

Other television programs at the time included the popular Six O&apos;Clock Rock hosted by Johnny O&apos;Keefe, Mr Squiggle, as well as operas and plays. In 1975, colour television was introduced into Australia, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ ( Double Jay ), which was eventually expanded into the national Triple J FM network. A year later, a national classical music network was established on the FM band, broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM – referring both to its &apos;fine music&apos; programming and radio frequency. [ About the ABC – The 60s and 70s Australian Broadcasting Corporation http://abc.net.au/corp/history/hist5.htm ] In 1978 the ABC NSW Staff Association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference.

At the same time, the newly-formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring – program production in indigenous affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded, while the Corporation&apos;s output of drama was boosted. Local production trebled from 1986–91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements. [ About the ABC – The 80s Australian Broadcasting Corporation http://abc.net.au/corp/history/hist6.htm 1 October 2007 ] The changes also led to the split of television and radio operations into two separate divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering undertaken. Geoffrey Whitehead was the initial Managing Director, however following his resignation in 1986, David Hill (at the time chair of the ABC Board) took over his position. A new Concert Music department was formed in 1985 to coordinate the corporation&apos;s six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy in order to better respond to local needs. Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the Orchestras&apos; audience reach. ABC Radio was restructured significantly in 1985 – Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as Radio National (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as The World Today, Australia All Over, and The Coodabeen Champions were introduced, while ABC-FM established an Australian Music Unit in 1989. Radio Australia began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the 1987 Fijian coup, Tiananmen Square massacre, and the First Gulf War. { Ultimo. } In 1991, the Corporation&apos;s Sydney radio and orchestral operations moved to a new building built by Leighton Holdings [ Leighton Holdings History Leighton Holdings http://www.leighton.com.au/about_us/history/history.html 2 February 2008 ] on a single site in the inner-city suburb of Ultimo.

Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results. By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24 hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters. Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990. ABC NewsRadio, a continuous news network broadcast on the Parliamentary and News Network when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994. International television service Australia Television International was established in 1993, while at the same Radio Australia increased its international reach. Reducing funding in 1997 for Radio Australia resulted in staff and programming cuts. Australia Television was sold to the Seven Network in 1998, however the service continued to show ABC news and current affairs programming up until its closure in 2001.

In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities – heralded at the time as &apos;the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour.&apos; The first programs to be produced in widescreen were drama series Something in the Air, Grass Roots and In the Mind of the Architect. At the same time, the ABC&apos;s Multimedia division was renamed &apos;ABC New Media&apos;, becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio. Legislation allowed the ABC to provide &apos;multichannels&apos; – additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, Fly TV and the ABC Kids Channel launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children. In 2002, the ABC launched ABC Asia Pacific – the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network Radio Australia, the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly and the ABC Kid&apos;s Channel. The ABC also launched a digital radio service, ABC DiG, in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until DAB+ became available in 2009. { ABC2 launched on 7 March 2005 } ABC2, a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005.

In addition, DiG Radio launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations. ABC Local Radio is the Corporation&apos;s flagship radio station in each broadcast area. There are 54 individual stations, each with a similar format consisting of locally presented light entertainment, news, talk back, music, sport and interviews, in addition to some national programming such as AM, PM, The World Today, sporting events and Nightlife. ABC Radio National broadcasts more than 60 special interest programs per week covering a range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs. ABC NewsRadio is a rolling news service, previously known as the Parliamentary and News Network. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programs are relayed from the BBC World Service, NPR, Deutsche Welle, Radio Netherlands and CNN Radio. ABC Classic FM was the ABC&apos;s first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as &quot; ABC FM &quot;, and for a short time &quot; ABC Fine Music &quot;. Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as BBC Radio 3. Triple J is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18–35. While the network plays music from around the world, it has a strong focus on local artists. Triple J was formerly known as &quot; Double Jay &quot; when it launched in Sydney on 19 January 1975. [ Television ] [ ABC Television ] Within Australia, the ABC operates four channels. ABC1, the Corporation&apos;s original television service, receives the bulk of funding for television and shows first-run comedy, drama, documentaries, and news and current affairs. In each state and territory a local news bulletin is shown at 7.00  p.m. nightly. In 2001 ABC TV launched its digital service. ABC2, launched in 2005, is a digital-only channel that shows repeated programs from ABC1, as well as some original content including news programs, children&apos;s shows, animation, and music shows. In September 2007, the Australian government announced a proposal to launch a new digital-only children&apos;s channel, to be named ABC3.

This unit continued until 2000, when the New Media division was formed, bringing together the ABC&apos;s online output as a division similar to Television or Radio. The division had over a million pages of material published by late 2003. In 2001 the New Media division became New Media and Digital Services, reflecting the broader remit to develop content for digital platforms such as digital television. In addition to ABC Online, the division also had responsibility over the ABC&apos;s two digital television services, Fly TV and the ABC Kids Channel, until their closure in 2003.

In conjunction with the ABC&apos;s radio division, New Media and Digital Services implemented the ABC&apos;s first podcasts in December 2004. By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programs delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week, [ Podcasting: ABC Radio National Tops 100,000 mp3s in One Week Australian Broadcasting Corporation http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1409756.htm 1 October 2007 ] including trial video podcasts of The Chaser&apos;s War on Everything and jtv.

The letters &quot; ABC &quot; were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC&apos;s official logo. Kennard was presented with £ 25 for his design. Since its original introduction in 1965, it has been updated several times, including with the introduction of colour television in 1975. The line was thickened to feature colour in the logo. The 1975 logo is the longest-running logo, with a lifespan of 27 years. In 2001, with the introduction of digital television in Australia, ABC Television adopted a modified version of the logo, featuring a silver 3D look and losing the &quot; over and under &quot; design. However, despite the launch of this logo, the 1975 logo is still used by the corporation. In July 2002, to celebrate the ABC&apos;s 70th anniversary, the corporation adopted a new logo across all media. This new logo still used the silver 3D colour but reverted to its &quot; over and under &quot; design. The 2002 logo is still in use today.
