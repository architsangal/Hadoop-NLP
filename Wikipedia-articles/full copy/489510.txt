Additionally, he was the editor for writer Alan Moore and illustrator Dave Gibbons &apos; influential DC miniseries Watchmen. Wein was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2008. [ Biography ] [ Early career ] In 2003 interview, Len Wein recalled that he &quot; was a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age seven, my dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. And I was hooked. When my eighth grade art teacher, Mr. Smedley, told me he thought I had actual art talent, I decided to devote all my efforts in that direction in the hope that I might someday get into the comics biz. &quot; [ http://www.comicsbulletin.com/wolfman/104904908691023.htm Speaking With... Len Wein Wolfman Marv Marv Wolfman March 30, 2003 &quot; What Th--? &quot; (column) Comics Bulletin http://www.webcitation.org/5v1pNP1CU December 16, 2010 y ] Approximately once a month, as a teenager, Wein and his friend Marv Wolfman took DC Comics &apos; weekly Thursday afternoon tour of the company&apos;s offices. Wolfman was active in fanzine culture, and together he and Wein produced sample superhero stories to show to the DC editorial staff. At that point, Wein was more interested in becoming an artist than a writer. In a 2008 interview, Wein said his origins as an artist have helped him &quot; describe art to an artist so that I can see it all in my own head &quot;, and claimed he &quot; used to have artists, especially at DC, guys like Irv Novick and a few of the others, who would come into the office waiting for their next assignment and ask [editor] Julie Schwartz, &apos;Do you have any Len Wein scripts lying around? He&apos;s always easy to draw.&apos; &quot; Eventually, DC editor Joe Orlando hired both Wolfman and Wein as freelance writers. { Stroud, Bryan D. &quot; Len Wein Interview &quot;, The Silver Age Sage, 2008. } Wein&apos;s first professional comics story was &quot; Eye of the Beholder &quot; in DC&apos;s Teen Titans #18 (Dec. 1968), for which he created Red Star, the first official Russian superhero in the DC universe. Neal Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a Teen Titans story which had been written by Wein and Wolfman. The story, titled &quot; Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho! &quot;, would have introduced DC&apos;s first African American superhero but was rejected by publisher Carmine Infantino.

Later that year, Wein was writing anthological mystery stories for DC&apos;s The House of Secrets and Marvel&apos;s Tower of Shadows and Chamber of Darkness. He additionally began writing for DC&apos;s romance comic Secret Hearts and the company&apos;s toy-line tie-in Hot Wheels; Skywald Publications &apos; horror -comics magazine s Nightmare and Psycho and its short-lived Western comic books The Bravados and The Sundance Kid; and Gold Key &apos;s Mod Wheels, Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery, the toyline tie-in Microbots, and the TV-series tie-ins Star Trek and The Twilight Zone.

[ McAvennie Michael Dolan Hannah, ed. 1970s DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle Dorling Kindersley 2010 978-0-7566-6742-9 146 &apos;Swamp Thing&apos; was the name of Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson&apos;s turn-of-the-century tale, and its popularity with readers led a modernized version of the character into his own series a year later. ] Over the next several decades, Swamp Thing would star in DC series and miniseries — including an initial 1972–76 series begun by Wein and Wrightson, { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 153: &quot; Following his debut in House of Secrets #92 in 1971, the Swamp Thing grew into his own series, albeit with a reimagining of his origins by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson. &quot; } and the mid-1980s Saga of the Swamp Thing, edited by Wein and featuring early work by writer Alan Moore — as well as two theatrical films, and a syndicated television series. Abigail Arcane, a major supporting character in the character&apos;s mythos was introduced by Wein and Wrightson in Swamp Thing #3 (Feb.-March 1973). { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 154: &quot; Scribe Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson left Swamp Thing some company...the woman who would become Swamp Thing&apos;s soul mate, Abigail Arcane. &quot; } Wein wrote the second story featuring Man-Thing (written circa May 1971, published in June 1972), introducing Barbara Morse and the concept that &quot; Whoever Knows Fear Burns at the Man-Thing&apos;s Touch &quot;, and later edited Steve Gerber &apos;s run on that title. Wein wrote a well-regarded run of Justice League of America (issues #100–114) wherein, together with artist Dick Dillin, he re-introduced the Seven Soldiers of Victory in issues #100-102 { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 152 &quot; Through an impromptu team-up of the JLA and the Justice Society on Earth-2, writer Len Wein and artist Dick Dillin ushered in the return of DC&apos;s Seven Soldiers of Victory. &quot; } and the Freedom Fighters in issues #107-108. { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 156 &quot; The annual Justice League-Justice Society get-together resulted in scribe Len Wein and artist Dick Dillin transporting both teams to the alternate reality of Earth-X. There, Nazi Germany ruled after winning a prolonged World War II and only a group of champions called the Freedom Fighters remained to oppose the regime. &quot; } In the fall of 1972, Wein and writers Gerry Conway and Steve Englehart crafted a metafiction al unofficial crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein&apos;s first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin ), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dillin and Dick Giordano ), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema ). As Englehart explained in 2010, &quot; It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It&apos;s really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back — it didn&apos;t matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel — I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do. &quot; [ http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/10/30/rutland-halloween-parade-marvel-dc-crossover/ The Rutland Halloween Parade: Where Marvel and DC First Collided Larnick Eric October 30, 2010 ComicsAlliance.com http://www.webcitation.org/63ia1MoQZ December 5, 2011 December 5, 2011 ] [ http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/10/01/comic-book-legends-revealed-280/ Comic Book Legends Revealed #280 Cronin Brian October 1, 2010 ComicBookResources.com http://www.webcitation.org/63iZZ9PQQ December 5, 2011 December 5, 2011 ] { &apos;&apos;Amazing Adventures&apos;&apos; #16 (Jan. 1973), &apos;&apos;Justice League of America&apos;&apos; #103 (Dec. 1972), and &apos;&apos;Thor&apos;&apos; #207 (Jan. 1973) at the } { Grand Comics Database } Libra, a supervillain created by Wein and Dillin in Justice League of America #111 (May–June 1974), { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 160 &quot; Through the words of scripter Len Wein and the art of Dick Dillin, the masked menace of Libra established himself as a grave threat to the World&apos;s Greatest Heroes. &quot; } would play a leading role in Grant Morrison &apos;s Final Crisis storyline in 2008. Wein co-created the Human Target with artist Carmine Infantino { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 153 &quot; Starting as a back-up feature in the pages of Action Comics, scribe Len Wein and artist Carmine Infantino introduced Christopher Chance, a master of disguise who would turn himself into a human target - provided you could meet his price. &quot; } and wrote the character&apos;s appearances as a backup feature in Action Comics, Detective Comics, and The Brave and the Bold. The character was adapted into a short-lived ABC television series starring Rick Springfield which debuted in July 1992, { &quot; Human Target on ABC &quot; TVGuide.com Retrieved January 31, 2011 } and was revived for a new two-season series on FOX that starred Mark Valley, Chi McBride and Jackie Earle Haley. { Gil Kane &amp; } { Dave Cockrum. } { In } the early 1970s, Wein began writing regularly for Marvel Comics. He succeeded Roy Thomas as editor-in-chief of the color-comics line in 1974, staying a little over a year before handing the reins to Wolfman. Remaining at Marvel as a writer, Wein had lengthy runs on Marvel Team-Up, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor and Fantastic Four, as well as shorter runs on such titles as The Defenders and Brother Voodoo. In 1975, he and artist Dave Cockrum revived the Stan Lee / Jack Kirby mutant - superhero team the X-Men after a half-decade&apos;s hiatus, reformatting the membership. Among the characters the duo created for the series were Nightcrawler, Storm, Colossus, and Thunderbird. Wein had previously created Wolverine, with artists John Romita Sr. and Herb Trimpe, for The Incredible Hulk. Wein plotted the early &quot; new X-Men &quot; stories with artist Cockrum. These issues were then scripted as Uncanny X-Men #94 &amp; 95 by Chris Claremont, who subsequently developed the title into one of Marvel&apos;s leading franchises. In 2009, Claremont said, &quot; The history of modern comics would be incredibly different if you took [Wein&apos;s] contributions out of the mix. The fact he doesn&apos;t get credit for it half the time is disgraceful. We owe a lot of what we are – certainly on the X-Men – to Len and to Dave [Cockrum] &quot;. { Krug, Kurt Anthony. &quot; Legends: Chris Claremont &quot;, Mania.com, April 22, 2009 } [ Return to DC ] At the end of the 1970s, following a dispute with Marvel management, Wein returned to DC as a writer and an editor. He scripted Batman and collaborated on Green Lantern with artists Dave Gibbons and Mark Farmer. On his first issue of Batman, #307 (Jan. 1979), he created Wayne Foundation executive Lucius Fox, { McAvennie &quot; 1970s &quot; in Dolan, p. 180 &quot; Batman #307 (Jan. 1979) Writer Len Wein and artist John Calnan introduced Bruce Wayne&apos;s new executive, Lucius Fox, in this issue of Batman. &quot; } later portrayed by Morgan Freeman in the movies Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
