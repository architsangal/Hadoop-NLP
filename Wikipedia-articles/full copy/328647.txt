[Kate, at 17 months old, is too young for school.] We’ve discovered that Billie can completely disengage, which troubled Nicole and I, so we took her to an early-education interventionist. She tested our daughter primarily by giving her tactical puzzles. As long as Billie was left alone to do them, she was fine. But when the teacher tried to give Billie praise, she was not interested. What this revealed is that Billie is fine as long as she is engaged in an activity, but she doesn’t care for the traditional approval or an A, B or C grade. Our takeaway is that Billie is fine and that we’ll have to find ways, people, systems, etc., that challenge her, because she doesn’t care about kudos. ] [ Her biggest strength is language. She’s extraordinarily verbal, and Max’s biggest challenge is his lack of spoken language. He can read at a certain level and do arithmetic, but he doesn’t form sentences. So parenting Max and parenting Billie represent two polar opposites on the spoken-word spectrum. How we parent them in the same household and find a happy middle has been really interesting and continues to be. &quot; John C McGinley Interview with Chet Cooper &quot; Retrieved April 03, 2012. ] McGinley appeared on the television show American Gladiators in 1994, during the Celebrity Challenge. { Retrieved November 19, 2008. } McGinley is also an avid fan of the Detroit Red Wings, and shows this by wearing a Red Wings jersey (usually Chris Chelios&apos; ) in several Scrubs episodes.
