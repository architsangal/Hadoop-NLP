The Central Coast has an approximate population of 299,000 making it the third largest urban area in New South Wales and the ninth largest urban area in Australia. Geographically, the Central Coast is generally considered to include the region bounded by the Hawkesbury River in the south, the Watagan Mountains in the west and the southern end of Lake Macquarie in the north. Politically, it is administered as two local government area s; City of Gosford and Wyong Shire. In September 2006, the NSW Government released a revised long term plan for the region that sees the Central Coast classified as a regional city, along with Wollongong and the Hunter Region, with the largest regional city in the area being Gosford. [ History ] In 1811, the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie gave the first land grant in the region to William Nash, an ex-Marine of the First Fleet. No further grants were made in the area until 1821. { Bennett, F. C.: &quot; The Story of the Aboriginal People of the Central Coast of New South Wales &quot;, page 9. Brisbane Water Historical Society, 1968. } [ Geography ] The region is a network of towns that have been linked in recent years by expanding suburban development. The main urban cluster of the region surrounds the northern shore of Brisbane Water and includes the Coast&apos;s largest population centre, Gosford, stretching east to the retail centre of Erina. Other major commercial &quot; centres &quot; on the Coast are Wyong, Tuggerah, Lakehaven, The Entrance, Terrigal, and Woy Woy. Large numbers of people who live in the southern part of the region commute daily to work in Sydney. The Central Coast is also a popular tourist destination, and a popular area for retirement. As a result, the cultural identity of the region is distinct from that of the large and diverse metropolis of Sydney as well as the Hunter region, with its mining, heavy industry and port. On 2 December 2005, the Central Coast was officially recognised as a stand alone region rather than an extension of Sydney or the Hunter Valley.
