[ 1955 02 16 ] { La Mesa, California } { Ambient } Steve Roach (born February 16, 1955 in La Mesa, California ) { Family Tree Legends } is a U.S. composer and performer of ambient and tribal-ambient music, whose recordings are also classified in the genres of space, drone, New Age, and electronic music. Roach is recognized as one of the &quot; leading innovators of contemporary electronic music. &quot; { Steve Roach Biography, Celestial Harmonies, accessed Jan. 24, 2009. } Roach plans on releasing three new collaboration albums for the remainder of 2012, along with two new solo albums, to be released in the fall and winter of 2012, respectively. [ deepcurrents ] [ Overview ] Originally a motorbike racer, at the age of 20 Roach taught himself to play the synthesizer { All Music Guide entry by Jason Ankeny. } after being inspired by such influential synthesizer artists and groups as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Vangelis. His debut album Now appeared in 1982, followed by Structures from Silence in 1984. In 1988 he released his acclaimed Quiet Music series, along with what has been described by critics as his masterpiece, the double-album Dreamtime Return. As Roach&apos;s approach to ambient music matured, he has typically { &quot; Stretch out and enjoy the soundscape &quot; by Gemma Tarlach, } { Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 21, 2000. } been beat less, although his rhythmic and trance-based groove and tribal-ambient releases are nearly as numerous as his more atmospheric releases. Some recordings are strictly synthesizer based, whereas some recordings include ambient guitar experiments, and other releases cross over with more ethnic influences. He was an early proponent { &quot; Instrument owner lauds soothing effects, &quot; } { The Advocate (Baton Rouge) June 7, 1998. } of the didgeridoo &apos;s use in ambient music and learned to play it during his extended trips to Australia during the 1980s. Later work with Mexican musician Jorge Reyes would introduce a Prehispanic element, and these fusions would further establish Roach as one of the founders of the tribal-ambient sound. Steve Roach is married to Linda Kohanov [ spiderbytes ] (who provided vocals on some of his albums). They live in Tucson, Arizona.
