[[Image:Chylomicron.svg|thumb|250px|Lipoprotein structure (chylomicron) ApoA, ApoB, ApoC, ApoE ( apolipoprotein s ); T ( triacylglycerol ); C ( cholesterol ); green ( phospholipid s )]]A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both protein s and lipid s, bound to the proteins, which allow fats to move through the water inside and outside cells. The proteins serve to emulsify the lipid (otherwise called fat) molecules. Many enzyme s, transporter s, structural proteins, antigen s, adhesin s, and toxin s are lipoproteins. Examples include the high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins, which enable fats to be carried in the blood stream, the transmembrane protein s of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins. { mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk } [ Function ] The function of lipoprotein particles is to transport lipids (fats) (such as triacylglycerol) around the body in the blood. All cell s use and rely on fat s and cholesterol as building-blocks to create the multiple membrane s that cells use both to control internal water content and internal water-soluble elements and to organize their internal structure and protein enzymatic systems. The lipoprotein particles have hydrophilic groups of phospholipids, cholesterol, and apoproteins directed outward. Such characteristics make them soluble in the salt water-based blood pool. Triglyceride-fats and cholesterol esters are carried internally, shielded from the water by the phospholipid monolayer and the apoprotein s. The interaction of the proteins forming the surface of the particles (a) with enzymes in the blood, (b) with each other, and (c) with specific proteins on the surfaces of cells determine whether triglycerides and cholesterol will be added to or removed from the lipoprotein transport particles. Regarding atheroma development and progression as opposed to regression, the key issue has always been cholesterol transport patterns, not cholesterol concentration itself. [ May 2010 ] [ Transmembrane lipoproteins ] The lipids are often an essential part of the complex, even if they seem to have no catalytic activity by themselves. To isolate transmembrane lipoproteins from their associated membranes, detergent s are often needed. [ Classification ] [ By density ] Lipoproteins may be classified as follows, listed from larger and less dense to smaller and denser. Lipoproteins are larger and less dense when the fat to protein ratio is increased. They are classified on the basis of electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Chylomicron s carry triglycerides (fat) from the intestine s to the liver, to skeletal muscle, and to adipose tissue. Very-low-density lipoprotein s (VLDL) carry (newly synthesised) triglycerides from the liver to adipose tissue. Intermediate-density lipoprotein s (IDL) are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood. Low-density lipoprotein s (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. LDLs are sometimes referred to as the &quot; bad cholesterol &quot; lipoprotein. High-density lipoprotein s (HDL) collect cholesterol from the body&apos;s tissues, and bring it back to the liver. HDLs are sometimes referred to as the &quot; good cholesterol &quot; lipoprotein..

This terminology is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as Abetalipoproteinemia.

It is divided into two pathways, exogenous and endogenous, depending in large part on whether the lipoproteins in question are composed chiefly of dietary (exogenous) lipids or whether they originated in the liver (endogenous). [ Exogenous pathway ] Epithelial cell s lining the small intestine readily absorb lipids from nutritive substances. These lipids, including triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol, are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 into chylomicron s. These nascent chylomicrons are secreted from the intestinal epithelial cells into the lymphatic circulation in a process that depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream. In the bloodstream, HDL particles donate apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent chylomicron; the chylomicron is now considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cell s lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (i.e., glycerol covalently joined to three fatty acids ) that ultimately releases glycerol and fatty acid s from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage. The hydrolyzed chylomicrons are now considered chylomicron remnants. The chylomicron remnants continue circulating until they interact via apolipoprotein E with chylomicron remnant receptor s, found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the endocytosis of the chylomicron remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within lysosome s. Lysosomal hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, which can be used for energy or stored for later use. [ Endogenous pathway ] The liver is another important source of lipoproteins, principally VLDL. Triacylglycerol and cholesterol are assembled with apolipoprotein B-100 to form VLDL particles. Nascent VLDL particles are released into the bloodstream via a process that depends upon apolipoprotein B-100. As in chylomicron metabolism, the apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E of VLDL particles are acquired from HDL particles. Once loaded with apolipoproteins C-II and E, the nascent VLDL particle is considered mature. Again like chylomicrons, VLDL particles circulate and encounter LPL expressed on endothelial cells. Apolipoprotein C-II activates LPL, causing hydrolysis of the VLDL particle and the release of glycerol and fatty acids. These products can be absorbed from the blood by peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle. The hydrolyzed VLDL particles are now called VLDL remnants or intermediate-density lipoprotein s (IDLs). VLDL remnants can circulate and, via an interaction between apolipoprotein E and the remnant receptor, be absorbed by the liver, or they can be further hydrolyzed by hepatic lipase. Hydrolysis by hepatic lipase releases glycerol and fatty acids, leaving behind IDL remnants, called low-density lipoprotein s (LDL), which contain a relatively high cholesterol content ( { Kumar V, Butcher SJ, Öörni K, Engelhardt P, Heikkonen J, et al. (2011) Three-Dimensional cryoEM Reconstruction of Native LDL Particles to 16Å Resolution at Physiological Body Temperature. } [ CtFwss81GBk see native LDL structure at 37°C ] ). LDL circulates and is absorbed by the liver and peripheral cells. Binding of LDL to its target tissue occurs through an interaction between the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein B-100 or E on the LDL particle. Absorption occurs through endocytosis, and the internalized LDL particles are hydrolyzed within lysosomes, releasing lipids, chiefly cholesterol.
