[ November 2009 November 2009 November 2009 ] Open gaming is the movement within the role-playing game (RPG) industry that is somewhat similar to the open source movement. [ Dancey Ryan The Most Dangerous Column in Gaming Interview with Ryan Dancey Wizards of the Coast 2002-02-28 http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x%3Ddnd%2Fmd%2Fmd20020228e Interview 2008-02-26 ] The key aspect is that authors give recipients of works covered by copyright a license to certain rights, such as the right to make copies or the right to create derivative works, under particular conditions. All open gaming therefore depends upon a license with exception to fair use and works under public domain. [ Definition ] &quot; Open gaming &quot; refers to the practice of publishing content (rules, sourcebooks, etc.) under a free content licence (either copyleft or copyfree ) or an open content license, which grants permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some or all of the content. A number of role-playing game publishers have joined the open gaming movement, largely as a result of the release of the System Reference Document by Wizards of the Coast, which contained the core rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition. Open gaming has also been popular among noncommercial role-playing game and supplement authors. However, Wizards of the Coast used the non-open Game System License for the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. [ History ] [ September 2011 ] The history of open gaming began with the publication of the System Reference Document and the simultaneous release of the Open Game License. However, role-playing games had been licensed under open and free content licenses before this. [ The Fudge Legal Notice ] The Fudge role-playing game system was created in 1992 by Steffan O&apos;Sullivan with extensive help from the rec.games.design community. The name stood for &quot; Freeform Universal Donated Game Engine &quot; until Steffan O&apos;Sullivan changed &apos;donated&apos; to &apos;DIY&apos; in 1995. One of the keys to the success of Fudge is that the author released it under the FUDGE Legal Notice, a license that made it essentially &quot; open &quot; for non-commercial use. This predates the publication of the System Reference Document under the Open Game License by several years. However the FUDGE Legal Notice (more commonly known as simply &quot; the Fudge license &quot; ) was never intended to cover any work other than its eponymous role-playing game. The 1993 FUDGE Legal Notice allowed reprinting of the Fudge rules, including in otherwise commercial works, as long as certain conditions were met. The 1995 FUDGE Legal Notice permitted the creation of derivative works for personal use and for publication in periodicals. Derivative works which were to be distributed for a fee required written permission from Fudge&apos;s author, Steffan O&apos;Sullivan. The details of the Fudge Legal Notice were modified and expanded from time to time as O&apos;Sullivan updated his work, but the essential elements of the license remained unchanged. In March 2004, Grey Ghost Games acquired the copyright of Fudge, and in 6 April 2005, they released a version of Fudge under the Open Game License, making it open for commercial use. [ Dominion rules and circle ] The phrase &quot; opensource roleplaying &quot; was used as early as 1999 by the Dominion Rules fantasy role-playing system, the license of which permitted supplementary material to be written for its rules (see the Dominion Rules License ). Another &quot; open &quot; system was the Circe role-playing system, published by the WorldForge project under the GNU Free Documentation License. [ Open Game License ] Despite Fudge and other games, the open gaming movement did not gain widespread recognition within the role-playing game industry until 2000, when Wizards of the Coast (WotC) re-published the 3rd Edition of their popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing system as the System Reference Document under the Open Game License. This move was driven by Ryan Dancey, then Brand Manager for WotC, who drafted the Open Game License and first coined the term &quot; open gaming &quot; with respect to role-playing games. [ Open Gaming Foundation ] The Open Gaming Foundation (OGF) was founded by Ryan Dancey as an independent forum for discussion of open gaming among the members of the fledgling open gaming movement. The OGF consisted of a web site and a series of mailing lists, including the OGF-L list (for general discussion of open gaming licensing issues) and the OGF-d20-L list (for discussion of d20-specific issues). The most common criticism of the Open Gaming Foundation was that it was primarily a venue for publicizing Wizards of the Coast. Ryan Dancey was an employee of WotC, and discussion on the mailing lists tended to focus on d20 and the OGL (both owned by WotC) rather than on open gaming in general. Like most efforts to publicize &quot; open gaming &quot;, the Open Gaming Foundation did not gain widespread support, and the most recent update to Ryan Dancey&apos;s OGF web site (as of January 2012) was on 4 August 2003. The OGF mailing lists continued to be active for some time (particularly the OGF-d20-L list, which was a haven for various d20 publishers), but they were ultimately shut down [ January 2012 ] and no archives were maintained on the OGF site. [ Reaction to the OGL ] The Open Game License gained immediate popularity with commercial role-playing game publishers. However, the OGL was criticized (primarily by independent role-playing game developers) for being insufficiently &quot; open &quot;, and for being controlled by the market leader Wizards of the Coast (see d20 System for more information). In response to this, and in an attempt to shift support away from the OGL and toward more open licenses, several alternatives to the OGL were suggested and drafted. Similarly, the popularity of the OGL inspired others to create their own, specific open content licenses. Virtually none of these gained acceptance beyond the works of the licenses&apos; own authors, and many have since been abandoned. [ October Open Gaming License ] One of the licenses written in response to the OGL was the October Open Game License, a copyleft license published on 27 December 2000 by RPG Library. The OOGL was designed to present an alternative to perceived problems with the WotC Open Game License. The OOGL was used by two games before the authors of the OOGL ceased using it for their own work in late 2002 (and suggested that others do the same), in favor of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. RPG Library support for the October Open Game License ceased entirely on June 15, 2003. [ Present adoption ] The most common open gaming license in use by commercial role-playing game publishers is the OGL, and the most popular noncommercial licenses are the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License and the GNU Free Documentation License. [ August 2011 ] There are many publishers currently producing material based on the WotC System Reference Document, and many which make their products available under the OGL but which use game systems not based on the SRD. [ Licenses ] Unlike open-source software, the term &quot; open gaming &quot; distinctly predates the establishment of an organization establishing a definition for the term. As such, while there is a definition offered by the Open Gaming Foundation for what is and is not an &quot; open gaming license &quot;, the term is used more expansively without notable comment. Generally, any license that permits re-use, modification, and redistribution of content can be considered an open gaming license, though open content, free content, copyleft, and copyfree offer various definitions and specifications for licensing terms that apply to some open gaming licenses. The following licenses are currently in use as open gaming licenses: Creative Commons - Various licenses are used Dominion Rules License EABA Open Supplement License ( external site ) GNU Free Documentation License GNU General Public License Open Content License Open Game License Open Publication License Open Works License ( external site ) [ Open supplement licenses ] Open supplement license is a licenses where the original rulebooks are covered by normal copyright, but a license permits the publication of supplementary material, such as adventures and new rules. Examples of open supplement licenses are the EABA Open Supplement License { http://www.infinite-realities.com/ordnance/OSL } and MasterBook™ Open Supplement License (MasterWorld™). { http://www.pigames.net/collaborative/index.php?action=read &amp; page=429 } [ Open games ] The following are considered open games (listed in alphabetical order): Conan: The Roleplaying Game Lone Wolf OGL Rulebooks { OSRIC by Stuart Marshall and Mathew Finch } { System Reference Document, which is a subset of the } { d20 System by } { Wizards of the Coast } { Swords &amp; Wizardry by Mythmere Games } { RuneQuest : the current version of RuneQuest (as of 2007), by Mongoose Publishing } { T10 systemet introduced by Swedish role-playing company } { Rävsvans } { Tagmar Brazilian Medieval RPG } { Traveller (role-playing game) by Mongoose Publishing } { Treasure by JennyT, Rob Lyon and D. Morrison } { Violence: The Roleplaying Game of Egregious and Repulsive Bloodshed by Greg Costikyan. } { Yags by Samuel Penn. } [ Retro-Clone systems ] [ Dungeons &amp; Dragons simulacrums ] A number of fans and publishers have created copies of rules systems which are no longer supported, and released those rules systems under an open license. The term &quot; retro-clone &quot; was coined by Goblinoid Games, the publisher of Labyrinth Lord and GORE. [ August 2010 ] The best known example of a retro-clone game is OSRIC, which contains the rules for 1st edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Other examples are GORE (the Basic Roleplaying System i.e., the rules used in RuneQuest and Call of Cthulhu), Labyrinth Lord (based on Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons), Swords &amp; Wizardry (based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons c. 1974), and Dark Dungeons (based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia { RPG.Net game index entry } ).
