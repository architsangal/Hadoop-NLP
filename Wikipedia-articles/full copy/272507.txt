[ History ] After India became independent in 1947, the Planning Commission was entrusted to oversee and direct the development of the nation. India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of public sector enterprises that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of the University of California to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named Indian Institutes of Management. Calcutta (known as Kolkata now) and Ahmedabad were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.

In 1981, the first IIM Review Committee was convened to examine the progress of the three existing IIMs and to make recommendations. The committee noted that the three IIMs were producing around 400 PGP graduates every year and that they had reached their optimum capacity. It proposed the opening of two more IIMs to meet the rising demand of management professionals. It also recommended expanding the Fellowship programmes to meet the growing demand of faculty in management schools in India. The fourth IIM ( IIM Lucknow ) was established in 1984 based on the committee&apos;s recommendation. Two more IIMs were established in Kozhikode ( IIM Kozhikode ) and Indore ( IIM Indore ) in 1996. Since 2007, seven new IIMs have been set up, taking the total number of IIMs to 13.

Some of the programmes offered by all IIMs are similar; however, some IIMs offer unique programmes for specialized purposes. [ Postgraduate education ] All IIMs offer a two-year full time Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP). This programme is considered the flagship programme of IIMs, and awards the Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) to successful candidates. This diploma is equivalent to the Master of Business Administration postgraduate degree. This programme usually starts in June and runs till April of the second year. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management programme with no specialization, and typically includes courses in Accounting, Behavioural sciences, Finance, Economics, Human Resource Management, Marketing, Business operations, Public policy, Strategy and General management. It is usually structured into six trimesters spread across two years. The first year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives. IIM Calcutta offers a Post Graduate Diploma in Computer aided Management (PGDCM) programme. This course, which was started in 1994, is similar to the regular PGDM programme, but with a special emphasis on Information technology and its business applications. It is aimed at creating business professionals who know how to apply Information and communication technology (ICTs) in business management. Most of the PGDCM coursework is integrated with the regular PGDM framework, and both PGDM &amp; PGDCM are considered as part of the PGP programme. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Lucknow offer a two-year Post Graduate Programme in Agribusiness Management (PGP-ABM) programme. This is essentially an MBA programme with a specialization in Agribusiness. Since 2006, some IIMs have started offering a special one-year full time postgraduate programme for experienced professionals. Designed as an executive MBA programme, it is named differently by different IIMs. It&apos;s called the Post Graduate Program for Executives by IIM Calcutta (PGPEX in short) and IIM Ahmedabad (PGPX), Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) by IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore, and International Programme in Management for Executives (IPMX) by IIM Lucknow. The exact structure, admission criteria and other details vary for these programmes. However, all these programmes admit only candidates with substantial professional experience. (Some of these programmes have age-based criteria instead of a work experience.) IIM Calcutta offers a specialized executive MBA programme called the Post Graduate Programme for Executives for Visionary Leadership in Manufacturing (PGPEX-VLM) jointly with IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras. It is a one-year, rigorous programme with a heavy focus on the manufacturing sector. [ Doctoral education ] The Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) of IIMs is a full-time Doctoral level programme in management. This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of research and analytical abilities. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of Fellow of that institute (e.g. Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta). This Fellow Program is equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy degree. However, students receiving such a fellowship every year, across all IIMs, work in close association with one another in a specific research area of their choice. [ Executive education ] Many IIMs offer executive education programmes targeted at working professionals. These are often short-term and/or part-time programmes and are known by various names such as Management Development Programme (MDP), Advanced Masters Program in Management of Global Enterprises (AMPM), Working Managers Programme (WMP), &apos;&apos;&apos;Executive General Management Programme (EGMP),etc. [ Other programmes ] Some IIMs offer specialized programmes targeted at various segments. IIM Ahmedabad offers a six-month, full time programme called the Armed Forces Programme (AFP) aimed at military personnel. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore offer full time programmes in public management and are called the Post Graduate Programme in Public Management and Policy (PGP-PMP) and Post Graduate Programme in Public Policy Management (PGPPM) respectively. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year, full time programme called the Post-Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management (PGSEM), an executive general management education programme designed for the specific needs of professionals working in the software and information technology industry. [ Admission process ] [ February 2012 ] Different programmes of IIMs follow different admission processes. Admission for residents of India to the flagship two year PGP programmes at all IIMs is based on the Common Admission Test (CAT). CAT scores are often used as the primary short-listing criteria for admissions. International/overseas applicants have the option to apply using GMAT scores in lieu of CAT scores.

The overall profiles of candidates including past academic and professional accomplishments are considered for all programmes along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic and/or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involve an interview, before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions. [ Entrance exam ] The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two year PGP programmes. It is widely considered as one of the most competitive exams in the world, [ CAT Common Admission Test (IIMs) - Most Popular MBA Entrance Exam in India http://www.successcds.net/mbaentranceexam/CAT/Common-Admission-Test.htm successcds.net 17 February 2012 ] with a success rate of around one in two hundred.
