[ Faqir the given name Faqir (given name) ] [ July 2009 ] { Herbert Ponting &apos;s 1907 photograph of &quot; a fakir in Benares &quot; ( } { Varanasi ), } { India. However, it is far more likely this depicts a Hindu } { sannyasi particularly since Benares is the holiest city in Hinduism where large numbers of ascetics gather. } The fakir or faqir ( [ f ə ˈ k ɪər ]; [ فقیر ] (noun of faqr)) Derived from faqr ( [ فقر ], &quot; poverty &quot; ) is a Muslim Sufi ascetic in Middle East and South Asia. The Faqirs were wandering Dervish es teaching Islam and living on alms. { God Speaks, Meher Baba, Dodd Meade, 1955, 2nd Ed. p. 305 } The term has become a common Urdu, Bengali, and Hindi byword for &quot; beggar &quot;. The term has also been used to refer to Hindu and Buddhist ascetics (e.g., sadhu s, guru s, swami s and yogi s ). These broader idiom atic usages developed primarily in the Mughal era in India. Calanus, a Hindu Naga sadhu of 4th Century B.C., whom Greek named as gymnosophists is often called as Fakir by historians. [ The philosophical books of Cicero 1989 186 http://books.google.co.in/books?id%3DL1MEAQAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bq%3Dcalanus%2Bfakir%26amp%3Bdq%3Dcalanus%2Bfakir%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bei%3DbUxoT8CuM8TwrQe02uGECA%26amp%3Bved%3D0CDoQ6AEwAg ] There is also a now a distinct caste of Faqir found in North India, descended from communities of faqirs who took up residence at Sufi shrines. [ History ] Emperor Jahangir receiving a petition from a fakir Historically, the terms tasawwuf, Sufism, faqr, faqer (noun of faqr) were first used (with full definition) by Husayn ibn Ali who was the grandson of Muhammad.[citation required] He wrote a book &quot; Mirat ul Arfeen &quot; on this topic, which is said to be first book on Sufism and tasawwuf. However, under Ummayad rule, neither could this book be published nor was it allowed to discuss tasawwuf, Sufism or &apos;Faqr&apos; openly. For a long time, after Husayn ibn Ali, the information and teachings of &apos;faqr&apos;, tasawwuf or Sufism, kept on transferring from heart to heart. { A brief history of Islam‎ by Tamara Sonn, 2004, p60 } In the 10th century, highly reputed Muslim Abdul-Qadir Gilani who is founder of Qadiriyya silsila which has the most followers in Muslim Sufism elaborated Sufism, tasawwuf and faqr. Then in the 13th century Ibn Arabi was the first vibrant Muslim Scholar who not only started this discussion publicly but also wrote hundreds of books about Sufism, tasawwuf and faqr. With the passage of time the doctrine of Sufism had been fading as well as that of tasawwuf and faqr. During some Mughal Emperors time, in the Indian continent, improper terminology were inserted in Sufism and Islam and &quot; faqir &quot; was quoted for street beggars and Hindu monks. The term then came to India where the term was injected into the local idiom through the Persian -speaking courts of Muslim rulers. The fakirs are called syed, shah or sai since they belong to the decents of sufi orders. { Sultan Bahoo } { Punjab, } { Pakistan } During the 17th century another noble and spirited Muslim scholar and saint Sultan Bahoo revolutionized Sufism and reinstated (with fresh properties) the definition of faqr and faqir. In the modern era, there is a Muslim Saint, Sultan Muhammad Asghar Ali the Sixth Sultan ul Faqr was declared by Hazrat Sultan Bahoo with the permission of Muhammad and currently that Crown of Faqr is Placed on the Head of Sultan Muhammad Ali who is Currently the Chairman of Islahee Jamaat &amp; Aalmi Tanzeem ul Aarifeen from Pakistan who is said to have extra ordinary spiritual powers and contends new dimensions in Sufism. In English, faqir or fakir is originally, a mendicant dervish. In mystical usage, the word fakir refers to man&apos;s spiritual need for God, who alone is self-sufficient. Although of Muslim origin, the term has come to be applied in India to Hindus as well, largely replacing gosvamin, sadhu, bhikku, and other designations. Fakirs are generally regarded as holy men who are possessed of miraculous powers. Among Muslims the leading Sufi orders of fakirs are the Chishtiyah, Qadiriyah, Naqshbandiyah, and Suhrawardiyah. { Online Dictionary / Reference } The Cambridge English dictionary refers to a faqir &apos;as a member of an Islamic religious group, or a holy man&apos;. { Dictionary of Cambridge } [ Attributes ] The expression of fakir can also be used pejoratively, to refer to a common street beggar who chants holy names, scriptures or verses. These broader idiomatic usages developed primarily in Mughal era India, where the term was injected into local idiom through the Persian-speaking courts of Muslim rulers. It has become a common Urdu and Hindi word for ‘beggar.’ The attributes of faqir and faqr have been defined by many Muslim saints and scholars, however, some significant definitions from distinguished personalities of Islam are quoted here. One of the most respected and beloved early Muslim saints Abdul-Qadir Gilani also elaborated Sufism, tasawwuf and faqr in a conclusive manner. Explaining attributes of faqir, he says, &quot; faqir is not who can not do anything and is nothing in his self-being. But faqir has all the commanding powers (gifted from Allah) and his orders can not be revoked. &quot; { Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East by N. Hanif, 2002 } { &apos;&apos;The Sultan of the saints: mystical life and teaching of Shaikh Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani, Muhammad Riyāz Qādrī, 2000, p24 } Then Ibn Arabi explained Sufism, including faqr in more details. He wrote more than 500 books on topics relating to Sufism, tasawwuf and faqr. He was the first Muslim scholar who introduced (first time openly) the idea of Wahdat al-wujud which remained the talk of the town for many centuries. { Fusus al-hikam (The Bezels of Wisdom), ed. A.

[ Bahu Sultan 28 April 2010 ] { Sultan Bahoo&apos;s book Ameer ul Konain } At another place, in the same book Sultan Bahoo says, &quot; Faqir attains eternity by dissolving himself in oneness of Allah. He, when, eliminates his-self from other than Allah, his soul reaches to divinity. &quot; { Reference from Sultan Bahoo&apos;s book } He further says in his other book, &quot; faqir has three steps (stages). First step he takes from eternity (without beginning) to this mortal world, second step from this finite world to hereafter and last step he takes from hereafter to manifestation of Allah &quot;. { &apos;&apos;&apos;Noor ul Khuda&apos;&apos;&apos; book of Sultan Bahoo } [ Gurdjieff ] In the Fourth Way teaching of G. I. Gurdjieff the word &quot; fakir &quot; is used to denote the specifically physical path of development, compared with the word &quot; yogi &quot; (which Gurdjieff used for a path of mental development) and &quot; monk &quot; (which he used for the path of emotion al development). { The Fourth Way: Teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff, P.D. Ouspensky, Random House USA, 2000 } [ In Bangladesh and India ] The Fakir and Goshai was with the stronger religious influence, and there are even Baul s who would shave off their heads as in their past and kept on practicing and believing in many of the basic creeds of Vaishnava-Sahajiya Buddhism. So all followers of different religions and religious practices came under the nomenclature Baul, which has its etymological origin in the Sanskrit words &quot; Vatula &quot; (madcap), or &quot; Vyakula &quot; (restless) and used for someone who is &quot; possessed &quot; or &quot; crazy &quot;. They were known as performers &apos;mad&apos; in a worshiping trance of joy - transcending above both good and bad. Though fond of both Hinduism and Islam, the Baul evolved into a religion focused on the individual and centered on a spiritual quest for God from within. They believe the soul that lives in all human bodies is God.
