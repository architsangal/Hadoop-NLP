In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, Group 5 of the periodic table contains vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta) and dubnium (Db). This group lies in the d-block of the periodic table. The group itself has not acquired a trivial name; it belongs to the broader grouping of the transition metal s. The lighter three Group 5 elements occur naturally and do share similar properties; all three are hard refractory metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, dubnium, has been synthesized in the laboratory, but it has not been found occurring in nature, with half-life of the most stable isotope, dubnium-268, being only 28 hours, and other isotopes even more radioactive. To date, no experiments in a supercollider have been conducted to synthesize the next member of the group, either unpentpentium (Upp) or unpentseptium (Ups). As unpentpentium and unpentseptium are both late period 8 element s it is unlikely that these elements will be synthesized in the near future.

All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting points (1910  °C, 2477  °C, 3017  °C). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions, similarly to trends in Group 3 or Group 4. The metals form different oxides: vanadium forms vanadium(II) oxide, vanadium(III) oxide, vanadium(IV) oxide and vanadium(V) oxide, niobium forms niobium(II) oxide, niobium(IV) oxide and niobium(V) oxide, but out of tantalum oxides only tantalum(V) oxide is characterized. Metal(V) oxides are generally nonreactive and act like acids rather than bases, but the lower oxides are less stable. They, however, have some unusual properties for oxides, such as high electric conductivity. [ Walter de Gruyter 1985 91-100 3-11-007511-3 Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie Arnold F. Holleman Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils; German ] All three elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +5. Lower oxidation states are also known, but they are less stable, decreasing in stability with atomic mass increase. [ History ] The discovery of all elements in the group led to controversies. The verification of those discoveries was difficult due to similarity of vanadium and group 6 element chromium, the chemical similarity of niobium and tantalum and the complicated setup which was necessary to produce a few atoms of dubnium.

Vanadium, essential to ascidians and tunicate s as vanabins, has been known in the blood cell s of Ascidiacea (sea squirts) since 1911 [ 10.1002/jemt.10042 Michibata H Uyama T Ueki T Kanamori K, 2002 Vanadocytes, cells hold the key to resolving the highly selective accumulation and reduction of vanadium in ascidians Microscopy Research and Technique 56 6 421–434 11921344 ] in concentrations of vanadium in their blood more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them.
