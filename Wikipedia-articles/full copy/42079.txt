It is the potassium salt of the coordination complex [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4-. This salt forms lemon-yellow monoclinic crystal s. [ Synthesis ] Potassium ferrocyanide is produced industrially from hydrogen cyanide, ferrous chloride, calcium hydroxide, the combination of which affords Ca 2 [Fe(CN) 6 ] · 11H 2 O. This solution is then treated with potassium salts to precipitate the mixed calcium-potassium salt CaK 2 [Fe(CN) 6 ], which in turn is treated with potassium carbonate to give the tetrapotassium salt.

After neutralization of this intermediate with sodium carbonate, red crystals of sodium nitroprusside can be selectively crystallized. [ Seel, F.

[ April 2012 ] A famous reaction involves treatment with ferric salts to give Prussian blue. With the approximate composition KFe 2 (CN) 6, this insoluble but deeply coloured material is the blue of blueprint ing. Potassium ferrocyanide, potassium ferricyanide, and Prussian blue account for over 97% of cyanides in the environment. [ Yu, X. Z.; Gu, J. D.; Li, T. P.

It and the related sodium salt are widely used as anti-caking agents for both road salt and table salt. The potassium and sodium ferrocyanides are also used in the purification of tin and the separation of copper from molybdenum ores. Potassium ferrocyanide is used in the production of wine and citric acid. In the laboratory, potassium ferrocyanide is used to determine the concentration of potassium permanganate, a compound often used in titration s based on redox reactions. Potassium ferrocyanide is used in a mixture with potassium ferricyanide and phosphate buffered solution (PBS) to provide a buffer for X-Gal, which is used to cleave Beta-galactosidase, giving a bright blue visualization where an antibody (or other molecule), conjugated to Beta-gal, has bonded to its target. Potassium ferrocyanide can be used as a fertilizer for plants. [ April 2012 ] [ Toxicity ] Potassium ferrocyanide is nontoxic, although upon contact with strong acid it can release toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. It is not decomposed to cyanide in the body. The toxicity in rats is low, with lethal dose (LD50) at 6400  mg/kg. [ http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5763.htm POTASSIUM FERROCYANIDE MSDS Number: P5763 - Effective Date: 12/08/96 J. T.
