It is partly bounded to the north and west by the Bristol Channel and the estuary of the River Severn. Its traditional northern border is the River Avon, but the administrative boundary has crept southwards with the creation and expansion of the City of Bristol, and latterly the county of Avon and its successor unitary authorities to the north. Somerset&apos;s county town, Taunton, is in the south. Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of human occupation from Palaeolithic times, and of subsequent settlement in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great, and later in the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. Agriculture is a major business in the county. Farming of sheep and cattle, including for wool and the county&apos;s famous cheeses (most notably Cheddar ), are traditional and contemporary, as is the more unusual cultivation of willow for basket weaving. Apple orchards were once plentiful, and Somerset is still known for the production of strong cider. Unemployment is lower than the national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. Population growth in the county is higher than the national average. [ Toponymy ] The name derives from Old English Sumorsǣte, which is short for Sumortūnsǣte, meaning &quot; the people living at or dependent upon Sumortūn. &quot; [ Watts Victor (Ed.) The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Cambridge University Press 2004 0-521-36209-1 ] The first known use of the name Somersæte was in 845, after the region fell to the Saxons. [ http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Somersetshire Somersetshire 21 October 2007 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica ] Sumortūn is modern Somerton and may mean &quot; summer settlement, &quot; a farmstead occupied during the summer but abandoned in the winter. [ Mesolithic hunters and fishermen Somerset History http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Meshuntfish.htm 28 May 2006 ] However, Somerton is not down on the levels—lower ground, where only summer occupation was possible because of flooding—but on a hill where winter occupation would have been feasible. An alternative suggestion is that the name derives from Seo-mere-saetan meaning &quot; settlers by the sea lakes. &quot; [ Whitlock Ralph Somerset 1975 B.T. Batsford Ltd London 978-0-7134-2905-3 ] The people of Somerset are first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle &apos;s entry for AD 845, in the inflected form &quot; Sumursætum, &quot; but the county is first mentioned in the entry for 1015 using the same name. The archaic county name Somersetshire is first mentioned in the Chronicle&apos;s entry for 878. Although &quot; Somersetshire &quot; had been in common use as an alternative name for the county, it went out of fashion in the late 19th century, and is no longer used. This is possibly due to the adoption of &quot; Somerset &quot; as the official name for the county through the establishment of the County Council in 1889. However, as with other counties not ending in &quot; shire, &quot; this suffix was superfluous, as there was no need to differentiate between the county and a town within it. The Old English name continues to be used in the motto of the county, Sumorsǣte ealle, meaning &quot; all the people of Somerset. &quot; Adopted as the motto in 1911, the phrase is taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Somerset was a part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and the phrase refers to the wholehearted support the people of Somerset gave to King Alfred in his struggle to save Wessex from the Viking invaders.

The decoys were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotive s. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location. The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half-a- dozen bombs on 2 December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941.

During the 1930s more than [ 3600 ha acre off ] of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely due to the displacement of baskets with plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s.

The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially. Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew around the medieval weaving industry. Street developed as a centre for the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C &amp; J Clark establishing its headquarters in the town.

Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C &amp; J Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia. Stone quarries are still a major employer in Somerset The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone. Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral. Bath Stone is also widely used. Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the 19th century, but it was used long before then. It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at locations in Wiltshire such as Box. { Hudson (1971). The Fashionable Stone.

Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the construction industry. Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement. Until the 1960s, Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden villages. Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball, adjacent to the King&apos;s Sedgemoor Drain.

The town of Glastonbury has mythical associations, including legends of a visit by the young Jesus of Nazareth and Joseph of Arimathea, with links to the Holy Grail, King Arthur, and Camelot, identified by some as Cadbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort. Glastonbury also gives its name to an annual open-air rock festival held in nearby Pilton.

The former lines of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway closed completely, { Atthill, Robin and } { Nock, O. S. (1967). The Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway. Newton Abbot, Devon: David &amp; Charles. ISBN 0-7153-4164-2. } as has the branch of the Midland Railway to Bath Green Park (and to Bristol St Philips ); however, the L &amp; SWR survived as a part of the present West of England Main Line. None of these lines, in Somerset, are electrified. Two branch lines, the West and East Somerset Railway s, were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as &quot; heritage &quot; lines. The fifth railway was a short-lived light railway, the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway. The West Somerset Mineral Railway carried the iron ore from the Brendon Hills to Watchet. Until the 1960s the piers at Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, Portishead and Minehead were served by the paddle steamer s of P and A Campbell who ran regular services to Barry and Cardiff as well as Ilfracombe and Lundy Island. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods, one of the reasons for the Somerset and Dorset Railway was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea is the shortest pier in the UK. { Handley, Chris (2001). Maritime Activities of the Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway. Cleckheaton: Millstream Books.

For long-distance holiday traffic travelling through the county to and from Devon and Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey. North–south traffic moves through the county via the M5 Motorway. { Charlesworth, George (1984). A History of British Motorways. London: Thomas Telford Limited. ISBN 0-7277-0159-2. } Traffic to and from the east travels either via the A303 road, or the M4 Motorway, which runs east–west, crossing the M5 just beyond the northern limits of the county.
