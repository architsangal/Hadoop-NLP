[ promise or a statement of fact the village in Somerset, England Oath, Somerset the racehorse Oath (horse) acronyms OATH (disambiguation) ] [ December 2006 June 2008 ] { Tennis Court Oath &quot; by } { Jacques-Louis David } { Henry Kissinger places his hand on a Bible as he is sworn in as } { Secretary of State, 1973 } { Lwów Oath &quot; by } { Jan Matejko } An oath (from Anglo-Saxon āð, also called plight) is either a statement of fact or a promise calling upon something or someone that the oath maker considers sacred, usually God, as a witness to the binding nature of the promise or the truth of the statement of fact. To swear is to take an oath, to make a solemn vow. Those who conscientiously object to making an oath will often make an affirmation instead. The essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath taker&apos;s own honesty and integrity in the matter under question. By implication, this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties. It therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of one&apos;s duty, such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law. A person taking an oath indicates this in a number of ways. The most usual is the explicit &quot; I swear, &quot; but any statement or promise that includes &quot; with * as my witness &quot; or &quot; so help me *, &quot; with &apos;*&apos; being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred, is an oath. Many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of scripture or a sacred object, thus indicating the sacred witness through their action: such an oath is called corporal. However, the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity, and the act does not of itself make an oath. [ March 2007 ] In the United States and some other countries, it is customary to raise the right hand while swearing an oath, whether or not the left hand is laid on a Bible or other text. This custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms, { www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o &amp; se=gglsc &amp; d=454360 }. However the practice is referred to in the Old Testament ( &quot; Their mouths speak untruth; their right hands are raised in lying oaths &quot;, Psalm 144:8). In England the common form of court oath is to swear with the right hand on the Bible, though alternatives are available. There is confusion between oaths and other statements or promises. The current Olympic Oath, for instance, is really a pledge and not properly an oath since there is only a &quot; promise &quot; and no appeal to a sacred witness. Oaths are also confused with vow s, but really, a vow is a special kind of oath. [ In law ] In law, oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly-appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office. In both of those cases, though, an affirmation can be usually substituted. A written statement, if the author swears the statement is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, is called an affidavit. The oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a notary, who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document. Willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of perjury. [ In English ] Common examples of oaths include: I swear on my mother&apos;s life I swear on my grandmothers grave [ In Islamic tradition ] Islamic theology takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously. So much so that one of the sayings of the Muslim prophet Mohammad, commonly referred to as ahadith (singular hadith) instructs Muslims to &quot; Make oaths only on Allah almighty, the Master of all beings, and protect them more than your lives &quot; (Sahih Bukhari 45: 15). [ Greco-Roman tradition ] In the Roman tradition, oaths were sworn upon Iuppiter Lapis or the Jupiter Stone located in the Temple of Jupiter, Capitoline Hill. Iuppiter Lapis was held in the Roman Tradition to be an Oath Stone, an aspect of Jupiter is his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office. Bailey (1907) states: We have, for instance, the sacred stone (silex) which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making. The fetial, who on that occasion represented the Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial pig with the silex, saying as he did so, &apos;Do thou, Diespiter, strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger.&apos; Here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection, Iuppiter Lapis. { In Chapter Two: The &apos;Antecedents&apos; of Roman Religion. Source: (accessed: August 21, 2007) } [ June 2011 ] Walter Burkert has shown that since Lycurgus of Athens (d. 324 BC), who held that &quot; it is the oath which holds democracy together &quot;, religion, morality and political organization had been linked by the oath, and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal, as well as international law. { Burkert, Greek Religion, trans. Raffan, Harvard University Press (1985), 250ff. } [ Jewish tradition ] The concept of oaths is deeply rooted within Judaism. It is found in Genesis 8:21, when God swears that he will &quot; never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing. &quot; This repetition of the term never again is explained by Rashi, the preeminent biblical commentator, as serving as an oath, citing the Talmud { Shavous 36a } for this ruling. { Metsudah Chumash and Rashi, KTAV Publishing House, 1991. page 88 } The first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be Eliezer, the chief servant of Abraham, when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son Isaac from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from among Abraham&apos;s own family. In the Judeo-Christian Tradition, this is held as the origination of the concept that it is required to hold a sacred object in one&apos;s hand when taking an oath. See also Alliance (Bible). [ Christian tradition ] [ Expounding of the Law#Oaths ] As late as 1880, Charles Bradlaugh was denied a seat as an MP in the Parliament of the United Kingdom as because of his professed atheism he was judged unable to swear the Oath of Allegiance in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a &quot; matter of form &quot;. Various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths, most notably the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Mennonite s. This is principally based on [ Matthew 5:34-37 ], the Antithesis of the Law. Here, Christ is written to say &quot; I say to you: &apos; Swear not at all &apos; &quot;. The Apostle James stated in [ James 5:12 ], &quot; Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your &quot; Yes &quot; be yes, and your &quot; No, &quot; no, or you will be condemned. &quot; Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that &quot; taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness &quot; { Faith and Practice of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (1988) p. 19 } suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important. Not all Christians understand this reading as forbidding all types of oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. Quaker s were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear loyalty oath s. Testifying in court was also difficult; George Fox, Quakers&apos; founder, famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any Bible passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths. (The judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment.) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the United Kingdom now has the right to make a solemn affirmation instead of an oath. The United States has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Only President Franklin Pierce has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration. [ Germanic tradition ] [ Symbel Feudalism ] Germanic warrior culture was significantly based on oaths of fealty, directly continued into medieval notions of chivalry. A prose passage inserted in the eddic poem Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar relates: Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one Yule -eve, and found a troll -woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. &quot; Nay, &quot; said he. She said, &quot; Thou shalt pay for this at the bragarfull. &quot; That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the bragarfull. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi&apos;s daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother. Such Norse traditions are directly parallel to the &quot; bird oaths &quot; of late medieval France, such as the voeux du faisan (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) voeux du paon (oath on the peacock). { Huizinga, } { The Autumn of the Middle Ages (ch. 3); Michel Margue, „Vogelgelübde“ am Hof des Fürsten.
