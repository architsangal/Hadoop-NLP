In 2006, Davis was ranked as the second most educated city (in terms of the percentage of residents with graduate degrees) in the US by CNN Money Magazine, after Arlington, Virginia. { MONEY magazine: Best places to live 2006: Top 25 Most Educated } [ History ] Davis grew around a Southern Pacific Railroad depot built in 1868. It was then known as &quot; Davisville, &quot; named for Jerome C. Davis, a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name simply to &quot; Davis &quot; in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated on March 28, 1917. { Jerome C. Davis } From its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agriculture along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California&apos;s University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908. { Davis: Historical Overview University of California History Retrieved on 02-17-08 } The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded into the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959. Contemporary Davis is also known for its contributions in the areas of biotechnology, medicine, and other life sciences.

The dry, hot summers and cool, rainy, winters are those of a Mediterranean climate. It is classified as a Köppen Csa climate. Thick ground fog named &quot; Tule Fog &quot; settles into Davis during late fall and winter. The characteristics of the fog are dense with visibility to less than 500 feet. Some accidents occurring in the winter season of Davis are due to the Tule Fog.

[ Toad Tunnel ] Entrance to the Toad Tunnel in front of the Post Office Davis&apos; Toad Tunnel is a wildlife crossing that was constructed in 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily Show. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21  inches (53  cm) wide and 18  inches (46  cm) high. The tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground. [ February 2010 ] The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town. [ Education ] [ University of California ] [ University of California, Davis ] The University of California, Davis, or UC Davis, a campus of the University of California, had an 2009 Fall enrollment of 32,153 students. { UC Davis News &amp; Information:: UC Davis Facts: Student Population Headcount, Fall 1997–2007 } { UC Davis Student Population } UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.

This is just west of Davis near the Yolo County Airport. About four miles (6  km) to the west, the Road 31 exit from Interstate 505 is marked with cryptic signage, &quot; DQU. &quot; The site is about 100 feet (30 m) above mean sea level (AMSL).

The [ 643 acre km2 ] and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a National Park Service publication, Five Views. The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as D-Q University. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name. [ Other colleges ] An off-campus branch of Sacramento City College is located in Davis. [ Public schools ] Davis&apos; public school system is administrated by the Davis Joint Unified School District. The city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District&apos;s oldest public school)). Davis has one school for independent study (Davis School for Independent Study), three public junior high schools (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Frances Harper), one main high school ( Davis Senior High School ), an alternative high school (Martin Luther King High School), and a small technology-based high school ( Leonardo da Vinci High School ). Cesar Chavez is a Spanish immersion school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, several of the elementary schools may be closed. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007–08 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High&apos;s campus) and a special-ed preschool. At one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K–6 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. Cesar Chavez served grades K–3 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4–6 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K–6 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K–6.
