Harris attributes the band&apos;s name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, which he saw around that time and which had a verbal connection to the iron maiden torture device.

[ Wall 2004 29 ] The original lineup did not last very long, however, with vocalist Paul Day being the first casualty as he lacked &quot; energy or charisma onstage. &quot; [ Wall 2004 32 ] He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances. [ Wall 2004 32 ] Wilcock&apos;s friend Dave Murray was invited to join, to the dismay of the band&apos;s guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance. [ Wall 2004 33 ] Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disunite the band in 1976, [ Wall 2004 33 ] though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Steve Harris and Dave Murray remain the band&apos;s longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases. Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band&apos;s albums. Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band onstage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth. [ Wall 2004 44 ] Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, [ Wall 2004 46 ] as well as original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis. A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, [ Wall 2004 23 ] in November 1977 was the line-up&apos;s first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. [ Wall 2004 48 ] At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band&apos;s sound. [ Wall 2004 48 ] A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided he&apos;d had enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. [ Wall 2004 50 ] As he preferred to be the band&apos;s sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray&apos;s return and was also dismissed. Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band&apos;s new line-up. [ Wall 2004 52 ] A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di&apos;Anno. [ Wall 2004 54 ] Steve Harris has stated, &quot; There&apos;s sort of a quality in Paul&apos;s voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge. &quot; [ Wall 2004 53 ] Although, the band were always looking to employ a second, from that point Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting that &quot; Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult. &quot; [ Wall 2004 64 ] [ Rise to fame (1978–1981) ] [ The Soundhouse Tapes Iron Maiden (album) Killers (Iron Maiden album) ] On New Year&apos;s Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge. [ Wall 2004 66 ] Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs, [ Wall 2004 66 ] the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, then managing a heavy metal club called &quot; Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse &quot;, located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London. [ Wall 2004 67 ] Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, &quot; Prowler &quot;, eventually went to No.  1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine. [ Wall 2004 104–105 ] A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band&apos;s manager, [ Wall 2004 83 ] and, as Iron Maiden&apos;s popularity increased, they decided to release the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club. [ Wall 2004 103 ] Featuring only three tracks (one song, &quot; Strange World &quot;, was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production) [ Wall 2004 102 ] all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.

[ Wall 2004 163–164 ] Smith declined as he was busy with his own band, Urchin, so Iron Maiden hired guitarist Dennis Stratton instead. [ Wall 2004 121 ] Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by an ex- Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton&apos;s suggestion on 26 December. [ Wall 2004 123 ] Iron Maiden&apos;s first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of &quot; Sanctuary &quot; and &quot; Wrathchild &quot;. [ Wall 2004 137 ] The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. [ Wall 2004 139 ] Iron Maiden&apos;s eponym ous 1980 release, Iron Maiden, debuted at No.  4 in the UK Albums Chart. [ Wall 2004 143 ] In addition to the title track, the album includes other early favourites such as &quot; Running Free &quot;, &quot; Transylvania &quot;, &quot; Phantom of the Opera &quot;, and &quot; Sanctuary &quot; – which was not on the original UK release but made the U.S. version and subsequent remasters. The band set out on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour &apos;s European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, [ Hinchcliffe Jon Dennis Stratton Interview: October 1999 27 October 1999 http://www.praying-mantis.com/mantis/dennis99.shtml Praying-Mantis.com 08-10-2006 ] and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980. In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second album, entitled Killers. Containing many tracks that had been written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: &quot; Prodigal Son &quot; and &quot; Murders in the Rue Morgue &quot; [ Wall 2004 183 ] (the latter&apos;s title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe ). [ Hack Job? Kerrang! Legends Paul Brannigan 2 26–27 ] Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album, [ Wall 2004 145 ] the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch, [ Wall 2004 181 ] who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992. [ Wall 2004 300 ] The record was followed by the band&apos;s first world tour, which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas. [ Wall 2004 251 ] [ Success (1981–1986) ] [ The Number of the Beast (album) Piece of Mind Powerslave Live After Death ] By 1981, Paul Di&apos;Anno was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly through his drug usage, about which Di&apos;Anno comments, &quot; it wasn&apos;t just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn&apos;t see my way to the end of it. I knew I&apos;d never last the whole tour. It was too much. &quot; [ Wall 2004 194 ] With his performances suffering, Di&apos;Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour, [ Wall 2004 219 ] at which point the band had already selected his replacement. [ Wall 2004 218 ] After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival, [ Wall 2004 217 ] Bruce Dickinson, previously of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired. [ Wall 2004 218 ] The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK. [ Wall 2004 219 ] In anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played &quot; Children of the Damned &quot;, &quot; Run to the Hills &quot;, &quot; 22 Acacia Avenue &quot; and &quot; The Prisoner &quot; at select venues, introducing fans to the sound that they were progressing towards. Dickinson&apos;s record debut with Iron Maiden was 1982&apos;s The Number of the Beast, an album that gave the band their first ever UK Albums Chart No.  1 record [ Wall 2004 227 ] and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries. [ Wall 2004 228 ] Dickinson, at the time, was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson&apos;s management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a &quot; moral contribution &quot; to &quot; Children of the Damned &quot;, &quot; The Prisoner &quot; and &quot; Run to the Hills &quot;. [ Shooman Joe Bruce Dickinson: Flashing Metal with Iron Maiden and Flying Solo Independent Music Press 2007 82 0-9552822-4-1 ] For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden&apos;s future was cemented; the album went on to sell over 14 million copies worldwide. { Nicko McBrain has been Iron Maiden&apos;s drummer since 1982 } The Beast on the Road&apos;s U.S. leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album&apos;s title track, [ Wall 2004 228 ] to the point where a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band. In recent years, Dickinson has stated that the band treated this as &quot; silliness, &quot; [ 4 December 2001 Classic Albums: Iron Maiden – The Number of the Beast DVD Eagle Vision ] and that the demonstrations in fact gave them &quot; loads of publicity. &quot; In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr ended his association with the band due to personal and tour schedule problems and was replaced by Nicko McBrain, previously of French band Trust. [ Wall 2004 233 ] Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios. [ Wall 2004 246 ] In 1983, they released Piece of Mind, which reached the No.  3 spot in the UK, [ Wall 2004 247 ] and was the band&apos;s debut at the North American charts, reaching No.  70 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200.

The album featured fan favourites &quot; 2 Minutes to Midnight &quot;, &quot; Aces High &quot;, and &quot; Rime of The Ancient Mariner &quot;, [ Wall 2004 253 ] the latter based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge &apos;s poem of the same name and running over 13 minutes long. The tour following the album, dubbed the World Slavery Tour, was the band&apos;s largest to date and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months, [ Wall 2004 253 ] playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people. [ Stenning, Paul Iron Maiden: 30 Years of the Beast – The Complete Unauthorised Biography Chrome Dreams 2006 1-84240-361-3 102 ] Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California (4 consecutive sold out concerts to an overall audience of 54,000), where the majority of their subsequent live release, Live After Death, was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.  4 in the UK. [ Wall 2004 257 ] Iron Maiden also co-headlined (with Queen ) the Rock In Rio festival, where they performed to an estimated crowd of 300,000. [ 4 February 2008 Live After Death: The History of Iron Maiden part 2 DVD EMI ] The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded a six month break when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months). [ Wall 2004 258 ] This was the first substantial break in the band&apos;s history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album, [ Stenning, Paul Iron Maiden: 30 Years of the Beast – The Complete Unauthorised Biography Chrome Dreams 2006 1-84240-361-3 104 ] with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended. [ Wall 2004 255 ] [ Experimentation (1986–1989) ] [ Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album) Seventh Son of a Seventh Son ] Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled Somewhere in Time, featuring, for the first time in the band&apos;s history, synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound. [ Somewhere in Time – Review 12-10-2008 Steve Huey allmusic 2008 ] The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single &quot; Wasted Years &quot;, but notably included no writing credits from lead singer Bruce Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band. [ Wall 2004 260 ] The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988. A concept album, based on The Tales of Alvin Maker series of novels by Orson Scott Card, [ Commercial Break! Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem 2005 Martin Popoff 108–109 ] this would be the band&apos;s first record to include keyboards, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release. [ Wall 2004 265 ] After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson&apos;s enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album. [ Wall 2004 265 ] Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden&apos;s second album to hit No.  1 in the UK charts, [ Wall 2004 263 ] although it only achieved a Gold certification in the U.S., in contrast to its four predecessors.

[ Wall 2004 269 ] Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N&apos; Roses and Helloween. [ http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/donington-1988.html Donington – Iron Maiden 12-10-2009 Donington 1988 ] The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N&apos; Roses performance; the following year&apos;s festival was cancelled as a result. [ Wall 2004 269 ] The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England. [ Wall 2004 272 ] [ Upheaval (1989–1994) ] [ No Prayer for the Dying Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album) ] During another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold, [ Wall 2004 273 ] and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, [ Wall 2004 281 ] followed by a tour. [ Wall 2004 285 ] At the same time, to mark the band&apos;s ten year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released The First Ten Years, a series of ten CDs and double 12 &quot; vinyl. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden&apos;s singles, including the original B-sides. Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the &quot; stripped down &quot; style that they were leaning towards. [ Wall 2004 283 ] Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson&apos;s solo project, was chosen to replace Smith and became the band&apos;s first new member in seven years. [ Wall 2004 285 ] The album, No Prayer for the Dying, was released in October 1990 [ No Prayer for the Dying – Review 19-11-2011 Greg Prato allmusic ] and contained &quot; Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter &quot;, the band&apos;s first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart No.  1, originally recorded by Dickinson for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. [ Wall 2004 282 ] After another tour and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio release, Fear of the Dark. Released in 1992, the album was noticeably longer (due to this being Iron Maiden&apos;s first album recorded for CD rather than LP) and included the stand-out title track, which is now a regular fixture in the band&apos;s concert setlists. Achieving their third No.  1 in the UK albums chart, [ Wall 2004 289 ] the disc also featured &quot; Wasting Love &quot;, one of the band&apos;s softer songs, and the No.  2 single &quot; Be Quick or Be Dead &quot;. The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries. Iron Maiden&apos;s second performance at Donington Park, to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988), [ Wall 2004 291 ] was filmed for the audio and video release, Live at Donington, [ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352442/ Live At The Donington 14-10-2009 IMDB 2008 ] and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform &quot; Running Free &quot;. [ Wall 2004 291 ] In 1993, Bruce Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package ). [ Wall 2004 293 ] The first, A Real Live One, featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, however, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high profile shows and that at several concerts he would only mumble into the microphone. [ Wall 2004 296 ] Dickinson denies the charge that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to &quot; make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn&apos;t right, &quot; claiming that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour. [ Wall 2004 297 ] He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the BBC and released on video under the name Raising Hell.
