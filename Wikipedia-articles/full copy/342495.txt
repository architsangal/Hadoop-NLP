[ Title ] The title is an allusion to a phrase in St. Paul&apos;s Epistle to the Philippians 3:21 which, in the King James Bible, reads &quot; Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body &quot;. The book was originally to be called &quot; Bright Young Things &quot; (which went on to be the title of Stephen Fry&apos;s 2003 film ); Waugh changed it because he decided the phrase had become too clichéd. The title that Waugh eventually settled on comes from a comment that the novel&apos;s narrator makes in reference to the characters&apos; party-driven lifestyle: &apos;All that succession and repetition of massed humanity... Those vile bodies...&apos; { Waugh Vile Bodies, p104. } [ Style ] Heavily influenced by the cinema and by the disjointed style of T. S. Eliot, Vile Bodies is Waugh&apos;s second and most ostentatiously &quot; modern &quot; novel. { Frick &quot; Style and Structure &quot;. } Fragments of dialogue and rapid scene changes are held together by the dry, almost perversely unflappable narrator. { Waugh, Evelyn, Vile Bodies, p. 146. A good example is the death of Simon Balcairn, a declining earl whose gossip columnist name is &quot; Mr. Chatterbox &quot;; his death forms a bridge between chapters VI and VII. ( &quot; He shut the door and the window and opened the door of the gas-oven. Inside it was very black and dirty and smelled of meat. He spread a sheet of newspaper on the lowest tray and lay down, resting his head on it. Then he noticed that by some mischance he had chosen Vanburgh’s gossip-page in the Morning Despatch. He put in another sheet. At first he held his breath. Then he thought that was silly and gave a sniff. The sniff made him cough, and coughing made him breathe, and breathing made him feel very ill; but soon he fell into a coma and presently died...Then Adam became Mr. Chatterbox. &quot; ) } The book was dedicated to B. G. and D. G. ( Bryan and Diana Guinness ). Waugh claims it was the first novel in which much of the dialogue takes place on the &apos;phone. [ Summary ] Adam Fenwick-Symes is the novel&apos;s antihero; his quest to marry Nina parodies the conventions of romantic comedy, as the traditional foils and allies prove distracted and ineffectual. War looms, Adam&apos;s circle of friends disintegrates, and Adam and Nina&apos;s engagement flounders. At the book&apos;s end, we find Adam alone on an apocalyptic European battlefield. The book&apos;s shift in tone from light-hearted romp to bleak desolation has bothered Okoye. { Hastings Evelyn Waugh } { McDonnell Evelyn Waugh. } { Meyers Problem of Evil. } (Waugh himself later attributed it to the breakdown of his first marriage halfway through the book&apos;s composition { Waugh Preface to the 1965 edition. } ). Others have defended the novel&apos;s curious ending as a poetically just reversal of the conventions of comic romance. { Hollis Evelyn Waugh. } { O&apos;Dea &quot; What&apos;s in a Name? &quot;. } [ Influence ] David Bowie cited the novel as the primary influence on his composition of the song Aladdin Sane. { Circus magazine, July 1973 } A stage adaptation of Vile Bodies, endorsed by the Evelyn Waugh estate, will be staged at the Warwick Arts Centre in March 2012. { http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/events/theatre/evelyn-waughs-vile-bodies } { http://evelynwaughvilebodies.wordpress.com/ } [ Characters ] Adam Fenwick-Symes Nina Ginger Littlejon Colonel Blunt The Drunken Major Lottie Agatha Runcible Simon Balcairn George Malpractice [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Further reading ] [ Frick Robert Style and Structure in the Early Novels of Evelyn Waugh Papers on Language and Literature 28 4 Fall 1992 0031-1294 2449428 ] [ Hastings Selina 1994 Evelyn Waugh: A Biography London Sinclair-Stevenson 1-85619-223-7 34721492 ] [ Hollis Christopher 1971 Evelyn Waugh London Longman 0-582-01046-2 1159162 ] [ McDonnell Jacqueline 1988 1998 Evelyn Waugh London Macmillan 0-312-01618-2 16900955 ] [ Meyers William 1991 Evelyn Waugh and the Problem of Evil London Faber &amp; Faber 0-571-14094-7 23594793 ] [ 56720065 ] [ http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0%2C%2C2179321%2C00.html The beautiful and the damned DJ Taylor 2007-09-29 2007-10-08 The Guardian Review, adapted from DJ Taylor&apos;s &quot; Bright Young People: The Rise and Fall of a Generation 1918-1940 &quot; ] Category:1930 novels Category:Novels by Evelyn Waugh Category:Novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in London
