[ New Zealand Bluff S 46 36 E 168 20 right 220 right ] Signpost at Stirling Point, Bluff Bluff is a town and seaport in the Southland region, on the southern coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is the southern-most town in New Zealand (excluding Oban ) and, despite Slope Point being further to the south, is colloquially used to refer to the southern extremity of the country (particularly in the phrase &quot; from Cape Reinga to The Bluff &quot; ). According to the 2006 census, the usually resident population was 1,850, a decrease of 85 since 2001. { Population Estimates at 30 June 2006 (from the } { Statistics New Zealand website) } The Bluff area, while itself not settled by Māori, was one of the earliest areas of New Zealand where a European presence became established. The first ship known to have entered the harbour was the Perseverance in 1813, in search of flax trading possibilities, with the first European settlers arriving in 1823/1824. This is the foundation for the claim { Bluff history - an overview (from the &apos;bluff.co.nz&apos; website. Accessed 2008-12-14.) } that this makes Bluff the oldest permanent European settlement in the country. However the missionary settlement at Kerikeri was both earlier and larger and the town is now larger than that of Bluff. The town was officially called Campbelltown in 1856, became a borough in 1878, and was renamed Bluff in 1917. [ Geography ] { Awarua Plain (top), } { Tiwai Point (centre) and Bluff (lower left) viewed from the } { International Space Station in 2008 } Bluff is 30  km by road from Invercargill, and the southern terminus of the Bluff Branch, the continuation from Invercargill of the Main South Line.

[ http://www.bluff.co.nz/history3.html A look at Bluff&apos;s past  – part 2 ] Bluff is at the end of a peninsula that forms the western side of Bluff Harbour and Awarua Bay, with the port located in the relatively narrow entrance channel. It is on State Highway 1, which terminates one kilometre to the south of the town at Stirling Point. At Stirling Point there is a signpost showing the distance and direction to various major cities and locations around the world, including the Equator and the South Pole. Bluff is dominated by Bluff Hill / Motupohue (standing at 265m), an extinct volcanic cone, which provides some shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. There is a world-class walk along the shore through native bush up to this point. The town is named for this bluff, which was known to early whaler s as Old Man&apos;s Bluff or Old Man Bluff. East across the entry channel from Bluff is Tiwai Point, home to New Zealand&apos;s only aluminium smelter and its wharf. [ Facilities ] South Port is the port operating company of the Port of Bluff, and is owned to 66.5% by the Southland Regional Council.

It is hoped that the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter and fossil fuel exploration activity in the Great South Basin will help to ensure the future relevance of the port.

It is the main gateway for NZ ships heading down to the Antarctic. The harbour is also home to the Foveaux Strait oyster fleet. Bluff oysters are renowned for their succulence and flavour, and are considered a delicacy nationwide, with Bluff holding an annual oyster festival.

This house was an ordinary bungalow transformed by having the outside walls totally covered in paua shells. The interior was also extensively decorated with paua and there is an extensive collection of (often kitsch ) paua-decorated ornaments, utensils and trinkets. The house became a museum after the death of the owners, but was sold and in March 2007 the exhibits removed to Christchurch. The Bluff Maritime Museum contains an extensive collection of models, boats, artefacts, displays, a working triple expansion engine and a full sized oystering boat, The Monica. { Panorama of the view from the summit of Bluff Hill.
