{ NOTOC } [ Wood Sandpiper.jpg 240px At Mangalajodi Wetlands, Chilika Lake, India LC IUCN3.1 Animal ia Chordata Aves Neornithes Charadriiformes Scolopacidae Tringa T. glareola Tringa glareola Linnaeus, 1758 Rhyacophilus glareola(Linnaeus, 1758) ] The Wood Sandpiper, Tringa glareola, is a small wader. This Eurasia n species is the smallest of the shanks, which are mid-sized long-legged waders of the family Scolopacidae. [ Description and systematics ] It resembles a longer-legged and more delicate Green (T. ochropus) or Solitary Sandpiper (T. solitaria) with a short fine bill, brown back and longer yellowish legs. It differs from the first of those species in a smaller and less contrasting white rump patch, while the Solitary Sandpiper nas no white rump patch at all. { Hayman et al. (1986) } However, it is not very closely related to these two species. Rather, its closest relative is the Common Redshank (T. totanus), and these two share a sister relationship with the Marsh Sandpiper (T. stagnatilis). These three species are a group of smallish shanks with red or yellowish legs, a breeding plumage that is generally subdued light brown above with some darker mottling and with a pattern of somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck. { Hayman et al. (1986), Pereira &amp; Baker (2005) } [ Ecology ] In non-breeding plumage The Wood Sandpiper breeds in subarctic wetlands from the Scottish Highlands across Europe and Asia. They migrate to Africa and southern Asia, particularly India. Vagrant birds have been seen as far into the Pacific as the Hawaiian Islands. In Micronesia it is a regular visitor to the Marianas Islands (where flocks of up to 32 birds are reported) and Palau; it is recorded on Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands about once per decade. This species is encountered in the western Pacific region between mid-October and mid-May { Hayman et al. (1986), Wiles et al. (2000), VanderWerf (2006), VanderWerf et al. (2006) } This bird is usually found on freshwater during migration and wintering. They forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud, and mainly eat insect s and similar small prey. T. glareola nests on the ground or uses an abandoned old tree nest of another bird, such as the Fieldfare (Turdus pilaris). The Wood Sandpiper is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) applies. Widespread, it is considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. { BLI (2008) } [ Footnotes ] [ References ] [ Tringa glareola ] [ BirdLife International (BLI) 2008 144006 Tringa glareola 12 May 2009 ] Hayman, Peter; Marchant, John &amp; Prater, Tony (1986): Shorebirds: an identification guide to the waders of the world.
