The lockout shut down the league for 310 days, the longest in sports history; the NHL was the first professional sports league to lose an entire season. The league vowed to install what it dubbed &quot; cost certainty &quot; for its teams, but the NHL Players Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap, which the union initially said it would not accept. A new collective bargaining agreement was ratified in July 2005 with a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term, allowing the NHL to resume as of the 2005–06 season. On October 5, 2005, the first post-lockout NHL season took to the ice with 15 games, and consequently all 30 teams. Of those 15 games, 11 were in front of sell-out crowds.

The NHL is estimated to earn annual revenue of around $2.27 billion. The debut of the Winter Classic, an outdoor regular season NHL game held on New Year&apos;s Day 2008, was a major success for the league. The game has since become a permanent staple of the NHL schedule. This, along with the transition to a national &quot; Game of the Week &quot; and an annual &quot; Hockey Day in America &quot; regional coverage, all televised on NBC, has helped increase the NHL&apos;s regular season television viewership in the United States. These improvements led NBC and the cable channel Versus to sign a shared ten-year broadcast deal (as their parent companies were merging), paying $200 million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels. [ Organizational structure ] The NHL Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the NHL.

In these cases, the timeout will occur at the first stoppage after the penalty expires or the next stoppage after the goal, respectively. A new rule was introduced for the 2007–08 season that if the first stoppage of play is an icing, the TV timeout does not occur. This is to prevent players from getting a break despite not being allowed to change. At the end of the 60-minute regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, overtime ensues. During the regular season, overtime is a five-minute, four-player on four-player sudden-death period, in which the first team to score a goal wins the game. Until the 2005–06 season, if no team was able to score in the five-minute overtime, the game ended in a tie. Beginning in the 2005–06 season, if the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a shootout. Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds, the shootout continues but becomes sudden death. Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings. The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one.

Infractions of the rules can lead to either the stoppage of play in the case of offside and icing calls, or a penalty call for more serious infractions. During the 2004–05 lockout, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the &quot; offside pass &quot; or &quot; two-line pass &quot; rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team&apos;s defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the center line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player. [ Relaunching the Game CBC sports CBC.com July 22, 2005 June 10, 2006 http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html ] Furthermore, the league reinstated the &quot; tag-up offside &quot; which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone. The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring, which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap. Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icings are called. In the NHL, a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) touches the puck before an attacking player is able to, in contrast to the IIHF rules where play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line. As a result of the rule changes following the 2004–05 lockout, when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change, or skater substitution of any sort (except for a clearly injured player) before the following faceoff. [ http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule65.html Icing the puck National Hockey League NHL.com June 8, 2006 2005 ] The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules. The NHL, in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games, calls major penalties which are more dangerous infractions of the rules, such as fighting, and have a duration of five minutes. [ http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html Major penalties National Hockey League NHL.com June 8, 2006 2005 ] This is in contrast to the IIHF rule, in which players who fight are ejected from the game.

Also, unlike minor penalties, major penalties must be served to their full completion, regardless of number of goals scored during the power play.

During the exhibition season, teams may play other teams from the NHL. They also often compete against European clubs, such as clubs from the Russian KHL. During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. The Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion. Beginning in 2007, the NHL regular season has begun in Europe while teams not involved complete their pre-season exhibition schedule. In the regular season, with the current 30-team NHL geographically split up into two 15-team conferences, and each conference having three division s of five teams apiece, each team plays 82 games; 41 games at home and 41 on the road. Each team plays 24 games in its own geographic division—six against each one of their four other divisional opponents—and 40 games against the ten remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—four games against every team in the other two divisions of its conference. Each team plays every team in the other conference at least once—one game each against 12 teams and two games against the remaining three teams. For three seasons between 2005 and 2008, teams played 32 games within their division—eight games against each team in the division—and 10 inter-conference games—one game against each team in two of the three divisions in the opposite conference. [ NHL ramps up rivalries http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/schedule_changes.html CBC Sports Online CBC.com July 27, 2005 June 6, 2006 ] The two divisions faced from the opposite conference were rotated every year, much like interleague play in Major League Baseball. As with the current system, each team played four games against the other ten teams in its conference outside of its division. The NHL&apos;s regular season standings are based on a point system instead of winning percentages. Points are awarded for each game, where two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion. The league&apos;s overall leader is awarded the Presidents&apos; Trophy. The three division champions along with the five other teams in each conference with the next highest number of points, for a total of eight teams in each conference, qualify for the playoff s. The division winners are seeded one through three (even if a non-division winner has a higher point total), and the next five teams with the best records in the conference are seeded four through eight. [ NHL.com Playoff formats 2005 June 6, 2006 http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] The Stanley Cup playoffs is an elimination tournament, where the teams are grouped in pairs to play best-of-seven series, the winners moving on to the next round. The first round of the playoffs, or conference quarter-finals, consists of the first seed playing the eighth seed, the second playing the seventh, third playing the sixth, and the fourth playing the fifth. In the second round, or conference semi-finals, the NHL re-seeds the teams, with the top remaining conference seed playing against the lowest remaining seed, and the other two remaining conference teams pairing off. In the third round, the conference finals, the two remaining teams in each conference play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Finals. In each round the higher-ranked team is awarded home-ice advantage. Four of the seven games are played at this team&apos;s home venue—the first and second, and, when necessary, the fifth and seventh games—with the other games played at the lower-ranked team&apos;s home venue. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the team with the most points during the regular season is given home-ice advantage, regardless of where each team ranks in their own conference. [ Entry Draft ] [ NHL Entry Draft ] The annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven-round off-season draft held in late June. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 14 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the 30th-place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by the order in which they were eliminated, with the Stanley Cup winner getting the 30th and last pick, and the runner-up is given the 29th pick. [ Teams ] [ National Hockey League All Time Results ] [ right ] The National Hockey League originated in 1917 with four Canadian teams, which after a tumultous first quarter century, found stability in the Original Six era spanning 1942–1967 with four franchises in the United States joining two Canadian clubs. Through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations the NHL currently consists of 30 teams, 23 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada. The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise with 24 Stanley Cup championships (23 as an NHL team, 1 as an NHA team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are only surpassed in the number of championships by the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball, who have three more. The next most successful franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, but they have not won one since 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise. The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955–56 to 1959–60; the New York Islanders (1980–1983) and the Montreal Canadiens (1976–1979) have four-year championship streaks. [ Stanley Cup Winners http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm Jamie Fitzpatrick about.com June 26, 2006 2006 ] The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all-time. [ The 10 greatest teams http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html ESPN ESPN.com December 31, 1999 June 26, 2006 ] Of all the major leagues in North America, the NHL is the only league to field teams that play in two countries&apos; capital cities, Ottawa, Ontario and Washington, D.C. The current league organization divides the teams into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Each conference has three divisions, and each division has five teams. The current organization has roots in the 1998–99 season when a league realignment added two divisions to bring the total number of divisions to six; the current team alignment began with the 2000–01 season when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams. Sixteen of the NHL&apos;s thirty teams are located in the Eastern Time Zone. Currently, the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets are the only Eastern Time teams in the Western Conference, and Winnipeg is the only non-Eastern Time team in the Eastern Conference (an alignment resulting from the franchise&apos;s late move out of Atlanta). The NHLPA denied consent for a conference realignment for the 2012-13 season on January 6, 2012.

[ Defunct and relocated teams ] [ List of defunct and relocated National Hockey League teams ] There have been 19 NHL teams that either folded or relocated. The first team to disband was the Montreal Wanderers in 1918, due to their arena burning down a mere four games into the season. The blaze destroyed all the team&apos;s equipment, and as a consequence the players were dispersed among the three remaining teams.

[ Holzman 2002 230 ] Three franchises succumbed to the economic pressures of the Great Depression : the Philadelphia Quakers, St. Louis Eagles, and Montreal Maroons. The Brooklyn Americans were the last team to fold in the NHL. In the early 1940s, the franchise was struggling financially, and was suspended prior to the [ 1942 season ] due to a lack of players during World War II. The franchise formally ceased operations in 1946, [ Holzman 2002 43 ] and their demise began a period in the league&apos;s history known as the &quot; Original Six &quot;. The 1967 NHL expansion added six teams, but one of those teams, the California Golden Seals, moved to become the Cleveland Barons before merging with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978 when both clubs were on the verge of folding. With six more expansion teams in the 1970s, and the 1979 NHL–WHA merger, the league had 21 teams at the end of the decade. Three of the four teams from the merger have since relocated to other cities: the Quebec Nordiques, the original Winnipeg Jets, and the Hartford Whalers.

On January 6, 2012, the league announced that the NHL Player&apos;s Association had rejected the proposed realignment, citing concerns about fairness, travel and the inability to see a draft schedule before approving, and that as a result, it would not implement the realignment until at least 2013 –14. { NHL realignment on hold after union balks.

The most prestigious team award is the Stanley Cup, which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the Presidents&apos; Trophy. There are also numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the Art Ross Trophy for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the Maurice &quot; Rocket &quot; Richard Trophy for the goal-scoring leader, and the William M. Jennings Trophy for the goalkeeper(s) for the team with the fewest goals against them. The other player trophies are voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers&apos; Association or the team general managers.

The most prestigious individual award is the Hart Memorial Trophy which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The Vezina Trophy is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goalkeeper as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The James Norris Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League&apos;s top defenceman, the Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association. In addition to the regular season awards, the Conn Smythe Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL&apos;s Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the Jack Adams Award as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony. { Hockey Hall of Fame in } { Downtown Toronto } One interesting aspect for the trophies in the NHL is that the same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its CFL counterpart, is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Larry O&apos;Brien Trophy, and Commissioner&apos;s Trophy, which have new ones made every year for that year&apos;s champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year. Players, coaches, officials, and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game, the shortest such time period of any major sport.

A steady stream of European players began entering the league in the 1970s, continuing into the 1980s. Most of the first wave of Europeans came from Sweden and Finland, with a small number of defectors from the Soviet Bloc. Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, political/ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared, leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia into the NHL. Swedes, Finns, and other Western Europeans, who were always free to move to North America, came to the league in greater numbers than before. Many of the league&apos;s top players today come from these European countries, including: Ilya Kovalchuk, Henrik Sedin, Daniel Sedin, Henrik Lundqvist, Marian Hossa, Nicklas Lidstrom, Marian Gaborik, Teemu Selanne, Zdeno Chara, Pavel Datsyuk, Evgeni Malkin, and Alexander Ovechkin.

aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and The Sports Network (TSN). CBC airs Hockey Night in Canada (HNIC), a long-standing Canadian tradition dating to 1952, [ CBC.ca CBC.ca http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hnic/seasoninfo.html HNIC in 2005–06 2005 June 19, 2006 ] [ CBC.ca CBC.ca Hockey Night in Canada: A history of excellence http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hnic/histrad.html 2005 June 19, 2006 ] and even prior to that on radio since the 1920s. During the regular season, HNIC airs a weekly Saturday night doubleheader, while TSN televises three or four games per week. Coverage of the first three rounds of the playoffs is split between CBC and TSN. CBC also broadcasts the Stanley Cup Finals. French language games are broadcast by the Réseau des sports (RDS) and Réseau Info-Sports (RIS), including all Montreal Canadiens games, selected Ottawa Senators games, and the playoffs. Games not aired nationally are instead broadcast regionally within a team&apos;s home market. Sportsnet holds regional broadcasting rights to five of the NHL&apos;s Canadian franchises, while the regional rights for the Montreal Canadiens and Winnipeg Jets are held by TSN, who airs those two clubs&apos; games on regional part-time channels. [ United States ] Historically, the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues. While CBC&apos;s aforementioned Hockey Night in Canada has been a tradition since the 1950s, the league&apos;s American broadcast partners have been in constant flux for decades, ranging from such networks as CBS, SportsChannel America, the USA Network, Fox, ABC, and ESPN. Since the 2005-06 season however, NHL games have aired nationally by the cable channel NBC Sports Network (previously the &quot; Outdoor Life Network &quot; and &quot; Versus &quot; ) and by the broadcast network NBC. [ Evan Weiner nysun.com http://www.nysun.com/article/34542 Don&apos;t Believe the Gripe: The NHL Is Back June 16, 2006 June 19, 2006 ] Originally, NBC had a revenue-sharing agreement with the league to broadcast games, with no money paid up front by the network. Versus had about 20 million fewer subscribers than ESPN when the NHL started on Versus, but its owner Comcast switched Versus from a digital tier to basic cable to make NHL games available to more cable subscribers as well as re-branded the network as a sports network. For Versus, the NHL coverage was a good addition as Versus&apos; ratings grew by about 275% when it showed an NHL game. In January 2011, Comcast officially acquired NBC Universal, and then in April of that year the league negotiated a new 10-year deal with the merged media company, worth nearly $2 billion dollars. Comcast/NBC also announced that Versus would become NBC Sports Network, and both the cable channel and NBC would increase its number of games. [ http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ NBC/Versus To Air NHL Games For The Next Ten Years Fang, Ken April 19, 2011 Fangsbites.com April 19, 2011 ] Under this contract, the NBC Sports Network usually airs at least two regular season games per week, while the main NBC broadcast network airs afternoon games on selected weekends. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with some first round games also being shown on another cable channel owned by NBC Universal. As in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team&apos;s home market. These broadcasters include several regional sports networks owned by Comcast SportsNet, Fox Sports Net and the MSG Network. The New England Sports Network is the regional broadcaster of the Boston Bruins, having taken over broadcasting their games from WSBK-TV for the 1984-85 Bruins season onwards. XM Satellite Radio is the official satellite radio broadcaster of the NHL, as of July 1, 2007. [ XM Satellite Radio June 28, 2007 XM to Become Exclusive Satellite Radio Carrier of NHL http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s%3Dpress_releases%26amp%3Bitem%3D1466 June 28, 2007 ] Between September 2005 and June 2007, the NHL&apos;s broadcasting rights were shared with both XM and Sirius Satellite Radio and were broadcast on just Sirius before the NHL lockout. XM used to broadcast more than 80% of NHL games, including all the playoffs and finals. Starting with the 2007–08 season, XM broadcasts every game. [ NHL Network ] [ NHL Network (Canada) NHL Network (United States) ] The league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. There are two versions, one for Canadian viewers and a separate one for those in the United States. The NHL Network is a joint venture with other media companies. CTV Specialty Television and Insight Sports are both minority owners of the Canadian version, while NBCUniversal is a minority owner of the American version. The NHL Network&apos;s signature show is NHL Tonight (formely NHL on the Fly), which covers NHL news, highlights, interviews, and analysis. The NHL Network also airs live games, with the Canadian version primarily focusing on those featuring Canadian teams and the American version focusing on American teams. [ Out-of-market sports packages ] In the past several years the NHL has expanded the availability of live out-of-market games to regions in Canada and the United States which normally would not get a particular NHL team&apos;s live broadcast. NHL Centre Ice in Canada { NHL Centre Ice (Canada) official website } and NHL Center Ice in the United States { NHL Center Ice United States official website } which are operated separately but have the same program offerings and are available on most Canadian and U.S. cable, satellite and IPTV (i.e. AT &amp; T U-verse &amp; Verizon FiOs) television providers gives a subscriber up to forty out-of-market games per week using various local and regional broadcast feeds. Further, the NHL now has an online service called NHL GameCenter Live which allows subscribers to watch out-of-market games on their desktop or laptop computer as well as on a mobile device such as Android or iOS (i.e. iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch), moreover NHL GameCenter Live is available through a subscriber&apos;s high definition television, using a wired or wireless high speed Internet connection and a device such as the Apple TV box, Roku streaming player, PlayStation Network gaming devices, a Blu-ray disc player installed with the NHL GameCenter app or a television set manufactured by LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and Vizio which have pre-installed software and a wired or wireless Internet connection. Subscribers of the NHL Centre Ice, NHL Center Ice and NHL GameCenter Live services are subject to blackout restrictions such as when an NHL game is broadcast on a local television station or cable sports network in their home territory or during a nationally televised game which is aired on the NBC Television Network or on its sister channel NBC Sports Network (Formerly Versus), In Canada NHL blackout restrictions will vary due to agreements between the CBC, TSN/TSN2 and RDS on local and national telecasts. [ International ] Outside of Canada and the United States, NHL games are broadcast across Europe (excluding the UK and Scandinavia) and the Middle East on ESPN America, which takes feeds from CBC, NBC, NBC SportsNet, TSN and teams&apos; regional broadcasts. In the UK Premier Sports has the rights to the NHL and show 10-12 games per week. Fox Sports in Australia, [ http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/fox-sports-1/default.htm Fox Sports 1 [501] Foxtel.com.au April 9, 2010 ] on SKY Sport in Italy, on Viasat Sport in Norway, Finland, and Denmark on Viasat Hockey in Sweden, [ http://www.cisionwire.com/mtg/mtg--viasat-acquires-nhl-broadcasting-rights-from-espn MTG: VIASAT ACQUIRES NHL BROADCASTING RIGHTS FROM ESPN Cision Wire.com July 16, 2009 April 9, 2010 ] in the Czech Republic and Slovakia on NovaSport and in Portugal on SportTV. [ http://www.sporttv.pt/ Sport TV Home Page sport TV.pt April 9, 2010 ] In the Americas, NHL games are broadcast across Mexico, Central America and Dominican Republic on SKY México. Stanley Cup games can also be viewed in New Zealand on Sky Sport. In Brazil, the games will be broadcast on ESPN International. The aforementioned NHL Gamecenter Live on NHL.com is also available for people outside Canada and the United States to watch games online, free from blackout restrictions. [ Popularity ] [ NHL attendance ] The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, along with Major League Baseball, the National Football League, and the National Basketball Association. The league is very prominent in Canada, where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports as well as the CFL. [ Canadian Press Canadian Press June 8, 2006 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060608.wsurvey8/BNStory/Sports/home Survey: Canadian interest in pro football is on the rise Globe and Mail June 8, 2006 Toronto ] Overall, hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues, the smallest revenue from television, and the least sponsorship. [ http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0408/feature_sports.shtml Champions of the Turnstiles August 2004 Markus David gsb.standford.edu June 24, 2011 ] While the NHL does not hold one of the largest fan bases in North America, it does hold one of the most affluent fan bases. Studies by the Sports Marketing Group conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL&apos;s fan base is much more affluent than that of the PGA Tour. { Nwsource.com } A study done by the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2004, found that NHL fans in America were the most educated and affluent of the four major leagues. They were also found to be substantially more computer literate than the other fans. Further it noted that season-ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the ability of the NHL fan to purchase them, something more out of reach for fans of the other leagues. According to Reuters in 2010, the largest demographic of NHL fans was highly sought after group males aged 18–34, who were also shown to be more &quot; tech savvy &quot; than most fans. [ http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6974VM20101008 NHL pushes for growth on TV, online October 8, 2010 Klayman Ben Reuters May 23, 2011 ] The NHL estimates that fully half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets. Beginning in 2008, under the direction of Chief Operating Officer John Collins, the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this. This has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL. The 2010 Stanley Cup play-offs saw the largest audience in the history of the sport &quot; after a regular season that saw record-breaking business success, propelled in large part by the NHL&apos;s strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings. &quot; { “Stanley Cup Playoffs attract largest audience ever”, “NHL.com,” June 14, 2010 } This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue. Collins said &quot; It was a great Stanley Cup run, really across every possible metric.... Our fans are consuming more hockey. &quot; Merchandise sales were up 22 percent and the number of unique visitors on the NHL.com website were up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season. { Klayman, Ben. “NHL ad, sponsorship revenue up 66 pct this year”, “Yahoo News,” June 14, 2010 } [ Causes ] The NHL advocates for a number of causes throughout the season. During the days leading up to Remembrance Day (November 11, known as Veterans Day in the United States), in respect of the day, coaches and other NHL officials wear red poppy lapel pins. Hockey Fights Cancer is a joint initiative founded in December 1998 by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players&apos; Association to raise money and awareness for hockey&apos;s most important fight. It is supported by NHL Member Clubs, NHL Alumni, the NHL Officials&apos; Association, Professional Hockey Trainers and Equipment Managers, corporate marketing partners, broadcast partners and fans.
