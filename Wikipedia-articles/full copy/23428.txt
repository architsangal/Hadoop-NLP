[ December 2008 ] The armed forces of Paraguay consist of the Paraguay an army, navy (including naval aviation and marine corps ) and air force. The constitution of Paraguay establishes the president of Paraguay as the commander-in-chief. Paraguay has compulsory military service, and all 18-year-old males and 17-year-olds in the year of their 18th birthday are liable for one year of active duty. Although the 1992 constitution allows for conscientious objection, no enabling legislation has yet been approved.

The Paraguayan Navy has twelve bases. The main base is the Puerto Saxony in Asuncion, followed by Bahia Negra, Ciudad del Este, Encarnacion, Salto del Guaria. It also has facilities in Puerto Saxony for helicopters and airplanes in SGAS. Naval personnel including Marine Corps aviation personnel, and the naval guard equal about 1,950. The Marine Corps have 800 marines, of which 400 are assigned to one commando unit with the rest being organized into a single battalion consisting of three companies. In terms of vessels, the Navy has 34 surface ships, some of which will soon reach centenarian age. (This is due in part to limited use and floating in fresh water.) The main vessels and the flagship of the Paraguay is still the Humaita, which was commissioned prior to Paraguay&apos;s involvement in the Chaco War. It has a further four patrol vessels, of which the oldest was commissioned in 1908 and the newest in 1985. The Navy has 17 patrol boats of various drafts, four of which were donated by Taiwan and the USA, while the other 13 were built locally. The rest of the fleet is composed of tug boats, barges, landing craft, transports, and a presidential yacht. The core assets of Paraguay&apos;s naval aviation wing are 2 attack helicopters, the Aeschylu Eurocopter AS350. It also has 6 training and liaison Cessna airplanes.
