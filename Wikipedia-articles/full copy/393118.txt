Although one woollen mill remains operational in the town, the industrial composition of Peebles has changed; the town is now home to many people who commute to work in Edinburgh as well as being a popular tourist destination, especially in the summer. In the mid-to-late 19th century, this included health tourism, centring around hydropathic establishments, which over time morphed into hotel format, with Peebles Hydro Hotel being one of the few survivors of that era.

Other local attractions include a museum and the Kailzie Gardens. Peebles has the highest shoe shop to population ratio in the UK. [ November 2011 ] It has won multiple awards for an excellent range of shops on its High Street. [ Location ] Peebles lies at the confluence of the River Tweed and Eddleston Water (locally called &quot; the Cuddy &quot; ). The Tweed flows west to east, and the Eddleston flows from the north, turning to flow south-west 300  yards before the confluence. This south-westerly turn demarcates a raised triangular piece of land, open to the east but contained by the rivers to the south and north. The name is generally accepted to come from the Brythonic pebyll tents, signifying a temporary settlement.

The road passing through this gate, the Eastgate, is one of four gates in Peebles, the others being Northgate, Bridgegate (where the Eddleston Water was crossed to the north of town), and Ludgate (the western gate of the town), now called Young Street. At the junction of Eastgate and Northgate roads, where the Eastgate becomes High Street, is an ancient market cross. The present-day market is held in the station car park, to the north and south ends of which are the remains of the town wall. Peebles High Street runs parallel with the Tweed along the spine of a ridge, at the west end of which is the parish church. [ Historic features and traditions ] { monument to the } { First World War in Peebles } The oldest building in Peebles is the tower of St Andrew&apos;s Church. The church was founded in 1195. It was destroyed (along with many other Borders abbey s and priories ) by the soldiers of Henry VIII. The stones of the ruins were pilfered for many other local buildings leaving only the tower standing amongst the gravestone of the churchyard. Another ancient church in the town is the Cross Kirk, founded in 1261. Although now mainly ruins, the Cross Kirk plays a prominent part in the local festival. The annual local festival in Peebles is called the Beltane, and involves (as with many Borders festivals) a Common Riding. The Beltane culminates with the crowning of the Beltane Queen (a girl chosen from one of three local primary school s ) along with her court, including the likes of the First and Second Courtiers, Sword Bearer and Standard Bearer; on the steps in front of the parish church. The adult principal of the festival is the Cornet, a local young man chosen by the organising committee on a basis of being considered worthy of representing the town, who then carries the town standard for a year. To the west of the town is Neidpath Castle, which can be reached on foot through Hay Lodge Park, the route offering spectacular views of the castle. The castle is now closed to the public. { On the south side of High Street are the old } { burgh offices. These incorporate the town&apos;s library, art gallery and local museum.

In years past, the Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway had lines that connected Peebles to Edinburgh and Galashiels. [ Notable people ] Traditionally, a person born in Peebles was called a gutterbluid, although few people can now claim that distinction as Peebles no longer has a hospital. Most babies are born in Edinburgh or Borders General Hospital at Melrose. Eric Bogle (b. 1944), folk musician resident in Australia, born in Peebles John Buchan (1875–1940), practised law in Peebles, and his house (opposite the old Sheriff Court ) bears a commemorative plaque Robert Chambers (1802–1871), publisher and author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation John Mathison (1901–1982), New Zealand MP born in Peebles Mungo Park (1771–1806), practised medicine, and his house on the north of the Cuddy bears a commemorative plaque Callum James Greens (b. 1982), music producer born in Edinburgh and raised in Peebles [ Facilities ] Peebles overview from Cademuir Hill. The Hydro Hotel can be seen on the right. Peebles has three primary schools, the state Kingsland and Priorsford Schools and the Roman Catholic Halyrude Primary School. Peebles also has the largest secondary school in the Scottish Borders, Peebles High School, which is attended by pupils from all over Tweeddale. A hillside to the north of the town is dominated by the Peebles Hydro Hotel. The town is surrounded by hill country on all sides and is therefore an attractive centre for the hillwalker and cyclist. From a car park 2km south of the town, a network of tracks and paths ascend the slopes of Cademuir Hill. The highest point (416m) is easily accessible, despite being within a forestry plantation and off the paths. In 2005, a study by the New Economics Foundation ranked Peebles as the best town in Scotland (second best in the UK, after Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire ), for range of independent shops and &apos;home town identity&apos;.
