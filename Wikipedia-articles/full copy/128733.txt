Its seat is located in Partille, which constitutes a part of the contiguously built-up Gothenburg urban area. The municipality is one of the smallest by size in Sweden with an area of only 59.35  km². The parish Partille was made a rural municipality, when the first local government acts came into force in 1863. Territorially it has not been affected by the nation-wide municipal reforms carried out during the 20th century. It has retained its size, but it has developed into a suburb of Gothenburg.

Fifteen ancient monuments from that time remain. Partille is located in a valley, between some mountains in a rocky terrain. Its name is believed to be derived from something similar to &quot; Part haella &quot; meaning &quot; split rock &quot;. Another possible meaning could be &quot; Port haella &quot;, the door in the mountain. The small river Säveån flows through the valley and intersects Partille. The name Säveån stems from the words säve, as in sävligt (leisurely, slow) and ån (the stream/creek), as it is a very slowly flowing little river. The river has been of great importance for Partille throughout its history. The fertile soil around it was used for agriculture and during the medieval ages a lot of farms were located there. { Partille Kommun - Partille - Idermark and Lagerwall reklam - 2009 - 4 } The oldest existing building in Partille is Partille Kyrka (Partille Church) which was built in the 13th century. The church, being placed in the current centre of Partille, indicates that the present centre has been the natural rendezvous and centre of the municipality ever since it was built. Being a Swedish, very old-fashioned, Partille Kyrka has no bell tower, as a compliment a separate belfry was built in 1652. { Partille Kommun - Partille - Idermark and Lagerwall reklam - 2009 - 4 } It is also an excellent place for fishing.
