The river flows for [ 926 mi km 0 ] through the eastern portion of that state and neighboring Texas before it empties into the Rio Grande near Del Rio. The river&apos;s drainage basin is approximately [ 44300 sqmi km2 ] in size. { Largest Rivers of the United States, USGS } [ Modifications ] There are multiple dams along the Pecos River. Santa Rosa Lake is 117 miles/188 kM east of Albuquerque. Sumner Lake is located between Santa Rosa and Fort Sumner, NM. Two dams are located north of Carlsbad, New Mexico, at Avalon Reservoir and Brantley Dam, to help irrigate about [ 25000 acre ha ] as part of the Carlsbad reclamation project (established in 1906). Texas has also dammed the river at the Red Bluff Dam in the western part of that state to form the Red Bluff Reservoir. The portion of the reservoir that extends into New Mexico forms the lowest point in that state. [ History ] The river was named &quot; Pecos &quot; by the Spanish from the Keresan name of the Pecos Pueblo, [p&apos;æyok&apos;ona]. [ Bright William William Bright Native American placenames of the United States http://books.google.com/books?id%3D5XfxzCm1qa4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA375 11 April 2011 2004 University of Oklahoma Press 978-0-8061-3598-4 375 ] The river played a large role in the exploration of Texas by the Spanish. In the latter half of the 19th century, &quot; West of the Pecos &quot; was a reference to the rugged frontiers of the Wild West. New Mexico and Texas disputed water rights to the river until the federal government settled the dispute in 1949 with the Pecos River Compact. The Pecos River Settlement Agreement was signed between New Mexico and Texas in 2003. [ Wild and Scenic River ] On June 6, 1990, [ 20.5 mi km 0 ] of the Pecos River —from its headwaters to the townsite of Tererro —received National Wild and Scenic River designation. It includes [ 13.5 mi km 0 ] designated &quot; wild &quot; and [ 7 mi km 0 ] designated &quot; recreational. &quot; { Pecos Wild and Scenic River, New Mexico - National Wild and Scenic Rivers System } Pecos River between Terrerro and Pecos, New Mexico.

[ Pecos River Flume ] The Flume is a modern aqueduct carrying irrigation water over the Pecos River.Construction took place from 1889 to 1890 and was part of the Pecos River Reclamation Project. It was originally constructed of wood and spanned [ 145 ft ]. It carried water at a depth of [ 8 ft ]. In 1902, a flood destroyed the Flume and it was subsequently rebuilt using concrete. In 1902, it was identified as the largest concrete aqueduct in the world. [ Phil T. Archuletta Sharyl S.
