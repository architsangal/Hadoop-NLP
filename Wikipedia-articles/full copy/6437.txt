It is an essential structural component of mammalian cell membranes and is required to establish proper membrane permeability and fluidity. In addition to its importance within cells, cholesterol is an important component in the hormonal systems of the body for the manufacture of bile acid s, steroid hormone s, and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals; in vertebrate s it is formed predominantly in the liver. Small quantities are synthesized in other cellular organisms ( eukaryote s ) such as plant s and fungi. It is almost completely absent among prokaryote s, i.e. bacteria. Although cholesterol is important and necessary for human health, high levels of cholesterol in the blood have been linked to damage to arteries and cardiovascular disease. François Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstone s, in 1769. However, it was only in 1815 that chemist Eugène Chevreul named the compound &quot; cholesterine &quot;. [ Olson RE Discovery of the lipoproteins, their role in fat transport and their significance as risk factors J.

However, normal and especially high levels of fats (including cholesterol) within the blood circulation, depending on how it is transported within lipoproteins, are strongly associated with progression of atherosclerosis. For a person of about 68  kg (150 pounds), typical total body cholesterol synthesis is about 1 g (1,000  mg) per day, and total body content is about 35 g, primarily located within all the membranes of all the cells of the body. Typical daily dietary intake of additional cholesterol, in the United States, is 200–300  mg. [ National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey United States Center for Disease Control http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/calories.pdf PDF 2012-01-28 ] However, most ingested cholesterol is esterified and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis. [ Lecerf JM, de Lorgeril M Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk Br J Nutr 2011 106 1 6–14 21385506 10.1017/S0007114511000237 ]. For these reasons, cholesterol intake in food has little, if any, effect on total body cholesterol content or concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is recycled. It is excreted by the liver via the bile into the digestive tract, in a non-esterified form. Typically about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the small bowel back into the bloodstream. Some plants make cholesterol in very small amounts. {, http://chemistry.osu.edu/~gopalan.5/file/7B.PDF. } Plants manufacture phytosterol s (substances chemically similar to cholesterol produced within plants), which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. [ John S, Sorokin AV, Thompson PD Phytosterols and vascular disease Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 18 1 35–40 2007 February 17218830 10.1097/MOL.0b013e328011e9e3 ] However, phytosterols are foreign to animal cells and, if absorbed, accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. [ Function ] Cholesterol is required to build and maintain membranes; it modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar head groups of the membrane phospholipid s and sphingolipid s, while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which reduces membrane fluidity. [ Sadava D, Hillis DM, Heller HC, Berenbaum MR Life: The Science of Biology 9th Edition Freeman San Francisco 2011 105–114 1-4292-4646-4 ] In this structural role, cholesterol reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, [ Yeagle PL Modulation of membrane function by cholesterol Biochimie 73 10 1303–10 1991 October 1664240 10.1016/0300-9084(91)90093-G ] protons, (positive hydrogen ions) and sodium ion s.

Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin -coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of cholesterol in such endocytosis can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recently, cholesterol has also been implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. Lipid raft formation brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. [ Incardona JP, Eaton S Cholesterol in signal transduction Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 12 2 193–203 2000 April 10712926 10.1016/S0955-0674(99)00076-9 ] In many neurons, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol, since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. [ Pawlina W, Ross MW Histology: a text and atlas: with correlated cell and molecular biology Lippincott Wiliams &amp; Wilkins Philadelphia 2006 230 0-7817-5056-3 ] Within cells, cholesterol is the precursor molecule in several biochemical pathways. In the liver, cholesterol is converted to bile, which is then stored in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts, which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K. Cholesterol is an important precursor molecule for the synthesis of vitamin D and the steroid hormones, including the adrenal gland hormones cortisol and aldosterone, as well as the sex hormones progesterone, estrogen s, and testosterone, and their derivatives. Some research indicates cholesterol may act as an antioxidant. [ Smith LL Another cholesterol hypothesis: cholesterol as antioxidant Free Radic. Biol.

As a consequence, all foods containing animal fat contain cholesterol to varying extents. [ Christie, William Lipid analysis: isolation, separation, identification, and structural analysis of lipids Oily Press Ayr, Scotland 2003 0-9531949-5-7 ] Major dietary sources of cholesterol include cheese, egg yolk s, beef, pork, poultry, fish, and shrimp. Human breast milk also contains significant quantities of cholesterol.

This effect is thought to come about by changes in the quantity of cholesterol and lipoprotein s that are synthesized by the body. In particular, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats have been shown to increase HDL -based cholesterol levels, with saturated fats also increasing LDL -based cholesterol levels. [ 1386252 ] Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL whilst increasing levels of LDL. [ 9322581 ] Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications. [ High cholesterol levels by NHS http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cholesterol/Pages/Introduction.aspx National Health Service 2010-09-14 ] The USDA for example recommends that those wishing to reduce their cholesterol through a change in diet should aim to consume less than 7% of their daily energy needs from saturated fat and fewer than 200  mg of cholesterol per day. [ Dietary Guidlines for Americans 2005 United States Department of Agriculture http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/pdf/DGA2005.pdf PDF 2010-07-28 ] An alternative view is that any reduction to dietary cholesterol intake could be counteracted by the organs compensating to try to keep blood cholesterol levels constant. [ Le Fanu, James The rise and fall of modern medicine Carroll &amp; Graf New York, NY 2000 0-7867-0732-1 ] However, the The China Study uses epidemiological evidence to claim that casein raises blood cholesterol even more than the ingested saturated fat or cholesterol. [ Campbell TC, Campbell TM The China Study : the most comprehensive study of nutrition ever conducted and the startling implications for diet, weight loss and long-term health Benbella Books 2005 1-932100-38-5 ] [ Biosynthesis ] All animal cells manufacture cholesterol with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 20–25% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the intestines, adrenal gland s, and reproductive organ s. Synthesis within the body starts with one molecule of acetyl CoA and one molecule of acetoacetyl-CoA, which are hydrated to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA ( HMG-CoA ). This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. This step is the regulated, rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for the statin drugs (HMG-CoA reductase competitive inhibitors). Mevalonate is then converted to 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate in three reactions that require ATP. Mevalonate is decarboxylated to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which is a key metabolite for various biological reactions. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum. Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol. Finally, lanosterol is then converted to cholesterol. [ Rhodes, Carl; Stryer, Lubert; Tasker, Roy Biochemistry 4th W.H. Freeman San Francisco 1995 280, 703 0-7167-2009-4 ] Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. [ Regulation of cholesterol synthesis ] Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). [ Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes Annu. Rev. Genet. 41 401–27 2007 17666007 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 ] In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP-cleavage-activating protein) and Insig1. When cholesterol levels fall, Insig-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, allowing the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus, where SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 and -2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low. The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The former scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol. [ Brown MS, Goldstein JL The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor 1997 Cell 89 331–40 9150132 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 3 ] A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation. Cholesterol synthesis can be turned off when cholesterol levels are high, as well. HMG CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain functions to sense signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain&apos;s oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteosome. This enzyme&apos;s activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.

Freeman San Francisco 2002 726–727 0-7167-4955-6 ] [ Plasma transport and regulation of absorption ] [ Blood lipids ] Cholesterol is only slightly soluble in water; it can dissolve and travel in the water-based bloodstream at exceedingly small concentrations. Since cholesterol is insoluble in blood, it is transported in the circulatory system within lipoprotein s, complex discoidal particles that have an exterior composed of amphiphilic proteins and lipids whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; triglycerides and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the surface monolayer of the lipoprotein particle. In addition to providing a soluble means for transporting cholesterol through the blood, lipoproteins have cell-targeting signals that direct the lipids they carry to certain tissues. For this reason, there are several types of lipoproteins within blood called, in order of increasing density, chylomicron s, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The more lipid and less protein a lipoprotein has the less dense it is. The cholesterol within all the various lipoproteins is identical, although some cholesterol is carried as the &quot; free &quot; alcohol and some is carried as fatty acyl esters referred to as cholesterol esters. However, the different lipoproteins contain apolipoproteins, which serve as ligands for specific receptors on cell membranes. In this way, the lipoprotein particles are molecular addresses that determine the start- and endpoints for cholesterol transport. Chylomicrons, the least dense type of cholesterol transport molecules, contain apolipoprotein B-48, apolipoprotein C, and apolipoprotein E in their shells. Chylomicrons are the transporters that carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues that need fatty acids for energy or fat production. Cholesterol that is not used by muscles remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, which are taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver. VLDL molecules are produced by the liver and contain excess triacylglycerol and cholesterol that is not required by the liver for synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E in their shells. During transport in the bloodstream, the blood vessels cleave and absorb more triacylglycerol from IDL molecules, which contain an even higher percentage of cholesterol. The IDL molecules have two possible fates: Half are into metabolism by HTGL, taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, and the other half continue to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they form LDL molecules, which have the highest percentage of cholesterol within them. LDL molecules, therefore, are the major carriers of cholesterol in the blood, and each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. The shell of the LDL molecule contains just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, which is recognized by the LDL receptor in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors become localized in clathrin -coated pits. Both the LDL and its receptor are internalized by endocytosis to form a vesicle within the cell. The vesicle then fuses with a lysosome, which has an enzyme called lysosomal acid lipase that hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. Now within the cell, the cholesterol can be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with cell membranes. Synthesis of the LDL receptor is regulated by SREBP, the same regulatory protein as was used to control synthesis of cholesterol de novo in response to cholesterol presence in the cell. When the cell has abundant cholesterol, LDL receptor synthesis is blocked so new cholesterol in the form of LDL molecules cannot be taken up. On the converse, more LDL receptors are made when the cell is deficient in cholesterol. When this system is deregulated, many LDL molecules appear in the blood without receptors on the peripheral tissues. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by macrophages, which become engorged and form foam cells. These cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to artherosclerotic plaque formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness). [ Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness PLoS ONE 5 10 e13467 2010 20976107 2956704 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 Federici Massimo ] These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a lipoprotein ) with &quot; bad &quot; cholesterol. Also, HDL particles are thought to transport cholesterol back to the liver for excretion or to other tissues that use cholesterol to synthesize hormones in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). [ Lewis GF, Rader DJ New insights into the regulation of HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport Circ. Res. 96 12 1221–32 2005 June 15976321 10.1161/01.RES.0000170946.56981.5c ] Having large numbers of large HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes.

[ Metabolism, recycling and excretion ] Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as oxysterol s. Three different mechanisms can form these; autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. [ Kandutsch AA, Chen HW, Heiniger HJ Biological activity of some oxygenated sterols Science 201 4355 498–501 1978 August 663671 10.1126/science.663671 ] This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”. Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their: participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription.

[ Javitt NB Bile acid synthesis from cholesterol: regulatory and auxiliary pathways FASEB J. 8 15 1308–11 1994 December 8001744 ] These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, glucuronic acid, or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. [ Wolkoff AW, Cohen DE Bile acid regulation of hepatic physiology: I.

Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstone s. Although, lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently. [ Marschall HU, Einarsson C Gallstone disease J. Intern.

This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. A cholesterol-reducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces.

This disease process leads to myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles, [ Brunzell JD, Davidson M, Furberg CD, Goldberg RB, Howard BV, Stein JH, Witztum JL Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation Diabetes Care 31 4 811–22 2008 April 18375431 10.2337/dc08-9018 ] LDL particles are often termed &quot; bad cholesterol &quot; because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as &quot; good cholesterol &quot;. These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body build, medication s, food choices, and other factors. [ Durrington P Dyslipidaemia Lancet 362 9385 717–31 2003 August 12957096 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1 ] Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially &quot; small dense LDL &quot; (sdLDL) particles, are associated with atheroma formation in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is the principal cause of coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people.

Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high. In contrast, however, if LDL particle number is low (mostly large particles) and a large percentage of the HDL particles are large, then atheroma growth rates are usually low, even negative, for any given total cholesterol concentration. [ February 2007 ] Recently, a post hoc analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of &quot; good cholesterol &quot;.

[ 67 Lipid modification 2008 ] Extreme cases have previously been treated with partial ileal bypass surgery, which has now been superseded by medication. Apheresis -based treatments are still used for very severe hyperlipidemias that are either unresponsive to treatment or require rapid lowering of blood lipids. [ April 2011 ] Multiple human trials using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins, have repeatedly confirmed that changing lipoprotein transport patterns from unhealthy to healthier patterns significantly lowers cardiovascular disease event rates, even for people with cholesterol values currently considered low for adults. [ September 2008 ] Studies have also found that statins reduce atheroma progression. [ 10.1586/14779072.6.7.925 ] As a result, people with a history of cardiovascular disease may derive benefit from statins irrespective of their cholesterol levels, [ MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin in 20,536 high-risk individuals: a randomised placebo-controlled trial Lancet 360 9326 7–22 2002 July 12114036 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09327-3 Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group ] and in men without cardiovascular disease, there is benefit from lowering abnormally high cholesterol levels ( &quot; primary prevention &quot; ).

The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 100  mg/dL (2.6 mmol /L), { &quot; About cholesterol &quot; – American Heart Association } although a newer upper limit of 70  mg/dL (1.8  mmol/L) can be considered in higher-risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier. Of note, typical LDL values for children before fatty streaks begin to develop is 35  mg/dL. [ October 2009 ] { Reference ranges for blood tests, showing usual, as well as optimal, levels of HDL, LDL and total cholesterol in mass and molar concentrations, is found in orange color at right, that is, among the blood constituents with the highest concentration. } Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a variant ): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400  mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400  mg/dL. [ Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints Clin. Chem. 36 1 15–9 1990 January 2297909 ] Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes. [ 19645040 ] In the Framingham Heart Study, in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1  mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to the fact that people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels.

This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age.

Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. [ Cholesterol testing ] [ section report US measures, whereas the measure in many places is mmol/L, into which they need to be converted, therefore the section October 2009 ] The American Heart Association recommends testing cholesterol every five years for people aged 20 years or older. [ http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier%3D541 How To Get Your Cholesterol Tested American Heart Association 2009-02-21 ] A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to determine a lipoprotein profile. This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 200  mg/dL or more, or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 40  mg/dL, or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. (In different countries measurements are given in mg/dL or mmol/L; 1  mmol/L is 38.665  mg/dL.) [ Interactive pathway map ] [ Cholesterol ] [ Cholesteric liquid crystals ] Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the liquid crystal line &quot; cholesteric phase &quot;. The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a chiral nematic phase, and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in liquid crystal display thermometer s and in temperature-sensitive paints.
