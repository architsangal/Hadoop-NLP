[ Life before boxing ] Born into a blue collar Irish-Catholic { http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/g/gerry_cooney.html } family on Long Island, Cooney was encouraged to become a professional fighter by his father. His brother Tommy Cooney was also a boxer, and reached the finals of the New York Golden Gloves Sub-Novice Heavyweight division. [ Amateur boxing ] Fighting as an amateur, Gerry Cooney won international tournaments in England, Wales and Scotland, as well as the New York Golden Gloves titles. He won two New York Golden Gloves Championships, the 1973 160  lb Sub-Novice Championship and the 1976 Heavyweight Open Championship. Cooney defeated Larry Derrick to win the 1973 160  lb Sub-Novice title, and Earlous Tripp to win the 1976 Heavyweight Open title. In 1975 he reached the finals of the 175  lb Open division, but was defeated by Johnny Davis. Cooney trained at the Huntington Athletic Club in Long Island, New York where his trainer was John Capobianco, Sr. His amateur record consisted of 55 wins and 3 losses. When he turned professional, Cooney signed with co-managers Mike Jones and Dennis Rappaport. He was then trained by Victor Valle Sr. { SIVAULT 6/2/80, New York Daily News Archives, SIVAULT 4/19/82, New York Daily News Archives } [ Professional career ] Known for his big left-hook and his imposing size, the tall, lean Cooney had his first paid fight on February 15, 1977, beating Billy Jackson by a knockout in one round. Nine wins followed and Cooney gained attention as a future contender. Although his opponents were carefully chosen. He moved up a weight class and fought future world cruiserweight champion S.T. Gordon in Las Vegas, winning by a fourth round disqualification. Cooney had 11 more wins, spanning 1978 and 1979. Among those he defeated were Charlie Polite, former US heavyweight champion Eddie Lopez, and Tom Prater. These were not rated contenders however. By 1980, Cooney was being featured on national television. Stepping up he beat one time title challengers Jimmy Young and Ron Lyle, both by &apos; knockout,&apos; although the Young fight was stopped because of cuts sustained by Young. { Boxing 101, Cooney vs. Jimmy Young: VHS Classic Rewind &quot;, May 25, 2012 } By now he was ranked number 1 by the WBC and eager for a match with champion Larry Holmes. In 1981, he defeated former world heavyweight champion Ken Norton by a knockout just 54 seconds into the first round with a blisteringly powerful attack. { Boxing 101, Cooney vs. Ken Norton: VHS Classic Rewind &quot;, May 31, 2012 } This broke the record set in 1948 by Lee Savold for the quickest knockout in a main event in Madison Square Garden. Since his management team was unwilling to risk losing a big future pay day with Holmes by having him face another viable fighter, Cooney did not fight for 13 months after defeating Norton. { Boxing 101, &quot; Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part One - The Championship Fight &quot;, April 30, 2012 } The following year, Holmes agreed to fight him. With a purse of ten million dollars for the challenger, it was the richest fight in boxing history to that time. The promotion of the fight took on racial overtones that were exaggerated by the promoters, something Cooney did not agree with. He believed that skill, not race, should determine if a boxer was good. However, if Cooney won, he would have become the first Caucasian world heavyweight champion since Swede Ingemar Johansson defeated Floyd Patterson 23 years earlier. This caused Don King to label Cooney &quot; The Great White Hope. &quot; The bout drew attention worldwide, and Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney was one of the biggest closed-circuit/pay-per-view productions in history, broadcast to over 150 countries. Cooney fought bravely after he was knocked down briefly in the second round. Some believe he was winning until he was deducted three points for repeated low blows in round 10. But after 12 rounds, the more skillful and experienced Holmes finally wore him down. In round 13, Cooney&apos;s trainer stepped into the ring to save his fighter from further punishment. After a long layoff, Cooney fought in September 1984, beating Phillip Brown by a 4th round knockout in Anchorage, Alaska. { http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122673/2/index.htm } He fought once more that year and won, but personal problems kept him out of the ring. { Boxing 101, &quot; Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part Two - Life After Boxing &quot;, May 1, 2012, } Cooney was far past his prime when he made an ill advised comeback against former world heavyweight and world light heavyweight champion Michael Spinks. Boxing carefully with constant sharp counters Spinks knocked him out in round 5. Cooney&apos;s last fight was in 1990. He was knocked out in a match of the veterans in two slugging rounds by former world champion George Foreman. Cooney did stagger Foreman in the first round however, but he was simply overmatched. Cooney compiled a professional record of 28 wins and 3 losses, with 24 knockouts. He is ranked number 53 on Ring Magazine &apos; s list of &quot; 100 Greatest Punchers of All Time &quot;. [ Boxing style ] Cooney had an orthodox style, with a good jab, a lethal left hook, but seldom used his right. Most of his fights ended in quick knockouts; while this benefited him in the beginning of his career, it left him unprepared for his fight with Larry Holmes. { Boxing 101, &quot; Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part One - The Championship Fight &quot;, April 30, 2012 } Despite his devastating punching power, Cooney&apos;s moderate stamina and lack of experience proved to be his downfall. Many feel he had real potential, but was limited by his lack of experience. Cooney&apos;s left-hook is described as one of the most powerful punches in boxing history. Foreman, Holmes, and Lyle all stated that Cooney&apos;s left was the hardest they had ever taken. It is also notable that Holmes had also previously fought Earnie Shavers, and at the time stated Shavers had the most powerful blow he had ever received. Cooney was known for not throwing punches at the head, aiming instead for his opponent&apos;s chest, ribs, or stomach. But this made him at times vulnerable against Holmes for example. [ Present life ] Cooney founded the Fighters&apos; Initiative for Support and Training, an organization which helps retired boxers find jobs. He has always tried to distance himself from the racism of the Holmes vs. Cooney match promotion. He and Holmes have become very good friends over the years. Cooney is also heavily involved with J.A.B., the first union for boxers. He became a boxing promoter for title bouts featuring Roberto Durán, Héctor Camacho, and George Foreman. Cooney is a supporter with of the &quot; Hands are not for hitting &quot; program, which tries to prevent domestic violence. He also does his part to instill and build interest in the sport by guiding aspiring young fighters in the gym. { Boxing 101, &quot; Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part Four - The Future of Boxing &quot;, May 3, 2012 } In June 2010, Cooney became the co-host of &quot; Friday Night at the Fights &quot; on SIRIUS XM Radio where he shares his views with listeners on active fighters and relevant issues in the sport. { Boxing 101, &quot; Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part Two - Life After Boxing &quot;, May 1, 2012 } { Boxing 101, &quot; Gerry Cooney, Still A Gentleman 30 Years Later: Part Three - Boxing Today &quot;, May 2, 2012 } Gerry Cooney now resides in Fanwood, New Jersey with his wife Jennifer and their three children. He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame at Walt Whitman High School, where he graduated.
