Jamshedpur is the first planned industrial city of India, founded by the late Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata. It is also known as Steel City, TataNagar or simply Tata. Jamshedpur is the headquarters of the East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand. It has a population of 2,337,131 (according to the 2011 census) and is the third Largest city in Eastern India after Kolkata and Patna. It ranks 36th among the 53 million-plus cities in India. { http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/india2/Million_Plus_UAs_Cities_2011.pdf } It is located on the Chota Nagpur plateau and is surrounded by the picturesque Dalma Hills. The city is bordered by the rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai on the north and west parts of the city. Jamshedpur is a major industrial centre of East India. It houses companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Lafarge Cement, Telcon, BOC Gases, Tata Technologies Limited, Praxair, TCE, TCS, Tinplate and many more. It is home to one of the largest industrial zones of India known as Adityapur which houses more than 1,200 small and medium scale industries. Jamshedpur was declared the 7th cleanest city of India for the year 2010 according to survey by the Government of India. { http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2010/may/d2010051103.pdf } In a survey in the year 2007, Jamshedpur was declared the 7th richest city of India. The survey was conducted on the basis of the percentage of population whose annual income is more than 1 million Rupees. It has been predicted as the 84th fastest growing city in the world for the timeframe 2006-2020. { http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html } A major part of the city is run by Tata Steel itself. Jamshedpur has been selected as one of the cities for the Global Compact Cities Pilot Programme by United Nations, the only one to be selected in India as well as the entire South-East Asia. { http://www.tata.co.in/company/Media/inside.aspx?artid=SUI2Ut3iDDk= } [ Etymology ] In 1919 Lord Chelmsford named the city, which was early a village called Sakchi to Jamshedpur in honour of its founder, Jamshedji Nausserwanji Tata, whose birthday is celebrated on 3 March as Founder&apos;s Day. J. N. Tata had written to his son Dorabji Tata about his vision of a great city in the area. On Founders Day, the [ 225 acre km2 on ] Jubilee Park is decorated with brilliant lightwork for about a week. The city has several nicknames including &apos;Steel City&apos; (which was referenced during TATA Steel&apos;s &apos;Green City - Clean City - Steel City&apos; campaign); &apos;Tatanagar&apos; after the name of its railway station Tatanagar Railway Station or simply &apos;Tata&apos; in deference to the presence of Tata companies. At one time it was also known as &apos;Kalimati&apos; (meaning &quot; black soil &quot; ) after the village near the Sakchi area. The only trace of the name is the main road through Sakchi area of Jamshedpur which is named Kalimati road. [ History ] Tata Steel plant in the early 20th century By the end of 19th century Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata met steel makers in Pittsburgh to get the most advanced technology for his plant. It is said that he got the idea of building a steel plant when he heard Thomas Carlyle declaring that &quot; the nation which gains control of iron soon acquires the control of gold &quot; in a lecture in Manchester. { http://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/heritage/landmark.asp } At the turn of the twentieth century, Jamshetji Tata asked geologist Charles Page Perin to help him find the site to build India&apos;s first steel plant. The search for a site rich in iron, coal, limestone and water began in April 1904 in today&apos;s Madhya Pradesh. The prospectors C. M. Weld, Dorabji Tata and Shapurji Saklatvala, took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the Chota Nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers. It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected. { http://www.tatasteel100.com/heritage/history/history04.asp } In 1908 the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began. The first steel ingot was rolled on 16 February 1912. It was a momentous day in the history of industrial India. { http://www.tatasteel100.com/heritage/history/history07.asp } Jamshedji&apos;s plan for the city was clear. He envisioned far more than a mere row of workers hutments. He insisted upon building all the comforts and conveniences a city could provide. As a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the Jubilee Park. While building the city, Jamshedji Tata had said, &quot; Be sure to lay wide streets planted with shady trees, every other of a quick growing variety. Be sure that there is plenty of space for lawns and gardens; reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks; earmark areas for Hindu temples, Mohammedan mosques and Christian churches. &quot; Messrs Julin Kennedy Sahlin of Pittsburgh, U.S.A, prepared the first layout of the town of Jamshedpur. { http://tripsguru.com/places/Jamshedpur/moredetails.html } What the city looks like today is a testament to his visionary plans. { http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_t/tata_steel/20070131_hundred_years.htm } Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation. Legend has it that in the late 1980s when the state government proposed a law to end the Tatas&apos; administration of Jamshedpur and bring the city under a municipality, the local populace rose in protest and defeated the government&apos;s proposal. In 2005, a similar proposal was once again put up by lobbying politicians. The target audience was the working class. A large majority sided with the government and set up protest meetings outside the East-Singhbhum Deputy Commissioner&apos;s office. However, the objective was never achieved and Jamshedpur remains without a municipality. { http://www.financialexpress.com/news/jamshedpur-citizens-do-not-want-municipal-corporation/64894/ } [ http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030613/asp/jamshedpur/story_2064297.asp Calcutta, India The Telegraph Push to civic makeover 13 June 2003 ] { http://origin-www.ibnlive.com/news/jamshedpur-on-a-renewal-mission/20820-7.html } [ Geography ] Jamshedpur is situated in the southern end of the state of Jharkhand and is bordered by the states of Orissa and West Bengal.
