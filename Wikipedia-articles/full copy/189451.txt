From 1996 to 2000 and from 2004 until his retirement in 2008, Iliescu was a Senator for the Social Democratic Party (PSD), whose honorary president he remains. He joined the Communist Party in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965, however beginning with 1971 he was gradually marginalized by Nicolae Ceauşescu. He had a leading role in the Revolution of 1989, being elected as Romania&apos;s first post-communist president in 1990. After a new Constitution was approved by popular referendum, he served a further two terms as president, 1992 to 1996, and 2000 to 2004, separated by the presidency of Emil Constantinescu. Iliescu is widely recognized as a predominant figure in the first fifteen years of post- 1989 Romanian Revolution politics. During his terms Romanian politics stabilized, and Romania joined NATO. [ Family background ] Iliescu&apos;s father, Alexandru Iliescu, was a railroad worker with Communist views during the period in which the Romanian Communist Party was banned by the authorities. In 1931, he went to the Soviet Union to take part in the Communist Party Congress of Gorikovo, near Moscow. He remained in the USSR for the next four years and was arrested upon his return. He was imprisoned from June 1940 to August 1944 and died in August 1945. During his time in the Soviet Union, Alexandru Iliescu divorced and married Mariţa, a chambermaid. [ Early life ] 1965 political poster { Elena Ceauşescu } Iliescu married Nina Şerbănescu in 1951; they have no children, not by choice but because they couldn&apos;t, as Nina had three miscarriage s. { &quot; De ce nu a avut Ion Iliescu urmasi &quot;, Ziua, 5 September 2008 } Born in Olteniţa, Iliescu studied fluid mechanics at the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute and then as a foreign student at the Energy Institute of the Moscow University. During his stay in Moscow, he was the secretary of the &quot; Association of Romanian Students &quot; it is alleged that he knew Mikhail Gorbachev, although Iliescu always denied this. { New York Times, &quot; Upheaval in the East: A Rising Star; A Man Who Could Become Rumania&apos;s Leader &quot;, 23 December 1989, p. 15 } President Nicolae Ceauşescu, however, probably believed a connection between the two existed, since during Gorbachev&apos;s visit to Romania in July 1989, Iliescu was sent outside of Bucharest to prevent any contact. { România Liberă. &quot; Gura lumii despre România &quot;, May 8, 1990, quoting } { Paris Match } He joined the Union of Communist Youth in 1944 and the Communist Party in 1953 and made a career in the Communist nomenklatura, becoming a secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth in 1956 and a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965. At one point, he served as the head of the Central Committee&apos;s Department of Propaganda. Iliescu later served as Minister for Youth-related Issues between 1967 and 1971. However, in 1971, Ceauşescu felt threatened by Iliescu - as he was seen as Ceauşescu&apos;s heir apparent - and he was marginalized by and removed from all major political offices, being assigned vice-president of the Timiş County Council (1971–1974), and later president of the Iaşi Council (1974–1979). In 1984, he was excluded from the Central Committee, and until 1989 he was in charge of Editura Tehnică publishing house. For most of the 1980s (if not before), he was tailed by the Securitate (secret police), as he was known to oppose Ceauşescu&apos;s harsh rule. [ Sebetsyen Victor Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire Pantheon Books New York City 2009 0-375-42532-2 ] [ 1989 Revolution ] The 1989 Romanian Revolution began as a popular revolt in Timişoara. After Ceauşescu was overthrown on 22 December (he was executed on Christmas Day), the political vacuum was filed by an organization named National Salvation Front (FSN: Frontul Salvării Naţionale), formed spontaneously by second-rank communist party members opposed to the policies of Ceauşescu and non-affiliated participants in the revolt. Iliescu was quickly acknowledged as the leader of the organization and therefore of the provisional authority. He&apos;d first learned of the revolution when he noticed the Securitate was no longer tailing him. Iliescu proposed multi-party elections and an &quot; original democracy &quot;. This is widely held to have meant the adoption of Perestroika -style reforms rather than the complete removal of existing institutions; it can be linked to the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country. Iliescu did not renounce the communist ideology and the program he initially presented during the revolution included restructuring the agriculture and the reorganization of trade, but not a switch to capitalism. These views were held by other members of the FSN, such as Silviu Brucan, who claimed in early 1990 that the revolution was against Ceauşescu, not against communism. [ November 2011 ] Iliescu later evoked the possibility of trying a &quot; Swedish model &quot; of socialism. Rumours abounded for years that Illiescu and other second-rank Communists had been planning to overthrow Ceauşescu, but the events of December 1989 overtook them. For instance, Nicolae Militaru, the new regime&apos;s first defense minister, said that Illiescu and others had planned to take Ceauşescu prisoner in February 1990 while he was out of the capital. However, Illiescu denies this, saying that the nature of the Ceauşescu regime made it all but impossible to make the serious plans necessary to launch a pre-planned coup. [ After the 1989 Revolution ] [ 50px Ion Iliescu Preşedintele (President) Preşedintele (President) Domnia Sa/Excelenţa Sa (His Excellency) ] The National Salvation Front decided to run in the free legislative elections of 20 May 1990, winning over 70% of the votes. Iliescu and his supporters split from the Front and created the NSDF (National Salvation Democratic Front), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see Social Democratic Party of Romania ). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a national government or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility. Under the pressure of the events that led to the Mineriad s, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of the Perestroika, Iliescu adopted a social democratic position, aligning himself with the Western European political spectrum. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong nationalist and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceauşescu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the Eastern bloc, Romania&apos;s tended to retain various cornerstones. Iliescu and U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002 The new Constitution was adopted in 1991, and in 1992 he won a second term when he received 61% of the vote. According to Romanian political analysts such as Daniel Barbu or Dan Pavel, his election was based almost exclusively on the rural population and disoriented lower class industrial workers, controlled through manipulation from the state-controlled media ( Televiziunea Română, the state television, was the only wide-scale TV channel until 1993). [ May 2011 ] He ran for a third time in 1996 but, stripped of media monopoly, that of virtually all urban citizens and even of some traditional votes, [ May 2011 ] he lost to Emil Constantinescu. Over 1,000,000 votes were cancelled, leading to accusations of widespread fraud. In the 2000 presidential election Iliescu ran again and won in the run-off against the ultra-nationalist { http://www.realitatea.net/preda-antonescu-il-secondeaza-pe-vadim-tudor-cu-discursul-ultranationalist_718413.html } { http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article &amp; article_id=4066 } { http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/romania/tudor.html } Corneliu Vadim Tudor. He began his third term on December 20 of that year, ending on 20 December 2004. The center-right was severely defeated during the 2000 elections due largely to public dissatisfaction with the harsh economic reforms of the previous four years as well as the political instability and infighting of the multiparty coalition. Tudor&apos;s extreme views also ensured that most urban voters either abstained or chose Iliescu. In the PSD elections of 21 April 2005, Iliescu lost the Party presidency to Mircea Geoană, but was elected as honorary president of the party in 2006, a position without official executive authority in the party. [ Controversies ] Though enjoying a certain popularity due to his opposition to Ceauşescu and image as a revolutionary, his political career after 1989 was characterized by multiple controversies and scandals. Public opinion regarding his tenure as president is still divided. { http://www.sfin.ro/articol_13481/al_cincilea_iliescu.html?action=print } [ Alleged KGB connections ] Some alleged he had connections to the KGB, the allegations continued during 2003-2008, when Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, who had been granted access to Soviet archives, declared that Iliescu and some of the NSF members were KGB agents, that Iliescu had been in close connection with Mikhail Gorbachev ever since they had allegedly met during Iliescu&apos;s stay in Moscow, and that the Romanian Revolution of 1989 was a plot organized by the KGB to regain control of the country&apos;s policies (gradually lost under Ceauşescu&apos;s rule). { Russian dissident who copied the Gorbachev Foundation&apos;s archive: Mitterrand and Gorbachev wanted the European Socialist Union, Thatcher opposed Germany&apos;s reunification } The only hard evidence published was a discussion between Gorbachev and Bulgaria&apos;s Aleksandar Lilov from May 23, 1990 (after Iliescu&apos;s victory in the May 20 elections) in which Gorbachev says that Iliescu holds a &quot; calculated position &quot;, and that despite sharing common views with Iliescu, Gorbachev wanted to avoid sharing this impression with the public. { Dovada Bukovski } [ Mineriads ] [ Mineriad ] He, along with other figures in the leading FSN, was allegedly responsible for calling the Jiu Valley miners to Bucharest on 28 January and June 14, 1990 to end the protests of the citizens gathered in University Square, Bucharest, protests aimed against the ex-communist leaders of Romania. The pejorative term used to describe this demonstration was the Golaniad (from the Romanian golan, rascal). On June 13, an attempt of the authorities to remove from the square around 100 protesters, which had remained in the street even after the May elections had confirmed Iliescu and the FSN, resulted in attacks against several state institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior, the Bucharest Police Headquarters and the National Television. Iliescu issued a call to the Romanian people to come and defend the government, prompting several group of miners to descend on the capital, armed with wooden clubs and bats. They trashed the University of Bucharest, some newspaper offices and the headquarters of opposition parties, claiming that they were havens of decadence and immorality - drugs, firearms and munitions, &quot; an automatic typewriter &quot;, and fake currency. The June 1990 Mineriad in particular was widely criticized both at home and internationally, with one historian (Andrei Pippidi) comparing the events to Nazi Germany&apos;s Kristallnacht. { http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/mineriadele-anului-1990-democratia-sub-bate-898037.html } { http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/investigatii/minerii-au-terorizat-capitala-30479.html } Government inquiries later established that the miners were infiltrated and instigated by former Securitate operatives. { Baleanu, V. G. &apos;&apos;The Enemy Within: The Romanian Intelligence Service in Transition. January 1995. Conflict Studies Research Centre, The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst: Camberley, Surrey GU15 4PQ. } In February 1994 a Bucharest court &quot; found two security officers, Colonel Ion. Nicolae and warrant officer Corneliu Dumitrescu, guilty of ransacking the house of Ion Raţiu, a leading figure in the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, during the miners’ incursion, and stealing $100,000. &quot; { Deletant, Dennis. &quot; Chapter 25: The Security Services since 1989: Turning over a new leaf. &quot; 2004. Carey, Henry F., ed. &apos;&apos;Romania since 1989: politics, economics, and society.&apos;&apos; Lexington Books: Oxford. Pages 507-510. } [ Pardons ] In December 2001, Iliescu pardon ed three inmates convicted for bribery, including George Tănase, former Financial Guard head commissioner for Ialomiţa. { Presedintele Ion Iliescu a acordat gratieri } Iliescu had to revoke Tănase&apos;s pardon a few days later due to the media outcry, claiming that &quot; a legal adviser was superficial in analyzing the case &quot;. { Romania&apos;s president to cancel pardon, pledges to fight corruption } { Colaboratorii presedintelui. Opinii - de Octavian PALER } Later, the humanitarian reasons invoked in the pardon were contradicted by another medical expert opinion. { Gratierea lui Iliescu miroase suspect de la o posta } Another controversial pardon was that of Dan Tartagă —a businessman from Braşov that, while drunk, had run over and killed two people on a pedestrian crossing. He was sentenced to three years and a half but was pardoned after only a couple of months. { Ambasada SUA: Nu a inceput anchetarea puscasului marin] (in the background section) } Tartagă was later sentenced to a two-year sentence for fraud. { Afacere imobiliara cu iz de TBC la Brasov (in the background section) } Most controversial of all, on 15 December 2004, a few days before the end of his last term, Iliescu pardon ed 47 convicts, including Miron Cozma, the leader of the miners during the early 1990s, who had been sentenced in 1999 to 18 years in prison in conjunction with the 1991 Mineriad. This has attracted harsh criticism from all Romanian media. { Gratiatii lui Iliescu-Nastase: corupti, tilhari, violatori, tepari } Many of the pardoned had been convicted for corruption or other economic crimes, while one had been imprisoned for his involvement in the attempts at suppressing the 1989 Revolution. [ Decorating Vadim Tudor ] In the last days of his President mandate, he awarded the National Order Steaua României (rank of ceremonial knighthood) to the ultra-nationalist controversial politician Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a gesture which drew criticism in the press and prompted Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, fifteen Radio Free Europe journalists, Timişoara mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandu, song writer Alexandru Andrieş, and historian Randolph Braham to return their Romanian honours in protest. The leader of Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, Béla Markó, did not show up to claim the award he received on the same occasion. The current president, Traian Băsescu, revoked the award granted to Tudor on May 24, 2007, but a lawsuit is ongoing even after Băsescu&apos;s decree was declared constitutional. { Curtea Constituţională a respins excepţia invocată de Vadim Tudor in procesul privind Ordinul &quot; Steaua Romaniei &quot; } [ Black sites ] Ion Iliescu is mentioned in the report of the Council of Europe investigator into illegal activities of the CIA in Europe, Dick Marty. He is pointed out as one of the people who authorized or at least knew about and have to stand accountable for torture prisons at Mihail Kogălniceanu airbase from 2003 to 2005.
