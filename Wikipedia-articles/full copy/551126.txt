[ Early life and modeling career ] Xuxa was born Maria da Graça Meneghel and &quot; Xuxa &quot; was originally a nickname given by her brother, which she would legally add to her name in 1988. { Xuxa Biography. Xuxa.globo.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-28. } Her family moved to Rio de Janeiro when she was 7. Xuxa was discovered by the publishing company Bloch Editores and she appeared on the cover of one of their magazines, Carinho, at the age of 16, starting a career in the adult entertainment business, however, she had a smooth crossover to the children&apos;s entertainment business, which she does to this day. At 17, she began to date the Brazilian football legend Pelé, who was seen as being influential in launching her career. { Xuxa, Pelé e a Playboy Muita Pimenta Retrieved July 12, 2011 } They had a personal relationship from 1981 to 1986. { Histórias secretas de Playboy (4): o dia em que Pelé foi, pessoalmente, recolher todas as fotos de Xuxa nua | Ricardo Setti – VEJA.com.

Retrieved on 2011-11-30. } In 1982 she posed for the Brazilian version of Playboy Magazine as well as &quot; Ela &quot; Magazine, in pictorials that showed her in various suggestive poses highlighting her well-conditioned physique. This Playboy quickly sold out and became one of the most highly valued editions of the magazine&apos;s international circulation (which at that time was at its zenith in circulation). Years later, Xuxa, through her various managers, and through the personal intervention of Pelé, would attempt to buy up the transparencies, prints, scans and rights for all published and non-published photos from the Playboy shoots; but by this time they had been widely distributed and subsequently became increasingly popular on the Internet. [ Film career ] [ April 2011 ] Her first starring role was in Amor Estranho Amor (English title: Love Strange Love), an 1982 Brazilian film. Produced by Anibal Massaini Neto by Cinearte, the plot involves an adult man&apos;s recollection of a short period in his life in 1937. As a young man, he visited his mother, the favorite woman of an important politician, in a bordello owned by her, right before key political changes in Brazil. In those hours, he discovers his own sexuality. Although rather tame by today&apos;s modern standards, the movie was considered somewhat controversial by some because it contains two brief scenes of sensuality between the libertine character played by Xuxa and that of the young man. In 1983, Xuxa had a minor role in the comedy group Os Trapalhões &apos;s movie Os Trapalhões e o Mágico de Oróz, a spoof of The Wizard of Oz. She followed it up with a minor role in another Os Trapalhões movis, Os Trapalhões e a Arca de Noé in 1984. In 1985, in Os Trapalhões no Reino da Fantasia she starred for the first time in a Os Trapalhões movie, followed in 1989 by A Princesa Xuxa e Os Trapalhões (Princess Xuxa and The Messed-Up Guys). The following year, she starred in two more movies: Xuxa e os Trapalhões em O Mistério de Robin Hood and Lua de Cristal. The latter included her song single Lua de Cristal. Xuxa also starred in Super Xuxa Contra Baixo Astral, which included her song Arco-Íris (Rainbow). In 1992 she starred in her last Os Trapalhões movie, O Mistério de Robin Hood. It took seven years before she made her next film, 1999&apos;s Xuxa Requebra. Her following movie, Xuxa Popstar, is one of the worst 10 comedies in history at the Internet Movie Database, with a rating of 1.4 stars out of 10. { Top Rated &quot; Comedy &quot; Titles, imdb.com } In 2001, she made Xuxa e os Duendes (Xuxa and the Elves). Since then, she has released a new movie every year. Xuxa e os Duendes 2 (Xuxa and the Elves – In the Way of the Fairies) in 2002, Xuxa Abracadabra in 2003, Xuxa e o Mistério da Cidade Perdida in 2004, and Xuxinha e Guto: Contra os Monstros do Espaço (Xuxinha and Guto Against the Monsters of the Galaxy) in 2005. In December 2009, Xuxa launched the movie Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha (The Mystery of Feiurinha) in Brazil with her daughter Sasha. In 2010, the film was released in the United States and Angola. Xuxinha e Guto: Contra os Monstros do Espaço, Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha, Xuxa em Sonho de Menina and Xuxa Popstar are among the 10 worst Family Films in history on the Internet Movie Database, earning Xuxa the dubious honour of being the only actress with multiple films in that list, all of them with less than 1.4 stars out of 10, dominating the category. { Top Rated &quot; Family &quot; Titles, imdb.com } In her 2006 movie, Xuxa Gêmeas, she played twins, one evil and one good. The movie featured the singer Ivete Sangalo and was a &quot; comeback &quot; of Xuxa in the cinema. The movie had more than 1 million viewers and also received very poor ratings by international audiences with 1.7 stars out of 10 at the Internet Movie Database. { Xuxa Gêmeas (2006), imdb.com } [ Filmography ] Year Film Audience 1982 Amor Estranho Amor 1983 Black Beetle 1983 Fun on Noah&apos;s Ark 1983 Os Trapalhões e o Mágico de Oróz 1984 Os Trapalhões e a Arca de Noé 1985 Os Trapalhões no Reino da Fantasia 1988 Super Xuxa Contra Baixo Astral 1989 A Princesa Xuxa e os Trapalhões 1990 Lua de Cristal 1990 O Mistério de Robin Hood 1991 Gaúcho Negro 1999 Xuxa Requebra 2000 Xuxa Popstar 2001 Xuxa e os Duendes 2002 &apos;&apos;Xuxa e os Duendes&apos;&apos; 2 2003 Xuxa Abracadabra 2004 Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida 2005 Xuxinha e Guto: Contra os Monstros do Espaço 2006 Xuxa Twins 2007 Xuxa em Sonho de Menina 2009 Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha [ Discography ] See in Xuxa Discography [ References ] [ External links ] [ Xuxa ] [ 0579430 Xuxa Meneghel ] Xuxa Official Website [ Xuxa Brazilian actress and singer March 27, 1892 a.C Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil ] Category:1963 births Category:Brazilian film actors Category:Brazilian television actors Category:Brazilian female singers Category:Brazilian television presenters Category:Brazilian vegetarians Category:Living people Category:People from Rio Grande do Sul Category:Brazilian people of Polish descent Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:Brazilian people of Austrian descent Category:Portuguese-language singers Category:Spanish-language singers Category:Brazilian film producers ast:Xuxa ca:Xuxa de:Xuxa es:Xuxa fr:Xuxa ko:슈샤 (연예인) hr:Xuxa he:שושה (זמרת) nl:Xuxa pl:Xuxa pt:Xuxa sv:Xuxa
