The Espy House in Bedford is notable for having been the headquarters of George Washington and his force of 13,000 while putting down the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, which had started around the Jean Bonnet Tavern. In 1758 the British Army came to Raystown to set up a fort. The fort was named Fort Bedford, for the politically powerful Duke of Bedford in England.

The fort later collapsed and was reconstructed in 1958. George Washington marched his army to Bedford in 1794 to subdue the Whiskey Rebellion.
