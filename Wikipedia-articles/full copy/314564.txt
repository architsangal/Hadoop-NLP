Fishman and Geertz (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) U.S. District Court for the Central District of California). The Affidavit contained criticisms of the Church of Scientology and substantial portions of the Operating Thetan course materials. [ Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz ] The documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz. Along with Kendrick Moxon and Laurie Bartilson, Timothy Bowles was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case. [ Gonnet Roger La secte: secte armée pour la guerre Alban 1998 212 2-911751-04-3 ] Fishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church.

The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be copyright ed and a trade secret.

The Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church&apos;s Religious Technology Center (RTC) brought copyright lawsuits over their release on the Internet. Fishman&apos;s description of OT VIII contains the accusation that Jesus was a pedophile. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist. { Press Release by Steven Fishman, &quot; Press Release: Scientology upper level references (OT materials) affirmed unsealed and in the public domain by United States Court of Appeals. &quot;, Pages 1-7., April 28, 1994. } The Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.

Among others, declarations were submitted by: Richard &amp; Vicki Aznaran, former executives of the Religious Technology Center Jonathan Epstein, at that time &quot; International Finance Director &quot; of the Church of Scientology International Declaration of Jonathan Epstein, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994 Guillaume Lesevre, at that time Executive Director International of the Church of Scientology International Declaration of Guillaume Lesevre, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994 David Miscavige, Chairman of the Board of the Religious Technology Center Declaration of David Miscavige, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 8th, 1994 Raymond Mithoff, at that time &quot; Senior Case Supervisor International &quot; of the Church of Scientology International Declaration of Raymond Mithoff, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994 Thomas Spring, tax attorney for the Church of Scientology International Declaration of Thomas Spring, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994 Norman Starkey, at that time Executive Director of Author Services Inc.

Touretzky. Lerma&apos;s newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 raid of his home for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post. U.S. Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that while Richard Leiby and the Washington Post had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was &quot; to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics. &quot; [ Alan Prendergast Nightmare on the Net http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/full Denver Westword Village Voice Media 1997-03-06 2008-07-08 ] [ Alan Prendergast Hush-Hush Money http://www.westword.com/1997-08-14/news/hush-hush-money/full Denver Westword Village Voice Media 1997-08-14 2008-07-08 ] After being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide.

Touretzky ] The Church of Scientology responded by suing a number of people and their Internet service provider s for copyright infringement. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents. The other notable case in connection with this was against Dutch writer Karin Spaink. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology&apos;s attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines.

Grossman The mills of Xenu grind exceeding slow http://www.theinquirer.net/?article%3D11516 The Inquirer 2003-09-12 2007-10-30 ] The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005 the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting hyperlinking.

Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or CCHR, and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims. { Affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, April 10, 1991 } Vicki Aznaran, a former Scientologist who was involved in anti-Scientology litigation before retracting her claims as part of a settlement with Scientology, gave a declaration through Scientology attorneys in which she states various allegations made by Steven Fishman and other church critics are untrue, { The Declaration of Vicki Aznaran } contradicting her previous declaration given in CSI v.
