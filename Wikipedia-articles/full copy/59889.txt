It is based in Madrid, Spain, but is affiliated with national language academies in twenty-one other hispanophone (Spanish-speaking) nations through the Association of Spanish Language Academies. The RAE&apos;s emblem is a fiery crucible, and its motto is &quot; [ es Limpia, fija y da esplendor ] &quot; ( &quot; [It] cleans, sets, and casts splendour &quot; ). The RAE dedicates itself to the linguistic planning by enacting legislation aimed at promoting linguistic unity within and between the various territories, to ensure a common standard in accordance with its founding charter: &quot; To ensure the changes that that it undergoes [...] do not break the essential unity that maintains the entire Hispanic sphere. &quot; [ Real Decreto 1109/1993, de 9 de julio, por el que se aprueba los Estatutos de la Real Academia Española http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/rd1109-1993.html#a1 Noticias Juridicas 27 April 2012 ] The proposed language guidelines are shown in a number of various works. The priorities are the dictionary (DRAE), edited periodically twenty-two times since 1780 until today, and grammar, edited in December of 2009. The RAE is a major publisher of dictionaries and grammar s, and has a formal procedure for admitting words to its publications. Its website includes an online dictionary and other resources, all in Spanish. Its most famous publication is the [ es Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española ] (Dictionary of the Spanish Language of the Royal Spanish Academy), the &quot; DRAE &quot;. The RAE headquarters is where it performs its duties. The headquarters, opened in 1894, is located on Calle Felipe IV, 4, in the neighborhood of Los Jerónimos. The Center for the Studies of the Royal Spanish Academy, opened in 2007, is located at Calle Serano 187-189. [ History ] { Title page of &apos;&apos; } [ es Fundación y estatútos de la Real Académia Españóla ] { &apos;&apos; (Foundation and statutes of the Royal Spanish Academy) (1715) } The [ es Real Academia Española ] was founded in 1713, modelled after the Italian [ it Accademia della Crusca ] (1582) and the French [ fr Académie française ] (1635), with the purpose &quot; to fix the voices and vocabularies of the Castilian language with propriety, elegance, and purity &quot;. King Philip V approved its constitution on 3 October 1714, placing it under the Crown&apos;s protection. Its aristocratic founder, [ es Juan Manuel Fernández Pacheco ], Marquis of Villena and Duke of Escalona, described its aims as &quot; to assure that Spanish speakers will always be able to read Cervantes &quot; – by exercising a progressive up-to-date maintenance of the formal language. The RAE began establishing rules for the orthography of Spanish beginning in 1741 with the first edition of the [ es Ortographía ] (spelled [ es Ortografía ] from the second edition onwards). The proposals of the Academy became the official norm in Spain by royal decree in 1844, and they were also gradually adopted by the Spanish speaking countries of Latin America. Several reforms were introduced in the [ es Nuevas Normas de Prosodia y Ortografía ] (1959), and since then the rules have undergone continued adjustment, in consultation with the other national language academies. The current rules and practical recommendations are presented in the latest edition of the [ es Ortografía ] (1999). [ http://www.rae.es/rae/gestores/gespub000015.nsf/%28voanexos%29/arch7E8694F9D6446133C12571640039A189/%24FILE/Ortografia.pdf Ortografía de la Lengua Española 2009-02-07 Real Academia Española 1999 PDF Spanish 84-239-9250-0 v–viii ] In 1994, the RAE ruled that the Spanish consonants &quot; CH &quot; ( [ es ché ] ) and &quot; LL &quot; ( [ es elle ] ) would hence be alphabetized under &quot; C &quot; and under &quot; L &quot;, respectively, and not as separate, discrete letters, as in the past. The RAE eliminated monosyllabic accented vowels where the accent did not serve in changing the word&apos;s meaning, examples include: [ es &quot; dio &quot; ] ( &quot; gave &quot; ), [ es &quot; vio &quot; ] ( &quot; saw &quot; ), both had an acutely-accented vowel [ es &quot; ó &quot; ]; yet the monosyllabic word [ es &quot; sé &quot; ] ( &quot; I know &quot;, the first person, singular, present of [ es &quot; saber &quot; ], &quot; to know &quot;; and the singular imperative of [ es &quot; ser &quot; ], &quot; to be &quot; ) retains its acutely-accented vowel in order to differentiate it from the reflexive pronoun [ es &quot; se &quot; ]. [ Criticisms of the Academy ] [ October 2009 ] [ section October 2009 ] The Royal Academy has [ April 2010 ], especially in the Spanish-speaking Americas, been criticized for being excessively conservative and slow to change; for excessively concentrating upon linguistic usages of the region of Castile, while dismissing variant usages from other parts of Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries; and for being slow in revising its authoritative [ es Diccionario de la Lengua Española ] [ August 2010 ]. Moreover, the dictionary has been criticised [ December 2010 ] for its partial definitions and somewhat limited coverage. For example, the DRAE definition for [ es dinosaurio ] ( &quot; dinosaur &quot; ) only covers Sauropodomorpha, just one of the many groups of dinosaurs that existed. Supporters respond that the RAE&apos;s purpose is not registering ephemeral Spanish usages, but to protect a united Castilian language and prevent national variants from becoming incomprehensible to other Spanish speakers [ August 2010 ]. Critics [ August 2010 ] have acknowledged, however, that recent editions of the [ es Diccionario de la Lengua Española de la Real Academia Española ] (the 20th, 21st, and current 22nd editions) show distinct improvement. One innovation was its publication of a paperback edition in 1992. Partnerships [ October 2009 ] with companies such as [ es Telefónica ], IBM, and Microsoft, enabled [ October 2009 ] the RAE to update and adapt to the current information-technology era, offering a free on-line version of its Diccionario, which may be consulted free of charge at its website. [ Composition ] [ List of members of the Real Academia Española ] Members of the Academy are known as [ es Académicos de número ] ( [ Academic Numerary ] ), chosen from among prestigious persons in the arts and sciences, including several Spanish-language authors, known as [ es Los Inmortales ] ( [ the Immortals ] ), similarly to their [ fr Académie Française ] counterparts. The Números are elected for life by the other academicians. Each academician holds a seat labeled with a letter from the Spanish alphabet; upper- and lower-case letters are separate seats.
