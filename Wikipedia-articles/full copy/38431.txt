{ Arkansas } { thumb } Wool section, Walcha show. The creamy fleeces on the left are crossbred wool. Wool is the textile fibre obtained from sheep and certain other animals, [ Braaten Ann W. Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion 2005 3 Thomson Gale 0-684-31394-4 441–443 Steele, Valerie Wool ] including cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, qiviut from muskox en, vicuña, alpaca, camel from animals in the camel family, and angora from rabbits. [ July 2010 ] Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it is elastic [ February 2012 ], and it grows in staples (clusters). { D&apos;Arcy, J.B., Sheep and Wool Technology, NSW University Press, Kensington, 1986 ISBN 0-86840-106-4 } In the U.S. the term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep, although in the U.K. it may be used of any long curling fibre such as wood wool, wire wool etc. { Australian Wool Corporation, Australian Wool Classing, Raw Wool Services, 1990 } [ Characteristics ] { hogget fleece, } { Walcha Show } { New Zealand } { Merino wool and combed wool top on a wool table } Wool&apos;s scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibres attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have a greater bulk than other textiles, and retain air, which causes the product to retain heat. Insulation also works both ways; Bedouin s and Tuareg s use wool clothes to keep heat out. The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibres. A fine wool like Merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch, while the coarser wools like karakul may have as few as 1 to 2. Hair, by contrast, has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed, and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batt s for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland. Wool fibres are hydrophilic, meaning they readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow. { http://www.mapp.co.nz/attributes/index.php } Wool can absorb moisture almost one-third of its own weight. { Wool Facts Retrieved on 12 January 2009 } Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics. It is generally a creamy white colour, although some breeds of sheep produce natural colours, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes. Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibres. It has lower rate of flame spread, low heat release, low heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip; { Wool History } it forms a char which is insulating and self-extinguishing, and contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products, when used in carpets. { The Land, Merinos - Going for Green and Gold, p.46, US use flame resistance, 21 August 2008 } Wool carpets are specified for high safety environments, such as trains and aircraft. Wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters, soldiers, and others in occupations where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire. Wool is resistant to static electricity, as the moisture retained within the fabric conducts electricity, so wool garments are much less likely to spark or cling to the body. The use of woollen car seatcovers or carpets reduces the risk of a shock when a person touches a grounded object. Wool is considered by the medical profession to be hypoallergenic. [ May 2009 ] [ Processing ] [ Shearing ] { Lismore, Victoria } [ Sheep shearing ] Sheep shearing is the process by which the woollen fleece of a sheep is cut off. After shearing, the wool is separated into four main categories: fleece (which makes up the vast bulk), broken, bellies, and locks. { Marshall, A.J.T., Woolclassing, Trust Publication, 1984, ISBN 0-7244-9890-7 } The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person called a wool classer groups wools of similar gradings together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner. In Australia and New Zealand, before being auctioned, all Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for micron, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes colour and comfort factor. [ Scouring ] Wool straight off a sheep, known as &quot; greasy wool &quot; { Preparation of Australian Wool Clips, Code of Practice 2010-2012, Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX), 2010 } or &quot; wool in the grease &quot;, contains a high level of valuable lanolin, as well as dirt, dead skin, sweat residue, pesticide, and vegetable matter. Before the wool can be used for commercial purposes, it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the greasy wool. Scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water, or as complicated as an industrial process using detergent and alkali, and specialized equipment. [ Technology in Australia 1788-1988 http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/267.html Australian Science and Technology Heritage Center 2001 2006-04-30 ] In commercial wool, vegetable matter is often removed by chemical carbonization. [ Wool on The Web - Carbonising http://www.woolontheweb.com/LivePage.aspx?pageId%3D23 2006-04-30 ] In less-processed wools, vegetable matter may be removed by hand, and some of the lanolin left intact through use of gentler detergents. This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen. Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products such as hand creams. [ Quality ] Various types and natural colours of wool, and a picture made from wool The quality of wool is determined by its fibre diameter, crimp, yield, colour, and staple strength. Fibre diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price. Merino wool is typically 3-5  inches in length and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns ). [ Merino Sheep in Australia http://www.merinos.com.au/history.asp 2006-11-10 http://web.archive.org/web/20061105005633/http%3A//www.merinos.com.au/history.asp 2006-11-05 ] The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino hoggets. Wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically more coarse, and has fibres [ 1.5 to 6 in mm ] in length. Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break. [ Wool Management - Maximizing Wool Returns http://www.midstateswoolgrowers.com/management.htm Mid-States Wool growers Cooperative Association Van Nostran Don 2006-11-10 ] Wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool&apos;s diameter in microns and also its style. These grades may vary depending on the breed or purpose of the wool. For example: 15.6-18.5 - Superfine Merino 18.6-20 - Fine Merino 20.1-23 - Medium Merino 23 Comeback : 21-26 microns, white, 90–180  mm long Fine crossbred: 27-31 microns, Corriedale s, etc. Medium crossbred: 32–35 microns Downs: 23-34 microns, typically lacks lustre and brightness. Examples, Aussiedown, Dorset Horn, Suffolk, etc. D&apos;Arcy, J.B., Sheep Management &amp; Wool Technology, NSW University Press, 1986, ISBN 0-86840-106-4 Coarse crossbred: 36 &gt; microns Carpet wools: 35-45 microns Any wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments, while coarser grades are used for outerwear or rugs. The finer the wool, the softer it is, while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling. The finest Australia n and New Zealand Merino wools are known as 1PP, which is the industry benchmark of excellence for Merino wool 16.9 microns and finer. This style represents the top level of fineness, character, colour, and style as determined on the basis of a series of parameters in accordance with the original dictates of British Wool as applied today by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) Council. Only a few dozen of the millions of bales auctioned every year can be classified and marked 1PP. { 1PP Certification: http://www.awex.com.au/scripts/nc.dll?AWEX.3408442:STANDARD:527792715:pc=1PPCER } [ History ] Wild sheep were more hairy than woolly. Although sheep were domesticated nine to eleven thousand years ago, archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in Iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000  BC, [ Sheep and Goat Science, Fifth Edition Ensminger Dr. M.E.

[ Beginning Shepherd&apos;s Manual, Second Edition Smith M.S. Barbara Mark Aseltine PhD, Gerald Kennedy DVM 1997 Iowa State University Press Ames, Iowa 0-8138-2799-X ] Woolly-sheep were introduced into Europe from the Near East in the early part of the 4th millennium BC. The oldest known European wool textile, ca. 1500 BC, was preserved in a Danish bog. [ http://www.woolmark.com/about_education_fibre.php?PHPSESSID%3D10d80556668ed0847e77b83c64c3c225 AWI Woolmark 2009-11-27 ] Prior to invention of shears - probably in the Iron Age - the wool was plucked out by hand or by bronze combs. In Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the European population; the cotton of India was a curiosity that only naturalists had heard of; and silk, imported along the Silk Road from China, was an extravagant luxury. Pliny the Elder records in his Natural History that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where selective breeding had produced sheep with a superior fleece, but which required special care. In medieval times, as trade connections expanded, the Champagne fairs revolved around the production of wool cloth in small centres such as Provins; the network that the sequence of annual fairs developed meant that the woollens of Provins might find their way to Naples, Sicily, Cyprus, Majorca, Spain, and even Constantinople. { Fernand Braudel, 1982. The Wheels of Commerce, vol 2 of Civilization and Capitalism (New York:Harper &amp; Row), pp.312-317 } The wool trade developed into serious business, the generator of capital. In the 13th century, the wool trade was the economic engine of the Low Countries and central Italy; by the end of the following century, Italy predominated, though in the 16th century Italian production turned to silk. Both pre-industries were based on English raw wool exports - rivalled only by the sheepwalk s of Castile, developed from the 15th century - which were a significant source of income to the English crown, which from 1275 imposed an export tax on wool called the &quot; Great Custom &quot;. The importance of wool to the English economy can be shown by the fact that since the 14th century, the presiding officer of the House of Lords has sat on the &quot; Woolsack &quot;, a chair stuffed with wool. Economies of scale were instituted in the Cistercian houses, which had accumulated great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries, when land prices were low and labour still scarce. Raw wool was baled and shipped from North Sea ports to the textile cities of Flanders, notably Ypres and Ghent, where it was dyed and worked up as cloth. At the time of the Black Death, English textile industries accounted for about 10% of English wool production; { Cantor 2001, 64 } the English textile trade grew during the 15th century, to the point where export of wool was discouraged. Over the centuries, various British laws controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials. The smuggling of wool out of the country, known as owling, was at one time punishable by the cutting off of a hand. After the Restoration, fine English woollens began to compete with silks in the international market, partly aided by the Navigation Acts; in 1699, the English crown forbade its American colonies to trade wool with anyone but England herself. A great deal of the value of woolen textiles was in the dyeing and finishing of the woven product. In each of the centres of the textile trade, the manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades, overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the English the &quot; putting-out &quot; system, or &quot; cottage industry &quot;, and the Verlagssystem by the Germans. In this system of producing wool cloth, until recently perpetuated in the production of Harris tweed s, the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance, the remainder being paid upon delivery of the product. Written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms. Fernand Braudel traces the appearance of the system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of 1275. The system effectively bypassed the guilds&apos; restrictions. Before the flowering of the Renaissance, the Medici and other great banking houses of Florence had built their wealth and banking system on their textile industry based on wool, overseen by the Arte della Lana, the wool guild: wool textile interests guided Florentine policies. Francesco Datini, the &quot; merchant of Prato &quot;, established in 1383 an Arte della Lana for that small Tuscan city. The sheepwalks of Castile shaped the landscape and the fortunes of the meseta that lies in the heart of the Iberian peninsula; in the 16th century, a unified Spain allowed export of Merino lambs only with royal permission. The German wool market - based on sheep of Spanish origin - did not overtake British wool until comparatively late. The Industrial Revolution introduced mass production technology into wool and wool cloth manufacturing. Australia&apos;s colonial economy was based on sheep raising, and the Australian wool trade eventually overtook that of the Germans by 1845, furnishing wool for Bradford, which developed as the heart of industrialized woollens production. { World War I -era poster sponsored by the } { United States Department of Agriculture encouraging children to raise sheep to provide needed war supplies. } Due to decreasing demand with increased use of synthetic fibres, wool production is much less than what it was in the past. The collapse in the price of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop; with occasional interruptions, the price has tended down. The result has been sharply reduced production and movement of resources into production of other commodities, in the case of sheep growers, to production of meat. { &quot; The end of pastoral dominance &quot; } { 1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2000, Australian Bureau of Statistics } { &quot; SHEEP, LAMB, MUTTON AND GOAT MEAT } Superwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early 1970s to produce wool that has been specially treated so it is machine washable and may be tumble-dried. This wool is produced using an acid bath that removes the &quot; scales &quot; from the fibre, or by coating the fibre with a polymer that prevents the scales from attaching to each other and causing shrinkage. This process results in a fibre that holds longevity and durability over synthetic materials, while retaining its shape. { Superwash Wool Retrieved on 10 November 2008 } In December 2004, a bale of the world&apos;s finest wool, averaging 11.8 micron, sold for $3,000 per kilogram at auction in Melbourne, Victoria. This fleece wool tested with an average yield of 74.5%, 68  mm long, and had 40 newtons per kilotex strength. The result was $AUD279,000 for the bale. [ November 2009 ] The finest bale of wool ever auction ed was sold for a seasonal record of 269,000 cents per kilo during June 2008. This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill Partnership and measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield and had a 43 Newtons per kilotex strength measurement. The bale realized $247,480 and was exported to India. { Country Leader, NSW Wool Sells for a Quarter of a Million, 7 July 2008 } During 2007, a new wool suit was developed and sold in Japan that can be washed in the shower, and dries off ready to wear within hours with no ironing required. The suit was developed using Australian Merino wool, and it enables woven products made from wool, such as suits, trousers and skirts, to be cleaned using a domestic shower at home. { Shower suit Retrieved on 11 November 2008 } In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so to raise the profile of wool and other natural fiber s. [ Production ] Global wool production is approximately 1.3 million tonnes per year, of which 60% goes into apparel. Australia is the leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep. New Zealand is the second-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of crossbred wool. China is the third-largest producer of wool. Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Tukidale, Drysdale and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpet s. In the United States, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado have large commercial sheep flocks and their mainstay is the Rambouillet (or French Merino). There is also a thriving home-flock contingent of small-scale farmers who raise small hobby flocks of specialty sheep for the hand spinning market. These small-scale farmers offer a wide selection of fleece. 1905 illustration of a Tibetan man spinning wool.

This wool is very limited in supply and much of it comes from New Zealand and Australia. [ Speer Jordan K. Shearing the Edge of Innovation Apparel Magazine 2006-05-01 ] It is becoming easier to find in clothing and other products, but these products often carry a higher price. Wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based nylon or polypropylene ) as a material for carpets, as well, in particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of formaldehyde -free glues. Animal rights groups have noted issues with the production of wool, such as mulesing. [ Marketing ] [ Australia ] { Merino wool samples for sale by } { auction, Newcastle, } { New South Wales. } { New South Wales. } About 85% of wool sold in Australia is sold by open cry auction. [ December 2011 ] &apos;Sale by sample&apos; is a method in which a mechanical claw takes a sample from each bale in a line or lot of wool. These grab samples are bulked, objectively measured, and a sample of not less than 4  kg is displayed in a box for the buyer to examine. The Australian Wool Exchange conducts sales primarily in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Fremantle. There are about 80 brokers and agents throughout Australia. [ December 2011 ] About 7% of Australian wool is sold by private treaty on farms or to local wool-handling facilities. This option gives wool growers benefit from reduced transport, warehousing, and selling costs. This method is preferred for small lots or mixed butts in order to make savings on reclassing and testing. About 5% of Australian wool is sold over the internet on an electronic offer board. [ December 2011 ] This option gives wool growers the ability to set firm price targets, reoffer passed-in wool and offer lots to the market quickly and efficiently. This method works well for tested lots, as buyers use these results to make a purchase. About 97% of wool is sold without sample inspection; however, as of December 2009, 59% of wool listed had been passed in from auction. [ December 2011 ] Growers through certain brokers can allocate their wool to a sale and at what price their wool will be reserved. Sale by tender can achieve considerable cost savings on wool clips large enough to make it worthwhile for potential buyers to submit tenders. Some marketing firms sell wool on a consignment basis, obtaining a fixed percentage as commission. Forward selling: Some buyers offer a secure price for forward delivery of wool based on estimated measurements or the results of previous clips. Prices are quoted at current market rates and are locked in for the season. Premiums and discounts are added to cover variations in micron, yield, tensile strength, etc., which are confirmed by actual test results when available. [ December 2011 ] Another method of selling wool includes sales direct to wool mill s. [ Other countries ] The British Wool Marketing Board operates a central marketing system for UK fleece wool with the aim of achieving the best possible net returns for farmers. Less than half of New Zealand &apos;s wool is sold at auction, while around 45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users. { NZ Wool } United States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states. In some cases, wool is pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool warehouse. Wool offered with objective measurement test results is preferred. Imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to central markets, where it is handled by the large merchants and manufacturers. { http://www.sheepusa.org/index.phtml?page=site/text &amp; nav_id=b5cd92c158e527a90be72c1ce8be84a2 } [ Yarn ] { yarn, the first step in the manufacture of most wool clothing. } Virgin wool is wool spun for the first time. { Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, ISBN 0-13-118769-4, p. 63 } Shoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibres. As this process makes the wool fibres shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original. The recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, wool noil, or another fibre such as cotton to increase the average fibre length. Such yarn s are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp. This process was invented in the Heavy Woollen District of West Yorkshire and created a micro-economy in this area for many years. Ragg is a sturdy wool fibre made into yarn and used in many rugged applications such as gloves. Worsted is a strong, long- staple, combed wool yarn with a hard surface. Woollen is a soft, short- staple, carded wool yarn typically used for knitting. In traditional weaving, woollen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom. { Østergård, Else:Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland, Aarhus University Press, 2004, ISBN 87-7288-935-7, p. 50 } [ Uses ] { New South Wales. } In addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, horse rugs, saddle cloths, carpet ing, felt, wool insulation (also see links) and upholstery. Wool felt covers piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odours and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt. Wool has also been traditionally used to cover cloth diapers. Wool fibre exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fibre is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment able to cover a wet diaper while inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odour. Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers. Initial studies of woollen underwear have found it prevented heat and sweat rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other fibres. { ABC Rural Radio: Woodhams, Dr. Libby, &apos;&apos;New research shows woollen underwear helps prevent rashes&apos;&apos; Retrieved 2010-3-24 } Merino wool has been used in baby sleep products such as swaddle baby wrap blankets and infant sleeping bags. Wool is an animal protein, and as such it can be used as a soil fertiliser, being a slow-release source of nitrogen and ready-made amino acids. Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology school of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and kevlar, the synthetic fibre widely used in body armour, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than kevlar alone. Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its effectiveness when wet and therefore required an expensive waterproofing process. Wool increased friction in a vest with 28-30 layers of fabric, to provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar alone.

In 1963, the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy was presented in Tasmania for growers of &quot; Superfine skirted Merino fleece &quot;. In 1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for Extrafine Wool Production, was launched. In 2004, this award became known as the Ermenegildo Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy. In 1998, an Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool Trophy was launched for fleece from sheep coated for around nine months of the year. In 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for wool that is 13.9 micron and finer. Wool from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each country.
