Holsworthy is located 31 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool and partly in the Sutherland Shire. Holsworthy is most notable for a large Australian Army reserve, Holsworthy Barracks, where training exercises are frequently carried out. The reserve is adjacent to Heathcote Road, which connects to Bankstown, Liverpool, Lucas Heights, Engadine and Heathcote. Signs on the perimeter warn potential trespassers of the use of laser guided and conventional gunfire. The residential area is located north of the railway station. Anzac Village is a locality in the northern part of the suburb and the adjacent suburb of Wattle Grove. A new development called &apos;Mornington&apos; has been built in the fields between Wattle Grove and Holsworthy railway station. Development stage one has been completed, with stage two under construction. A shopping centre will also be built in this area. [ History ] The area was named after Holsworthy, Devon, England, where Governor Lachlan Macquarie married Elizabeth Campbell, on 3 November 1807. It was originally spelt as Holdsworthy until after World War II, when the &apos;d&apos; was dropped. { The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ISBN 0-207-14495-8, page 123 } Originally the land belonged to the Tharawal people but following the arrival of the First Fleet, indigenous people were pushed back from their traditional lands in the area surrounding Sydney. In 1795, explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders explored the Georges River and in 1798, grants of land for farming were made in the area. The soil was good and crops of corn, wheat and vegetables were soon being harvested.

In 1801, Governor King ordered soldiers to fire on the aborigines to keep them from settler&apos;s properties. By 1815, Governor Macquarie declared a state of open warfare against aborigines in the Georges River area and forbade them carrying weapons within a mile of any British settlement. Ultimately, the British prevailed.

By the 1880s a number of vineyards were established in the area. The land was acquired by the army in 1913. During World War I it was home to a large interment camp for civilians of German or Austro-Hungarian background, the camp absorbed prisoners from the famed Torrens Island Concentration Camp in 1915. The modern village of Holsworthy evolved after World War II to the north, with the barracks to the south. The streets are named with a military theme, such as Tarakan, Bardia, Wewak, Lae, Brunei, Finschhafen, Madang, Gona, Anzac, Light Horse, Infantry, Cavalry, Sabre, Gunners Row and Trooper Row. In Anzac Village, Australian Generals are remembered with Birdwood, Monash, Bridges and Blamey. The Holsworthy bushland retains many indigenous sites and has been referred to as &quot; Sydney&apos;s Kakadu &quot;. There are more than 500 significant Tharawal sites in the area including campsites, tool making sites and rock art. The art is mostly engravings of hands, boomerangs, animals, birds and fish. [ Climate ] Holsworthy has an oceanic climate, with warm summers and cool to mild winters, with precipitation spread throughout the year. Thunderstorms are common in the summer months, and provide most of the precipitation in that season. Winters are pleasantly cool and sunny, although east coast lows can bring large amounts of rainfall. Snow has never occurred, although frost is a fairly common occurrence in winter. Spring and autumn are transition seasons. Being inland from the coast, and away from Sydney City, Holsworthy receives up to 500mm (20 Â in) less precipitation than coastal areas, just [ 25 km mi on ] away.
