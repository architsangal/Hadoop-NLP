Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. La Habana, v. 4 p. 45 et seq. } { Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p. 181 gives his birth name as Ignacio Loyola Scull Rodríguez. It is reasonable to prefer the more recent and more complete source (the Cuban 2nd ed of Orovio was published in 1981). } was a Cuba n musician who played the tres (Cuban guitar) in son -based music, and conga s in folkloric rumba. In the 1940s and 50s Rodríguez reorganized the son conjunto (&apos;son group&apos;) and developed the son montuno, the basic template of modern-day salsa. He claimed to be the true creator of the mambo, and was an important and prolific composer who wrote nearly two hundred song lyrics. [ Early life ] Rodrígues was born in Güira de Macurijes in Bolondrón, Matanzas Province as the third of fifteen children, fourteen boys and one girl. { García, David F. 2006. &apos;&apos;Arsenio Rodríguez and the transnational flows of latin popular music&apos;&apos;. Philadelphia : Temple University Press. p. 13 } As a young child, Rodríguez was blinded when a horse (or a mule) kicked him in the head. [ Rise to Fame ] Later, Rodríguez became a musician, and eventually became one of the most renowned bandleaders on the island earning him the nickname El Ciego Maravilloso (the marvellous blind man). His music emphasized Afro-Cuban rhythm as well as the melodic lead of the tres, which he played. In 1936 he played his own compositions with the Sexteto Boston, led by his cousin Jacinto Scull. The group disbanded in 1937, and he joined the Septeto Bellamar of cornet ist José Interián in 1938. From 1940 to 1947 he led a band in Cuba, Arsenio Rodríguez y su Conjunto. Rodríguez then went to New York where he hoped to get cured from his blindness but was told that his optic nerves had been completely destroyed. This experience led him to compose the bolero La Vida es un Sueño (Life is a dream). He went on to play with percussionist Chano Pozo and other great musical artists of what became Latin Jazz like Machito, Dizzy Gillespie, Tito Puente, and Mario Bauza. [ Innovations ] Rodríguez&apos;s chief innovation, his interpretation of the son montuno, established the basic template for Cuban popular dance music and salsa that continues to this day. &quot; It took fifty years for Latin music to catch up with what Arsenio was doing in the 1940s &quot; —Kevin Moore (2007: web). { Moore, Kevin 2007. &quot; 1945 - No hay yaya sin Guayacán. &quot; The Roots of Timba part 1.

At the same time, the rhythmic component had become increasingly deemphasized, or in the opinion of some, &quot; watered-down. &quot; Rodríguez brought a strong rhythmic emphasis back into the son. His compositions are clearly based on the key pattern known in Cuba as clave, a Spanish word for &apos;key,&apos; or &apos;code.&apos; 3-2 clave and 2-3 clave written in cut-time. When clave is written in two measures, as shown above, the measure with three strokes is referred to as the three-side, and the measure with two strokes—the two-side. When the chord progression begins on the three-side, the song, or phrase is said to be in 3-2 clave. When it begins on the two-side, it&apos;s in 2-3 clave. { Peñalosa, David 2010.

Bottom: bass line from &quot; Dame un cachito pa&apos; huele &quot; (1946). David García Identifies the accents of &quot; and-of-two &quot; (in cut-time) on the three-side, and the &quot; and-of-four &quot; (in cut-time) on the two-side of the clave, as crucial contributions of Rodríguez&apos;s music. { García 2006 p. 43. } The two offbeats are present in the following 2-3 bass line from Rodríguez&apos;s &quot; Mi chinita me botó &quot; (1944). { García 2006 p. 45. } Top: 2-3 clave. Bottom: &quot; Mi chinita me botó &quot; bass line. The two offbeats are especially important because they coincide with the two syncopated steps in the son&apos;s basic footwork. The conjunto&apos;s collective and consistent accentuation of these two important offbeats gave the son montuno texture its unique groove and, hense, played a significant part in the dancer&apos;s feeling the music and dancing to it, as Bebo Valdés noted &quot; in contratiempo &quot; [&apos;offbeat timing&apos;]—García (2006: 43). { García 2006 p. 43. } Moore points out that Rodríguez&apos;s conjunto introduced the two-celled bass tumbao s, that moved beyond the simpler, single-cell tresillo structure. { Moore, Kevin 2007. &quot; 1945 - No hay yaya sin Guayacán. &quot; The Roots of Timba part 1. Web. Timba.com. http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/1945-no-hay-yaya-sin-guayac-n } This type of bass line has a specific alignment to clave, and contributes melodically to the composition. Rodríguez&apos;s brother Raúl Travieso recounted, Rodríguez insisted that his bass players make the bass &quot; sing. &quot; { Raúl Travieso quoted by David García 2006. Arsenio Rodriguez and The Transnational Flows of Latin Popular Music p. 43. } Moore states: &quot; This idea of a bass tumbao with a melodic identity unique to a specific arrangement was critical not only to timba, but also to Motown, rock, funk, and other important genres. &quot; { Moore 2007. &quot; 1945 - No hay yaya sin Guayacán. &quot; Timba.com. } In other words, Rodríguez is a creator of the bass riff. Breaks (&apos;cierres&apos;) Rodríguez&apos;s &quot; Juventud amaliana &quot; (1946) contains an example of one of his rhythmically dynamic unison breaks, strongly rooted in clave. { Moore, Kevin (2007: web). Arsenio Rodriguez 1946 La juventud amaliana. The Roots of Timba part 1. Web. Timba.com. http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/1946-la-juventud-amaliana } Unison break from &quot; Juventud amaliana &quot; (1946), beginning on the three-side of clave. Most of Arsenio&apos;s classic tracks from the golden period of 1946-1951 feature a virtuousic and highly-polyrhythmic solo by either Lilí Martínez on piano, Arsenio himself on tres, or occasionally Chappottín or one of the other trumpeters. The solo usually ends with Arsenio&apos;s signature [break] lead-in phrase:. X X X X... [first measure in the example above]. The figure is usually played on the two-side in 3-2 clave and on the three-side in 2-3 clave, and leads directly to what most timba musicians call a bloque but which in Arsenio&apos;s day was called a cierre. It consists of everyone in the band playing the same series of punches, creating extreme rhythmic tension with a combination of cross-rhythms and deceptive harmonies. As [David] García points out, the first four beats of the actual [break] have a rhythm [below] which was used repeatedly in the subsequent decades, most famously by Tito Puente and later Carlos Santana in &quot; Oye Como Va &quot; —Moore (2007). { Moore, Kevin (2007: web). Arsenio Rodriguez 1946 La juventud amaliana. The Roots of Timba part 1. Web. Timba.com. http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/1946-la-juventud-amaliana } Moore is referring to the second and third measures of the break in the previous example. Here is that figure in relation to 2-3 clave. When the pattern is used as a type of block chord guajeo, as in &quot; Oye Como Va, &quot; it&apos;s referred to as ponchando. { Peñalosa, David 2010. The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins p. 256. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. ISBN 1-886502-80-3. } 2-3 clave (top) with ponchando figure (bottom). [ Layered &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; guajeo &quot; &gt; guajeo &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; trail &gt; s &lt; /trail &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] Rodríguez introduced the idea of layered guajeo s (typical Cuban ostinato melodies)—an interlocking structure consisting of multiple contrapuntal parts. This aspect of the son &apos;s modernization can be thought of as a matter of &quot; re-Africanizing &quot; the music. Helio Orovio recalls: &quot; Arsenio once said his trumpets played figurations the &apos;Oriente&apos; tres-guitarists played during the improvisational part of el son &quot; (1992: 11). { Helio Orovio quoted by Max Salazar 1992. &quot; Who Invented the Mambo? &quot; part 2. Latin Beat Magazine. v. 2 n. 9: 9. p. 11. } The &quot; Oriente &quot; is the name given to the eastern end of Cuba, where the son was born. It is common practice for treseros to play a series of guajeo variations during their solos. Perhaps it was only natural then that it was Rodríguez the tres master, who conceived of the idea of layering these variations on top of each other. The following example is from the &quot; diablo &quot; section of Rodríguez&apos;s &quot; Kile, Kike y Chocolate &quot; (1950). { García 2006 p. 52. } The excerpt consists of four interlocking guajeos: piano (bottom line), tres (second line), 2nd and 3rd trumpets (third line), and 1st trumpet (fourth line). 2-3 Clave is shown for reference (top line). Notice that the piano plays a single celled (single measure) guajeo, while the other guajeos are two-celled. It&apos;s common practice to combine single and double-celled ostinatos in Afro-Cuban music. Four interlocking guajeos, with 2-3 clave (top line) for reference. Excerpt from Arsenio Rodríguez&apos;s &quot; Kile, Kike y Chocolate &quot; (1950). During the 1940’s, the conjunto instrumentation was in full swing, as were the groups who incorporated the jazz band (or big band) instrumentation in the ensemble, guajeos (vamp-like lines) could be divided among each instrument section, such as saxes and brass; this became even more subdivided, featuring three or more independent riffs for smaller sections within the ensemble. By adopting polyrhythmic elements from the son, the horns took on a vamp-like role similar to the piano montuno and tres (or string) guajeo”—Mauleón (1993: 155). { Mauleón, Rebeca 1993. Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble p. 155. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. ISBN 0-9614701-9-4. } [ Expansion of the son &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; conjunto &quot; &gt; conjunto &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] The denser rhythmic weave of Rodríguez&apos;s music required the addition of more instruments. Rodríguez added a second, and then, third trumpet—the birth the Latin horn section. He made the bold move of adding the conga drum, the quintessential Afro-Cuban instrument. Today, we are so used to seeing conga drums in Latin bands, and that practice began with Rodríguez. His bongo player used a large, hand-held cencerro (&apos;cowbell&apos;) during montuno s (call-and-response chorus section). { It had been a concern of bandleaders since the sextetos of the 1920s that these groups were not loud enough to cope with the large venues and audiences, to which the older } { típicas were well suited. } Rodríguez also added a variety of rhythms and harmonic concepts to enrich the son, the bolero, the guaracha and some fusions, such as the bolero-son. Similar changes had been made somewhat earlier by the Lecuona Cuban Boys, who (because they were mainly a touring band) had less influence in Cuba. The overall &apos;feel&apos; of the Rodríguez conjunto was more African than other Cuban conjuntos. [ Piano &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; guajeo &quot; &gt; guajeo &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; trail &gt; s &lt; /trail &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] Rodríguez took the pivotal step of replacing the guitar with the piano, which greatly expanded the contrapuntal and harmonic possibilities of Cuban popular music. &quot; Dile a Catalina, &quot; sometimes called &quot; Traigo la yuca, &quot; may be Arsenio’s most famous composition. The first half uses the changüí /son method of paraphrasing the vocal melody, but the second half strikes out into bold new territory – using contrapuntal material not based on the song’s melody and employing a cross‐rhythm based on sequences of three ascending notes—Moore (2011: 39). { Moore, Kevin 2009. Beyond Salsa Piano: The Cuban Timba Piano Revolution v. 1. Beginning The Roots of Timba p. 39. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. ISBN‐10: 1439265844 } 2-3 piano guajeo &quot; Dile a Catalina &quot; (1943). The piano guajeo for &quot; Dame un cachito pa’ huele &quot; (1946) completely departs from both the generic son guajeo and the song’s melody. The pattern marks the clave by accenting the backbeat on the two-side. Moore observes: &quot; Like so many aspects of Arsenio’s music, this miniature composition is decades ahead of its time. It would be forty years before groups began to consistently apply this much creative variation at the guajeo level of the arranging process &quot; (2009: 41). { Moore 2009. p. 41. } 2-3 piano guajeo &quot; Dame un cachito pa’ huele &quot; (1946). &quot; No me llores más &quot; [1948] stands out for its beautiful melodies and the incredible amount emotional intensity it packs into its ultra‐slow 58 bpm groove. The guajeo is based on the vocal melody and marks the clave relentlessly—Moore (2009: 48). { Moore 2009. p. 48. } 2-3 piano guajeo &quot; No me llores más &quot; (1948). The piano guajeo for &quot; Jumba &quot; (aka &quot; Zumba &quot; ) (1951) is firmly aligned with clave, but also has a very strong nengón flavor—something which had rarely, or never been used in Havana popular music. While Rodríguez was not from the &quot; Oriente &quot; (eastern end of Cuba, where nengón and changüí are played), he had a thorough knowledge of many folkloric styles and his creative partner, the pianist Lilí Martínez, in fact came from that part of the island. { Moore 2009. p. 52. } 2-3 piano guajeo &quot; Jumba &quot; (1951). Arsenio’s use of modal harmonies pre‐echoes not only songo, salsa, and timba, but rock and soul as well. &quot; Guaragüí &quot; [1951] has not one but two shockingly original chord progressions. [The guajeo] is in D, but the chord progression is in the Mixolydian mode: I – bVII – IV (D – C – G). This virulently addictive little sequence would remain dormant for fifteen years until becoming a pop juggernaut in songs such as &quot; Hey Jude &quot; and &quot; Sympathy from the Devil. &quot; In the early 70s, when Juan Formell of Los Van Van reintroduced it to Latin pop, it sounded like a clear borrowing from rock &amp; roll, but here it is in Arsenio’s music when rock and rollers were limited to I – IV – V and I – vimi – IV – V, and even Tin Pan Alley had yet to incorporate modal harmonies. Equally interesting from a harmonic standpoint, is &quot; Guaragüí’ &quot; s opening progression: imi – IV – bVII – imi (Ami – D – G – Ami). It’s the same progression, but in minor, with the IV and bVII inverted—Moore (2009: 53). { Moore 2009. p. 53. } 2-3 piano guajeo &quot; Guaragüí &quot; (1951). [ Diablo, the proto- &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Mambo (music) &quot; &gt; Mambo (music) &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; mambo &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ? ] Leonardo Acosta is not convinced by Rodríguez&apos;s claim to have invented the mambo, if by mambo Rodríguez meant the big-band arrangements of Pérez Prado. Rodríguez was not an arranger: his lyrics and musical ideas were worked over by the group&apos;s arranger. The compositions were published with just the minimal bass and treble piano lines. To achieve the big-band mambo such as by Prado or Machito, Tito Puente requires a full orchestration where the trumpets play counterpoint to the rhythm of the saxophones. This, a fusion of Cuban with big-band jazz ideas, is not found in Rodríguez, whose musical forms are set in the traditional categories of Cuban music. { see Acosta, Leonardo 2003. Cubano be, cubano bop: one hundred years of jazz in Cuba. Smithsonian, Washington, D.C. p. 86 et seq. for a more complete discussion. } While it is true that the mambo of the 1940s, and 1950s contains elements not present in Rodríguez&apos;s music, there is considerable evidence that the contrapuntal structure of the mambo began in the conjunto of Arsenio Rodríguez. { Salazar, Max 1992. &quot; Who Invented the Mambo? &quot; part 1. Latin Beat Magazine. v. 2 n. 9: 9. p. 10. } While working in the charanga Arcaño y Sus Maravillas, Orestes López &quot; Macho &quot; and his brother Israel López &quot; Cachao &quot; composed &quot; Mambo &quot; (1938), the first piece to use the term. A prevalent theory is that the López brothers were influenced by Rodríguez&apos;s use of layered guajeos (called diablo), and introduced the concept into the charanga&apos;s string section with their historical composition. As Ned Sublette observes: &quot; Arsenio maintained till the end of his life that the mambo—the big band style that exploded in 1949—came out of his diablo, the repeating figures that the trumpets in the band played. Arsenio claimed to have already been doing that in the late 1930s &quot; (2004: 508). { Sublette, Ned 2008. Cuba and its Music; From the First Drums to the Mambo p. 508. Chicago: Chicago Review Press. } As Rodríguez himself asserts: &quot; In 1934 I was experimenting with a new sound which I fully developed in 1938. &quot; { Arsenio Rodríguez quoted in Bohemia (1955), cited by Max Salazar 1992. &quot; Who Invented the Mambo? &quot; part 2. Latin Beat Magazine. v. 2 n. 9: 8. p. 11. } Max Salazar concurs: &quot; It was Arsenio Rodríguez&apos;s band that used for the first time the rhythms which today are typical for every mambo &quot; (1992: 10). { Salazar, Max 1992. &quot; Who Invented the Mambo? &quot; part 1. Latin Beat Magazine. v. 2 n. 9: 9. p. 10. } In an early article on mambo, published in 1948, the writer Manuel Cuéllar Vizcaíno suggests that Rodríguez and Arcaño&apos;s styles emerged concurrently, which might account for the decades-long argument concerning the identity of the &quot; true &quot; inventor of the mambo. { Manuel Cuéllar Vizcaíno cited my García 2006 p. 47. } In the late 1940s Pérez Prado codified the contrapuntal structure of the mambo within a horn-based big band format. Throughout the 1940s Arsenio&apos;s son montuno style was never referred to as mambo, even though central principles and procedures of his style, such as playing in contratiempo (against the beat). What had made the conjunto and son montuno style so innovative was in fact Arsenio&apos;s and his musicians&apos; deep knowledge and utilization of aesthetic principles and performance procedures rooted in Afro-Cuban traditional music in which Arsenio had been immersed as a youngster in rural areas of Matanzas and La Habana. Drawing from these principles and procedures, Arsenio and his colleagues formulated new ways of performing Cuban son and danzón music that arrangers for big bands soon after adapted and popularized internationally as mambo—García (2006: 42). { García 2006 p. 42. } [ Deeply rooted in Afro-Cuban folkloric traditions ] Rodríguez brought the African-based words and phrases from Abakuá, Lucumí, and Palo Monte into his music. Arsenio uses proverbs associated with Palo Monte and other traditional passages with Congo lexical passages... Arsenio’s afrocubanos demonstrate not only the extent of his knowledge of Palo Monte spirituality but also his critique of the discourse on African inferiority and atavismas (1) manifested in racist representational tropes in Cuban popular culture and (2) implied in the ideology of mestizaje (read: racial and cultural “progress”). As he countered in his afrocubanos, these traditions of his youth, through representing a “primitive” era for most of the white Cuban elite as well as black intellectuals, continued to be a vital and powerful aspect of his music and life—García (1006: 21). On Palo Congo by Sabu Martinez (1957) Rodríguez sings and plays a traditional palo song and rhythm, a Lucumí song for Elegguá, and a rumba and a conga de comparsa accompanied by tres. { Martinez, Sabu Palo Congo. Blue Note CD 226665 (1957). } Rodríguez&apos;s 1973 landmark album Quindembo features an abakuá, a columbia, and several band adaptations of traditional palo songs, accompanied by the bona fide rhythms. { Rodríguez, Arsenio Quindembo Sony CD 469742-2 (1973). } Rodríguez was an authentic rumbero; he both played the tumbadora ( conga drum), and composed songs within the rumba genre. Rodríguez recorded folkloric rumbas and also fused rumba with son montuno. His “Timbilla” (1945) { RCA Victor 45 RPM phonorecord 23-0362-B (1945). } and “Anabacoa” (1950) are examples of the guaguancó rhythm used by a son conjunto. On “Timbilla,” the bongos fulfill the role of the quinto (rumba lead drum). In “Yambú en serenata” (1964) a yambú using a quinto drum is augmented by a tres, bass, and horns. { Peñalosa, David 2010. Rumba Quinto p. 186. Redway, CA: Bembe Books. ISBN 1-4537-1313-1 } In 1956 Rodríguez released the folkloric rumbas &quot; Con flores del matadero &quot; and &quot; Adios Roncona &quot; in Havana. { Cox, Barry (30 May 2011: web.) “The earliest recordings of Cuban rumba: A comprehensive summary.” Web. ¡Vamosa Guarachar! http://esquinarumbera.blogspot.com/2011/05/filiberto-sanchez-first-to-record-rumba.html } { RCA Victor 78 rpm phonorecord 23-7120 (1956). } The tracks consist of voice and percussion only. One of the last recording Rodríguez performed on was the rumba album Patato y Totico by the conguero Carlos Valdes “Patato” and vocalist Eugenio Arango &quot; Totico &quot; (1967). { Patato y Totico Verve CD 5037 (1968). } The tracks are purely folkloric, except for the unconventional addition of Rodríguez on tres, and the great Israel Lopez “ Cachao ” on bass. Additional personnel included Papaito and Virgilio Marti. [ Later life and death ] At the end of the 1960s the mambo craze petered out, and Rodríguez continued to play in his typical style, although he did record some boogaloo numbers, without much success. As times changed, the popularity of his group declined. He tried a new start in Los Angeles. He invited Joseph to fly out to Los Angeles with him but died only a week later. Arsenio died in 1970 and his body was returned for burial to New York. There is much speculation about his financial status during his last years, but Mario Bauza denied that he died in poverty, arguing that Rodríguez had a modest income from royalties. { García, David F. 2006. Arsenio Rodríguez and the transnational flows of latin popular music. Philadelphia. p. 115 } [ Tributes ] Of the many tributes to Arsenio Rodríguez, four are of special interest. The first, in 1972, was a Larry Harlow LP Tribute to Arsenio Rodríguez, Fania 404. On this, five of the numbers had been recorded earlier by Rodriguez&apos; conjunto. Later, in 1994, The Cuban band Sierra Maestra recorded a CD Sierra Maestra: Dundunbanza!, World Circuit WCD 041. This had four Rodríguez numbers at full length. Jazz guitarist Marc Ribot recorded two albums made mostly of Rodríguez&apos; compositions or songs in his repertoire called Marc Ribot y los Cubanos Postizos and Muy Divertido!. Arsenio Rodriguez is mentioned in a national television production called &apos;&apos;La época&apos;&apos;, about the Palladium-era in New York, and Afro-Cuban music. The film discusses Arsenio&apos;s contributions, and features some of the musicians he recorded with. Others interviewed in the movie &apos;&apos;840AM Interview&apos;&apos; include the daughter of legendary Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaría – Ileana Santamaria, bongocero Luis Mangual and others. Rodríguez&apos;s close friend and bassist for eight years Alfonso &quot; El Panameño &quot; Joseph, as well as other members of Rodríguez&apos;s band, such as Julian Lianos, who performed with Rodríguez at the Palladium Ballroom in New York during the 1960s, have had their legacies documented in a national television production called &apos;&apos;La Epoca&apos;&apos;, released in theaters in the US in September 2008, and in Latin America in 2009. He had much success in the US and migrated there in 1952 one of the reasons being the better pay of musicians. { García, David F. 2006.
