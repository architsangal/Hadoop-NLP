[ արևելահայերեն ] { arevelahayeren } { Indo-European } { Armenian } { Armenia, } { Former Soviet Union, } { United States of America, and } { Iran } { 5,800,000 language in Encyclopædia Britannica } { Armenian alphabet } { hyr } { IPA } Eastern Armenian ( [ արևելահայերեն ] arevelahayeren) is one of the two standardized forms of modern Armenian (an Indo-European language ), the other being Western Armenian. The two standards form pluricentric language. Eastern Armenian is spoken in the Caucasus Mountains (particularly in the Republic of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as well as Georgia ) and by the Armenian community in Iran. Although the Eastern Armenian spoken by Armenians in Armenia and Iranian-Armenians are similar, there are pronunciation differences with different inflections. Armenians from Armenia also have some words that are unique to them. Due to migrations of speakers from Armenia and Iran to the Armenian Diaspora, the dialect is now very prominent in countries and regions where only Western Armenian was used. It was developed in the early 19th century and is based on the dialect of the Ararat district (of Eastern Armenia ). [ Distinguishing the two forms of Armenian ] Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian are easily mutually intelligible. They share the same ISO 639-1 code hy. The ISO 639-3 code for both is hye. The Armenian wikipedia is coded hy and is largely Eastern Armenian. Commercial translations are generally done into Eastern Armenian, the official language of the Republic of Armenia. { Pipoyan } [ Phonology ] [ Vowels ] [ Monophthongs ] Eastern Armenian has six monophthong vowel sounds. [ i ] [ u ] [ ɛ ] [ ə ] [ o ] [ ɑ ] Front Central Back Unrounded Rounded Unrounded Rounded Close ի i     ու u Mid ե, է The choice of Armenian symbol depends on the vowel&apos;s context in the word.

Compare this to the phonology of the Western Armenian language, which has kept only a two-way distinction: one voiced and one aspirated. (See the Differences in Phonology from Classical Armenian in the Western Armenian language article for details.) A few exceptional Eastern Armenian words contain voiced stop letters pronounced as voiceless aspirated stops, like Western Armenian. For instance, թա գ ավոր (king) is [ [tʰɑkʰɑˈvoɾ] ], not [ [tʰɑɡɑˈvoɾ] ]; other examples are ձի գ, ձա գ, կար գ, դա դ ար, վարա գ ույր. [ Orthography ] The Eastern Armenian language is written using either Traditional Armenian Orthography or Reformed Armenian Orthography. The controversial reformed orthography was developed during the 1920s in Soviet Armenia and is in widespread use today by Eastern Armenian speakers in the Republic of Armenia. Eastern Armenian speakers in Iran continue to use the traditional orthography. Nevertheless, writings of either form are mutually intelligible, since the difference between the two orthographies is not large. [ Morphology ] [ Pronouns ] Armenian has T-V distinction, with [ hy դու ], [ hy քո ], [ hy քեզ ] used informally and capitalized [ hy Դուք ], [ hy Ձեր ], [ hy Ձեզ ] as the polite forms. [ Nouns ] Eastern Armenian nouns have seven case s, one more than Western Armenian. They are: Nominative (subject), Accusative (direct object), Genitive (possession), Dative (indirect object), Ablative (origin), Instrumental (means) and Locative (position). Of the seven cases, the nominative and accusative, with exceptions, are the same, and the genitive and dative are the same, meaning that nouns have mostly five distinct forms for case. Nouns in Armenian also decline for number (singular and plural), but do not decline for gender (i.e. masculine or feminine). Declension in Armenian is based on how the genitive is formed. There are several declension s, but two are the most used (genitive in i, and genitive in u): &lt; tr &gt; &lt; td &gt;   &lt; td colspan=2 &gt; դաշտ [ /daʃt/ ] (field) &lt; td &gt; [ ɡaɹi ] (barley) &lt; td &gt;   &lt; td &gt; singular &lt; td &gt; plural &lt; td &gt; singular &lt; td &gt; plural &lt; td &gt; Nominative - Accusative &lt; td &gt; դաշտ [ /daʃt/ ] &lt; td &gt; դաշտեր [ /daʃteɹ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹi/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹineɹ/ ] &lt; td &gt; Genitive - Dative &lt; td &gt; դաշտի [ /daʃti/ ] &lt; td &gt; դաշտերի [ /daʃteri/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹu/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹineɹi/ ] &lt; td &gt; Ablative &lt; td &gt; դաշտից [ /daʃtit͡sʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; դաշտերից [ /daʃterit͡sʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹut͡sʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹineɹit͡sʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; Instrumental &lt; td &gt; դաշտով [ /daʃtov/ ] &lt; td &gt; դաշտերով [ /daʃteɹov/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹov/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹineɹov/ ] &lt; td &gt; Locative &lt; td &gt; դաշտում [ /daʃtum/ ] &lt; td &gt; դաշտերում [ /daʃteɹum/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹum/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /ɡaɹineɹum/ ] Two notes: First, notice that the Ablative form in Eastern Armenian is [ /-it͡s/ ], where it is -ê in Western Armenian: Abl.sg WA karê/EA [ /ɡaɹut͡sʰ/ ] &apos; Second, notice that in Western Armenian, the plural forms followed the u-declension, while in Eastern Armenian the plural forms follow the i-declension: Gen.pl WA karineru/EA [ /ɡaɹineɹi/ ] [ Articles ] Like some other languages such as English, Armenian has definite and indefinite articles. The indefinite article in Eastern Armenian is [ /mi/ ], which precedes the noun: [ mi ɡiɹkʰ ] (&apos;a book&apos;, Nom.sg), [ /mi ɡɹkʰi/ ] (&apos;of a book&apos;, Gen.sg) The definite article is a suffix attached to the noun, and is one of two forms, either [ /-ə/ ] or [ /-n/ ], depending on whether the final sound is a vowel or a consonant, and whether a preceding word begins with a vowel or consonant: [ /maɹdə/ ] (&apos;the man&apos;, Nom.sg) [ /ɡaɹin/ ] (&apos;the barley&apos; Nom.sg) but: [ /sa maɹdn e/ ] (&apos;This is the man&apos;) [ /sa ɡaɹin e/ ] (&apos;This is the barley&apos;) [ Adjectives ] Adjectives in Armenian do not decline for case or number, and precede the noun: [ /lav ɡiɹkʰə ] (&apos;the good book&apos;, Nom.sg) [ /lav ɡɹkʰi ] (&apos;of the good book&apos;, Gen.sg) [ Verbs ] Verbs in Armenian are based on two basic series of forms, a &quot; present &quot; form and a &quot; imperfect &quot; form. From this, all other tenses and moods are formed with various particles and constructions. There is a third form, the preterite, which in Armenian is tense in its own right, and takes no other particles or constructions. (See also Armenian verbs and Eastern Armenian verb table for more detailed information.) The present tense in Eastern Armenian is based on two conjugation s (a, e). In Eastern Armenian, the distinct conjugations in e and i merged as e. &lt; tr valign=top &gt; &lt; td &gt;   &lt; td &gt; [ /linel/ ] &apos;to be&apos; &lt; td &gt; [ siɹel ] &apos;to love&apos; &lt; td &gt; [ kaɹdal ] &apos;to read&apos; &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; present participle &lt; td &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹum/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹdum/ ] &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /jes/ ] (I) &lt; td &gt; [ /em/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹem/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹdam/ ] &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /du/ ] (you. sg) &lt; td &gt; [ /es/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹes/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹdas/ ] &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /na/ ] (he/she/it) &lt; td &gt; [ /e/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹi/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹda/ ] &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /menkʰ/ ] (we) &lt; td &gt; [ /enkʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹenkʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹdankʰ/ ] &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /dukʰ/ ] (you.pl) &lt; td &gt; [ /ekʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹekʰ/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹdakʰ/ ] &lt; tr valign=bottom &gt; &lt; td &gt; [ /nɹankʰ/ ] (they) &lt; td &gt; [ /en/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /siɹen/ ] &lt; td &gt; [ /kaɹdan/ ] The present tense (as we know it in English) is made by adding the present tense of linel after the present participle form of the verb: [ jes kaɹdum em ɡiɹkʰə/ ] (I am reading the book) [ jes siɹum em ajd ɡiɹkʰə/ ] (I love that book) [ See also ] Armenian language Armenian verbs Eastern Armenian verb table Western Armenian language Western Armenia Eastern Armenia Language families and languages IETF language tag :hy-arevela [ References ] [ External links ] Arak29 Eastern Armenian Arak29 Western Armenian Arak29 On-Line Dictionaries http://www.ethnologue.com/show_iso639.asp?code=hye Category:Armenian languages Category:Languages of Armenia Category:Languages of Azerbaijan Category:Languages of Georgia (country) Category:Languages of Iran Category:Languages of Russia es:Idioma armenio oriental eo:Orient-armena lingvo fr:Arménien oriental hy:Արևելահայերեն it:Lingua armena orientale nl:Oost-Armeens ru:Восточноармянский язык tr:Doğu Ermenicesi uk:Східновірменська мова
