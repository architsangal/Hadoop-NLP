Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycle s for transport, recreation, or for sport. [ Oxford English Dictionary Second 1989 Oxford University Press cycling: The action or activity of riding a bicycle etc. ] Persons engaged in cycling are cyclists [ Oxford English Dictionary Second 1988 Oxford University Press cyclist: One who rides a cycle or practises cycling. ] or bicyclists. [ Oxford English Dictionary Second 1989 Oxford University Press bicyclist: One who rides a bicycle. ] Apart from ordinary two-wheeled bicycles, cycling also includes riding unicycle s, tricycle s, quadracycle s, and other similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). Bicycle s were introduced in the 19th century and now number about one billion worldwide. { DidYouKnow.cd. There are about a billion or more bicycles in the world.. Retrieved 30 July 2006. } They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. Cycling is a very efficient and effective mode of transportation [ http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question527.htm HowStuffWorks &quot; Is there a way to compare a human being to an engine in terms of efficiency? &quot; Auto.howstuffworks.com 2009-09-29 ] optimal for short to moderate distances. Bicycles provide numerous benefits compared to motor vehicles, including exercise, an alternative to the use of fossil fuel s, no air or noise pollution, much reduced traffic congestion, easier parking, greater maneuverability, and access to both roads and paths. The advantages are at less financial cost to the user as well as society (negligible damage to roads, and less pavement required). [ http://www.doitgreen.org/article/transportation/bicycle A Case for Bicycle Commuting Do It Green! 2009-09-29 ] Criticisms and disadvantages of cycling include reduced protection in crashes, particularly with motor vehicles, [ Wardlaw MJ Three lessons for a better cycling future BMJ 321 7276 1582–5 2000 11124188 1119262 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1582 ] longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the skill and fitness required. [ Equipment ] [ Bicycle ] Urban cycling in Amsterdam alt=A man with sports clothes and a white helmet on a bicycle on a road. In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is a utility bicycle. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds. [ September 2009 ] Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, utilizing stronger muscles (particularly the gluteus maximus ) and reducing air resistance at high speed. The price of a new bicycle can range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the world is the custom Madone by Damien Hirst, sold at $500,000 USD { http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/stages/hirst/ } ), { Custom Bike Builders: Groupe de Tete  – bicycling.com } depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can weigh as little as 3.2  kg (7  lb) { SPIN Custom...7.04 lbs } ). However, UCI regulations stipulates a legal race bike cannot weigh less than 6.8  kg (14.99  lbs). Being measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before buying. The drivetrain components of the bike should also be considered. A middle grade dérailleur is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes come equipped with hub gear s. If the rider plans a significant amount of hillclimbing, a triple- crank (three chainrings) front gear system may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter and less expensive two chainrings may be better. Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available, and may be more suitable for commuters. Many road bikes along with mountain bikes include clipless pedal s to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, permitting the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and back lights, bells or horns, disc brakes, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages. For basic maintenance and repairs, cyclists can choose to carry a pump (or a CO 2 cartridge ), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes. Items legally required in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include bicycle helmet s, generator or battery operated lights, reflectors, and audible signalling devices such as a bell or horn. Extras include studded tires and a bicycle computer. Bikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat designs and handle bars, for example. [ Skills ] [ Vehicular cycling ] Learning to ride efficiently and safely in traffic is important. In countries such as the Netherlands, where cycling is popular, cyclists sometimes ride in bike lanes at the side of, or separate from, main highways and roads. Many primary schools participate in the national road test in which children individually complete a circuit on roads near the school while being observed by testers. [ Cycling infrastructure ] [ Cycling infrastructure ] { Niigata, Niigata, Japan. } { alt=Hundreds of bicycles, grouped in rectangular parking places with driving paths in between. } { bicycle stand s around the city centers such as these on } { Briggate in Leeds, England. } Cyclists, pedestrians and motorists make different demands on road design which may lead to conflicts. Some jurisdictions give priority to motorized traffic, for example setting up one-way street systems, free-right turns, high capacity roundabouts, and slip roads. Others may apply traffic restraint measures to limit the impact of motorized transport. In the former cases, cycling has tended to decline while in the latter it has tended to be maintained. Occasionally, extreme measures against cycling may occur. In Shanghai, where bicycles were once the dominant mode of transport, bicycle travel on a few city roads was banned temporarily in December 2003. In areas in which cycling is popular and encouraged, cycle-parking facilities using bicycle stand s, lockable mini-garages, and patrolled cycle parks are used in order to reduce theft. Local governments promote cycling by permitting bicycles to be carried on public transport or by providing external attachment devices on public transport vehicles. Conversely, an absence of secure cycle-parking is a recurring complaint by cyclists from cities with low modal share of cycling. Extensive bicycle path systems may be found in some cities. Such dedicated paths often have to be shared with in-line skaters, scooters, skateboarders, and pedestrians. Segregating bicycle and automobile traffic in cities has met with mixed success, both in terms of safety and bicycle promotion. At some point the two streams of traffic inevitably intersect, often in a haphazard and congested fashion. Studies have demonstrated that, due to the high incidence of accidents at these sites, some such segregated schemes can actually increase the number of car-bike collisions. { &quot; Bicycling Life &quot; } Bicycles are considered a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and relatively shorter distances when used for transport (compared to recreation). Case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate this kind of functional cycling in cities can be found at Eltis, Europe&apos;s portal for local transport. A number of European countries, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, apply a strict liability towards cyclists, protecting them. { http://www.bikehub.co.uk/news/bike-to-work/strict-liability-too-contentious-says-transport-minister/ citing UK transport secretary Norman Baker in December 2010. } For example in the Netherlands, the law assumes the stronger participant (e.g. a car driver) is liable in the case of an accident with a weaker participant (e.g. a cyclist) unless it can be proved that the cyclist&apos;s behavior could not have been expected. Furthermore, in the Netherlands, drivers know to expect a high volume of cyclist traffic and bicycle paths are widespread and (in the cities) closed to scooter s. Due to these issues the number of car-bike collisions with serious consequences is not alarmingly high in the Netherlands [ July 2011 ]. [ Types ] [ Utility ] { tender coconut for sale. } { Karnataka, India. } { alt=A bicycle loaded with so many green fruits that the rear wheel can not be seen. } [ Utility cycling ] Utility cycling refers both to cycling as a mode of daily commuting transport as well as the use of a bicycle in a commercial activity, mainly to transport goods, mostly accomplished in an urban environment. The postal services of many countries have long relied on bicycles. The British Royal Mail first started using bicycles in 1880; now bicycle delivery fleets include 37,000 in the UK, 25,700 in Germany, 10,500 in Hungary and 7000 in Sweden. The London Ambulance Service has recently introduced bicycling paramedic s, who can often get to the scene of an incident in Central London more quickly than a motorized ambulance. Late in the 20th century, urban police bicycle s became more common, as the mobility of car-borne officers was increasingly limited by traffic congestion and pedestrianisation. Bicycles enjoy substantial use as general delivery vehicles in many countries. In the UK and North America, generations of teenagers have got their first jobs delivering newspapers by bicycle. London has many delivery companies that use bicycles with trailers. Most cities in the West, and many outside it, support a sizeable and visible industry of cycle couriers who deliver documents and small packages. In India, many of Mumbai&apos;s Dabbawala s use bicycles to deliver home cooked lunches to the city’s workers. In Bogotá, Colombia the city’s largest bakery recently replaced most of its delivery trucks with bicycles. Even the car industry uses bicycles. At the huge Mercedes-Benz factory in Sindelfingen, Germany workers use bicycles, color-coded by department, to move around the factory. [ Recreational ] Bicycle Touring [ Bicycle touring ] alt=A white bicycle parked in the grass. Bicycles are used for recreation at all ages. Bicycle touring, also known as cyclotourism, involves touring and exploration or sightseeing by bicycle for leisure. A brevet or randonnée is an organized long-distance ride. One popular Dutch pleasure is the enjoyment of relaxed cycling in the countryside of the Netherlands. The land is very flat and full of public bicycle trails where cyclists are not bothered by cars and other traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling recreation. Many Dutch people subscribe every year to an event called fietsvierdaagse  — four days of organised cycling through the local environment. Paris–Brest–Paris (PBP), which began in 1891, is the oldest bicycling event still run on a regular basis on the open road, covers over [ 1200 km 0 on ] and imposes a 90-hour time limit. Similar if smaller institutions exist in many countries. Organized rides { Portland, Oregon } { alt=Many bicyclists with colorful clothes } Many cycling club s hold organized rides in which bicyclists of all levels participate. The typical organized ride starts with a large group of riders, called the mass, bunch or even peloton. This will thin out over the course of the ride. Many riders choose to ride together in groups of the same skill level to take advantage of drafting. Most organized rides, for example Cyclosportive s, Challenge Rides or reliability trial s, and hill climbs include registration requirements and will provide information either through the mail or online concerning start times and other requirements. Rides usually consist of several different routes, sorted by mileage, and with a certain number of rest stops that usually include refreshments, first aid and maintenance tools. Routes can vary by as much as [ 100 mi km ]. Mountain Mountain biking began in the 1970s, originally as a downhill sport, practised on customized cruiser bikes around Mount Tamalpais. { http://sonic.net/~ckelly/Seekay/clunker.htm } Most mountain biking takes place on dirt roads, trails and in purpose-built parks. Downhill mountain biking has just evolved in the recent years and is performed at places such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park. Slopestyle, a form of downhill, is when riders do tricks such as tailwhips, 360s, backflips and frontflips. [ Racing ] alt=A black-and-white picture of a man on an old bicycle. Another man is holding or pushing the bicycle. alt=A bunch of bicyclist following a car. [ Bicycle racing ] Shortly after the introduction of bicycles, competitions developed independently in many parts of the world. Early races involving boneshaker style bicycles were predictably fraught with injuries. Large races became popular during the 1890s &quot; Golden Age of Cycling &quot;, with events across Europe, and in the U.S. and Japan as well. At one point, almost every major city in the US had a velodrome or two for track racing events, however since the middle of the 20th century cycling has become a minority sport in the US whilst in Continental Europe it continues to be a major sport, particularly in France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The most famous of all bicycle races is the Tour de France. This began in 1903, and continues to capture the attention of the sporting world. In 1899, Mile-a-Minute Murphy became the first man to ride his bicycle a mile in under a minute, which he did by drafting a locomotive at New York&apos;s Long Island. As the bicycle evolved its various forms, different racing formats developed. Road races may involve both team and individual competition, and are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, criterium, and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling&apos;s Grand Tours. Recumbent bicycle s were banned from bike races in 1934 after Marcel Berthet set a new hour record in his Velodyne streamliner (49.992  km on November 18, 1933). Track bicycle s are used for track cycling in Velodrome s, while cyclo-cross races are held on rugged outdoor terrain, which is performed on road, grass, and mud. Riders in cyclocross must get off their bikes at certain intervals and hop over barriers. Time trial races, another form of road racing require a rider to ride against the clock. Time trials can be performed as a team or as a single rider. Bikes are changed for time trial races, using aero bars. In the past decade, mountain bike racing has also reached international popularity and is even an Olympic sport. Professional racing organizations place limitations on the bicycles that can be used in the races that they sanction. For example, the Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of international cycle sport (which sanctions races such as the Tour de France), decided in the late 1990s to create additional rules which prohibit racing bicycles weighing less than 6.8 kilograms (14.96 pounds). The UCI rules also effectively ban some bicycle frame innovations (such as the recumbent bicycle ) by requiring a double triangle structure. [ http://oldsite.uci.ch/english/about/rules/ch01_general.pdf PDF UCI Cycling Regulations 2006-08-04 Union Cycliste International 2003 ] [ War ] [ Bicycle infantry ] The bicycle is not suited for combat, but it has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan&apos;s march or &quot; roll &quot; through Malaysia in World War II. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne &quot; Cycle-commandos &quot; with folding bike s. In the Vietnam War, communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle troops was Switzerland, who disbanded their final unit in 2003. [ Activism ] Two broad and correlated themes run in bicycle activism: one is about advocating the bicycle as an alternative mode of transport, and the other is about the creation of conditions to permit and/or encourage bicycle use, both for utility and recreational cycling. [ One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1899_reg.html Furness Zack 2010 Temple University Press Philadelphia 978-1-59213-613-1 ] Although the first, which emphasizes the potential for energy and resource conservation and health benefits gained from cycling versus automobile use, is relatively undisputed, the second is the subject of much debate. { Critical Mass, April 29, 2005. } { alt=Many cyclists on a road, all going in the same direction. } It is generally agreed that improved local and inter-city rail services and other methods of mass transportation (including greater provision for cycle carriage on such services) create conditions to encourage bicycle use. However, there are different opinions on the role of the use of segregated cycle facilities and other items of the cycling infrastructure in building bicycle-friendly cities and roads. Some bicycle activists (including some traffic management advisers) seek the construction of segregated cycle facilities for journeys of all lengths. Other activists, especially those from the more established tradition, view the safety, practicality, and intent of many segregated cycle facilities with suspicion. They favor a more holistic approach based on the 4 &apos;E&apos;s; education (of everyone involved), encouragement (to apply the education), enforcement (to protect the rights of others), and engineering (to facilitate travel while respecting every person&apos;s equal right to do so). In some cases this opposition has a more ideological basis: some members of the Vehicular Cycling movement oppose segregated public facilities, such as on-street bike lanes, on principle. Some groups offer training courses to help cyclists integrate themselves with other traffic. This is part of the ongoing cycle path debate. Critical Mass is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in cities around the world where bicyclists take to the streets en masse. While the ride was originally founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the direct action of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city streets. There is a long-running cycle helmet debate among activists. The most heated controversy surrounds the topic of compulsory helmet use. [ Associations ] { London Cycling Campaign. } { alt=A group of people standing with their bicycles. } Cyclists form associations, both for specific interests (trails development, road maintenance, urban design, racing clubs, touring clubs, and so on.) and for more global goals ( energy conservation, pollution reduction, promotion of fitness). Some bicycle clubs and national associations became prominent advocates for improvements to roads and highways. In the United States, the League of American Wheelmen lobbied for the improvement of roads in the last part of the 19th century, founding and leading the national Good Roads Movement. Their model for political organization, as well as the paved roads for which they argued, facilitated the growth of the automobile. As a sport, cycling is governed internationally by the Union Cycliste Internationale in Switzerland, USA Cycling (merged with the United States Cycling Federation in 1995) in the United States, (for upright bicycle s ) and by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (for other HPVs, or human-powered vehicles). Cycling for transport and touring is promoted on a European level by the European Cyclists&apos; Federation, with associated members from Great Britain, Japan and elsewhere. Regular conferences on cycling as transport are held under the auspices of Velo City; global conferences are coordinated by Velo Mondial. [ http://www.velomondial.net Velo Mondial: The premier global sustainable mobility and cycling network 2010-04-29 ] [ Advantages ] [ Exercise ] The physical exercise gained from cycling is generally linked with increased health and well-being. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is second only to tobacco smoking as a health risk in developed countries, [ http://www.euro.who.int/document/e75662.pdf PDF A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE LIFE THROUGH EVERYDAY TRANSPORT World health Organisation 2009-09-29 ] and this is associated with many tens of billions of dollars of healthcare costs. [ http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/economic_consequences.htm Overweight and Obesity: Economic Consequences Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov) 2009-09-29 ] The WHO&apos;s report suggests that increasing physical activity is a public health &apos;best buy&apos;, and that cycling is a &apos;highly suitable activity&apos; for this purpose. The charity Sustrans reports that investment in cycling provision can give a 20:1 return from health and other benefits.

[ British Medical Association Mayhew Hillman, David Morgan Cycling: Towards Health and Safety Oxford University Press 0-19-286151-4 1992 ] Bicycles are often used by people seeking to improve their fitness and cardiovascular health. In this regard, cycling is especially helpful for those with arthritis of the lower limbs who are unable to pursue sports that cause impact to the knees and other joints. Since cycling can be used for the practical purpose of transportation, there can be less need for self-discipline to exercise. Cycling while seated is a relatively non- weight bearing exercise that, like swimming, does little to promote bone density. [ Nichols JF, Palmer JE, Levy SS Low bone mineral density in highly trained male master cyclists Osteoporos Int 14 8 644–9 2003 August 12856112 10.1007/s00198-003-1418-z ] Cycling up and out of the saddle, on the other hand, does a better job by transferring more of the rider&apos;s body weight to the legs. However, excessive cycling while standing can cause knee damage {. } [ http://www.sheldonbrown.com/pain.html#knees Bicycling and Pain 2011-02-07 ] [ May 2011 ] It used to be thought that cycling while standing was less energy efficient, but recent research has proven this not to be true. Other than air resistance, there is no wasted energy from cycling while standing, if it is done correctly. [ http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/?pg%3Dfullstory%26amp%3Bid%3D4512 Sit or Stand: Tradeoffs in Efficiency? November 21, 2006 2006-11-28 ] Cycling on a stationary cycle is frequently advocated as a suitable exercise for rehabilitation, particularly for lower limb injury, owing to the low impact which it has on the joints. In particular, cycling is commonly used within knee rehabilitation programs. [ http://www.kneeguru.co.uk/KNEEnotes/node/1071 Cycling for Knee Rehabilitation ] As a response to the increased global sedentarity and consequent overweight and obesity, one response that has been adopted by many organizations concerned with health and environment is the promotion of Active travel, which seeks to promote walking and cycling as safe and attractive alternatives to motorized transport. Given that many journeys are for relatively short distances, there is considerable scope to replace car use with walking or cycling, though in many settings this may require some infrastructure modification, particularly to attract the less experienced and confident.

It should be noted that calculated fatality rates based on distance for bicycling (as well as for walking) can have an exceptionally large margin of error, since there are generally no annual registrations or odometers required for bicycles (as there are with motor vehicles), and this means the distance traveled must be estimated. Most cycle deaths result from a collision with a car or heavy goods vehicle, both motorist and cyclist having been found responsible for collisions [ http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/articles/cyclingingreatbritain1 Cycling in Great Britain Department of Transport 2009-09-29 ] [ http://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/53/article4.html 44 tonne articulated trucks and towns don&apos;t mix Cambridge Cycling Campaign UK 2009-09-29 ] [ http://showcase.commedia.org.uk/article/articleview/390/1/13/ Lorries and Towns Don&apos;t Mix (video) Robert Webb ] However, around a fifth of non-fatal injuries to cyclists do not involve any other person or vehicle. A Danish study in 2000 concluded that &quot; bicycling to work decreased risk of mortality in approximately 40% after multivariate adjustment, including leisure time physical activity &quot;.

Acute physical trauma includes injuries to the head and extremities resulting from falls and collisions. Since a large percentage of the collisions between motor and pedal vehicles occur at night, bicycle lighting is required for safety when bicycling at night. { Taroko Gorge in Taiwan } The most common cycling overuse injury occurs in the knees, affecting cyclists at all levels. These are caused by many factors: [ http://www.biomech.com/db_area/archives/1996/9607sports.bio.html http://web.archive.org/web/20070928070212/http%3A//www.biomech.com/db_area/archives/1996/9607sports.bio.html 2007-09-28 Knee Pain in Cycling: New Twist on an old Injury BioMechanics July/August, 1996 2006-11-24 ] Incorrect bicycle fit or adjustment, particularly the saddle. Incorrect adjustment of clipless pedals. Too many hills, or too many miles, too early in the training season. Poor training preparation for long touring rides. Selecting too high a gear. A lower gear for uphill climb protects the knees, even though muscles may be well able to handle a higher gear. Excessive saddle height can cause posterior knee pain, while setting the saddle too low can cause pain in the anterior of the knee. An incorrectly fitted saddle may eventually lead to muscle imbalance. A 25 to 35 degree knee angle is recommended to avoid an overuse injury. [ http://www.nasm.org/nasmpro/library/showarticle.aspx?id%3D14202 Avoid Repetitive Knee Injuries While Riding A Bike ] Overuse injuries, including chronic nerve damage at weight bearing locations, can occur as a result of repeatedly riding a bicycle for extended periods of time.

Recumbent bicycle s are designed on different ergonomic principles and eliminate pressure from the saddle and handlebars, due to the relaxed riding position. Note that overuse is a relative term, and capacity varies greatly between individuals. Someone starting out in cycling must be careful to increase length and frequency of cycling sessions slowly, starting for example at an hour or two per day, or a hundred miles or kilometers per week. Muscular pain is a normal by-product of the training process, but joint pain and numbness are early signs of overuse injury. Cycling has been linked to sexual impotence due to pressure on the perineum from the seat, but fitting a proper sized seat prevents this effect.
