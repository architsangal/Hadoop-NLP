[ Buxton Patrick A. The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control 2nd Edward Arnold London 24–72 The biology of Pediculus humanus 1947 ] Head lice are wingless insect s spending their entire life on human scalp and feeding exclusively on human blood. Human s are the only known host s of this specific parasite, while chimpanzee s host a closely related species Pediculus schaeffi. Other species of lice infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds. The head louse differs from the related body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. Although the two subspecies are morphologically almost identical, they do not normally interbreed, although they will interbreed in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies of them, they are thought to have diverged as species about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing.

It is visually different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. [ Buxton Patrick A. The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control 2nd Edward Arnold London 136–141 The crab louse Phthirus pubis 1947 ] Lice infestation of any part of the body is known as pediculosis. [ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pediculosis pediculosis – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary 2008-04-23 ] Head lice differ from other hematophagic ectoparasites such as the flea in that lice spend their entire life cycle on a host. [ Maunder JW The Appreciation of Lice Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain 55 1–31 Royal Institution of Great Britain London 1983 ] Head lice cannot fly, and their short stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. [ Adult morphology ] Like other insects of the suborder Anoplura, adult head lice are small (1–3  mm long), dorso-ventrally flattened (see anatomical terms of location ), and entirely wingless. [ Buxton Patrick A. The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control 2nd Edward Arnold London 1–4 The Anoplura or Sucking Lice 1947 ] The thoracic segments are fused, but otherwise distinct from the head and abdomen, the latter being composed of seven visible segments. [ Buxton Patrick A. The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control 2nd Edward Arnold London 5–23 The Anatomy of Pediculus humanus 1947 ] Head lice are grey in general, but their precise color varies according to the environment in which they were raised. After feeding, consumed blood causes the louse body to take on a reddish color. [ Head ] Male head louse, adult upright One pair of antennae, each with five segments, protrude from the insect&apos;s head. Head lice also have one pair of eye s. Eyes are present in all species within Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member) but are reduced or absent in most other members of the Anoplura suborder. Like other members of Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect&apos;s head except during feeding.

Whitehouse Station, NJ USA ] [ Thorax ] Head louse gripping a human hair Six legs project from the fused segments of the thorax. As is typical in Anoplura, these legs are short and terminate with a single claw and opposing &quot; thumb &quot;. Between its claw and thumb, the louse grasps the hair of its host. With their short legs and large claws, lice are well adapted to clinging to the hair of their host. However, these adaptations leave them quite incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. Lice can climb up strands of hair very quickly, allowing them to run and jump on to another host. As with other members of Anoplura, wings are entirely absent. [ Abdomen ] There are seven visible segments of the louse abdomen. The first six segments each have a pair of spiracles through which the insect breathes. The last segment contains the anus and (separately) the genitalia. [ Gender differences ] In male lice, the front two legs are slightly larger than the other four. This specialized pair of legs is used for holding the female during copulation. Males are slightly smaller than females and are characterized by a pointed end of the abdomen and a well-developed genital apparatus visible inside the abdomen. Females are characterized by two gonopods in the shape of a W at the end of their abdomen. [ Louse eggs ] Head louse egg attached to hair shaft of host Like most insects, head lice are oviparous. Louse eggs contain a single embryo and are attached near the base of a host hair shaft. [ Williams LK, Reichert A, MacKenzie WR, Hightower AW, Blake PA Lice, nits, and school policy Pediatrics 107 5 1011–5 2001 11331679 10.1542/peds.107.5.1011 ] [ Burkhart CN, Burkhart CG Head lice: scientific assessment of the nit sheath with clinical ramifications and therapeutic options J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 53 1 129–33 2005 15965432 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.01.134 ] Egg-laying behavior is temperature dependent and likely seeks to place the egg in a location that will be conducive to proper embyro development (which is, in turn, temperature dependent). In cool climates, eggs are generally laid within 1  cm of the scalp surface. In warm climates, and especially the tropics, eggs may be laid [ 6 in cm ] or more down the hair shaft. [ Meinking Terri Lynn Infestations Current Problems in Dermatology 11 3 75–118 1999 May/June 10.1016/S1040-0486(99)90005-4 ] To attach each egg, the adult female secretes a glue from her reproductive organ. This glue quickly hardens into a &quot; nit sheath &quot; that covers the hair shaft and the entire egg except for the operculum, a cap through which the embryo breathes. The glue was previously thought to be chitin -based, but more recent studies have shown it to be made of protein s similar to hair keratin. Each egg is oval-shaped and about 0.8  mm in length. They are tan to coffee-colored so long as they contain an embryo but appear white after hatching. Typically, a hatching time of six to nine days after oviposition is cited by authors. [ Burgess IF Human lice and their management Advances in parasitology 36 271–342 1995 7484466 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60493-5 Advances in Parasitology 978-0-12-031736-3 ] However, these data are from work with body lice (not head lice) that show hatching time and hatching probability are extremely temperature dependent.

After hatching, the louse nymph leaves behind its egg shell, still attached to the hair shaft. The empty egg shell remains in place until physically removed by abrasion or the host, or until it slowly disintegrates, which may take months or years.

[ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nit nit – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary 2008-02-25 ] With respect to eggs, this rather broad definition includes the following: [ Pollack RJ, Kiszewski AE, Spielman A Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 19 8 689–93; discussion 694 2000 10959734 10.1097/00006454-200008000-00003 ] Viable eggs that will eventually hatch Remnants of already-hatched eggs Nonviable eggs (dead embryo ) that will never hatch This has produced some confusion in, for example, school policy (see The &quot; no-nit &quot; policy ) because, of the three items listed above, only eggs containing viable embryos have the potential to infest or reinfest a host. [ Burgess IF Human lice and their control Annu. Rev. Entomol. 49 457–81 2004 14651472 10.1146/annurev.ento.49.061802.123253 ] Some authors have reacted to this confusion by restricting the definition of nit to describe only a hatched or nonviable egg: Louse hatching [ In many languages the terms used for the hatched eggs, which were obvious for all to see, have subsequently become applied to the embryonated eggs that are difficult to detect. Thus the term &quot; nit &quot; in English is often used for both. However, in recent years my colleagues and I have felt the need for some simple means of distinguishing between the two without laborious qualification. We have, therefore, come to reserve the term &quot; nit &quot; for the hatched and empty egg shell and refer to the developing embryonated egg as an &quot; egg &quot;. Ian F. Burgess (1995) ] [ The empty eggshell, termed a nit... J. W. Maunder (1983) ] [ Mumcuoglu Kosta Y.

Terri Lynn Meinking (1999) ] [ Because nits are simply egg casings that can contain a developing embryo or be empty shells, not all nits are infective. L. Keoki Williams and others (2001) ] Note that all these quotations appear to reject the notion that louse nymphs are nits and may indicate that the nit definition is currently in flux. [ Development and nymphs ] { body lice ), which is similar to that of head lice (&apos;&apos;Pediculus humanus capitis&apos;&apos;) } Head lice, like other insects of the order Phthiraptera, are hemimetabolous. Newly hatched nymphs will moult three times before reaching the sexually-mature adult stage. Thus, mobile head lice populations contain members of up to four developmental stages: three nymphal instars, and the adult ( imago ). Metamorphosis during head lice development is subtle. The only visible differences between different instars and the adult, other than size, is the relative length of the abdomen, which increases with each molt. Aside from reproduction, nymph behavior is similar to the adult. Nymphs feed only on human blood ( hematophagia ), and cannot survive long away from a host. Like adult head lice, the nymph cannot fly or jump. However, there are reports of the light-weighted nymphs being blown by wind. Similarly, after a molt, the discarded exoskeleton can be later shed by the host and may be mistakenly interpreted as a viable louse. The time required for head lice to complete their nymph development to the imago depends on feeding conditions. At minimum, eight to nine days is required for lice having continuous access to a human host. This experimental condition is most representative of head lice conditions in the wild. Experimental conditions where the nymph has more limited access to blood produces more prolonged development, ranging from 12 to 24 days. Nymph mortality in captivity is high —about 38% —especially within the first two days of life. In the wild, mortality may instead be highest in the third instar. Nymph hazards are numerous. Failure to completely hatch from the egg is invariably fatal and may be dependent on the humidity of the egg&apos;s environment. Death during molting can also occur, although it is reportedly uncommon. During feeding, the nymph gut can rupture, dispersing the host&apos;s blood throughout the insect. This results in death within a day or two. It is unclear if the high mortality recorded under experimental conditions is representative of conditions in the wild. [ Reproduction ] Copulation in &apos;&apos;Pediculus humanus humanus&apos;&apos; (&apos;&apos;Pediculus humanus capitis&apos;&apos; is similar). Female is on top, with the male below. Dilation of the female&apos;s vagina has already occurred, and the male&apos;s dilator rests against his back (dorsal surface), out of the way. The male vesica, which contains the penis proper (not seen), is fully inserted into the vagina. Note the male&apos;s attachment with his specialized claws on the first leg pair to the specialized notch on the female&apos;s third leg pair. Adult head lice reproduce sexually, and copulation is necessary for the female to produce fertile eggs. Parthenogenesis, the production of viable offspring by virgin females, does not occur in Pediculus humanus. Pairing can begin within the first 10 hours of adult life. After 24 hours, adult lice copulate frequently, with mating occurring during any period of the night or day. [ Bacot A Contributions to the bionomics of Pediculus humanus (vestimenti)and Pediculus capitis Parasitology 9 228–258 1917 10.1017/S0031182000006065 2 ] Mating attachment frequently lasts more than an hour. Young males can successfully pair with older females, and vice versa. Experiments with Pediculus humanus humanus (body lice) emphasize the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with six or more males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with red —a condition attributed to rupture of the alimentary canal during the sexual act. Old females frequently die following, if not during, intercourse. Females lay about three to four eggs daily. [ Michigan Head Lice Manual State of Michigan 2004 ] During its lifespan of four weeks a female louse lays 50–150 eggs (nits). [ May 2008 ] [ Lifespan and colony persistence ] A generation lasts for about one month. [ May 2008 ] The number of children per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare in a particular area (e.g. school) and socioeconomic status were found to be significant factors in head louse infestation. Girls are two to four times more frequently infested than boys. Children between 4 and 14 years of age are the most frequently infested group. [ Mumcuoglu Kosta Y.

Bloodsucking may continue for a long period if the louse is not disturbed. While feeding, lice may excrete dark red feces onto the skin. &quot; [ Weems, Jr. H. V. Fasulo, T. R.

Head lice are repelled by light and will move towards shadows or dark-colored objects in their vicinity. [ Nuttall George H. F. George Nuttall The biology of Pediculus humanus, Supplementary notes Parasitology 11 2 201–221 1919 ] [ Migration ] Lice have no wings or powerful legs for jumping, so they move by using their claw-like legs to transfer from hair to hair. Normally head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent-child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, brushes, towels, clothing, beds or closets. Head-to-head contact is by far the most common route of lice transmission. [ Distribution ] About 6–12 million people, mainly children, are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world, including Israel, Denmark, Sweden, UK, France, and Australia.

[ Treatment ] There are many chemical and pesticide treatments available that aim to kill the louse, however these often do not affect the eggs (nits). Wet combing is one of the most effective treatments, but persistence is required due to the life cycle of the louse, and it&apos;s recommended combing once every 3-7 days. Another very effective treatment is the LouseBuster which uses heat to effectively dehydrate the lice and their eggs. Applying a blow-dryer can have similar (yet reduced) effect as the LouseBuster. { An Effective Nonchemical Treatment for Head Lice: A Lot of Hot Air } After treatment wash all bedding and vacuum all areas the head may have been such as car seats, coat hoods and sofas. Put all combs and brushes in boiling water for 5-10 minutes. [ Prevention ] Keeping hair neatly tied up is the best prevention. A pony tail which is then pleated ensures no loose hairs for lice to get hold of. Wash and brush regularly to ensure the hair is manageable. It is advisable to comb the whole family once a week whilst children are at school age. This can become part of a routine like brushing the teeth. If your child goes to a sleep over, get them to take their own pillow case and tell them to &apos;top and tail&apos;.

Why infest the loved ones – inherent human behaviour indicates former mutualism with head lice Parasitology in press 2012 ] { that humans express love by touching their hairy scalps together (a behaviour absent in apes) so as to share their beneficial head lice infestations. } It was recently suggested that headlice might have been mutualist partners to humans throughout a long period of human evolutionary past up to recent times. The authors argue that childhood headlice infestations may provoke an immune response that provides some defense against body lice infestations later on. This would be beneficial for humans because body lice serve as vectors of lethal human diseases while head lice do not play any vector role. Indeed, body lice are important vectors of epidemic or louse-borne typhus, trench fever, louse-borne relapsing fever, and probably even classical bubonic plague [ Drancourt M. Houhamdi L.; Raoult D. Yersinia pestis as a telluric, human ectoparasite-borne organism Lancet Infectious Diseases 6 234–241 2006 ]. Thus a childhood headlice infestation may serve as a &quot; natural vaccine &quot; against the body lice and the lethal pathogens they may carry. In modern days, however, head lice infestations do not yield any adaptive benefits for the people living in developed countries where the threat exposed by the virulent forms of body-louse-borne diseases is mostly (though not totally) eradicated.
