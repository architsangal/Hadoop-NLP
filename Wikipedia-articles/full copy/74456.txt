Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Lieberman is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School. He was elected as a &quot; reform Democrat &quot; in 1970 to the Connecticut Senate, where he served three terms as Majority Leader. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, he served as state Attorney General from 1983 to 1989. Lieberman defeated moderate Republican Lowell Weicker in 1988 to win election to the United States Senate and was re-elected in 1994 and 2000. In the 2000 United States presidential election, Lieberman was the Democratic nominee for Vice President, running with presidential nominee Al Gore, becoming the first Jewish candidate on a major American political party presidential ticket.

At Yale he was editor of the Yale Daily News and a member of the Elihu Club. He later attended Yale Law School, receiving his law degree in 1967. After graduation from law school, Lieberman worked as a lawyer for the New Haven -based law firm Wiggin &amp; Dana LLP. A spokesperson told The Hartford Courant in 1994 that Lieberman received an educational deferment from the Vietnam War draft when he was an undergraduate and law student from 1960 to 1967. Upon graduating from law school at age 25, Lieberman qualified for a family deferment because he was already married and had one child, Matt. { Lieberman: A history-making candidate. CNN.com.

They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They had two children – Matt and Rebecca. Betty, who is also Jewish, later worked as a psychiatric social work er. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce in an interview with New York Magazine, Lieberman said, &quot; one of the differences we had was in levels of religious observance, &quot; adding, &quot; I&apos;m convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn&apos;t have gotten divorced. &quot; { You Go, Joe. &apos;&apos; } { New York Magazine November 18, 2002. } In 1982, he met his second wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while he was running for Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Lieberman is the child of a Holocaust survivor. According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because he thought it would be interesting to go out with someone named Hadassah. ( Hadassah is the name of the Women&apos;s Zionist Organization of America ). { Merida, Kevin.

In 1965 he married Betty Haas, a Reform Jew. Since the death in 1967 of Lieberman&apos;s grandmother, a deeply religious immigrant, he found renewed interest in religious observance. His second wife, Hadassah, is also an observant Modern Orthodox Jew. &quot; Hadassah calls herself my right wing, &quot; says Lieberman. In Lieberman&apos;s 1988 upset of Republican Party incumbent Senator Lowell Weicker, his religious observance was mostly viewed in terms of inability to campaign on Shabbat. This changed when Gore chose Lieberman as the running mate; a Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said: [ &quot; He refers to himself as observant, as opposed to Orthodox, because he doesn&apos;t follow the strict Orthodox code and doesn&apos;t want to offend the Orthodox, and his wife feels the same way. &quot; ] The Liebermans keep a kosher home and observe Shabbat. { Goodstein, Laurie.

(1964 Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater &apos;s father was Jewish, but Sen. Goldwater&apos;s mother was an Episcopalian, and the Senator practiced his mother&apos;s faith.) [ Early political career ] Lieberman was elected as a &quot; reform Democrat &quot; to the Connecticut Senate in 1970, where he served for 10 years, including the last six as Majority Leader. He suffered his first defeat in Connecticut elections in the Reagan landslide year of 1980, losing the race for the Third District Congressional seat to Republican Lawrence Joseph DeNardis, a state senator from suburban Hamden with whom he had worked closely on bipartisan legislative efforts. In 1981 he wrote an admiring biography of long-time Connecticut and national Democratic leader John Moran Bailey, reviewing also in the book the previous 50 years of Connecticut political history. { Review of &apos;&apos;THE LEGACY: Connecticut Politics 1930–1980&apos;&apos; Book by Joseph I.

[ U.S. Senate ] [ Tenure ] In 1988, Lieberman defeated moderate Republican Lowell Weicker to win election to the United States Senate and was re-elected in 1994 and 2000. Like Bill Clinton and Dick Gephardt, Lieberman served as chair of the Democratic Leadership Council. Lieberman was first elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in the 1988 election, by a margin of 10,000 votes. He scored the nation&apos;s biggest political upset that year, after being backed by a coalition of Democrats and unaffiliated voters with support from conservative Republicans, who were disappointed in three-term Republican incumbent Lowell Weicker&apos;s moderate voting record and personal style. During the campaign, he received support from the Connecticut&apos;s Cuban-American community which was unhappy with Weicker. Lieberman has since remained firmly anti-Castro. { Toobin, Jeffrey. Joe Lieberman looks hopefully toward the White House. } { The New Yorker December 16, 2002. } Six years later, Lieberman made history by winning by the largest landslide ever in a Connecticut Senate race, drawing 67 percent of the vote and beating his opponent by more than 350,000 votes. In 1998, Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to publicly challenge Bill Clinton for the judgment exercised in his affair with Monica Lewinsky. { Senator Joe Lieberman Attacks Clinton. AustralianPolitics.com September 3, 1998. Retrieved October 10, 2006. } However, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment. In 2000, while concurrently running for the vice presidency, Lieberman was elected to a third Senate term with 64 percent of the vote easily defeating the Republican Philip Giordano. When control of the Senate switched from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, with oversight responsibilities for a broad range of government activities. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chair of its Subcommittee Clean Air, Wetlands and Private Property; the Armed Services Committee, where he chaired the Airland Subcommittee and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee. When Republicans gained control of the Senate in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired. { Standing Committees of the Senate 108th Congress. Retrieved September 10, 2006. } 2002, as Chairman of what was then known as the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Lieberman led the fight to create a new Department of Homeland Security. One month after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he introduced legislation to reorganize the federal government to better protect the American people from terrorism and natural disasters and steered a bipartisan plan through his committee. After months of opposing the plan, the White House eventually endorsed the concept. Legislation that passed Congress in 2002 created a department incorporating key organizational elements Senator Lieberman advocated. { http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs } In 2006, Senators Lieberman and Collins drafted legislation to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency into an agency that would more effectively prepare for and respond to catastrophes, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the Coast Guard and designated the head of FEMA to be the President&apos;s point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of the preparedness and response functions within FEMA, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. And the measure strengthened FEMA&apos;s regional offices, creating dedicated interagency &quot; strike teams &quot; to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006. As the 2007 hurricane season approached, Senator Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007. He urged FEMA to implement the reforms at a quicker pace. { http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs } Senator Lieberman actively oversaw the government response to the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic and held four hearings on the subject in 2009, including one in Connecticut. He has continually pressed the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute vaccines and antiviral medications in at quicker pace and to streamline the process. { http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs } { In the 110th Congress, Lieberman is Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is responsible for assuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government.
