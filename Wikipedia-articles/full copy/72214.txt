Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns even when such practices were supposedly against cultural morals. Since the 1970s, a number of international conventions have come into effect that try to limit the participation of children in armed conflicts, nevertheless the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers reports that the use of children in military forces, and the active participation of children in armed conflicts is widespread. [ 3 ] [ International law ] [ International human rights law ] The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 38, (1989) proclaimed: &quot; State parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of 15 years do not take a direct part in hostilities. &quot; However, people who are over the age of 15 but still remain under the age of 18 are still voluntarily able to take part in combat as soldiers. The Optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict to the Convention that came into force in 2002 stipulates that its State Parties &quot; shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities and that they are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces &quot;. { Adoption by the UN General Assembly of a new treaty prohibiting the use of children under age eighteen in combat } { Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, New York, May 25, 2000 } The Optional Protocol further obligates states to &quot; take all feasible measures to prevent such recruitment and use, including the adoption of legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalize such practices. &quot; (Art 4, Optional Protocol.) { UNICEF: Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child } Likewise, under the Optional Protocol states are required to demobilize children within their jurisdiction who have been recruited or used in hostilities, and to provide assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration. (Art 6(3) Optional Protocol.) Under war, civil unrest, armed conflict and other emergency situations, children and youths are also offered protection under the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict. Under Article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), adopted in July 1998 and entered into force 1 July 2002; &quot; Conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into the national armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities &quot; is a war crime. { Wikisource:Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court#Article 8 - War crimes } [ United Nations ] The United Nations Security Council convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass resolutions under the heading &quot; Children in armed conflict &quot;.

[ International humanitarian law ] According to Article 77.2 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, adopted in 1977: [ The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces. In recruiting among those persons who have attained the age of fifteen years but who have not attained the age of eighteen years, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to give priority to those who are oldest. ] As the ICRC commentary on Protocol I makes clear, this is not a complete ban on the use of children in conflict. The ICRC had suggested that the Parties to the conflict should &quot; take all necessary measures &quot;, which became in the final text, &quot; take all feasible measures &quot; which is not a total prohibition on their doing so because feasible should be understood as meaning &quot; capable of being done, accomplished or carried out, possible or practicable &quot;. Refraining from recruiting children under fifteen does not exclude children who volunteer for armed service. During the negotiations over the clause &quot; take a part in hostilities &quot; the word &quot; direct &quot; was added to it, this opens up the possibility that child volunteers could be involved indirectly in hostilities, gathering and transmitting military information, helping in the transportation of arms and munitions, provision of supplies etc. { ICRC Commentary on Protocol I: Article 77 website of the } { ICRC ¶ 3183-3191 also ¶ 3171 } Article 4.3.c of Protocol II, additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, adopted in 1977, states &quot; children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in hostilities &quot;. Under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which was adopted and signed in 2002, National armed forces can accept volunteers into their armed forces below the age of 18, but &quot; States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities &quot;. { Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, Articles 1 and 2 } Non-state actors and guerrilla forces are forbidden from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose. In March 2012 Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was convicted by the International Criminal Court for military use of children. [ International labor law ] Forced or compulsory recruitment of anyone under the age of 18 for use in armed conflict, is one of the &apos;&apos;predefined worst forms of child labour&apos;&apos;, deemed a form of slavery, in terms of the International Labour Organisation&apos;s Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, adopted in 1999. In terms of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation ratifying countries should ensure that forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict is a criminal offence, and also provide for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of such national legislation III(12) to (14)). [ War crimes ] Opinion is currently divided over whether children should be prosecuted for committing war crimes. { Lauren McCollough, The Military Trial of Omar Khadr: Child Soldiers and the Law, Crimes of War Project March 10, 2008 } International law does not prohibit the prosecution of children who commit war crimes, but the article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child does limit the punishment that a child can receive including &quot; Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. &quot; Many child soldiers fought in the Civil war in Sierra Leone. In its wake the UN sanctioned the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) to try the participants for war crimes and other breaches of humanitarian law. The statute of the SCSL gave the court jurisdiction over persons aged 15 and older, however the Paris Principles state that children who participated in armed conflict: [... who are accused of crimes under international law allegedly committed while they were associated with armed forces or armed groups should be considered primarily as victims of offences against international law; not only as perpetrators. They must be treated in accordance with international law in a framework of restorative justice and social rehabilitation, consistent with international law which offers children special protection through numerous agreements and principles. The Paris Principles and Guidelines on Children associated with armed forces or armed groups,February 2007. Section &quot; Treatment of children accused of crimes under international law &quot;,p. 9 ] and this was reflected in the wording of article 7 of the SCSL statute which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised rehabilitation and society&apos;s reintegration. David Crane the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, chose to interpret the statute so that the tribunal&apos;s policy was to prosecute those who recruited the children rather than the children themselves no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed. In the United States, prosecutors take a different view from David Crane and have repeatedly stated that they intend to try Omar Khadr, on several serious charges including murder, for offences they allege he committed in Afghanistan while fighting for the Taliban against United States forces while he was under sixteen years old. If found guilty under US law such a crime carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On 25 October 2010, Khadr pleaded guilty to murder in violation of the laws of war, attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, two counts of providing material support for terrorism and spying.

The symposium define a child soldier as any person under age 18 who is &quot; part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or group in any capacity, including but not limited to cooks, porters, messengers and those accompanying such groups, other than purely as family members.

The earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible (such as David &apos;s service to King Saul ), in Hittite and Egyptian art, and in Greek mythology (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas ), philosophy and literature. Also in a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on campaign, together with the rest of a military man&apos;s family, as part of the baggage. This exposed them to harm from rearguard attacks, such as the one at the battle of Agincourt, where the retainers and children of the English army were massacred by the French. [ Significant sentence unsupported by citation and also not even mentioned on specialized article (Battle of Agincourt) January 2012 ] The Romans also made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age. In medieval Europe, young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides ( &quot; squires &quot; ), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called Children&apos;s Crusade in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children actually entered combat; according to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children&apos;s Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which the entire family took part in a war effort. Young boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814, he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in Holland with Marshal MacDonald and aged between 14 and 17. { Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813-1814, pg.99-100 } Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France (they were also known as &quot; The Infants of the Emperor). These soldiers were in their mid-teens and performed heroic acts under the personal direction of Napoleon, but could not stem the tide of the Allied advance. { Stephen Pope, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 318 } One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous &quot; drummer boy &quot; – the film &apos;&apos;Waterloo&apos;&apos; (based on the Battle of Waterloo ) graphically depicts French drummer boys leading Napoleon&apos;s initial attack, only to be gunned down by Allied soldiers. During the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many important tasks including bringing powder and shot from the ship&apos;s magazine to the gun crews. These children were called &quot; powder monkeys &quot;. During the Siege of Mafeking in the Second Boer War, Robert Baden-Powell recruited and trained 12-15 year old boys as scouts, thus freeing up the limited number of men for the actual fighting. The boys&apos; success led indirectly to Baden-Powell founding the Boy Scouts, a youth organization originally run along military lines. At the outbreak of the First World War, boys as young as 13 were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers cheerfully enlisted for active service others to avoid the harsh and dreary lives they had working in British industry. Many were to serve in the bloodiest battles of the war, such as ex-miner Dick Trafford who took part in the Battle of Loos, and Frank Lindley who, seeking to avenge his dead brother, went over the top on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Both were just sixteen. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a Bantam battalion in the Welsh Regiment.

Prior to that, Japanese school children experienced increased military training introduced through their physical education classes, with military drills becoming a staple part of their curriculum. The use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however, had forstalled the Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands by bringing about the Japanese surrender, and thus rendered these child soldiers unnecessary. A fifteen year-old Yugoslavian boy named Bosko Buha formed the &quot; Partisan Artillery &quot;, a battalion of teenage grenade-throwers. He died in 1943 at the age of seventeen when his truck was ambushed by Chetniks. [ Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos ] [ Indochina Wars ] In the most notorious case, the Khmer Rouge communist group exploited thousands of desensitized conscripted children to commit mass murders and other inhuman acts during the Cambodia n genocide.

Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities. Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of village attacks, while others were found abandoned. They were used for patrol purposes, attacking villages, and guarding workers in the diamond fields. In his book A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Child Soldier, Ishmael Beah chronicles his life during the conflict in Sierra Leone. In June 2007, the Special Court for Sierra Leone found three accused men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this, the Special Court became the first-ever UN backed tribunal to deliver a guilty verdict for the military conscription of children.
