The Carnival Destiny was built with two less decks than the rest of the Triumph-class ships. Two more Spirit-class ships sail for Carnival&apos;s sister company Costa Cruises, the Costa Atlantica and the Costa Mediterranea. The Conquest-class is based on the overall design of the Destiny-class, but are longer. Because of the additional length, the Conquest class has expanded facilities compared to the Destiny class. All ships have a reservations-only restaurant. The Carnival Conquest, Carnival Glory, Carnival Valor, Carnival Liberty and the Carnival Freedom, slightly differ from the rest of the fleet because they have Carnival&apos;s Seaside Theater installed by the main pool on the lido deck. The Destiny-class ships, Carnival Destiny, Carnival Triumph and Carnival Victory also have one installed.The Carnival Splendor and the Dream-class ships, Carnival Dream and Carnival Magic, were built with the Seaside Theater. The Carnival Splendor offers facilities other ships do not have. This is because the ship was originally designed for Carnival&apos;s sister company Costa Cruises. Costa Cruises has three sister ships to the Carnival Splendor, the Costa Concordia, the Costa Serena, and the Costa Pacifica. The inaugural voyage for the Carnival Splendor was on 2 July 2008 from Genoa, Italy to Dover, England. On 3 April 2008 Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, stated that due to the low value of the US dollar, inflation and high shipbuilding costs, the company would not be ordering any new ships for their US-based brands (Carnival, Princess Cruises and Holland America Line ) until the economic situation improves. Carnival Corporation has since ordered no less than four ships for the American market: three for Carnival and one for Princess.
