In Japan, the character is known as [ Koopa クッパ Kuppa ] [ クッパ http://www.smashbros.com/jp/characters/koopa.html Masahiro Sakurai Nintendo Japanese Koopa 2007-07-03 2009-10-18 ] and bears the title of [ Daimaō 大魔王 lit. &quot; Great Demon King &quot; ]. [ キャラクター紹介 http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n01/n64/software/nus_p_nmqj/game/chara/index.html Nintendo Japanese Character introduction 2009-10-18 ] Bowser is the leader and most powerful of the Turtle -like Koopa race and is the greedy archnemesis of the Mario Brothers beginning with his first appearance, in the game Super Mario Bros. His ultimate goals are to marry Princess Peach, defeat Mario, and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. Since his debut, he has appeared in almost every Mario series game. Currently, Bowser is voiced by both Scott Burns and Kenny James. [ Concept and creation ] { Shigeru Miyamoto. } Bowser was the creation of Nintendo designer and producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Miyamoto had first envisioned Bowser as an ox, basing him on the Ox King from the Toei Animation film Alakazam the Great. [ http://ds.kombo.com/article.php?artid%3D7373 David Oxford Iwata Asks:The Birth of Bowser Ds.Kombo 2010-08-23 ] However, Nintendo designer Takashi Tezuka pointed out to Miyamoto that the character looked a lot more like a turtle than an ox. Despite popular misconception, Bowser is, in fact, supposed to be a turtle, not a dragon. [ http://stars.ign.com/articles/104/1049247p1.html Jesse Schedeen Big Boss of the Day: Bowser IGN 2009-12-26 ] (Though an early advertisement flyer for the arcade version of the game did refer to &quot; conquer[ing] dragons &quot; as part of its gameplay.) { VS Mario Adventure http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer &amp; db=videodb &amp; id=6009 &amp; image=2 } Miyamoto and Tezuka then began to work together to define Bowser&apos;s appearance. Since the character was the leader of the turtle-like Koopa Troopas the two began to base his new appearance on them, creating a new illustration. In his final design, Miyamoto commented that he could make Bowser &quot; look cool now &quot;.

Kuppa came from the Japanese name for [ ko 국밥 ], gukbap, a Korean dish. Miyamoto had also considered the names [ ja ユッケ ] Yukke and [ ja ビビンバ ] Bibinba, also Japanese names of Korean dishes ( [ ko 육회 ] yukhoe and [ ko 비빔밥 ] bibimbap respectively). [ http://themushroomkingdom.net/mariosan.shtml Mario in Japan page at The Mushroom Kingdom Themushroomkingdom.net 2010-07-17 2010-08-10 ] Interestingly enough, the Korean name for the character Bowser/Kuppa is not Gukbap, but [ ko 쿠파 ] Kupa, which is essentially a phonetic round-trip translation. [ http://www.nintendo.co.kr/DS/soft/mariokart/mariokart_character.php Characters in Mario Kart DS at Nintendo of Korea&apos;s website Nintendo.co.kr 2010-08-10 ] The name was anglicized Kuppa rather than Koopa in the Japanese versions up until the release of Super Mario World. [ Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development Nintendo Co., Ltd. 23 October 1988 Family Computer Japanese ending ] [ Super Mario World Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development Nintendo Co., Ltd. 21 November 1990 Japanese ending ] In the &apos;&apos;Super Mario Bros.&apos;&apos; film, Bowser, known as King Koopa in that adaption, was portrayed by Dennis Hopper. In the film, King Koopa appears as human-like, but with reptilian features (such as a long, slithering tongue, and a lack of body hair). The climax of the film sees Koopa devolve into an enomorous Tyrannosaur to battle the Mario Bros. [ http://www.smbmovie.com/SMBArchive/specials/interviews/2_JeffGoodwin_3-30-09.html Super Mario Bros. The Movie Archive Smbmovie.com 2009-03-30 2010-08-10 ] [ Characteristics ] Bowser is portrayed as the &quot; King of the Koopas &quot;, anthropomorphic turtles that inhabit the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser differs greatly from the rest of his clan, who appear mainly as bipedal tortoises. His iconic features include a large, spiked shell, horns, and a shock of red hair. Bowser is physically powerful, can breathe fire, and is said to have skills in black magic. Bowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own hellish realm. He is infatuated with Princess Peach, [ Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Strategy Guide ] [ Paper Mario Intelligent Systems ] [ Super Paper Mario Intelligent Systems ] and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination. Sometimes, however, he kidnaps Peach to simply lure Mario into a trap. The character&apos;s role in the series varies. He is typically the main villain of the story, but in the RPG series, he sometimes works with the heroes to defeat a greater evil. { Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga, and Super Paper Mario. } The RPGs also portray Bowser in a more humorous light as a blustering, buffoonish bully with a hidden softer side. Bowser also has his very own castle. Named Bowser&apos;s Castle, Bowser can summon his minions in order to take over the Mushroom Kingdom in the main story but in the spin-off games, it can be a racing track, a tennis court, or a baseball stadium. He also has eight children, the Koopalings and Bowser Jr. [ Appearances ] [ In video games ] [ Super Mario series ] Bowser&apos;s first appearance was in Super Mario Bros. as the main villain who kidnaps Princess Peach and as the final boss with several false versions of him appearing as lesser bosses. He reappears in Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, which uses the same battle style. He appears in Super Mario Bros. 3, and along with his seven children, the Koopalings, he transforms the kings of seven worlds into various different creatures and eventually capturing Princess Peach yet again. Bowser and his seven underlings reappear in Super Mario World, where they conquer Dinosaur Land and kidnap Peach while she and Mario are on vacation on Yoshi&apos;s Island. He makes his first 3D appearance in Super Mario 64, where he takes over Peach&apos;s castle and steals 105 of the 120 Power Stars, scattering them through various worlds linked using the castle (this ups to 150 in Super Mario 64 DS ). He returns in Super Mario Sunshine, in which his youngest, but favorite son, Bowser Jr., who is disguised as an evil version of Mario, kidnaps Peach. Bowser himself eventually appears in the final boss battle of the game. In New Super Mario Bros., Bowser is the boss of the first world, which features a battle similar to that of Super Mario Bros. After being defeated, he falls into lava and transforms into a skeletal version of himself known as Dry Bowser. He is eventually restored by Bowser Jr. and acts as the final world&apos;s boss along with his son. In Super Mario Galaxy, Bowser steals Power Stars from Rosalina&apos;s Comet Observatory and kidnaps Peach, taking her to the center of the universe to recreate it, with the intention of taking over the universe. He also appears in New Super Mario Bros. Wii as the final boss and primary antagonist of the game. After being defeated at the end, he grows to a much greater size, chasing Mario through the castle before Mario defeats him again. Bowser appears in the sequel Super Mario Galaxy 2, once again as the main villain. Here, however, Bowser has grown to giant size, requiring the player to dodge more powerful attacks such as meteors and electricity bolts. Bowser also appears in Super Mario 3D Land as the main villain once again where he steals Peach and use the Super Leaf to create tailed minions. Dry Bowser also returns in this game as well. Bowser appears as a child in various games. Known as Baby Bowser, he antagonizes the Baby Mario brothers and various members of the Yoshi species. He first appears in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&apos;s Island where Kamek predicts the brothers will become problems in the future, so he attempts to kidnap them. He appears yet again in the sequel Yoshi&apos;s Story, stealing the &quot; Super Happy Tree &quot; from a group of Yoshis. He appeared yet again in Yoshi&apos;s Island DS as a playable character to recover his castle. [ Other games ] { Mario Party 9 &apos;&apos;, battling against } { Mario, } { Wario, } { Peach, and } { Yoshi. } Bowser makes various appearances in the Mario RPGs. In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, he allies with Mario to regain his castle, which is stolen by the main antagonist, Smithy. In Paper Mario, he is the primary antagonist, stealing an item called the Star Rod and using it to empower himself. He is a lesser antagonist in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and a minor playable character, and is a major playable character in the sequel Super Paper Mario. He plays minor antagonistic and supporting roles in Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga, where he aides Mario and Luigi in battling the witch Cackletta, losing his memory at one point and being possessed by Cackletta&apos;s spirit at another. Its sequel, Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time, features both Bowser and Baby Bowser as minor antagonists. In Super Princess Peach, he uses the power of the Vibe Scepter to capture Mario and Luigi (prompting Princess Peach herself to come to their rescue). His most recent RPG appearance was in Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&apos;s Inside Story, where he is one of the three main characters and is often cited as the starring character. Although he is also a villain in that game, he is also playable and can serve as a hero in some parts of the RPG. Bowser appears as a playable character in the Mario Kart series and various Mario sport titles, such as Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, and Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games with its sequels Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games and Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games where he is one of the two main villains (with Dr. Eggman ) in the Adventure Mode (Nintendo DS version only). In the Adventure Tour, he and Dr. Eggman plan to make their own Olympic Winter Games by capturing the Star Spirits. In the game&apos;s climax, he and Eggman serve as the final bosses. He also appears frequently in the &apos;&apos;Mario Party&apos;&apos; series as both a playable and non-playable character. Bowser is a selectable character within Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A form not featured in any other game is called &quot; Giga Bowser &quot;, a darker and more monstrous form with added power elements to his attacks. This form is an unplayable boss character in Melee Adventure Mode, whilst in Brawl, it serves as a playable transformation with the Final Smash. [ In other media ] Bowser&apos;s first appearance in any Mario media outside the games was in the Mario anime film Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!, in which he is voiced by Akiko Wada. He then appeared in the Super Mario Bros. 3 OVA films. His first American appearances were as the antagonist in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario World which were all produced by DIC Entertainment productions, in which he is voiced by Harvey Atkin and the character is typically referred to as &quot; King Koopa &quot; rather than Bowser. His appearance in the cartoon was also different his video game appearances. In the cartoon he had green skin and lacked his red hair and ability to breathe fire, although he did keep his magic wand. Bowser also hosted his very own show entitled King Koopa&apos;s Kool Kartoons, which debuted in 1989. On this half-hour program, Bowser gives away prizes to the children. Bowser also appears as the antagonist in the Mario comics published as part of the Nintendo Comics System. In the &apos;&apos;Super Mario Bros.&apos;&apos; film, his character was split into 2, the main villain played by the late Dennis Hopper called &quot; King Koopa &quot; who usurped the throne of the parallel-universe city of Dinohattan (the film&apos;s version of the Mushroom Kingdom) from the rightful &quot; King Bowser &quot; (played by Lance Henriksen ) who he devolved into fungus for most of the film. Rather than a turtle, Koopa was a humanoid evolved from dinosaurs. Koopa is killed in the climax when Mario and Luigi devolve him first into a Tyrannosaurus Rex and then into primordial slime. Bowser was played by the late Christopher Hewett in the 1989 Ice Capades. Bowser also appeared in the CD-i game Hotel Mario as a final boss in the last hotel in the game. Bowser appeared in the Annoying Orange episode Super Mario. The film version of Bowser was met with significant criticism, even being mentioned by the actor who portrays him, Dennis Hopper, as the worst role he has ever played on Late Night with Conan O&apos;Brien.
