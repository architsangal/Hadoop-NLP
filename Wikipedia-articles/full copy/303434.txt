[ Constitution and Bylaws of the United Church of Christ UCC http://www.ucc.org/about-us/constitution-of-the-ucc.html#LOCAL 2010-01-22 ] Within this locally-focused structure, however, there are central beliefs common to the UCC. The UCC often uses four words to describe itself: &quot; Christian, Reformed, Congregational and Evangelical &quot;. [ What is the United Church of Christ? A brief history UCC http://i.ucc.org/StretchYourMind/UCC101/BriefHistoryoftheUCC/tabid/93/Default.aspx 2010-01-22 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] While the UCC refers to its evangelical characteristics, it springs from (and is considered part of) mainline Protestantism as opposed to Evangelicalism. The UCC is generally theologically liberal, and the denomination notes that the &quot; Bible, though written in specific historical times and places, still speaks to us in our present condition &quot;. The motto of the United Church of Christ comes from John 17:21 : &quot; That they may all be one &quot;. The denomination&apos;s official literature uses broad doctrinal parameters, emphasizing freedom of individual conscience and local church autonomy. [ Historic confessions ] In the United Church of Christ, creed s, confessions, and affirmations of faith function as &quot; testimonies of faith &quot; around which the church gathers rather than as &quot; tests of faith &quot; rigidly prescribing required doctrinal consent. As expressed in the United Church of Christ constitution: The United Church of Christ acknowledges as its sole Head, Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior. It acknowledges as kindred in Christ all who share in this confession. It looks to the Word of God in the Scriptures, and to the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, to prosper its creative and redemptive work in the world. It claims as its own the faith of the historic Church expressed in the ancient creeds and reclaimed in the basic insights of the Protestant Reformers. It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord&apos;s Supper or Holy Communion. The denomination, therefore, looks to a number of historic confessions as expressing the common faith around which the church gathers, including: The Apostles&apos; Creed, The Nicene Creed, The Heidelberg Catechism (inherited from both the German Reformed and German Evangelical heritages), Luther&apos;s Small Catechism (inherited from the German Evangelical heritage), The Kansas City Statement of Faith (a 1913 statement in the Congregationalist tradition), The Evangelical Catechism (a 1927 catechism in the German Evangelical tradition), and The Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ (written at the founding of the denomination).

Among the results of this were findings that in the UCC, 5.6% of the churches responding to the survey described their members as &quot; very liberal or progressive, &quot; 3.4% as &quot; very conservative, &quot; 22.4% as &quot; somewhat liberal or progressive, &quot; and 23.6% as &quot; somewhat conservative. &quot; Those results suggested a nearly equal balance between liberal and conservative congregations. The self-described &quot; moderate &quot; group, however, was the largest at 45%. Other statistics found by the Hartford Institute show that 53.2% of members say &quot; the Bible &quot; is the highest source of authority, 16.1% say the &quot; Holy Spirit, &quot; 9.2% say &quot; Reason, &quot; 6.3% say &quot; Experience, &quot; and 6.1% say &quot; Creeds. &quot; David Roozen, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research who has studied the United Church of Christ, said surveys show the national church&apos;s pronouncements are often more liberal than the views in the pews but that its governing structure is set up to allow such disagreements.

They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an “entry into the Church Universal” was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize. While clergy emphasized Holy Communion as “a meal in which we encounter God’s living presence,” laity emphasized “a remembrance of Jesus’ last supper, death, and resurrection.” [ Relationships with other denominations ] One of the UCC&apos;s central beliefs is that it is &quot; called to be a united and uniting church. &quot; [ What we believe UCC http://www.ucc.org/about-us/what-we-believe.html 2010-01-22 ] Because of this, the UCC is involved in Churches Uniting in Christ, an organization seeking to establish full communion among nine Protestant denominations in America. [ Ecumenical partnerships and relationships of full communion UCC http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/ecumenical-partnerships-and.html 2010-01-22 ] Currently, the UCC has entered into an ecumenical partnership with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (USA), and the Reformed Church in America.

This includes membership in the National Muslim-Christian Initiative. { http://www.ucc.org/synod/pdfs/REPORT-From-the-Committee-on-Ecumenical-and-Interfaith-Relations.pdf } [ Structure ] Quoting the United Church of Christ Constitution, &quot; The basic unit of the life and organization of the United Church of Christ is the local church. &quot; An interplay of wider interdependence with local autonomy characterizes the organization of the UCC. Each &quot; setting &quot; of the United Church of Christ relates covenantally with other settings, their actions speaking &quot; to but not for &quot; each other. The ethos of United Church of Christ organization is considered &quot; covenantal. &quot; The structure of UCC organization is a mixture of the congregational and presbyterian polities of its predecessor denominations. With ultimate authority on most matters given to the local church, many see United Church of Christ polity as closer to congregationalism; however, with ordination and pastoral oversight conducted by Associations, and General Synod representation given to Conferences instead of congregational delegates, certain presbyterian similarities are also visible. [ Local churches ] { First Congregational Church of } { Long Beach, California, a local church of the United Church of Christ. } The basic unit of the United Church of Christ is the local church (also often called the congregation). Local churches have the freedom to govern themselves, establishing their own internal organizational structures and theological positions. Thus, local church governance varies widely throughout the denomination. Some congregations, mainly of Congregational or Christian origin, have numerous relatively-independent &quot; boards &quot; that oversee different aspects of church life, with annual or more frequent meetings (often conducted after a worship service on a Sunday afternoon) of the entire congregation to elect officers, approve budgets and set congregational policy. Other churches, mainly of Evangelical and Reformed descent, have one central &quot; church council &quot; or &quot; consistory &quot; that handles most or all affairs in a manner somewhat akin to a Presbyterian session, while still holding an annual congregational meeting for the purpose of electing officers and/or ratifying annual budgets. Still others, probably those congregations started after the 1957 merger, have structures incorporating aspects of both, or other alternative organizational structures entirely. In almost all cases, though, the selection of a minister for the congregation is, in keeping with the Reformed tradition of the &quot; priesthood of all believers, &quot; vested in a congregational meeting, held usually after a special ad hoc committee searches on the congregation&apos;s behalf for a candidate. Members of the congregation vote for or against the committee&apos;s recommended candidate for the pastorate, usually immediately after the candidate has preached a &quot; trial sermon; &quot; candidates are usually presented one at a time and not as a field of several to be selected from. Typically the candidate must secure anywhere from 60 to 90 percent affirmative votes from the membership before the congregation issues a formal call to the candidate; this depends on the provisions in the congregation&apos;s particular constitution and/or by-laws. Local churches have, in addition to the freedom to hire ministers and lay staff, the sole power to dismiss them also. However, unlike purely congregational polities, the association has the main authority to ordain clergy and grant standing to clergy coming to a church from another association or another denomination (this authority is exercised &quot; in cooperation with &quot; the person being ordained/called and the local church that is calling them). Such standing, among other things, permits a minister to participate in the UCC clergy pension and insurance plans. Local churches are usually aided in searching for and calling ordained clergy through a denominationally-coordinated &quot; search-and-call &quot; system, usually facilitated by staff at the conference level. However, the local church may, for various reasons, opt not to avail itself of the conference placement system, and is free to do so without fear of retaliation, which would likely occur in synodical or presbyterian polities. Participation in the process, though, is usually a sign of the congregation&apos;s loyalty to the larger denomination and its work. At the end of 2008, 5,320 churches were reported to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches were reported to have over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members. [ http://www.ucc.org/research/ Research Services ucc.org 2010-05-19 ] The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination&apos;s declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church&apos;s size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, as they once were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC&apos;s congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as might happen in a more hierarchical denominational structure. [ Larger organizations ] [ Associations ] [ Associations of the United Church of Christ ] Local churches are typically gathered together in regional bodies called Associations. Local churches often give financial support to the association to support its activities. The official delegates of an association are all ordained clergy within the bounds of the association together with lay delegates sent from each local church. The association&apos;s main ecclesiastical function is to provide primary oversight and authorization of ordained and other authorized ministers; it also is the ecclesiastical link between the local congregation and the larger UCC. The association ordains new ministers, holds ministers&apos; standing in covenant with local churches, and is responsible for disciplinary action; typically a specific ministerial committee handles these duties. Also, an association, again with the assistance of the ministerial committee, admits and removes local congregations from membership in the UCC. Associations meet at least once annually to elect officers and board members and set budgets for the association&apos;s work; fellowship and informational workshops are often conducted during those meetings, which may take place more frequently according to local custom. In a few instances where there is only one association within a conference, or where the associations within a conference have agreed to dissolve, the Conference (below) assumes the association&apos;s functions. [ Conferences ] [ Conferences of the United Church of Christ ] Local churches also are members of larger Conferences, of which there are 38 in the United Church of Christ. A conference typically contains multiple associations; if no associations exist within its boundaries, the conference exercises the functions of the association as well. Conferences are supported financially through local churches&apos; contribution to &quot; Our Church&apos;s Wider Mission &quot; (formerly &quot; Our Christian World Mission &quot; ), the United Church of Christ&apos;s denominational support system; unlike most associations, they usually have permanent headquarters and professional staff. The primary ecclesiastical function of a conference is to provide the primary support for the search-and-call process by which churches select ordained leadership; the conference minister and/or his or her associates perform this task in coordination with the congregation&apos;s pulpit search committee (see above) and the association to which the congregation belongs (particularly its ministerial committee). Conferences also provide significant programming resources for their constituent churches, such as Christian education resources and support, interpretation of the larger UCC&apos;s mission work, and church extension within their bounds (the latter usually conducted in conjunction with the national Local Church Ministries division). Conferences, like associations, are congregationally representative bodies, with each local church sending ordained and lay delegates. Most current UCC conferences were formed in the several years following the consummation of the national merger in 1961, and in some instances were the unions of former Congregational Christian conferences (led by superintendents) and Evangelical and Reformed synods (led by presidents, some of whom served only on a part-time basis). A few have had territorial adjustments since then; only one conference, the Calvin Synod, composed of Hungarian-heritage Reformed congregations, received exemption from the geographical alignments, with its churches scattered from Connecticut westward to California and southward to Florida. Only one conference has ever withdrawn completely from the denomination: Puerto Rico, expressing disapproval of national UCC tolerance of homosexuality (as well as that of a large number of mainland congregations), departed the denomination in 2006, taking all of its churches. [ General Synod ] [ Resolutions of the United Church of Christ ] The denomination&apos;s churchwide deliberative body is the General Synod, which meets every two years. The General Synod consists of delegates elected from the Conferences (distributed proportionally by conference size) together with the boards of directors of each of the four covenanted ministries (see below, under National Offices). While General Synod provides the most visible voice of the &quot; stance of the denomination &quot; on any particular issue, the covenantal polity of the denomination means that General Synod speaks to local churches, associations, and conferences, but not for them. Thus, the other settings of the church are allowed to hold differing views and practices on all non-constitutional matters. General Synod considers three kinds of resolutions: Resolutions of Witness: A Resolution of Witness is an expression of the General Synod concerning a moral, ethical, or religious matter confronting the church, the nation, or the world, adopted for the guidance of the officers, Associated, or Affiliated Ministries, or other bodies as defined in Article VI of the Bylaws of the United Church of Christ; the consideration of local churches, Associations, Conferences, and other bodies related to the United Church of Christ; and for a Christian witness to the world. It represents agreement by at least two-thirds of the delegates voting that the view expressed is based on Christian conviction and is a part of their witness to Jesus Christ. Prudential Resolutions: A Prudential Resolution establishes policy, institutes or revises structure or procedures, authorizes programs, approves directions, or requests actions by a majority vote. Other Formal Motions [ National offices: covenanted, affiliated, and associated ministries ] As agents of the General Synod, the denomination maintains national offices comprising four &quot; covenanted ministries &quot;, one &quot; associated ministry &quot;, and one &quot; affiliated ministry &quot;. The current system of national governance was adopted in 1999 as a restructure of the national setting, consolidating numerous agencies, boards, and &quot; instrumentalities &quot; that the UCC, in the main, had inherited from the Congregational Christian Churches at the time of merger, along with several created during the denomination&apos;s earlier years. [ Covenanted ministries ] These structures carry out the work of the General Synod and support the local churches, associations, and conferences. The head executives of these ministries comprise the five member Collegium of Officers, which are the non-hierarchical official officers of the denomination. (The Office of General Ministries is represented by both the General Minister, who serves as President of the denomination, and the Associate General minister). According the UCC office of communication press release at the time of restructure, &quot; In the new executive arrangement, the five will work together in a Collegium of Officers, meeting as peers. This setting is designed to provide an opportunity for mutual responsibility and reporting, as well as ongoing assessment of UCC programs. &quot; The main offices of the Covenanted ministries are at the &quot; Church House &quot;, the United Church of Christ national headquarters at 700 Prospect Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio. The Office of General Ministries (OGM) is responsible for administration, common services (technology, physical plant, etc.), covenantal relations (ecumenical relations, formal relations to other settings of the church), financial development, and &quot; proclamation, identity and communication &quot;. The current General Minister and President is the Rev. Dr. Geoffrey Black and the current Associate General Minister is Mr. W. Mark Clark. Local Church Ministries (LCM) is responsible for evangelism, stewardship and church finance, worship and education, Pilgrim Press and United Church Resources (the publishing house of the United Church of Christ), and parish life and leadership (authorization, clergy development, seminary relations, parish leadership, etc.). The current Executive Minister of Local Church Ministries is the Rev. J. Bennett Guess. Wider Church Ministries (WCM) is responsible for partner relations* (relations with churches around the world, missionary work, etc.), local church relations* (as relates to world ministries and missions), global sharing of resources, health and wholeness ministry, and global education and advocacy*. The starred &apos;*&apos; ministries are carried out through the Common Global Ministries Board, a joint instrumentality of the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The current Executive Minister for Wider Church Ministries is the Rev. Rev. Jim Moos. Justice and Witness Ministries (JWM) is responsible for ministries related to economic justice, human rights, justice for women and transformation, public life and social policy, and racial justice. In addition to its offices in Cleveland, JWM also maintains an office on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The current Executive Minister for Justice and Witness Ministries is Rev. M. Linda Jaramillo. JWM also maintains an office called &quot; Minister for Children, Families and Human Sexuality Advocacy &quot; that promotes the Our Whole Lives sex education curriculum. [ Affiliated ministry ] The Pension Boards of the United Church of Christ (PB-UCC) operates the employee benefits systems for all settings of the United Church of Christ, including health, dental, and optical insurance, retirement annuity/pension systems, disability and life insurance, and ministerial assistance programs. The Pension Boards offices are located in New York City, where the headquarters of all UCC national bodies had been located prior to their move to Ohio in the early 1990s. [ Associated ministry ] United Church Funds (UCF), formerly known as The United Church Foundation, provides low cost, socially responsible, professionally managed Common Investment Funds (CIFs) and other trustee services to any setting of the United Church of Christ. United Church Funds&apos; offices are also located in New York City.

One calls for the use of economic leverage to promote peace in the Middle East, which can include measures such as government lobbying, selective investment, shareholder lobbying, and selective divestment from companies which profit from the continuing Israel-Palestine conflict. The other resolution, named &quot; Tear Down the Wall &quot;, calls upon Israel to remove the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank. Opponents of the &quot; Tear Down the Wall &quot; resolution have noted that the wall&apos;s purpose is to prevent terrorist attacks, and that the resolution does not call for a stop to these attacks. The Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that the July 2005 UCC resolutions on divestment from Israel were &quot; functionally anti-Semitic &quot;. { Simon WIESENTHAL Center. } The Anti-Defamation League stated that those same resolutions are &quot; disappointing and disturbing &quot; and &quot; deeply troubling &quot;. { Anti-Defamation League. } In addition to the concerns raised about the merits of the &quot; economic leverage &quot; resolution, additional concerns were raised about the process in which the General Synod approved the resolution.

Thomas expressing concern &quot; with the precedent-setting implications of voted actions, integrity of process and trust. &quot; [ Sex Education ] The United Church of Christ, along with the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations created several sexual education classes designed for many different age groups.

Nonetheless, some critics, mainly social and theological conservatives, are vocal about the UCC&apos;s theology, political identity, and cultural milieu. [ Theological criticism ] More conservative members of the UCC have complained that the UCC has lost members because of its &quot; theological surrender to the moral and spiritual confusion of contemporary culture. &quot; [ An Introduction to the Biblical Witness Fellowship 1983 http://www.biblicalwitness.org/introduction.htm 2010-01-22 ] This movement has focused its complaints on the &quot; often radically liberal political agenda &quot; of the UCC. [ Social criticism ] Conservatives have complained that UCC members are &quot; probably the most left-leaning of all major U.S. denominations. &quot; [ Tooley Mark Religious Left Voter Guides Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy 2008-09-16 http://www.theird.org/Page.aspx?pid%3D782 2010-01-23 ] These critics have complained that the UCC attempts to control &quot; how liberal Christians should think in politically correct terms about climate controversies, socialized medicine, the U.S. presence in Iraq, immigration and the Welfare State. &quot; [ Criticism over same-sex marriage ] The UCC has been severely criticized for its stand on same-sex marriage. In fact, citing differences over &quot; the membership and ministry of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Christians &quot;, the UCC&apos;s Puerto Rico Conference left the church in 2006. [ Puerto Rico Church Leaves UCC Over Gay Policies Christian Post Associated Press 2006-06-23 http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060623/puerto-rico-church-leaves-ucc-over-gay-policies/index.html 2010-01-23 ] Most of the congregation departed Grace Community United Church of Christ in Minnesota when the pastor announced his support for same sex marriage. { http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/05/28/pastor-supports-gay-rights-may-lose-church/ } [ Criticism of sex education ] Critics have complained that the UCC&apos;s focus on sex education, including the distribution of condoms, does not provide appropriate moral context for sex and has failed in &quot; reinforcing the traditional Christian ethic reserving sex for marriage. &quot; [ United Church of Christ Ad Masks Decline Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy 2008-04-02 http://www.theird.org/Page.aspx?pid%3D611 2010-01-23 ] [ Sources of criticism ] The Institute on Religion and Democracy has been consistently critical of the UCC, complaining that the denomination &quot; is stuck in the liberal theology and politics of the 1960s &quot; and makes conservatives feel unwelcome. [ Pass the Offering Plate, Take a Condom United Church of Christ Promotes Contraceptive Distribution in the Sanctuary Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy 2009-03-25 http://www.theird.org/Page.aspx?pid%3D979 2010-01-23 ] Internal critics have also complained that the UCC has &quot; set on a course of dishonest political activism &quot; without the knowledge of the local congregations. [ Hutchins James http://www.ucctruths.com/blog/thepoint.htm The Point 2010-01-23 ] Outcries have been so strong among conservative congregations that they have ended their affiliations with the denomination, in many cases terminating decades of association with one of the UCC&apos;s four major traditions. This became especially pronounced in the months following the decision of General Synod 25 to endorse same-sex marriage. Three denominations have in particular been beneficiaries of their decisions: the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (founded in the late 1950s in opposition to the UCC merger), the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (founded in the 1940s as a more conservative alternative), and the Evangelical Association of Reformed and Congregational Christian Churches (founded in the 1990s, mostly by E &amp; R-heritage churches). However, quite a number of withdrawing congregations have decided to operate independently, influenced perhaps by the recent growth and success of non-denominational fellowships throughout the U.S. Still other congregations have decided to remain in the denomination but withhold financial support for &quot; Our Church&apos;s Wider Mission &quot; (OCWM). They say their goal is to avoid funding conference and national programs and policies they find objectionable. Many of those churches are openly affiliated with two conservative &quot; renewal &quot; organizations, the Biblical Witness Fellowship and the North Carolina -based Faithful and Welcoming group, both of which have tried, largely unsuccessfully, to lobby the General Synod (and some conferences) to renounce politically and theologically liberal stances on a number of issues. However, some individuals and families have deserted those congregations remaining loyal to the UCC, in favor of more theologically and politically moderate mainline churches or conservative evangelical congregations. Even so, it was reported at General Synod 2011 that 175 new churches joined the UCC in the two previous years, which amounts to more than any similar time period in the last 40 years. The new churches represent new church starts as well as existing churches who were either previously associated with other denominations, or even independent. It remains to be seen whether these new congregations will help the denomination arrest its gradual numerical decline in membership. [ Barack Obama and the UCC ] A controversy arose over Obama speaking at UCC gatherings, but the IRS found that the UCC had adhered to the prohibition against churches campaigning for political candidates. In 2007, US Presidential candidate and longtime UCC member Barack Obama spoke at the UCC&apos;s Iowa Conference meeting and at the General Synod 26. { One week before Synod speech, Obama addresses UCC&apos;s Iowa Conference } A complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service alleged that the UCC promoted Obama&apos;s candidacy by having him speak at those meetings. { The American Spectator } Barry Lynn, an ordained UCC minister and the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, stated that although he personally would not have invited a Presidential candidate to speak at the meetings, he believed &quot; the Internal Revenue Service permits this to happen. &quot; { OneNewsNow.com - Your News Right Now } The church had consulted lawyers prior to the event to make sure they were following the law and had instructed those in attendance that no Obama campaign material would be allowed in the meeting. Nevertheless, in February 2008, the IRS sent a letter to the church stating that it was launching an inquiry into the matter. { The Associated Press: IRS Investigates Obama&apos;s Denomination } On February 27, 2008, in an open letter to UCC members, Rev. John H. Thomas announced the creation of The UCC Legal Fund, to aid in the denomination&apos;s defense against the IRS. { The United Church of Christ: Support the UCC&apos;s legal defense against the IRS } While the denomination expected legal expenses to surpass six figures, it halted donations after raising $59,564 in less than a week. In May 2008, the IRS issued a letter which states that the UCC had taken appropriate steps and that the denomination&apos;s tax status was not in jeopardy. { The United Church of Christ: Search results for 59,564 } [ Membership ] At the time of its formation, the UCC had over 2 million members in nearly 7,000 churches. [ http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1463.asp Historic Archive CD and Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches The National Council of Churches 2009-12-18 ] The denomination has suffered a 44 percent loss in membership since the mid-1960s.

In 2006, the UCC had roughly 1.2 million members in 5,452 churches. According to its 2008 annual report, the United Church of Christ has about 1.1 million members in about 5,300 local congregations. [ http://www.ucc.org/about-us/2008-annual-report.html 2008 Annual Report ucc.org 2009-07-05 ] However the 2010 report confirms that there has been a decline of 31 thousand members and a loss of 33 congregations since then. However, positive trends like the large number of new congregations mentioned above could well stop the continual decline, and possibly bring about an increase for the first time in nearly a half-century. Membership is concentrated primarily in the Northeast and Midwest, the two regions of the U.S. where population has declined the strongest since the denomination&apos;s inception (in many cases, people departing those regions moved to areas where the denomination was not ready available, such as much of the South and Southwest, and had to affiliate, out of necessity, with other mainline traditions). Pennsylvania, a bastion of the German Reformed tradition, has the largest number of members and churches. As of 2000, the state had over 700 congregations and over 200,000 members.
