The VII Corps of the United States Army was one of the two principal corps of the army in Europe during the Cold War, along with V Corps. Activated in 1918, it was subordinate to the Seventh Army, or USAREUR, throughout most of its existence and headquartered at Kelley Barracks in Stuttgart, West Germany, until deactivated in 1992. [ History ] [ World War and Cold War ] Captured Iraqi Tank at former VII Corps Cold War HQ, Kelley Barracks. Organized at the end of World War I on 19 August 1918, at Remiremont, France, its first re-entry into Europe took place on D-Day in 1944, as one of the two assault corps for US First Army during Operation Overlord. Subsequently, the unit participated in many battles during the advance across France and Germany until the surrender of the Third Reich. Throughout the Cold War, the corps guarded part of NATO &apos;s front with the Warsaw Pact. After Saddam Hussein &apos;s troops invaded Kuwait in 1990, the corps was deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of the second major wave of deployments of American forces. Its presence took US forces in theatre from a force capable of defending Saudi Arabia to a force capable of ejecting Iraq i troops from Kuwait. [ Corps Commanders During Cold War and Gulf War ] Maj.

Normally, a corps commands three divisions when at full strength, along with other units such as artillery of various types, corps-level engineers and support units. However, VII Corps had far more firepower under its command. Its principal full strength fighting formations were U.S. 1st Armored Division, U.S. 3rd Armored Division and U.S. 1st Infantry Division. In addition, the Corps had U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment to act as a scouting force, and two further heavy divisions; US 1st Cavalry Division and British 1st Armoured Division, as well as the U.S. 11th Aviation Group. Although both 1st Cavalry Division and 1st Armoured Division had only two maneuver brigades, they were still immensely powerful formations in their own right. VII corps was originally deployed to give the CinC an offensive option if needed. In the 100 hour war they were given a force mission: To wipe out the Iraqi Republican Guards Heavy Divisions. That meant that the 1st Infantry Division had to make a forced entry to make room for the British attack on the right wing and to secure the main forces advance on the left. That attack force was led by the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment followed by the 1st Armored Division and the 3rd Armored Division. That main force was later joined by the 1st Infantry Division after they had completed their breach. That gave VII Corps commander General Frederick M. Franks, Jr. a three Division strike force to confront several Iraqi Armored Divisions. After the corp had turned 90 degrees east according to FRAGPLAN 7 and after the Cavalry Regiment had fought the single sided Battle of 73 Easting the three Divisions (plus the British on the right wing) fought one of the most one sided battles in the history of the US Army. VII Corps cut a swathe through Iraqi forces. It advanced with U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps on its left wing and Arab forces on its right wing. It pulverized all Iraqi forces that tried to stand and fight and destroyed a good proportion of the Iraqi Republican Guard divisions. A ceasefire was called before the destruction of the Republican Guard units could be completed. VII Corps attack cost about a hundred US and British soldier lives. But it destroyed several Divisions including the Medina and the Tawalkna Republican guards division along with support units. It also destroyed most of the Iraqi VII Corps that had guarded the frontline as well as other units. The attack was one of the most single sided battles in history of warfare. The Battle of 73 Easting was studied as a textbook armored battle in the US armored units. After the fighting was over most VII Corps units were redeployed directly to the United States for reassignment or retirement. VII Corps HQ returned to Germany and was deactivated in 1992. It was disbanded as part of the post-Cold War American defense spending cuts. [ Battle of Normandy ] [ Allied Chain of Command ] Supreme Allied Commander : Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower VII Corps: Maj.
