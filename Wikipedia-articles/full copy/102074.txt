In the elections they received 4, 2 and 2 seats respectively. Representatives of the blue colored parliamentary groups form the executive coalition. [ Board of executives ] The board of executives ( College van burgemeester en wethouders in Dutch) for 2010-2014 consists of a coalition of SDOH-D66-HB (2 Municipal Executives), CDA (Mayor and 2 Municipal Executives), and VVD (1 Municipal Executive). After elections the parties SDH-OH, CDA, VVD, D66 en Helmondse Belangen reached an agreement to form a right wing coalition. Because CDA would get 2 Municipal Executives, only 3 positions where open, but there were 4 parties left in the coalition. It was decided to merge the parliamentary groups of SDH-OH, D66 and Helmondse Belangen into one group named SDOH-D66-HB. The combination received 2 Municipal Executives, of which one (P.G.M. Tielemans) is a SDH-OH-member and one (J.B.C.W. van den Heuvel) a D66 member. The parliamentary group leader of Helmondse Belangen, Berry Smits, became Parliamentary group leader of the combined group. This way the board holds a 20 of the 37 seats majority in the municipal council.
