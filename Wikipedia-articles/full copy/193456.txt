Between 1 January and 14 January 2011, the kroon circulated together with the euro, after which the euro became the sole legal tender in Estonia.

The word kroon ( [ ˈkroːn est ], crown) is related to that of the Nordic currencies (such as the Swedish krona and the Danish and Norwegian krone ) and derived from the Latin word corona ( &quot; crown &quot; ). The kroon succeeded the mark in 1928 and was in use until the Soviet invasion in 1940, after which it was replaced by the Soviet ruble. After Estonia regained its independence, the kroon was reintroduced in 1992. [ First kroon, 1928–1940 ] [ History ] The kroon became the currency of Estonia on 1 January 1928 after having been a unit of account since 1924. [ Estonian Coinage http://www.worldnotaphily.com/Coinage_Estonia.php European Commission 2010-05-13 ] It replaced the mark at a rate of 100 mark = 1 kroon. The kroon was subdivided into 100 senti. In 1924, the kroon was pegged to the Swedish krona at par, with a gold standard of 2480 kroon = 1 kilogram of pure gold. The standard received real coverage with the reserves backing the kroon. The issue of treasury note s and exchange notes was terminated. In order to secure the credibility of the kroon, the Bank of Estonia exchanged kroon for foreign currency. All these measures restored confidence in the domestic banking and monetary sector, contributing to the economic reinvigoration of the country and to the improvement of the reputation of the Estonian state in the international arena. During the Great Depression in 1933, the kroon went off the gold standard, devalued 35% and obtained a currency peg with the Great Britain Pound (GBP) at 1 GBP = 18.35 kroon. [ http://www.bankofestonia.info/pub/en/yldine/pank/ajalugu/Ajalugu/kronoloogia.html Some facts from the history of Eesti Pank and Estonian finance Bank of Estonia 13 May 2010 ] The Estonian kroon kept this peg and circulated until the Soviet occupation of 1940. The kroon was exchanged for the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 ruble = 0.8 kroon. [ Banknotes and coins ] In 1928, the first coins of this currency were issued, nickel-bronze 25 senti pieces. These were followed by bronze 1 sent in 1929, silver 2 krooni in 1930, bronze 5 senti and nickel-bronze 10 senti in 1931, silver 1 kroon in 1933, bronze 2 senti and aluminium-bronze 1 kroon in 1934, nickel-bronze 20 senti in 1935, nickel-bronze 50 senti in 1936. On 25 July 1940, 4 days after founding of Estonian SSR, the last Estonian pre-WW II coin, new 1 sent (date 1939) was issued. In 1927, before the kroon was officially introduced, 100 marka banknotes circulated with an &quot; ÜKS KROON &quot; (1 kroon) overprint. Eesti Pank introduced 10 krooni notes in 1928, followed by 5 and 50 krooni in 1929, 20 krooni in 1932 and 100 krooni in 1935. [ Second kroon, 1992–2010 ] [ History ] The kroon was reintroduced as Estonia&apos;s currency on 20 June 1992, replacing the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 kroon = 10 rubles. (Each person was able to change maximally 1500 rubles to 150 kroons.) Initially, the Estonian kroon was pegged to the Deutsche Mark at a rate of 8 krooni = 1 Deutsche Mark.

On 27 June 2004, as Estonia joined the ERM II -system, the central parity of the Estonian kroon was revalued (by less than 0.001%) to 15.6466 krooni per euro.
