Pseudoscorpions are generally beneficial to humans since they prey on clothes moth larvae, carpet beetle larvae, booklice, ant s, mite s, and small flies. They are small and inoffensive, and are rarely seen due to their size. [ Characteristics ] Pseudoscorpions are small arachnids with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that resemble those of scorpion s. They usually range from [ 2 to 8 mm 2 in ] in length. { Pennsylvania State University, Department: Entomological Notes: Pseudoscorpion Fact Sheet } The largest known species is Garypus titanius of Ascension Island at up to [ 12 mm 1 on ]. [ Ascension Island Conservation Centre http://www.ascensionconservation.org.ac/pdf/35-O-Endemic-invertebrates-leaflet.pdf Endemic invertebrates ] [ Agricultural Research Council (South Africa) http://www.arc.agric.za/home.asp?PID%3D1%26amp%3BToolID%3D63%26amp%3BItemID%3D1769 Pseudoscorpions ] { Phoretic pseudoscorpion on a fly } The abdomen, known as the opisthosoma, is made up of twelve segments, each protected by plates (called tergite s above and sternite s below) made of chitin. The abdomen is short and rounded at the rear, rather than extending into a segmented tail and stinger like true scorpions (the fact that they look exactly like scorpions, aside from not having a stinger tail, is the source of the name &quot; Pseudoscorpion &quot; ). The color of the body can be yellowish-tan to dark-brown, with the paired claws often a contrasting color. They may have two, four or no eyes. A pseudoscorpion has eight legs with five to seven segments; the number of fused segments is used to distinguish families and genera. They have two very long pedipalp s with palpal chelae (pincers) which strongly resemble the pincers found on a scorpion. The pedipalps generally consist of an immobile &quot; hand &quot; and &quot; finger &quot;, with a separate movable finger controlled by an adductor muscle. A venom gland and duct are usually located in the mobile finger; the poison is used to capture and immobilize the pseudoscorpion&apos;s prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions pour a mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains. Pseudoscorpions spin silk from a gland in their jaws to make disk-shaped cocoon s for mating, molting, or waiting out cold weather. However, they do not have book lungs as most of their closest relatives, the spiders, do. They breathe through spiracle s, a trait they share with the insect s. [ Behavior ] Some species have an elaborate mating dance, where the male pulls a female over a spermatophore previously laid upon a surface. [ Peter Weygoldt 1966 Spermatophore web formation in a pseudoscorpion Science 153 3744 1647–1649 10.1126/science.153.3744.1647 17802636 ] In other species, the male also pushes the sperm into the female genitals using the forelegs.

Up to two dozen young are hatched in a single brood; there may be more than one brood per year. The young go through three molts over the course of several years before reaching adulthood. Many species molt in a small, silken igloo that protects them from enemies during this vulnerable period. [ Ross Piper 2007 Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals Greenwood Press ] After reaching adulthood, pseudoscorpions live two to three years. They are active in the warm months of the year, overwintering in silken cocoons when the weather grows cold. Smaller species live in debris and humus. Some species are arboreal, i.e., live on trees. Some others are phagophile s, eating parasites in an example of cleaning symbiosis. Some species are phoretic. [ http://www.arc.agric.za/home.asp?pid%3D3294 Pseudoscorpions South African National Survey of Arachnids ] They may sometimes be found feeding on mites under the wing covers of certain beetles. [ Distribution ] A book scorpion (&apos;&apos;Chelifer cancroides&apos;&apos;) on top of an open book There are more than 3,300 species of pseudoscorpions recorded in more than 430 genera, with more being discovered on a regular basis. They range worldwide, even in temperate to cold regions like Northern Ontario and above timberline in Wyoming&apos;s Rocky Mountains in the United States and the Jenolan Caves of Australia, but have their most dense and diverse populations in the tropics and subtropics. Species have been found under tree bark, in leaf and pine litter, in soil, in tree hollows, under stones, in caves, at the seashore in the intertidal zone, and within fractured rocks. Chelifer cancroides is the species most commonly found in homes, where they are often observed in rooms with dusty books. There the tiny animals ( [ 2.5 - 4.5 mm 2 on or ] ) can find their food like booklice and house dust mites. They enter homes by &quot; riding along &quot; with larger insects (known as phoresy ), or are brought in with firewood. [ Evolution ] The oldest known fossil pseudoscorpion dates back 380 million years to the Devonian period. [ William A. Shear, Wolfgang Schawaller &amp; Patricia M. Bonamo 1989 Record of Palaeozoic pseudoscorpions Nature 342 6242 527–529 10.1038/341527a0 ] It has all of the traits of a modern pseudoscorpion, indicating that the order evolved very early in the history of land animals. [ 2246/5041 ] [ Historical references ] Pseudoscorpions were first described by Aristotle, who probably found them among scrolls in a library where they would have been feeding on booklice. Robert Hooke referred to a &quot; Land-Crab &quot; in his 1665 work Micrographia. Another reference in the 1780s, when George Adams wrote of: &quot; A lobster-insect, spied by some labouring men who were drinking their porter, and borne away by an ingenious gentleman, who brought it to my lodging. &quot; { Adams, George (1787): Essays on the Microscope.
