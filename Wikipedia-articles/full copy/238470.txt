He is seen as one of the major figures in } { abstract expressionism and one of the foremost of the } { color field painters. } [ Early life ] Newman was born in New York City, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. { The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist&apos;s Life page } He studied philosophy at the City College of New York and worked in his father&apos;s business manufacturing clothing. From the 1930s he made paintings, said to be in an expressionist style, but eventually destroyed all these works. A well-respected writer and critic who also organized exhibitions and wrote catalogs, Newman later became a member of the Uptown Group. [ Career ] [ What is the explanation of the seemingly insane drive of man to be painter and poet if it is not an act of defiance against man&apos;s fall and an assertion that he return to the Garden of Eden? For the artists are the first men. Barnett Newman Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, pg 40 ] Barnett Newman wrote catalogue forewords and reviews before having his first solo show at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Newman remarked in one of the Artists&apos; Session at Studio 35: &quot; We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image. &quot; { Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O&apos;Neill, pgs.: 240-241, University of California Press, 1990. } Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, &quot; Letter to Sidney Janis :...it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it. &quot; { Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O&apos;Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990). } Throughout the 1940s he worked in a surrealist vein before developing his mature style. This is characterised by areas of color separated by thin vertical lines, or &quot; zips &quot; as Newman called them. In the first works featuring zips, the color fields are variegated, but later the colors are pure and flat. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully mature style with the Onement series (from 1948). The zips define the spatial structure of the painting, while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition. The zip remained a constant feature of Newman&apos;s work throughout his life. In some paintings of the 1950s, such as The Wild, which is eight feet tall by one and a half inches wide (2.4 meters by 2 centimeters), the zip is all there is to the work. Newman also made a few sculpture s which are essentially three-dimensional zips. Although Newman&apos;s paintings appear to be purely abstract, and many of them were originally untitled, the names he later gave them hinted at specific subjects being addressed, often with a Jewish theme. Two paintings from the early 1950s, for example, are called Adam and Eve (see Adam and Eve ), and there is also Uriel (1954) and Abraham (1949), a very dark painting, which as well as being the name of a biblical patriarch, was also the name of Newman&apos;s father, who had died in 1947. &apos;&apos;Who&apos;s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue?&apos;&apos;, 1966. Typical of Newman&apos;s later work, with the use of pure and vibrant color. The Stations of the Cross series of black and white paintings (1958–66), begun shortly after Newman had recovered from a heart attack, is usually regarded as the peak of his achievement. The series is subtitled &quot; Lema sabachthani &quot; - &quot; why have you forsaken me &quot; - words spoken by Christ on the cross. Newman saw these words as having universal significance in his own time. The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the holocaust. { Broken Obelisk &apos;&apos; in the } { University of Washington &apos;s } { Red Square } Newman&apos;s late works, such as the Who&apos;s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue series, use vibrant, pure colors, often on very large canvases - Anna&apos;s Light (1968), named in memory of his mother who had died in 1965, is his largest work, 28 feet wide by 9 feet tall (8.5 by 2.7 meters). Newman also worked on shaped canvas es late in life, with Chartres (1969), for example, being triangular, and returned to sculpture, making a small number of sleek pieces in steel. These later paintings are executed in acrylic paint rather than the oil paint of earlier pieces. Of his sculptures, Broken Obelisk (1963) is the most monumental and best-known, depicting an inverted obelisk whose point balances on the apex of a pyramid. Newman also made a series of lithograph s, the 18 Cantos (1963–64) which, according to Newman, are meant to be evocative of music. He also made a small number of etching s. Newman is generally classified as an abstract expressionist on account of his working in New York City in the 1950s, associating with other artists of the group and developing an abstract style which owed little or nothing to European art. However, his rejection of the expressive brushwork employed by other abstract expressionists such as Clyfford Still and Mark Rothko, and his use of hard-edged areas of flat color, can be seen as a precursor to post painterly abstraction and the minimalist works of artists such as Frank Stella. Newman was unappreciated as an artist for much of his life, being overlooked in favour of more colorful characters such as Jackson Pollock. The influential critic Clement Greenberg wrote enthusiastically about him, but it was not until the end of his life that he began to be taken really seriously. He was, however, an important influence on many younger painters. [ Legacy ] Newman died in New York City of a heart attack in 1970. Nine years after his death, Newman&apos;s widow Annalee founded the Barnett Newman Foundation. The Foundation not only functions as his official Estate, but also serves &quot; to encourage the study and understanding of Barnett Newman&apos;s life and works. &quot; { The Barnett Newman Foundation website: About the Foundation page } The Foundation was instrumental in creating Newman&apos;s Catalogue Raisonne in 2004. { The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Catalogue Raisonne page } The U.S. copyright representative for the Barnett Newman Foundation is the Artists Rights Society. { Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society } [ Selected collections ] Among the public collections holding works by Barnett Newman are the Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, Massachusetts), the Allen Memorial Art Museum (Oberlin College, Ohio), the Art Institute of Chicago, the Berlin State Museums, the Cleveland Museum of Art, Harvard University Art Museums, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington D.C.), the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Kawamura Memorial Museum of Art (Japan), Kunstmuseum Basel (Switzerland), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Menil Collection (Houston, Texas), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Madrid), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Nasher Sculpture Center (Dallas, Texas), the Nassau County Museum of Art (Roslyn Harbor, New York), the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Sheldon Museum of Art (Lincoln, Nebraska), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), the Tate Gallery (London), the Wadsworth Atheneum (Hartford, Connecticut), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota), the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum (Cologne, Germany), and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City).
