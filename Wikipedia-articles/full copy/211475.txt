[ Taxonomy ] The family Oriolidae comprises the figbirds in the genus Sphecotheres, and the Old World orioles in the genus Oriolus. [ B Walther P Jones Josep del Hoyo Andrew Elliott David Christie Family Oriolidae (Orioles and Figbirds)] Handbook of the Birds of the World.

For example, the African black-headed species are sometimes placed in the genus Baruffius. In 2011 the genus Turnagra which contained two extinct species from New Zealand, the piopio, were found to be placed within this family.

G. (2012) Molecular and morphological evidences place the extinct New Zealand endemic Turnagra capensis in the Oriolidae. Mol Phylogenet Evol. 62(1):414-26. } The family is not related to the New World oriole s, which are icterid s, family Icteridae. [ Distribution and habitat ] The family is distributed across Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The few temperate nesting species are migratory, and some tropical species also show seasonal movements. Orioles are arboreal and tend to feed in the canopy. Many species are able to survive in open forests and woodlands, although a few are restricted to closed forest. They are opportunistic omnivore s, with the main components of their diet being fruit, berries, and arthropods. [ Description and behaviour ] The orioles and figbirds are medium sized passerines, around 20–30  cm in length, with the females only slightly smaller than the males. The beak is slightly curved and hooked, and, except in the figbirds, as long again as the head. The plumage of most species is bright and showy, although the females often have duller plumage than the males do. The plumage of many Australasian orioles mimics that of friarbird s (a genus of large honeyeater s ), probably to reduce aggression against the smaller orioles. { Diamond J (1982) &quot; Mimicry of friarbirds by orioles &quot; The Auk 99(2): 187-196 } Orioles are monogamous, breeding in territorial pairs (although the Australasian Figbird, and possibly also the other figbirds, breed in loose colonies ). Nesting sites may be chosen near aggressive species such as drongo s, shrike s or friarbirds, which confer a degree of protection. The nest is a deep woven cup suspended like a hammock from a branch. They usually lay two or three eggs, but as many as six have been recorded.
