[ Education and early career ] After completing his service in the IDF, Shalom attended Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, from which he received a BA in Economics as well as a CPA. Certification. During that time, Shalom was elected as the chairman of the university&apos;s students&apos; union and later as the vice chairman of the national students union. He later attended Tel Aviv University, from which he received an LLB law degree as well as an MA in Public Policy.Shalom started as a journalist. While working on his first degree, he began to work as a journalist at the Yediot Aharonot newspaper in the student section. After that he started working in the &quot; Rosh Berosh &quot; magazine and in the Negev&apos;s local newspaper. In 1980 he moved to Tel Aviv and started working at the now-defunct Hadashot newspaper. In 1984, he was appointed as its head political and economical correspondent. [ Politics ] In 1985, Shalom was appointed adviser to the finance minister, Yitzhak Moda&apos;i, who was later appointed justice minister. At the age of 31, he was appointed as the CEO of the energy ministry and two years later, in 1990, he was appointed director in chief of the Israel Electric Company. [ Knesset member ] In 1992, at the age of 34, Shalom was elected as a Knesset member. He was elected on the 34th spot in the Likud list to the Knesset and the party received only 33 seats in the 13th Knesset. After former security minister Moshe Arens resigned, Shalom succeeded in becoming an MK. As a young MK, his first bill was in the academic field. In 1992 there was room for only 100,000 thousand students, with no space for any more students. Shalom acted to allow all the students to get accepted when the reduction of the students would be made at the end of the first year. Due to his bill, awareness has been made to the problem and the Israeli colleges were established. In the year 2010, for the first time, more students started their degree in colleges.Shalom, during his first term was the first male MK to be a member of the committee on the status of women. He was also the chairman of the subcommittee regarding the capital market, chairman of the subcommittee of energy and a member of the economic affairs committee.In 1996, a year after the assassination of p.m. Yitzhak Rabin from the labor party, the Likud, headed by the opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, was united with 2 parties: Gesher and Tzomet and ran in the election against the Labor party, headed by acting P.M. Shimon Peres. The Likud received 32 seats, 2 fewer than the labor party, but due to the direct election of the P.M. at the time of the election, Netanyahu won and became P.M. [ Deputy to the defense minister ] Shalom, who won the 18th spot in the combined list of the three parties, became deputy to the defense minister, Itzhak Morderchai. One of his biggest achievements was in integrating and allowing Hareidi Jews to serve in the army, a step that they have been avoiding in doing for decades. The Hareidi battalion, &quot; Netzach Yehuda &quot;, was established on February 1999 and became independent in 2002. The uniqueness of the battalion is that unlike most soldiers, who serve in the army for 3 years, the &quot; netzach Yehuda &quot; soldiers serve for 2 years and on the 3rd year they go to study in order to allow them to get accepted to a working place and narrowing the gaps in fields which they are lacking knowledge like Math, English and Science. [ Minister of science ] After a rotation with MK Michael Eitan, Shalom, on July 13th 1998, became minister of science. During his year old term in office, he created the &quot; science flowers &quot; project, which helped universities get to the Israeli periphery and helped under privileged students to excel.

[ Mk In the opposition (1999-2001) ] In the 1999 election, the Likud party, headed by the widely unpopular prime minister at the time, Benjamin Netanyahu, was running against the Labor party, headed by Ehud Barak. The labor party won 26 seats in the Knesset, while the Likud party received only 19 seats and lost the election. After the Labor party gained power in 1999 and the resignation of Benjamin Netanyahu, Shalom who reached the 1st place, became part of the opposition, lead by Ariel Sharon. After challenging Netanyahu for party leadership in late 2005 and achieving second place, Shalom was granted the second spot on the Likud list to the 2006 general election and thus did not compete in the 11 January 2006 primaries.
