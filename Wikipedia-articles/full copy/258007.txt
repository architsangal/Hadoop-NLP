The population was 27,472 at the 2010 census. [ http://factfinder2.census.gov Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Harrison town, Westchester County, New York U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder November 15, 2011 ] [ History ] [ Establishment ] Harrison was established in 1696 by John Harrison, who was given 24 hours to ride his horse around an area which would become his, to fill an owe the King had to him. The town gets its name from him. It became a town on March 7, 1788, by an act of the New York State legislature. [ Revolutionary War ] Merritt&apos;s Hill in West Harrison was the site of the Battle of White Plains during the Revolutionary War. Regiment 182 of the Continental Army, of the 367 regiments there, was the Harrison Regiment, composed solely of people from Harrison. [ Old businesses ] During the 1830s, David Haviland settled in Harrison, producing the Haviland China which he sold in his store in New York City, before returning to France. Today there exists a Haviland Street in a neighborhood of Harrison known as The Trails, whose only street marker looks rather quite older than the rest in the town, composed of wrought iron in scrolled shapes. In 1867 Benjamin Holladay purchased the land that is now Manhattanville College in Purchase. On the property is a Norman-style Roman Catholic chapel built for his wife. There is also Reid Castle, once called the Ophir House, before being renamed for a later purchaser. The castle hosted the King and Queen of Siam in the early 1930s. [ June 2011 ] [ Railroads and the Industrial Revolution ] What is now the Metro-North Railroad, running from Manhattan, New York City, to Greenwich, Connecticut, first came through Harrison in 1848, though the first station was not built until 1870. Before that time, Harrisonites had to flag down the train to get a ride. Harrison remained generally free of factories through the Industrial Revolution, while large factory districts grew in the neighboring towns of White Plains, Port Chester and Mamaroneck. In 1929, the Hutchinson River Parkway was extended to Harrison. [ Local culture ] [ Areas within Harrison ] The boundaries of the town of Harrison are the approximate shape of a figure-eight. The southern half is known as simply Harrison, or downtown, while the hamlet of Purchase is located in the northern portion of the town. West Harrison is a neighborhood south of Purchase, further west, bounded by Silver Lake, the Brae Burn Golf Course, and I-287. The &quot; downtown &quot; southern half of Harrison is divided into four general areas: The Brentwood, Sunnyridge, Sterling Ridge/The Trails, and South Downtown. [ Elementary schools ] Harrison has four elementary schools. Purchase School serves Purchase, Preston School serves West Harrison, and Parsons School serves South Downtown. The fourth school, Harrison Avenue School, serves the remaining area of &quot; Downtown &quot;, Sunnyridge, Sterling Ridge/The Trails, and The Brentwood. [ Characteristics of the four areas ] West Harrison is an isolated community, lodged between a tall hill bordered by a lake, Interstate 287, a tall relatively steep hill, and a cliff at the northern edge. Because of this, there is a general lack of street entrances. There is really only one road into it, although there are a few other &quot; back &quot; ways into it. The road is called Lake Street, flanked on one side by Silver Lake Park, bordering the lake, and by a small business district on the other side of the street. West Harrison contains the Passidomo Veterans Memorial Park and Pool and the Leo Mintzer Center. West Harrison also contains the site of the Battle of White Plains from the Revolutionary War. { History } Silver Lake is also the home of Buckout Road, which was said to have been a home of witches, albinos, and slaughters. { BUCKOUT ROAD – history, urban legends, hauntings, ghosts – Westchester County alleged haunted road } Purchase is a more secluded area of Harrison, with winding roads and deep woods. The houses are larger, in often cases whole swatches of land developed in the late twentieth century, and early 2000s, comparing to the age of the rest of the town. [ June 2011 ] Downtown is split into the four sections mentioned above, and is flanked by Interstate 95, the Hutchinson River Parkway, and the Metro-North Railroad. The manmade lines create isolation to areas, with few areas to cross each. Harrison&apos;s only middle school and only High School, Harrison High School, are located in the &quot; downtown &quot; area. As remarked by one realtor, &quot; It seems as though, between the roads, and other stuff, every house in Harrison is noisy from a road, or noisy from a train. &quot; [ November 2011 ] The impression by the statement, however, is incorrect. The four areas of downtown, as separated by the boundaries of Interstate 95 and the railroad tracks as well as separated by wealth gaps, are very diverse. Despite its name, &quot; Downtown &quot; is not in any sense a business district, it is much rather a residential enclave, featuring houses of every wealth level. [ Landmarks in Harrison ] [ Colleges ] The State University of New York at Purchase and Manhattanville College are located in Purchase. In 2008, Fordham University opened its Westchester campus in West Harrison on 32 landscaped acres with a stream and pond. { Westchester Campus and Facilities, Fordham University. Accessed March 19, 2009 } [ Country clubs ] The Westchester Country Club and two private golf courses operated by Westchester County are located in Harrison. All three of them are next to each other in the southern half ( &quot; downtown &quot; ) portion of the town. [ &lt; template type= &quot; anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Cemetaries &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; Cemeteries ] There are several cemeteries in the downtown, including many small family plots dating back to the 17th century and before. Greenwood Union Cemetery is a cemetery shared by the city of Rye. There is also the Small Roman Catholic Cemetery dating back to when Harrison was first discovered in the 17th century. It is located right on the border of Rye and Harrison. This was a domain for Indian burials.

Madden ] Harrison&apos;s &quot; Platinum Mile &quot;, a string of corporate office parks along I-287 in the Purchase section of Harrison, developed under Passidomo. The mayor played an instrumental role in attracting large corporations such as PepsiCo, MasterCard and Texaco. [ Purchase&apos;s attempt to secede from Harrison ] In the early 1970s under Passidomo&apos;s supervisorship, a group in the Purchase section of town, concerned about the town&apos;s over-development, attempted to incorporate as a village and thereby separate from the town of Harrison. Creatively, to avoid being served papers that would have begun the legal proceedings for Purchase to incorporate as a village, Passidomo entered his office through the fire escape. Passidomo then immediately saw to it that the town Harrison became a village while still remaining as a town, putting an end to the possibility of Purchase&apos;s secession since a village cannot legally be formed in another village.
