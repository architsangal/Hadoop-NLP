The railway was built in 1869 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS &amp; LR) and the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR), as a part of a quest to provide an alternative link between Manchester and the south, that was independent of the London and North Western Railway (L &amp; NWR). Thomas Oliver had suggested this route hoping to revive the cotton mills of Bollington, the Kerridge stone quarries as well as the coal fields at Poynton. The line was closed in 1970 because British Rail stated it was not profitable. The trackbed is used for walking, cycling and horseriding; It is known as the Middlewood Way. { Middlewood Way } The Macclesfield Canal that passes through the centre of the town is now part of the Cheshire Ring. The stretch from Marple Junction on the Peak Forest Canal to Bosley is without locks and is carried on an embankment through Kerridge.

Today the canal is used for leisure purposes. [ Media ] Bollington Live! is a publication produced three times a year by a team of volunteer writers, editor and distributors.
