He had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 movie Camp Nowhere. He also reprised his role of Riker for a Next Generation cutaway on an episode of &apos;&apos;Family Guy&apos;&apos; that also featured his co-stars Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn as their respective roles of Picard and Worf. Later, he again played himself on another &apos;&apos;Family Guy&apos;&apos; episode, where the all seven main TNG (plus Wil Wheaton ) actors made voice appearances. He is also one of six Star Trek actors (the other actors being Kate Mulgrew, Michael Dorn, George Takei, Avery Brooks and Majel Barrett ) to lend their voices to the video game Star Trek: Captain&apos;s Chair reprising his role as Commander William T. Riker when users visit the Enterprise-D bridge featured in the game. Frakes is one of only two Star Trek regulars to appear on four different Star Trek series ( Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise ). (The only other regular to match or exceed that number is Majel Barrett-Roddenberry who appeared in all five television series.) He has also directed episodes in three of them (TNG, DS9 and VOY) and was a popular and innovative director on the Star Trek set, often finding completely new ways to shoot the show&apos;s familiar sets. His directing career has included the films Star Trek: First Contact (for which he earned the nickname &quot; Two-Takes Frakes &quot;, because of his efficient directing style) [ February 2012 ] and Star Trek: Insurrection. Additionally, Frakes was an executive producer for the WB series Roswell, directed several episodes and guest-starred in three episodes. His relationship with Star Trek is made light of in the episode &quot; Secrets and Lies &quot;, in which the alien character Max auditions for a guest role as an alien for Star Trek: Enterprise. Frakes appeared on the 1994 Phish album Hoist, playing trombone on the track titled &quot; Riker&apos;s Mailbox &quot;. Frakes would occasionally perform on the trombone during his tenure as Commander Riker, drawing on his college marching band experience. He was also a member of &quot; The Sunspots &quot;, a vocal backup group of Star Trek cast members that appeared on Brent Spiner &apos;s 1991 album Ol&apos; Yellow Eyes Is Back. Frakes hosted Paranormal Borderline, a television series at Fox, which dealt with the paranormal and mysterious happenings and creatures. In one episode, Frakes presented an interview of reporter Yolanda Gaskins with veteran astronaut Gordon Cooper, where they discussed the possibility of aliens having visited the Earth in the past. { http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3Dc Youtube video } { http://www.qtm.net/~geibdan/coop.html &apos;&apos;UFO Folklore Center – Transcript of Interview } Overall, the show was criticized and pulled off the air after it was found out that footage showing a yeti from the Himalayas was purposely faked by the show and its producers. The &quot; Snowwalker &quot; footage, as it is known, purportedly shows a yeti as it is crossing through a valley in the Himalayas, walking in front of a Belgian couple who are traversing the area on skis. The network finally admitted the hoax, and Frakes distanced himself from the show. He hosted Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction which also dealt in the paranormal world. Frakes and Francis appeared together in Lois &amp; Clark in the episode &quot; Don&apos;t Tug on Superman&apos;s Cape &quot; as a creepily too-good-to-be-true couple.
