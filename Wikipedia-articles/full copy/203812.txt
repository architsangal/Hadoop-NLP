[ Description ] Juvenile Great Crested Grebe with adult Head of a young Great Crested Grebe with characteristic stripes The Great Crested Grebe is [ 46 – 51 cm in ] long with a [ 59 – 73 cm in ] wingspan. It is an excellent swimmer and diver, and pursues its fish prey underwater. The adults are unmistakable in summer with head and neck decorations. In winter, this is whiter than most grebes, with white above the eye, and a pink bill. It is the largest European grebe. The young are distinctive because their heads are striped black and white. They lose these markings when they become adults. [ Distribution ] The Great Crested Grebe breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes. The subspecies P. c. cristatus is found across Europe and Asia. It is resident in the milder west of its range, but migrates from the colder regions. It winters on freshwater lakes and reservoirs or the coast. The Africa n subspecies P. c. infuscatus and the Australasia n subspecies P. c. australis are mainly sedentary. [ Behaviour ] An adult with two fish ready to feed its young in Scotland The Great Crested Grebe has an elaborate mating display. Like all grebes, it nests on the water&apos;s edge, since its legs are set relatively far back and it is thus unable to walk very well. Usually two egg s are laid, and the fluffy, striped young grebe are often carried on the adult&apos;s back. In a clutch of two or more hatchlings, male and female grebes will each identify their &apos;favourites&apos;, which they alone will care for and teach Unusually, young grebes are capable of swimming and diving almost at hatching. The adults teach these skills to their young by carrying them on their back and diving, leaving the chicks to float on the surface; they then re-emerge a few feet away so that the chicks may swim back onto them. The Crested Grebe feeds mainly on fish, but also small crustacean s, insect s and small frogs. This species was hunted almost to extinction in the United Kingdom in the 19th century for its head plumes, which were used to decorate hats and ladies&apos; undergarments. The RSPB was set up to help protect this species, which is again a common sight.
