These crows are some of the only non-primate animals known to invent new tool s by modifying existing ones, and then passing these innovations on to other individuals in the cultural group. They have also been seen making tools that they use in the wild out of completely different material. [ Description ] The New Caledonian Crow (Corvus moneduloides) is a moderately sized crow (40  cm in length) similar in size to the House Crow but less slender-looking. The bird has an all-black appearance with a rich gloss to its feathers of purple, dark blue and some green in good light. The beak, feet and legs are all black. The beak is of moderate size but is unusual in that the tip of the lower is angled up making it somewhat chisel-like in profile. The ability to fashion tools has always been held as unique to primate s. But humans and apes are not alone in having tool-making skills. Crows amazed the science community [ January 2012 ] when footage recorded using tiny &quot; crow-cams &quot; on the tails of New Caledonian crows showed the birds creating advanced implements. One crow was observed whittling twigs and leaves with its beak to fashion grabbers designed to retrieve grubs from the ground. The New Caledonian crows are among few known non-primates to manufacture and use tools in the wild. The voice is described as a soft &quot; waa-waa &quot; or &quot; wak-wak &quot;, and sometimes as a hoarse &quot; waaaaw &quot;. [ Distribution and habitat ] The bird is endemic to the island of New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands in the Pacific, living in primary forest. [ Ecology and behavior ] It eats a very wide range of food, including many types of insects and other invertebrates (some caught in flight with some agility, including night-flying insects which it catches at dusk), eggs and nestlings, small mammals, snail s (which it drops from a height onto hard stones), and various nut s and seed s. It is known for using plant material to create hooks or barb s for extracting grubs from inside logs and branches. This bird fills in the ecological niche of the woodpecker s and the Woodpecker Finch of the Galapagos, since the latter and New Caledonia lack woodpeckers. Unlike the Woodpecker Finch, however, it does not simply stab a grub and lever it slowly out of its log using a small twig but pokes the twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig. It shows great ingenuity in the search for food. Its nest is built high in a tree with usually 2 dozen eggs laid from September to November. [ Tool making ] The New Caledonian Crow is the only non-human species with a record of inventing new tool s by modifying existing ones, then passing these innovations to other individuals in the cultural group. Gavin R. Hunt and colleagues at the University of Auckland studied tools the crows make out of pandanus (or screw pine) leaves: [ Crows Better at Tool Building Than Chimps, Study Says John Pickrell National Geographic News http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0423_030423_crowtools.html 23 April 2003 3 May 2007 ] Observations of the distribution of 5,500 leaf counterparts or stencil s left behind by the cutting process suggest that the narrow and the stepped tools are more advanced versions of the wide tool type. &quot; The geographical distribution of each tool type on the islandsuggests a unique origin, rather than multiple independent inventions &quot;. This implies that the inventions, which involve a delicate change in the manufacturing process, were being passed from one individual to another. [ Hunt, G.R. and Gray, R.D. 2004 Direct observations of pandanus-tool manufacture and use by a New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides).

In 2002, researcher Kacelnik and colleagues at the University of Oxford observed of a couple of New Caledonian Crows called Betty and Abel: [ Crow Makes Wire Hook to Get Food Robert Winkler National Geographic News http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0808_020808_crow.html 8 August 2002 3 May 2007 ] Subsequently, this ability was tested through a series of systematic experiments. Out of ten successful retrievals, Betty bent the wire into a hook nine times. Abel retrieved the food once, without bending the wire. [ Weir, A.A.S., Chappell, J., &amp; Kacelnik, A. 2002 Shaping of hooks in New Caledonian crows Science 297 5583 981 10.1126/science.1073433 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5583/981?ijkey%3D2kJDaHqe6c11A%26amp%3Bkeytype%3Dref%26amp%3Bsiteid%3Dsci 12169726 ] The process would usually start with Betty trying to get the food bucket with the straight wire, but then she would make a hook from it bending it in different ways, usually by snagging one end of the wire under something, and then using the bent hook to pick up the tray. Clearly, Betty&apos;s creation of hooks cannot be attributed to the shaping or reinforcement of randomly generated behavior. In 2004, Gavin Hunt observed the crows in the wild also making hooks, but the adaptation to the new material of the wire was clearly novel, and also purposeful. This type of intentional tool-making, even if it is generalizing a prior experience to a completely new context, is almost unknown in the animal world. Chimpanzees have great difficulty in similar innovative tasks. The use of direct human activity has been recorded as well. This involves the placing of nuts in front of a vehicle on a heavy trafficked street and waiting for the/a car to crush it open, and then waiting at pedestrian lights with other pedestrians in order to retrieve the crushed nut safely. { EduTube Educational Videos } [ Meta-tool use ] Recent experiments show that New Caledonian Crows are able to use one tool to affect another to achieve a task, at a level rivalling the best performances seen in primate s.

They were given a stick too short to reach the food, but they could use this to retrieve a longer stick from another box. The longer stick was then used to retrieve the food. This complex behaviour involved realising that a tool could be used on non-food objects, and suppressing the urge to go directly for the food. It was solved by six of seven birds on the first attempt, and had previously only been observed in primates. The crows also use tools to investigate potentially dangerous objects.

The birds tested did not immediately recognise themselves in the mirror, which may be due to their never having seen a mirror before. Individual crows showed different levels of ability.
