Magic cards can be valuable due to their rarity and utility in game play. [ History ] Richard Garfield, the creator of the game, was a doctoral candidate at University of Pennsylvania when he first started to design the game. During his free time he worked with local volunteer playtesters to help refine the game. He had been brought on as an adjunct professor at Whitman College in 1993 when Peter Adkison (then CEO of Wizards of the Coast games company) first met with Garfield to discuss Garfield&apos;s new game RoboRally. Adkison saw the game as very promising, but decided that Wizards of the Coast lacked the resources to produce it at that point. He did like Garfield&apos;s ideas and mentioned that he was looking for a portable game that could be played in the downtime that frequently occurs at gaming convention s. Garfield returned and presented the general outline of the concept of a Trading Card Game. Adkison immediately saw the potential of this idea and agreed to produce it.

Mana Clash was instead chosen to be the name used in the first solicitation of the game. Still, everybody involved with the game continued to refer to it as Magic. After further consultation with the lawyer it was decided to rename the game to Magic: The Gathering, thus enabling the name to be trademarked.

[ Gameplay ] [ Magic: The Gathering rules ] In a game of Magic, two or more players are engaged in a battle as powerful wizards called &quot; planeswalker s &quot;. A player starts the game with twenty &quot; life points &quot; and loses when he or she is reduced to zero or fewer. Players lose life when they are dealt &quot; damage &quot; by being attacked with summoned creatures or when spells or other cards cause them to lose life directly. Although reducing an opponent to zero life is the most common way of ending a game, a player also loses if he or she must draw from an empty deck (called the &quot; library &quot; during the game), or if they have acquired 10 &quot; poison counters. &quot; In addition, some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game. [ Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules 7‚Äì8 The DCI July 11, 2009 July 24, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules_20090708.pdf ] Players begin the game by shuffling their decks and then drawing seven cards. [ Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules 7 The DCI July 11, 2009 July 24, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules_20090708.pdf ] Players also draw one card at the beginning of each of their turns, except the first player on their first turn. Players take turns consisting of several phases. Certain cards can only be played during certain phases or during the player&apos;s own turn, and the player whose turn it is has the first chance to play cards. At the end of a player&apos;s turn, if that player has more than seven cards in hand, the player discards until their hand contains seven cards. The contents of other players&apos; decks and hands are not usually known to players. The two basic card types in Magic are &quot; spells &quot; and &quot; lands &quot;. Lands provide &quot; mana &quot;, or magical energy, which is used as magical fuel when the player attempts to cast spells. Players may only play one land per turn. More powerful spells generally cost more mana, so as the game progresses more mana becomes available, and the quantity and relative power of the spells played tends to increase. Some spells also require the payment of additional resources, such as cards in play or life points. Spells come in several varieties: &quot; sorceries &quot; and &quot; instants &quot; have a single, one-time effect before they go to the &quot; graveyard &quot; (discard pile); &quot; enchantments &quot; and &quot; artifacts &quot; are &quot; permanents &quot; that remain in play after being cast to provide a lasting magical effect; &quot; creature &quot; spells summon monsters that can attack and damage an opponent. The set Lorwyn introduced the new &quot; planeswalker &quot; card type, which represent powerful allies who fight with their own magic abilities depending on their loyalty to the player who summoned them. Spells can be of more than one type.

The Comprehensive Rules, a detailed rulebook, exists to clarify these conflicts.

In most tournament formats, decks are required to be a minimum of sixty cards, with no upper limit. [ Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules 5 The DCI July 11, 2009 May 4, 2010 http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules_20090708.pdf ] Players may use no more than four copies of any named card, with the exception of &quot; basic lands &quot;, which act as a standard resource in Magic. Both these rules are loosened in &quot; limited &quot; tournament formats, where a small number of cards are opened for play from booster packs or tournament packs, with a minimum deck size of forty cards and no &quot; four of &quot; rule. Depending on the type of play, some cards have been &quot; restricted &quot; (the card is limited to a single copy per deck) or &quot; banned &quot; (the card is no longer legal for tournament play). [ Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules The DCI July 1, 2009 July 24, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/MTG_MTR_1Jul09_EN.pdf ] These limitations are usually for balance of power reasons, but have been occasionally made because of gameplay mechanics. [ Crafting a Vintage Wizards of the Coast July 26, 2009 July 24, 2009 LaPille Tom http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x%3Dmtg%2Fdaily%2Fld%2F44 ] Deck building requires much strategy as players must choose among thousands of cards which they want to play. This requires players to evaluate the power of their cards, as well as the possible synergies between them, and their possible interactions with the cards they expect to play against (this &quot; metagame &quot; can vary in different locations or time periods). [ A Beginners Guide to Magic the Gathering Kim E Lumbard 2003 July 24, 2009 http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~kel/MTG/ ] The choice of cards is usually narrowed by the player deciding which colors they want to include in the deck. This decision is a key part of creating a deck. In general, reducing the number of colors used increases the probability of drawing the lands needed to cast one&apos;s spells, while a player utilizing more colors has access to a greater arsenal of cards. [ Colors of Magic ] Most spells come in one of five colors. { An article on the consideration of &quot; purple &quot; for the set } { Planar Chaos is at The Color Purple. } The colors can be seen on the back of the cards, in a pentagon al design, called the &quot; Color Wheel &quot; or &quot; Pentagon of Colors &quot;. Clockwise from the top, they are: white, blue, black, red, and green, respectively abbreviated WUBRG (often pronounced &quot; woo-berg &quot; by players and designers). { &quot; U &quot; stands for &quot; blue &quot; because &quot; B &quot; denotes Black and &quot; L &quot; land; see Anatomy of a Magic Card } To play a spell of a given color, at least one mana of that color is required. This mana is normally generated by a basic land: plains for white, island for blue, swamp for black, mountain for red, and forest for green. The balances and distinctions among the five colors form one of the defining aspects of the game. Each color has strengths and weaknesses based on the &quot; style &quot; of magic it represents. { A series of articles written by } { Mark Rosewater describing each color in depth (as well as multicolor cards, artifact or colorless cards, and color-hybrid cards) can be found at the game&apos;s official site at MagicTheGathering.com : The Great White Way, True Blue, In the Black, Seeing Red, It&apos;s Not Easy Being Green, Just the Artifacts, Ma&apos;am, and Midas Touch. } White is the color of order, equality, righteousness, healing, law, community, peace, absolutism/totalitarianism, and light, although not necessarily &quot; good &quot;. White&apos;s strengths are a roster of small creatures that are strong collectively; protecting those creatures with enchantments; gaining life; preventing damage to creatures or players; imposing restrictions on players; reducing the capabilities of opposing creatures, and powerful spells that &quot; equalize &quot; the playing field by destroying all cards of a given type. White creatures are known for their &quot; Protection &quot; from various other colors or even types of card, rendering them nearly impervious to harm from those things. Numerous white creatures also have &quot; First Strike &quot;, &quot; Lifelink &quot;, and &quot; Vigilance &quot;. White&apos;s weaknesses include a focus on creatures, its unwillingness to simply kill creatures outright (instead hobbling them with restrictions that can be undone), and the fact that many of its most powerful spells affect all players equally‚Äîincluding the casting player. Blue is the color of intellect, reason, illusion, logic, knowledge, manipulation, and trickery, as well as the classical elements of air and water. Blue&apos;s cards are best at letting a player draw additional cards; permanently taking control of an opponent&apos;s cards; returning cards to their owner&apos;s hand; and countering spells, causing them to be discarded and the mana used to pay them wasted. Blue&apos;s creatures tend to be weaker than creatures of other colors, but commonly have abilities and traits which make them difficult to damage or block, particularly &quot; Flying &quot; and to a lesser extent &quot; Shroud &quot; or &quot; Hexproof &quot;. Blue&apos;s weaknesses include having trouble permanently dealing with spells that have already been played, the reactive nature of most of its spells, and a small (and expensive) roster of creatures. [ http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x%3Dmtgcom%2Fcotd%2F0706 Card of the Day ¬†‚Äî July, 2006 Wizards of the Coast September 30, 2006 July 27, 2006 Black removal spells like Terror or Dark Banishing that could take out large-sized creatures historically had the drawback of not being able to affect other black creatures, and sometimes not artifact creatures either. Since then this drawback has been tweaked in many ways that no longer limit the cards to just non-black or non-artifact. ] Black is the color of power, ambition, greed, death, illness, corruption, selfishness, and amorality; it is not necessarily evil, though many of its cards refer directly or indirectly to this concept. Black cards are best at destroying creatures, forcing players to discard cards from their hand, making players lose life, and returning creatures from the players&apos; graveyards. Furthermore, because Black seeks to win at all costs, it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals, creatures, cards in hand, cards in library, and other difficult-to-replace resources. Black is known for having creatures with the ability &quot; Intimidate &quot;, making them difficult to block. Lesser black abilities include &quot; Deathtouch &quot; and &quot; Regeneration &quot;. Black&apos;s main weaknesses are an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts, its tendency to hurt itself almost as badly as it hurts the opponent, and difficulties in removing other Black creatures. [ http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x%3Dmtgcom%2Faskwizards%2F0206#1 Ask Wizards September 26, 2006 Brady Dommermuth Wizards of the Coast February 1, 2006 The particular issue of red&apos;s connection to earth and stone has another aspect as well, though. Red has and will continue to have earth/stone-themed cards. But green wants to be connected to earth as well, in the soil sense. So red gives up a few of its &apos;earth&apos; cards for green&apos;s sake. ] Red is the color of freedom, chaos, passion, creativity, impulse, fury, warfare, lightning, the classical element of fire, and the non-living geological aspects of the classical element earth. Red&apos;s strengths include destroying opposing lands and artifacts, sacrificing permanent resources for temporary but great power, and playing spells that deal &quot; direct damage &quot; to creatures or players, usually via applications of fire. Red has a wide array of creatures, but with the exception of extremely powerful dragons, most are fast and weak, or with low toughness, rendering them easier to destroy. Some of Red&apos;s cards can turn against or hurt their owner in return for being more powerful for their cost. Red also shares the trickery theme with Blue and can temporarily steal opponents&apos; creatures or divert spells, although generally not permanently. Many of Red&apos;s most famous creatures have the &quot; Haste &quot; trait, which lets them attack and use many abilities earlier. The ability to raise a creature&apos;s power temporarily is also common among Red&apos;s creatures. Red&apos;s weaknesses include its inability to destroy enchantments, the self-destructive nature of many of its spells, and the way in which it trades early-game speed at the cost of late-game staying power. Red also has the vast majority of cards that involve random chance. Green is the color of life, nature, reality, evolution/adaptability, ecology, interdependence, instinct, and indulgence. Green&apos;s strengths are on the battlefield, usually winning through combat with creatures, of which it has a broad menagerie. These tend to be strong for their cost and have abilities that make them more survivable like Regenerate and Hexproof. Green creatures also often have &quot; Trample &quot;, an ability which allows them to deal attack damage to an opponent if blocked by a weaker creature. Many Green spells bolster its creatures&apos; potency, both permanently and temporarily. Green spells often focus on growth, such as regaining life points and getting lands faster, thus allowing the player more resources and the capacity to get strong creatures on the battlefield faster. Green&apos;s weakness is an inability to defend against indirect attacks. It has few cards that allow it to counter attacks against the hand, library, or graveyard; Green also has few defenses against creatures that bypass its own powerful creatures when attacking, via abilities like Flying, Landwalk, or Intimidate. The colors adjacent to each other on the pentagon are &quot; allied &quot; and often have similar, complementary abilities. For example, Blue has a relatively large number of flying creatures, which it shares with White and Black, which are next to it. The two non-adjacent colors to a particular color are &quot; enemy &quot; colors, and are thematically opposed. For instance, Red tends to be very aggressive, while White and Blue are often more defensive in nature. The Research and Development (R &amp; D) team at Wizards of the Coast seeks to balance power and abilities among the five colors by using the &quot; Color Pie &quot; to differentiate each. [ http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x%3Dmtgcom%2Fdaily%2Fmr85 The Value of Pie September 30, 2006 Wizards of the Coast Mark Rosewater Mark Rosewater August 18, 2003 ] This guideline lays out the capabilities, themes, and mechanics of each color and allows for every color to have its own distinct attributes and gameplay. The Color Pie is used to ensure new cards are thematically in the correct color and do not infringe on the territory of other colors. Multi-color cards were introduced in the Legends set and typically use a gold frame to distinguish them from mono-color cards. These cards require mana from two or more different colors to be played and count as each of the colors used to play them. Multi-color cards tend to combine the philosophy and mechanics of all the colors used in the spell&apos;s cost. Multi-color cards tend to be proportionally more powerful compared to single-color or hybrid cards, as requiring multiple colors of mana makes them harder to cast. More recently, two-color &quot; hybrid &quot; cards were introduced in the Ravnica set, and appeared extensively throughout the Shadowmoor and Eventide sets. Hybrid cards are distinguished by a gradient frame with those two colors, and can be paid with either of the card&apos;s colors (as opposed to requiring both); for instance, a card with two hybrid-red/white icons can be cast using two red mana, two white mana, or one of each. Colorless cards belong to no color, and most often appear in the form of Lands and Artifacts. Unlike the five colors, Colorless cards do not have a specific personality or style of play. Sometimes, colorless cards will imitate the mechanics of a particular color, though in a less-efficient manner than a similar colored card. Often colorless cards are linked to one or more colors via their abilities, through story references, or through flavor text on the cards themselves. With the Rise of the Eldrazi expansion, however, colorless cards that are neither artifacts nor lands have been introduced for the first time in larger quantities. [ Luck vs. skill ] Magic, like many other games, combines chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves the notion that there is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. [ Magic Jargon Wizards of the Coast Knutson Ted September 9, 2006 July 24, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x%3Dmtgcom%2Facademy%2F9 ] Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player&apos;s chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. The standard land count in most 60-card decks ranges from 18 to 28. Some players swear by a standard rule of 40% mana in a deck; in Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 the mana-count will always automatically adjust to 40%. The use of special spells or lands and the relative costs of the main spells within the deck can substantially increase or decrease the number of lands required. Other cards can minimize the player&apos;s dependence on mana.

The modern &quot; Paris mulligan &quot; allows players to shuffle an unsatisfactory opening hand back into the deck at the start of the game, draw a new hand with one fewer card, and repeat until satisfied. In multiplayer, a player may take one mulligan without penalty, while subsequent mulligans will still cost one card (a rule known as &quot; Partial Paris mulligan &quot; ).

A variation of this rule called a &quot; forced mulligan &quot; is still used in some casual play circles and in multiplayer formats on Magic Online, and allows a single &quot; free &quot; redraw of seven new cards if a player&apos;s initial hand contains seven, six, one or zero lands.

The rule was added to all multiplayer Magic Online later, as explained in this official announcement. } [ Gambling ] The original set of rules prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Each player would remove a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. [ The Original Magic Rulebook Wizards of the Coast December 25, 2004 June 14, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x%3Dmtgcom%2Fdaily%2Fjc20 ] Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play. The cards came with the instruction that they should be removed from the deck in a game that was not being played for ante. The ante concept became controversial because many regions had restrictions on games of chance. The rule was later made optional because of these restrictions and because of players&apos; reluctance to possibly lose a card that they owned. [ Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules 45 The DCI July 11, 2009 April 9, 2010 http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules_20090708.pdf ] The gambling rule is forbidden at sanctioned events and is now mostly a relic of the past, though it still sees occasional usage in friendly games as well as the &quot; five color &quot; format. [ 5-Color Magic 5-color.com April 9, 2010 http://www.5-color.com ] The last card to mention ante was printed in the 1995 expansion set Homelands Many cards said that you have to remove them from your deck if you are not playing for ante.. [ Variant rules ] [ Magic: The Gathering formats ] While the primary method of Magic play is one-on-one using standard deck construction rules, there are many alternative formats for playing the game. The most popular alternatives describe ways of playing with more than two players (with teams or free-for-all) or change the rules about how decks can be built. [ Organized play ] { Rostock, } { Germany competed for an invitation to a professional tournament in } { Nagoya, } { Japan. } [ DCI (Wizards of the Coast) The DCI ] Magic tournament s regularly occur in gaming stores and other venues. Larger tournaments with hundreds of competitors from around the globe sponsored by Wizards of the Coast are arranged many times every year, with substantial cash prizes for the top finishers. A number of websites report on tournament news, give complete lists for the most currently popular decks, and feature articles on current issues of debate about the game. The DCI, which is owned and operated by Wizards of the Coast, is the organizing body for sanctioned Magic events. The two major categories of tournament play are &quot; Constructed &quot; and &quot; Limited &quot;. [ Constructed ] In &quot; Constructed &quot; tournaments, each player arrives with a pre-built deck, which must have a minimum of sixty cards and follow other deck construction rules. The deck may also have a fifteen card sideboard, which allows players to modify their deck: following the first game of each match, each player is permitted to replace any number of cards in his or her deck with an equal number of cards from his or her sideboard. The original deck configuration is restored before the start of the next match. Normally the first player to win two games is the winner of the match. Different formats of Constructed Magic exist, each allowing different cards. The DCI maintains a &quot; Banned and Restricted List &quot; for each format; players may not use banned cards at all, and restricted cards are limited to one copy per deck. The DCI bans cards that it determines are damaging the health of a format; it seeks to use this remedy as infrequently as possible, and only a handful of cards have been banned in recent years. Currently, the only format with a Restricted List is Vintage. Block Constructed formats are defined by the cycle of three sets of cards in a given block. For example, the Ravnica block format consists of Ravnica: City of Guilds, Guildpact, and Dissension. Only cards that were printed in one of the sets in the appropriate block can be used in these formats. Standard, formerly known as Type 2, contains the current block, the last completed block, and the most recent core set (except in the intervening months between the core set release in summer and rotation in October, wherein the most recent core set and previous core set are both Standard legal). The Standard card pool undergoes a &quot; rotation &quot; each year in October, when the first set of the next block is released. Currently the Standard card pool consists of the Scars of Mirrodin block, the Innistrad block and the Magic 2012 core set. Extended is the format where all Magic blocks and core sets issued during the last four years are legal. Prior to July 15, 2010, Extended format was different in the fact that Extended was the past seven years were legal instead of four. As in Standard, the pool rotates once a year in October. Prior to March 1, 2008, Extended format rotation system was different and more complicated: three Magic blocks rotated out every three years. The current Extended format consists of Shards of Alara, Zendikar, Scars of Mirrodin, Innistrad, and their corresponding blocks; and the Magic 2010, Magic 2011, and Magic 2012 core sets. Modern is an experimental format that was first played at the Magic Online 2011 Community Cup, a response to players&apos; desire for a non-rotating format that is more accessible to newer players. Modern consists of every block and core set using the modern card frame, currently consisting of Mirrodin, Kamigawa, Ravnica, Time Spiral, Lorwyn, Shadowmoor, Shards of Alara, Zendikar, Scars of Mirrodin, and Innistrad and their corresponding blocks, as well as the stand-alone expansion Coldsnap, and the core sets Eighth Edition, Ninth Edition, Tenth Edition, Magic 2010, Magic 2011, and Magic 2012. Cards that were not printed in one of these sets are not legal in Modern, even if they have the modern card frame. Legacy is considered an &quot; Eternal &quot; format because the card pool never rotates. This means that all the sets that are currently legal will continue to be legal and any new tournament-legal cards will automatically be included in the legal card pool upon their release. [ http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/7614.html Money, Proxies, and the Must-Have List ¬†‚Äî A Case for Vintage September 30, 2006 Starcitygames Avi Flamholz July 13, 2004 More and more, the larger U.S. Vintage tournaments are unsanctioned and allow growing numbers of proxies (usually five to ten, sometimes unlimited). In fact, I would be hard pressed to find a sanctioned Type 1 tournament (A.K.A. proxy-free) in the last year or so that drew more than thirty people (other than major conventions like GenCon). ] Vintage, previously known as Type 1, is also an Eternal format. The only banned cards in Vintage are cards using the &quot; ante &quot; mechanic and a few other cards that the DCI considers inappropriate for competitive Magic. Because of the expense in acquiring the scarce old cards to play competitive Vintage, many Vintage tournaments permit players to proxy a certain number of cards. [ Limited ] In &quot; Limited &quot; tournaments, players construct decks using booster packs plus any additional basic lands of their choice. The decks in Limited tournaments must be a minimum of forty cards. All unused cards function as the sideboard. In contrast to &quot; Constructed &quot; tournaments, the player is not restricted to exchange cards on a one-for-one basis when sideboarding, so long as the player adheres to the forty card minimum. The rule that a player may use only four copies of any given card does not apply. Sealed Deck tournaments give each player six 15-card booster packs from which to build his or her deck. Booster Draft is usually played with eight players. The players are seated around a table and each player is given three booster packs. Each player opens a pack, selects a card from it, and passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then selects one of the remaining cards from the pack he or she just received, and passes the remaining cards again. This continues until all of the cards are depleted. Players pass left for the first and third packs, and right for the second. Players then build decks out of any of the cards that they selected during the drafting. Talking, signaling, and showing cards is forbidden during the drafting process, except for double faced cards from the Innistrad block, which must be shown openly to other players. { Jon Finkel won the right for this card to feature his design and likeness. } [ Tournament structure ] The DCI maintains a set of rules for being able to sanction tournaments, as well as runs its own circuit. Some hobby shops offer &quot; Gateway &quot; tournaments as a &quot; casual &quot; entrance to structured play. [ Gateway Wizards of the Coast 2008 June 14, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x%3Devents%2Fmagic%2Fgateway ] The same shops often offer &quot; Friday Night Magic &quot; tournaments as a stepping-stone to more competitive play.

The right to compete in a Pro Tour has to be earned by either winning a Pro Tour Qualifier Tournament or being successful in a previous tournament on a similar level. A Pro Tour is usually structured into two days of individual competition played in the Swiss format. On the final day, the top eight players compete with each other in an elimination format to select the winner. [ Pro Tour Wizards of the Coast 2009 June 14, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x%3Dmtgcom%2Fevents%2Fprotour ] At the end of the competition in a Pro Tour, players are awarded Pro Points depending on their finishing place. If the player finishes high enough, they will also be awarded prize money. Frequent winners of these events have made names for themselves in the Magic community, such as Gabriel Nassif, Kai Budde and Jon Finkel. As a promotional tool, the DCI launched the Hall of Fame in 2005 to honor selected players. At the end of the year the Magic World Championship is held. The World Championship functions like a Pro Tour, except that competitors have to present their skill in three different formats (usually Standard, booster draft and a second constructed format) rather than one. Another difference is that invitation to the World Championship can be gained not through Pro Tour Qualifiers, but via the national championship of a country. Most countries sends the top four players of the tournament as representatives, though nations with minor Magic playing communities may send just one player. There are also other means to be invited to the tournament. The World Championship also has a team-based competition, where the national teams compete with each other. [ 2009 Magic: The Gathering Worlds Championships Wizards of the Coast 2009 June 14, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x%3Devents%2Fmagic%2Fworlds ] At the beginning of the World Championship, new members are inducted into the Hall of Fame. The tournament also concludes the current season of tournament play and at the end of the event, the player who earned the most Pro Points during the year is awarded the title &quot; Pro Player of the Year &quot;. The player who earned the most Pro Points and did not compete in any previous season is awarded the title &quot; Rookie of the Year &quot;.

Under Wizards of the Coast&apos;s current production and marketing scheme, a new set is released quarterly. Various products are released with each set to appeal to different segments of the Magic playing community. The majority of cards are sold in booster packs, which contain fifteen cards normally divided into four rarities, which can be differentiated by the color of the expansion symbol. { For cards released prior to } { Exodus, rarities must be checked against an external cardlist or database, as all expansion symbols were black. } A fifteen-card Booster Pack will typically contain one Rare (gold), three Uncommons (silver), ten Commons (black), and one Basic Land (colored black, as Commons). Sets prior to Shards of Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land. Shards of Alara also debuted Mythic Rares, which replace one in eight Rare cards on average. There are also premium versions of every card with holographic foil, randomly inserted into some boosters, which replace about every seventieth card. Four to five Intro Packs are released with each set; an Intro Pack is a pre-constructed deck aimed at newcomers that highlights one of the set&apos;s mechanical themes. It comes with a booster pack from that set, a rulebook, and a fixed selection of cards, including one foil rare. Each set starting from Mirrodin Besieged has also featured two Event Decks, which are preconstructed decks designed as an introduction to tournament play.

[ 2011 10 28 ] The current Core Set, Magic 2012, was released on July 15, 2011. The expansion sets are released in a three-set block starting in October, typically with a large initial set (that gives its name to the block) and then two smaller follow-ups at three-month intervals. These sets consist almost exclusively of newly-designed cards. Contrasted with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards to a handful of particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics which do not appear in other sets. Expansion sets are released in a yearly three-set &quot; block, &quot; starting with a large, ~250 card set in October which is followed by two small, ~150 card sets the following winter and spring. The follow-up sets typically continue the storyline established in the block&apos;s opening set and have related gameplay mechanics. In addition to the quarterly set releases, Magic cards are released in other products as well, such as the recent Planechase and Archenemy spin-off games. These combine reprinted Magic cards with new, oversize cards with new functionality. Magic cards are also printed specifically for collectors, such as the From the Vault and Premium Deck Series sets, which contain exclusively premium foil cards.

For the first few years of its production, Magic: The Gathering featured a small number of cards with names or artwork with demon ic or occult ist themes, in 1995 the company elected to remove such references from the game.

Foil versions of rare and mythic rare cards are typically priced at about 1.5x as much as the regular versions. A few of the oldest cards, due to smaller printings and limited distribution, are highly valued and extremely rare.

However, the artist is allowed to sell the original piece and printed reproductions of it, and for established and prolific Magic artists, this can be a lucrative source of revenue. As Magic has expanded across the globe, its artwork has had to change for its international audience. Artwork has been edited or given alternate art to comply with the governmental standards. For example, the portrayal of skeletons and most undead in artwork was prohibited by the Chinese government until 2008. [ Chinese Skeleton Wizards of the Coast March 13, 2002 April 18, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x%3Dmtgcom%2Farcana%2F50 ] [ Alternate Chinese Art in Ravnica Part 1 Wizards of the Coast November 14, 2005 April 18, 2009 http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x%3Dmtgcom%2Farcana%2F948 ] [ Storyline ] [ Magic: The Gathering storylines ] An intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion and is shown in the art and flavor text of the cards, as well as in novels and anthologies published by Wizards of the Coast (and formerly by Harper Prism ). Important storyline characters or objects often appear as cards in Magic sets, usually as &quot; Legendary &quot; creatures. The expansion sets from Antiquities through Scourge (with the exception of Homelands ) revolve around the plane of Dominaria and are a roughly chronological timeline of that plane&apos;s history (with the exception of the Urza&apos;s Saga block). Major recurring characters include Urza and his brother Mishra. The sets from Weatherlight through Apocalypse particularly follow the story about the crew of the Weatherlight who fight against Yawgmoth and his army of Phyrexians. Odyssey through Scourge are an unconnected storyline set 100 years later on the continent of Otaria, where multiple factions battle for control of the Mirari, a powerful magical artifact. After Scourge, Magic ventured out of Dominaria into the new planes of Mirrodin, a metallic artificial plane watched over and ruled by an animated Mirari; Kamigawa, a Japanese-themed plane set in the time of a great war between spirits and mortals; and Ravnica, a completely urbanised plane headed by ten guilds, at a time when their pact is at a turning point. It then returned to Dominaria, in a devastated apocalyptic state, for the Time Spiral block, but left it again upon the block&apos;s conclusion. The following blocks took place on a series of new planes: Lorwyn, inspired by Celtic mythology, which shifts from a utopic and bucolic paradise to a shadowy and creepy land of darkness; Alara, a world split into five magically and culturally distinct &quot; shards &quot; but later reunited; and Zendikar, a world used as a prison to entrap a race of interplanar parasitic monsters called the Eldrazi.

[ http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x%3Dmtg%2Fdaily%2Farcana%2F409 Announcing Scars of Mirrodin Wizards of the Coast March 29, 2010 ] To further integrate the storyline into the gameplay, certain events for the second set, Mirrodin Besieged, encouraged players to affiliate themselves with either the Mirran or Phyrexian faction. The most recent storyline focuses on Innistrad, a horror themed plane where humanity struggles to survive against werewolves, vampires, zombies, and spirits. On February 4, 2012, the second set of the Innistrad block, Dark Ascension, was released, and Avacyn Restored completed the block on May 5, 2012. ( Avacyn Restored also provided a storyline connection to Kamigawa, in the form of Tamiyo, the Moon Sage.)
