Her vivacious presence and inventive use of stage props earned her the nickname &quot; The Hottest Blaze in Burlesque &quot;. She was also known for her affair with Louisiana governor Earl Long. The 1989 film Blaze was based on her memoir. [ Early life ] Starr was born in rural Wilsondale, West Virginia, to Lora Evans and Goodlow Mullins (later changed to Fleming). Fleming left home at age fifteen in 1947, { Rasmussen, Frederick N. (May 15, 2010). &quot; Blaze Starr recalls burlesque era in new film &quot;. } { The Baltimore Sun. } and moved to Washington D.C. where Red Snyder discovered her either working in a doughnut shop (according to her autobiography) or as a hat check girl (according to other sources). Snyder became Fleming&apos;s first manager, encouraged her to start stripping, and gave her the stage name Blaze Starr. After he attempted to rape her, however, Starr left Snyder. Starr moved to Baltimore, Maryland where she began performing at the Two O&apos;Clock Club nightclub in 1950, eventually becoming its headliner. Starr rose to national renown after she was profiled in a February 1954 Esquire magazine article, &quot; B-Belles of Burlesque: You Get Strip Tease With Your Beer in Baltimore &quot;. The Two O&apos;Clock Club remained her home base, but she began to travel and perform in clubs throughout the country. [ Career ] Starr&apos;s striking red hair, voluptuous figure and on-stage enthusiasm were a large part of her appeal. The theatrical flourishes and unique gimmicks she used in her stage show went beyond established burlesque routines like the fan dance and balloon dance. [ October 2011 ] Perhaps her most famous prop was a couch that she rigged to smolder and then appear to burst into flame as she sat on it and undressed. [ October 2011 ] [ Relationship with Earl Long ] { Lolita Davidovich, and her relationship with Louisiana Governor } { Earl Long, played by } { Paul Newman } In the late 1950s, while working at the Sho-Bar on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, Starr began a long-term affair with then-governor Earl Long. Starr was in the process of divorcing her husband, club owner Carroll Glorioso, and Long was married to the state&apos;s first lady, known colloquially as Miz Blanche. Starr and Long&apos;s relationship, invoked as one reason for Long being involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, lasted until his death in 1960. In his will, Long left her $50,000, which she refused to accept. [ September 2007 ] [ Media appearances ] Two of Starr&apos;s performances, including the combustible sofa, are among the burlesque routines featured in the 1956 compilation film Buxom Beautease, produced and directed by Irving Klaw. Director Doris Wishman &apos;s 1962 film Blaze Starr Goes Nudist, a nudie - sexploitation film, features Starr&apos;s one lead movie role. As the title suggests, she plays herself. The film is also known as Blaze Starr Goes Back to Nature, Blaze Starr Goes Wild, Blaze Starr the Original, and Busting Out. Diane Arbus photographed Starr in 1964. The photo &quot; Blaze Starr at home &quot; was included in the book and traveling exhibit Diane Arbus: Family Albums. The 1989 movie Blaze recounts the story of their relationship. It was directed by Ron Shelton, adapted by him from Starr&apos;s 1974 memoir Blaze Starr: My Life as Told to Huey Perry. Lolita Davidovich portrays Starr in the movie, and Paul Newman plays Long. Starr herself appears in a cameo role. [ Personal life ] Starr eventually bought the Two O&apos;Clock Club on The Block in Baltimore, Maryland. Some of her costumes and other memorabilia have been displayed at the Museum of Sex in New York City and the Burlesque Hall of Fame. In the early 1980s, Starr made an appearance at the Mitchell Brothers &apos; O&apos;Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, California. [ September 2007 ] Semi-retired since 1975, she finally retired from stripping for good in 1983, to become a full-time gemologist. She had dabbled in that occupation part-time since 1975, and spent several holiday seasons selling hand-crafted jewelry at the Carrolltowne Mall in Eldersburg, Maryland, near Baltimore. { Lovece, Frank (December 13, 1989). &quot; Starr Power: The Life and Times of a Striptease Queen &quot;. } { Los Angeles Times. } Starr currently conducts jewelry sales with a brother from her website. Starr is also the cousin of onetime country/western music singer Molly O&apos;Day. { Blaze Starr html at &apos;&apos;Sonny Watson&apos;s Streetswing&apos;&apos; website } [ February 2011 ] [ Notes ] [ References ] Starr, Blaze and Perry, Huey (1974).
