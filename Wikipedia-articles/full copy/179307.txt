[ Biography ] Born in Belozerka, in the Kherson Governorate of the Ukraine, Sergei Bondarchuk spent his childhood in the cities of Yeysk and Taganrog, graduating from the Taganrog School Number 4 in 1938. His first performance as an actor was onstage of the Taganrog Theatre in 1937. He continued studies in the Rostov-on-Don theater school (1938–1942). After his studies, he was conscripted into the Red Army against Nazi Germany and was discharged in 1946. At the age of 32, he became the youngest Soviet actor ever to receive the top dignity of People&apos;s Artist of the USSR. In 1955, he starred with future wife Irina Skobtseva in Othello and after four years, they married. He was previously married to Inna Makarova, mother to his elder daughter. In 1959 he made his directorial debut with Destiny of a Man, based on the Mikhail Sholokhov short story of the same name. Bondarchuk&apos;s western fame lies with his epic production of Tolstoy&apos;s War and Peace, which on original release totaled more than ten hours of cinema, took seven years to complete and won Bondarchuk, who both directed and acted the role of Pierre Bezukhov, the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968.

His first English language film was 1970&apos;s Waterloo, produced by Dino De Laurentiis. This was remarkable for the epic battle scenes. However, it failed at the box office. To prevent running into hurdles with the Soviet government, he joined the Communist Party in 1970. A year later, he was appointed President of the Union of Cinematographers, while he continued his directing career, steering toward political film s, directing Boris Godunov before being dismissed from the semi-government post in 1986. In 1975 he directed They Fought for Their Country, which was entered into the 1975 Cannes Film Festival.

It was filmed in 1992-93 but premiered on Channel One only in November 2006, [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6125440.stm Europe &amp; #124; Russia recovers Soviet-era epic BBC News 2006-11-07 2012-03-14 ] as there were disputes concerning the Italian studio that was co-producing over unfavourable clauses in his contract, which left the tapes locked in a bank vault, even after his death aged 74 of a heart attack. Sergei Bondarchuk is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. His daughter Natalya Bondarchuk is remembered as a star of Andrei Tarkovsky &apos;s Solaris, while his son Fyodor Bondarchuk (who starred with him in Boris Godunov) is a popular Russian film actor and director best known for his box-office champion The 9th Company (2005). In June 2007, his ex-wife Inna Makarova unveiled a bronze statue of Sergei Bondarchuk in his native Yeysk.
