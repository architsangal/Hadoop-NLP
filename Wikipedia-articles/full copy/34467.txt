Over 23,000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum&apos;s launch and new titles continue to be released, with over 90 new ones in 2010. [ Hardware ] ZX Spectrum 48K motherboard (Issue 3B  — 1983, heat sink removed) The Spectrum is based on a Zilog Z80 A CPU running at 3.5   MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The original model Spectrum has 16  kB (16×1024 byte s ) of ROM and either 16  kB or 48  kB of RAM. Hardware design was by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research, and the machine&apos;s outward appearance was designed by Sinclair&apos;s industrial designer Rick Dickinson. Video output is through an RF modulator and was designed for use with contemporary portable television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32  columns × 24  rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black.

Altwasser received a patent for this design. [ EP 0107687 patent Display for a computer 1988-07-06 1983-04-22 1982-04-22 Richard Francis Altwasser Sinclair Research Ltd ] An &quot; attribute &quot; consists of a foreground and a background colour, a brightness level (normal or bright) and a flashing &quot; flag &quot; which, when set, causes the two colours to swap at regular intervals. This scheme leads to what was dubbed colour clash or attribute clash with some bizarre effects in the animated graphics of arcade style games. This became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum and an in-joke among Spectrum users, as well as a point of derision by advocates of other systems. [ July 2011 ] Other machines available around the same time, for example the Amstrad CPC, did not suffer from this limitation. The Commodore 64 used colour attributes in a similar way, but a special multicolour mode, hardware sprite s and hardware scrolling were used to avoid attribute clash. Sound output is through a beeper on the machine itself. This is capable of producing one channel with 10 octaves. The machine also includes an expansion bus edge connector and 3.5  mm audio in/out ports for the connection of a cassette recorder for loading and saving programs and data. [ Firmware ] The machine&apos;s Sinclair BASIC interpreter is stored in ROM (along with fundamental system-routines) and was written by Steve Vickers on contract from Nine Tiles Ltd. The Spectrum&apos;s chiclet keyboard (on top of a membrane, similar to calculator keys) is marked with BASIC keywords, so that, for example, pressing &quot; G &quot; when in programming mode would insert the BASIC command GOTO. [ Vickers Steven Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ 19 September 2006 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd Basic programming concepts http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap2.html ] The BASIC interpreter was developed from that used on the ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features making it easier to use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and also supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was also much more advanced, saving and loading around four times faster than the ZX81, and much more reliably. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could in addition save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.

Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48  kB versions. To reduce the price, the 32  kB extension used eight faulty 64   kilobit chips with only one half of their capacity working and/or available. Links on the PCB were configured accordingly so as to place these faulty memory locations in the other (unused) half of each IC. [ Goodwin Simon 1984 September Suddenly, it&apos;s the 64K Spectrum!

Both machines had 16  kB of onboard ROM. About 60,000 &quot; Issue 1 &quot; ZX Spectrums were manufactured; they can be distinguished from later models by the colour of the keys (light grey for Issue 1, blue-grey for later models).

An external tape recorder was needed to load the majority of software released. Either socket could also be connected to headphones or an amplifier as an audio output, though this would not disable the internal speaker.

Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48  kB model. It was possible to change the system boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. [ 1984 December News: New Spectrum launch Sinclair User 33 11 http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/033/news.htm 19 August 2006 ] A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was also available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5-6% for the older model. [ ZX Spectrum 128 ] Sinclair developed the ZX Spectrum 128 (code-named Derby) in conjunction with their Spanish distributor Investrónica. [ Bourne Chris 1985 November News: Launch of the Spectrum 128 in Spain Sinclair User 44 5 http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/044/news.htm 15 August 2006 ] Investrónica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after the Spanish government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64  kB RAM or less, { Ministerio de Economía y Hacienda (BOE 211 de 3/9/1985), Real Decreto 1558/1985, de 28 de agosto, por el que se aclara el alcance del mínimo específico introducido en la subpartida 84.53.B.II del Arancel de Aduanas, por el Real Decreto 1215/1985. Rango: Real Decreto, Páginas: 27743 - 27744, Referencia: 1985/18847. } and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the Spanish alphabet and show messages in Spanish. { Ministerio de Industria y Energía (BOE 179 de 27/7/1985), Real Decreto 1250/1985, de 19 de junio, por el que se establece la sujeción a especificaciones técnicas de los terminales de pantalla con teclado, periféricos para entrada y representación de información en equipo de proceso de datos. Rango: Real Decreto, Páginas: 23840 - 23841, Referencia: 1985/15611. } The appearance of the ZX Spectrum 128 was similar to the ZX Spectrum+, with the exception of a large external heatsink for the internal 7805 voltage regulator added to the right hand end of the case, replacing the internal heatsink in previous versions. New features included 128  kB RAM, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an RS-232 serial port, an RGB monitor port, 32  kB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad. The machine was simultaneously presented for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO &apos;85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of £179.95. [ 1985 April Clive discovers games  — at last Sinclair User 49 53 http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/049/128lnch.htm 20 August 2006 ] No external keypad was available for the UK release, although the ROM routines to use it and the port itself remained. The Z80 processor used in the Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, which means only 64  kB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80  kB of RAM the designers used bank switching so that the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16  kB at the top of the address space. The same technique was also used to page between the new 16  kB editor ROM and the original 16  kB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space. [ July 2011 ] The new sound chip and MIDI out abilities were exposed to the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there is no way to switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80  kB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with some BASIC programs. [ July 2011 ] The ZX Spectrum 128 had no internal speaker like its predecessors. The sound was produced from the television speaker instead. { ZX Spectrum 128 Manual p. 9 at } { World of Spectrum } The Spanish version had the &quot; 128K &quot; logo in white while the English one had the same logo in red. [ Amstrad models ] [ ZX Spectrum +2 ZX Spectrum +2A ZX Spectrum +3 ] [ ZX Spectrum +2 ] The ZX Spectrum +2 was Amstrad &apos;s first Spectrum, coming shortly after their purchase of the Spectrum range and &quot; Sinclair &quot; brand in 1986. The machine featured an all-new grey case featuring a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and a built-in cassette recorder dubbed the &quot; Datacorder &quot; (like the Amstrad CPC 464 ), but was in most respects identical to the ZX Spectrum 128. The main menu screen lacked the Spectrum 128&apos;s &quot; Tape Test &quot; option, and the ROM was altered to account for a new 1986 Amstrad copyright message. These changes resulted in minor incompatibility problems with software that accessed ROM routines at certain addresses. Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to £139–£149. [ Phillips Max 1986 November ZX Spectrum +2 Your Sinclair 11 47 http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/spectrumplustworeview.htm 29 August 2006 ] The new keyboard did not include the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a major issue however, as the +2 boasted a menu system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could switch between 48k BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128k BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128. [ July 2011 ] The ZX Spectrum +2 power supply was a grey version of the ZX Spectrum+ and 128 power supply. [ July 2011 ] [ ZX Spectrum +2A ] The ZX Spectrum +2A was a variant of the Spectrum +3 housed a black version of the Spectrum +2 case mouldings. The Spectrum +2A/+3 motherboard (AMSTRAD part number Z70830) was designed such that it could be assembled without the floppy disk controller or associated logic and a +2 style &quot; datacorder &quot; connected. { Spectrum +3 Service Manual. AMSTRAD. p.18. } Originally, Amstrad planned to introduce an additional disk interface for the +2A/+2B called the AMSTRAD SI-1, { Spital, Ivor. Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. AMSTRAD, 1987. p.354. } however this never appeared. If an external disk drive was added, the &quot; +2A &quot; on the system OS menu would change to a +3. The power supply of the ZX Spectrum +2A used the same pinout as the +3. However, the power supply purchased with the +2A/B had &quot; Sinclair +2 &quot; written on the case. [ July 2011 ] [ ZX Spectrum +2B ] The ZX Spectrum +2B and ZX Spectrum +3B were functionally similar in design to the Spectrum +2A and +3. { Spectrum +2B/+3B Service Manual. AMSTRAD. } The main electronic differences being simply changes to the generation of the audio output signal to resolve problems with clipping. The Spectrum +2B motherboard (AMSTRAD part number Z70833) does not have provision for floppy disk controller circuitry so cannot be assembled as a +3B. No documented discovery of a Spectrum +3B has been made so it is unknown whether the computer was ever produced. [ ZX Spectrum +3 ] The ZX Spectrum +3 looked similar to the +2 but featured a built-in 3-inch floppy disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 [ South Phil 1987 July It&apos;s here... the Spectrum +3 Your Sinclair 17 22–23 http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag%3DYourSinclair%2FIssue19%2FPages%2FYourSinclair1900022.jpg 5 August 2008 ] and then later £199 [ Amstrad 1987 November The new Sinclair has one big disk advantage Sinclair User 68 2–3 http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag%3DSinclairUser%2FIssue068%2FPages%2FSinclairUser06800002.jpg 5 August 2008 Amstrad ] and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware. The +3 saw the addition of two more 16  kB ROMs. One was home to the second part of the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3&apos;s disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad&apos;s AMSDOS, called +3DOS. These two new 16  kB ROMs and the original two 16  kB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32  kB chips. To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16  kB of RAM. Such core changes brought incompatibilities: Removal of several lines on the expansion bus edge connector (video, power, and IORQGE); caused many external devices problems; some such as the VTX5000 modem could be used via the &quot; FixIt &quot; device. Dividing ROMCS into 2 lines, to disable both ROMs Reading a non-existent I/O port no longer returned the last attribute; caused some games such as Arkanoid to be unplayable Memory timing changes; some of the RAM banks were now contended causing high-speed colour-changing effects to fail The keypad scanning routines from the ROM were removed move 1 byte address in ROM Some older 48K, and a few older 128K, games were incompatible with the machine. The ZX Interface 1 was incompatible due to differences in ROM and expansion connector; therefore it was not possible to connect and use the Microdrive units. [ July 2011 ] The ZX Spectrum +3 power supply provides the same voltages as the one supplied with +2A/B. This power supply has the same DIN connector so can also be used with the +2A/B. However, the power supply purchased with the +3 had &quot; Sinclair +3 &quot; written on the case. [ July 2011 ] Production of the +3 ceased in December 1990. Although still accounting for one third of all home computer sales in the UK at the time [ September 2010 ], production of the model was ceased by Amstrad at that point. [ September 2010 ] [ Clones ] { Didaktik M } [ list of ZX Spectrum clones ] Sinclair licensed the Spectrum design to Timex Corporation in the United States. An enhanced version of the Spectrum with better sound, graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the Timex Sinclair 2068. Timex&apos;s derivatives were largely incompatible with Sinclair systems. However, some of the Timex innovations were later adopted by Sinclair Research. A case in point was the abortive Pandora portable Spectrum, whose ULA had the high resolution video mode pioneered in the TS2068. Pandora had a flat-screen monitor and Microdrives and was intended to be Sinclair&apos;s business portable. After Amstrad bought the computer business of Sinclair Research, Sir Clive retained the rights to the Pandora project, and it evolved into the Cambridge Computer Z88, launched in 1987. [ Goodwin Simon SINCLAIR’S Z88 — Pandora’s Box?

However, by this point, the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST had taken hold of the market, leaving MGT in eventual receivership. [ July 2011 ] Many unofficial Spectrum clones were produced, especially in the former Eastern Bloc countries (e.g. in Romania, several models were produced (Tim-S, HC85, HC91, Cobra, Junior, CIP, CIP 3, Jet), some featuring CP/M and a 5.25 &quot; /3.5 &quot; floppy disk ) and South America (e.g. Microdigital TK 90X and TK 95 ). In the Soviet Union, ZX Spectrum clones were assembled by thousands of small start-ups and distributed through poster ads and street stalls. Over 50 such clone models existed.

[ McCandless David Retrospectrum Daily Telegraph 17 September 1998 http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/sinclair/clive_dt170998.htm ] [ Distribution ] Most Spectrum software was originally distributed on audio cassette tape s. The Spectrum was intended to work with a normal domestic cassette recorder, [ Vickers Steven and Bradbeer, Robin Steve Vickers (academia) Sinclair ZX Spectrum: Introduction http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrumIntroduction/contents.html 10 August 2007 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd 21 6. Using the cassette recorder http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrumIntroduction/chapter_six.html ] and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process was quite reliable, if somewhat slow (by today&apos;s standards). Although the ZX Microdrive was initially greeted with good reviews, [ Frey Franco Epicventuring and Multiplayer Networking &apos;&apos;CRASH&apos;&apos; 1984 May 4 46–47 http://www.crashonline.org.uk/04/microdv.htm 11 August 2007 ] it never took off as a distribution method due to worries about the quality of the cartridges and piracy. [ Foot Cathy Microdrive revisited CRASH 1985 November 22 8 http://www.crashonline.org.uk/22/opinion.htm 10 August 2006 ] Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive. Despite the popularity of the DISCiPLE and +D systems, most software released for them took the form of utility software. The ZX Spectrum +3 enjoyed much more success when it came to commercial software releases on floppy disk. More than 700 titles were released on 3-inch disk from 1987 to 1997. Software was also distributed through print media; magazine s [ http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/type-ins/typehome.htm Grimwood Jim The Type Fantastic 16 September 2008 ] and book s. [ http://www.worldofspectrum.org/books.html World of Spectrum van der Heide Martijn Books 17 September 2008 ] The reader would type the Sinclair BASIC program listing into the computer by hand, run it, and could save it to tape for later use. The software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts. Magazines also printed long lists of checksum med hexadecimal digits with machine code games or tools. Another software distribution method was to broadcast the audio stream from the cassette on another medium and have users record it onto an audio cassette themselves. In radio or television shows in many European countries, the host would describe a program, instruct the audience to connect a cassette tape recorder to the radio or TV and then broadcast the program over the airwaves in audio format. [ News Sinclair User 1983 July 16 17 http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/016/news.htm 19 August 2006 ] Some magazines distributed 7 &quot; 33⅓ rpm flexidisc records, a variant of regular vinyl record s which could be played on a standard record player. [ http://equ.in/ox/spectrum/music/ Collins Paul Equinox Spectrum references in popular music 16 September 2008 ] [ April 2012 H3llBot ] These disks were known as floppy ROM s. [ Copying and backup software ] Many copiers—utilities to copy programs from audio tape to another tape, microdrive tapes, and later on diskettes—were available for the Spectrum. [ World of Spectrum http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekadv.cgi?type%3DCopy Sinclair Inforseek 18 September 2008 van der Heide Martijn ] As a response to this, publishers introduced copy protection measures to their software, including different loading schemes. [ http://newton.sunderland.ac.uk/~specfreak/Schemes/schemes.html ZX Spectrum Loading Schemes 18 September 2008 Barker Andy ] Other methods for copy prevention were also used including asking for a particular word from the documentation included with the game—often a novella like in Silicon Dreams trilogy —or another physical device distributed with the software—e.g. Lenslok as used in Elite. Special hardware, such as Romantic Robot&apos;s Multiface, was able to dump a copy of the ZX Spectrum RAM to disk/tape at the press of a button, entirely circumventing the copy protection systems. Most Spectrum software has, in recent years, been converted to current media and is available for download. One popular program for converting Spectrum files from tape is Taper; it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the line in port of a sound card, or—through a simple home-built device—to the parallel port of a PC. [ World of Spectrum http://www.worldofspectrum.org/taper.html Taper 12 September 2008 van der Heide Martijn ] Once in files on a host machine, the software can be executed on one of many emulator s, on virtually any platform available today. The largest on-line archive of ZX Spectrum software is World of Spectrum, with more than 21,000 titles. The legality of this practice is still in question and while a number of copyright holders have explicitly objected to the posting of their software, others have given their permission for their games to be archived as part of the preservation project. [ World of Spectrum http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/ World of Spectrum  — Software  — Copyrights and Distribution Permissions 12 September 2008 van der Heide Martijn ] [ Community ] The ZX Spectrum enjoyed a very strong community early on. Several dedicated magazines were released including Sinclair User (1982), Your Sinclair (1983) and CRASH (1984). Early on they were very technically oriented with type-in programs and machine code tutorials. Later on they became almost completely game-oriented. Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail. They included Computer Gamer, Computer and Video Games, Computing Today, Popular Computing Weekly, Your Computer and The Games Machine.
