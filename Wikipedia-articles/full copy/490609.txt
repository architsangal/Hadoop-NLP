Together with the similarly coloured but larger Emperor Penguin (A. forsteri), it is one of two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes. Fossil evidence of a third species— Ridgen&apos;s Penguin (A. ridgeni)—has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. { Williams, (The Penguins) p. 13 } Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. [ Jouventin P 1982 Visual and vocal signals in penguins, their evolution and adaptive characters Adv. Ethol. 24 1–149 ] Mitochondria l and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40  million years ago.

Williams (The Penguins) p. 143 A. p. halli breeds on the Kerguelen, Crozet, Prince Edward, Heard, and Macquarie Islands. [ Description ] { South Georgia, British Overseas Territories } The King Penguin is the second largest species of penguin at about [ 90 cm ft on ] tall and weighing [ 11 to 16 kg lb on ], second only to the Emperor Penguin. Like all penguin species, it has a streamlined body to minimise drag while swimming, webbed feet to propel more force when swimming, and wings that have become stiff, flat flippers. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 3 } There is little difference in plumage between the male and female, although the latter are slightly smaller. The upper parts features of the King Penguin include a silvery-grey back with a blackish-brown head decorated with ear patches of bright golden-orange. However, rare individuals have been sighted that have varying degrees of melanism, including one individual spotted on a National Geographic Society expedition to South Georgia Island that was completely black. [ Nanos J 2010 Today&apos;s Pic: Rare Black Penguin National Geographic Traveller http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/2010/03/todays-pic-rare-black-penguin.html ] The 12–13  cm (4¾–5  in) black bill is long and slender, and curved downwards like a banana peel. The lower mandible bears a striking pink or orange-coloured mandibular plate. The chick is first covered with brown-grey down, before moulting into a thick, woolly brown coat borne until around 10–12  months of age. Their mandibular plates are black until the moult into immature plumage. An immature bird will have yellow, rather than orange-tinged markings, and grey tips to its black brown feathers. It moults into adult plumage after reaching two years of age. [ Stonehouse B 1960 The King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicusof South Georgia I. Breeding behaviour and development Scientific Report of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey 23 1–81 ] King Penguins live for an average of 15 to 20 years in the wild. [ http://www.pittsburghzoo.org/ppganimal.aspx?id%3D63 King Penguin Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium May 15, 2012 ] [ Adaptations to the environment ] King Penguins have adapted well to their extreme living conditions in the subantarctic. To keep warm, the penguins have four layers of feathering. King Penguins have 70 feathers per every square inch. The outer layer of feather s are oiled and waterproof, unlike the feathering of a duck, which reduces the amount of water absorbed that would otherwise increase their weight. The inner three layers are down feather s, very effective insulation. A chick is born without the oily outer layer, and therefore cannot fish until maturity. A King Penguin chick has dark down feathers. They remain on land and do not go into the water until their down feathers have fallen off. [ Drinking ] Like most penguins, King Penguins are able to drink salt water because of their supraorbital gland s which filter excess salt from their blood stream by way of a capillary just above the eyes. The excess salt is then expelled through the nostrils as a concentrated brine. [ Distribution and habitat ] { South Georgia } King Penguins breed on subantarctic islands between 45 and 55°S, at the northern reaches of Antarctica, as well as Tierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, and other temperate islands of the region. The total population is estimated to be 2.23  million pairs and is increasing. The largest breeding populations are on Crozet Island, with around 455,000 pairs, 228,000 pairs on the Prince Edward Islands, 240,000–280,000 on the Kerguelen Islands and over 100,000 on the South Georgia Islands. Macquarie Island has around 70,000 pairs. The non-breeding range is poorly known though presumably the subantarctic waters of the southern Indian, South Atlantic and Asian part of the Southern Ocean. Vagrant birds have been recorded from the Antarctic peninsula as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The Nature Protection Society released King Penguins in Gjesvær in Finnmark, and Røst in Lofoten in northern Norway in August 1936. Birds were reported in the area several times in the 1940s though none have been seen since 1949.

Ecology 79: 1905-1921 } The King Penguin dives to depths of 100–300  meters (350–1000  feet), spending around 5 minutes submerged, during daylight hours, and less than [ 30 m ft ] at night.

They have been described as U-shaped or W-shaped, relating to the course of the dive. The bird dives in a V-shaped or &apos;spike&apos; pattern in the remaining 12% of dives; that is the bird dives at an angle through the water column, reaches a certain depth and then returns to the surface. Other penguins dive in this latter foraging pattern in contrast. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 87-88 } Observations at Crozet Islands revealed most King Penguins were seen within [ 30 km mi on ] of the colony. [ Ridoux V, Jouventin P, Stahl J-C, Weimerskirch H 1988 Ecologie alimentaire comparée des manchots nicheurs aux Iles Crozet Revues Ecologie 43 345–55 ] Using the average swimming speed, Kooyman estimated the distance travelled to foraging areas at [ 28 km mi on ]. Its average swimming speed is 6.5–10  km/h (4–6  mph). On shallower dives under [ 60 m ft on ], it averages [ 2 km/h mph on ] descending and ascending, while on deeper dives over [ 150 m ft on ] deep, it averages [ 5 km/h mph on ] in both directions.

Like all penguins, it is flightless. [ Diet ] { South Georgia Island } { 250px } { thumb } King Penguins eat small fish, and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans. Fish constitute 80–100% of the diet, except in winter months of July and August, when they make up only 30%. Lanternfish are the main fish taken, principally the species Electrona carlsbergi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, as well as Protomyctophum tenisoni. Slender escolar ( Paradiplospinus gracilis ) of the Gempylidae, and Champsocephalus gunneri, is also consumed. Cephalopods consumed include those of the genus Moroteuthis, the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, the Sevenstar Flying Squid ( Martialia hyadesii ), young Gonatus antarcticus and Onychoteuthis species. [ Predators ] The King Penguin&apos;s predator s include birds and aquatic mammals; Skua species (Stercorarius spp.) take small chicks and eggs, while the Snowy Sheathbill (Chionis alba) scavenges for dead chicks and unattended eggs. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 40 } The Leopard Seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) takes adult birds at sea. [ Stonehouse B 1960 The King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicusof South Georgia I. Breeding behaviour and development Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey Scientific Report 23 1–81 ] Orcas may also hunt King Penguins. [ Courtship and breeding ] &apos;&apos; Aptenodytes patagonicus&apos;&apos; { Macquarie Island } The King Penguin is able to breed at three years of age, although only a very small minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 151 } King Penguins are serially monogamous. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 54 } The long breeding cycle may contribute to this low rate. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 152 } The King Penguin has an unusually prolonged breeding cycle, taking some 14–16 months from laying to offspring fledging. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 148 } Although pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They then return to the sea for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 149 } The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300   g (⅔  lb). { Williams (The Penguins) p. 150 } It is initially soft, but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around [ 10 x 7 cm in on ]. The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6–18  days each. Hatching may take up to 2–3  days to complete, and chicks are born semi-altricial and nidicolous. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The young chick is brooded in what is called the guard phase, spending its time balanced on its parents&apos; feet and sheltered by its pouch. { Williams (The Penguins) p. 28 } During this time, the parents alternate every 3–7  days, one incubating while the other forages. This period lasts for 30–40 days before the chicks form crèche s, a group of many chicks together. A penguin can leave its chick at a crèche while it fishes as a few adult penguins stay behind to look after them. Other varieties of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring. By April the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer. King Penguins form huge breeding colonies; for example, the colony on South Georgia Island at Salisbury Plain holds over 100,000 breeding pairs and the one at St. Andrew&apos;s Bay over 100,000 birds. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously occupied. The King Penguin feeds its chicks by eating a fish, digesting it slightly and regurgitating the food into the chick&apos;s mouth. Because of their large size, King Penguin chicks take 14–16 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King Penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone.
