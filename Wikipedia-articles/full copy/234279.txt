By December of that year Loki had gained the rights to produce a port of Activision &apos;s then upcoming strategy game Civilization: Call to Power for Linux. { Interview: Scott Draeker and Sam Latinga, Loki Entertainment } { Linux Journal, August 1, 1999 } This was to become Loki&apos;s first actual product, with the game hitting stores in May 1999. { Civilization: Call to Power for Linux Ships Linux Today, May 7, 1999 } From there they gained contracts to port many other titles, such as Myth II: Soulblighter, Railroad Tycoon II, and Eric&apos;s Ultimate Solitaire. { Loki releases three more games for Linux IDG News Service, May 18, 1999 } Throughout the next two years up until its eventual closure the company would continue to bring more games to Linux. { Loki Retrospective } { LinuxGames, August 13, 2001 } [ Legacy ] Loki Software, although a commercial failure, is credited with the birth of the modern Linux game industry. Loki developed several free software tools, such as the Loki installer (also known as Loki Setup), and supported the development of the Simple DirectMedia Layer. They also started the OpenAL audio library project (now being run by Creative Technology and Apple Inc. ) and with id Software wrote GtkRadiant. These are still often credited as being the cornerstones of Linux game development. They also worked on and extended several already developed tools, such as GCC and GDB. { An Interview with Loki Games&apos; Scott Draeker O&apos;Reilly Media, March 3, 2000 (Article by J. S. Kelly) } The book Programming Linux Games by Loki Software and John R. Hall is recognized as one of the prominent tutorials for the Simple DirectMedia Layer. Many of Loki&apos;s free tools are still actively used and being developed, often by former employees of the company, many of them having moved to other computer game or Linux companies. Loki also offered a start to many figures still in the Linux and gaming industries. Ryan C. Gordon (also known as icculus), a former employee of Loki, has been responsible for the Linux and Mac OS X ports of many commercial games after the demise of the company. Mike Phillips would help start Linux Game Publishing, which was itself founded in response to Loki&apos;s closure. { Interview with LGP&apos;s Mike Phillips LinuxHardware.org, June 16, 2003 } Nicholas Vining would go on to do some porting work and is currently the lead programmer at Gaslamp Games, which would later release their game Dungeons of Dredmor for Linux. { Classic Roguelike : Dungeons of Dredmor Is Coming To GNU/Linux Soon Linux Gaming News, July 19, 2010 } { Coming Soon: Dungeons of Dredmor } { LinuxGames, October 24, 2010 } Sam Lantinga would also later join Blizzard Entertainment and found Galaxy Gameworks to commercially support the Simple DirectMedia Layer. Although many Loki ports are unsupported since Loki&apos;s closure, Linux Game Publishing managed to pick up the rights to MindRover and offer a supported and updated version of the games Linux port. id Software picked up the support for the Linux release of Quake III Arena, { Quake 3 Arena takes Linux by force LinuxWorld, December 3, 2001 } hiring Timothee Besset to maintain it; he would later also be responsible for porting some of id&apos;s later products to Linux. { Interview with id Software&apos;s Timothee Besset } { LinuxGames, August 22, 2004 } Running with Scissors still sells a Linux port of Postal on its website. In 2004 Human Head Studios has released the source code for Rune, but nobody make updates for Linux version. Software contractor Frank C. Earl claims to hold the porting rights for the entire Myth series and says he will port it to Linux. { Upcoming GNU/Linux games!
