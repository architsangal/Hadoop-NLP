His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes popularly called &quot; The Father of Science Fiction &quot;.

Wells and } { Jules Verne } In his honor, the annual Science Fiction Achievement awards are named the &quot; Hugos &quot;. [ Biography ] Born in the Bonnevoie neighborhood of Luxembourg City, Gernsback emigrated to the United States in 1905 and later became a naturalized citizen. [ O&apos;Neil Paul Barnum of the Space Age Life 55 4 pp. 62–68 Time New York July 26, 1963 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DJlIEAAAAMBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA62 0024-3019 ] He married three times: to Rose Harvey in 1906, Dorothy Kantrowitz in 1921, and Mary Hancher in 1951. In 1925, Hugo founded radio station WRNY which broadcast from the 18th floor of The Roosevelt Hotel in New York City and was involved in the first television broadcasts. He is also considered a pioneer in amateur radio. Before helping to create science fiction, Gernsback was an entrepreneur in the electronics industry, importing radio parts from Europe to the United States and helping to popularize amateur &quot; wireless. &quot; In April 1908 he founded Modern Electrics, the world&apos;s first magazine about both electronics and radio, called &quot; wireless &quot; at the time. While the cover of the magazine itself contends it was a catalog, most historians note that it contained articles, features, and plotlines, qualifying it as a magazine. { Massie, K., &amp; Perry, S. D. (2002). Hugo Gernsback and Radio Magazines: An Influential Intersection in Broadcast History. &quot; Journal of Radio Studies, 9, pp. 267-268. } Under its auspices, in January 1909, he founded the Wireless Association of America, which had 10,000 members within a year. In 1912, Gernsback said that he estimated 400,000 people in the U.S. were involved in amateur radio. In 1913, he founded a similar magazine, The Electrical Experimenter, which became Science and Invention in 1920. It was in these magazines that he began including scientific fiction stories alongside science journalism. He died at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City on August 19, 1967.

He was 83 years old and lived at 263 West End Avenue. New York Times August 20, 1967 2010-12-06 ] [ Science fiction ] Gernsback started the modern genre of science fiction by founding the first magazine dedicated to it, Amazing Stories, in 1926. He said he became interested in the concept after reading a translation of the work of Percival Lowell as a child. His idea of a perfect science fiction story was &quot; 75 percent literature interwoven with 25 percent science &quot;. He also played a key role in starting science fiction fandom, by publishing the addresses of people who wrote letters to his magazines. So, the science fiction fans began to organize, and became aware of themselves as a movement, a social force; this was probably decisive for the subsequent history of the genre. He also created the term “science fiction”, though he preferred the term &quot; scientifiction &quot;. In 1929, he lost ownership of his first magazines after a bankruptcy lawsuit. There is some debate about whether this process was genuine, manipulated by publisher Bernarr Macfadden, or was a Gernsback scheme to begin another company. After losing control of Amazing Stories, Gernsback founded two new science fiction magazines, Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories. A year later, due to Depression-era financial troubles, the two were merged into Wonder Stories, which Gernsback continued to publish until 1936, when it was sold to Thrilling Publications and renamed Thrilling Wonder Stories. Gernsback returned in 1952-53 with Science-Fiction Plus. Gernsback was noted for sharp (and sometimes shady { Science-Fiction, The Early Years by Everett F. Bleiler, Kent State University Press, 1990, page 282. } ) business practices, { Lovecraft: a Biography } and for paying his writers extremely low fees [ Banks Michael A.

Society for Amateur Scientists Society for Amateur Scientists 1 October 2004 http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues/2004-10-01/feature1/index.html 2007-02-13 ] or not paying them at all. { The Gernsback Days by Mike Ashley, Michael Ashley, Robert A. W. Lowndes, Wildside Press LLC, 2004, page 241. } H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith referred to him as &quot; Hugo the Rat. &quot; { Lovecraft: a Biography, p. 298. } As Barry Malzberg has said, &quot; Gernsback&apos;s venality and corruption, his sleaziness and his utter disregard for the financial rights of authors, have been so well documented and discussed in critical and fan literature. That the founder of genre science fiction who gave his name to the field&apos;s most prestigious award and who was the Guest of Honor at the 1952 Worldcon was pretty much a crook (and a contemptuous crook who stiffed his writers but paid himself $100K a year as President of Gernsback Publications) has been clearly established. &quot; { &quot; Resnick and Malzberg Dialogues XXXXVI: The Prozines (Part 1) &quot; by Mike Resnick and Barry Malzberg, The SFWA Bulletin, Dec. 2009-Jan. 2010, Volume 43, Issue 5, pages 27-8. } [ Fiction ] Gernsback wrote fiction, including the novel Ralph 124C 41+ in 1911; the title is a pun on the phrase &quot; one to foresee for many &quot; ( &quot; one plus &quot; ). Even though Ralph 124C 41+ is one of the most influential science fiction stories of all time, { The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction by Gary Westfahl, Liverpool University Press, 1999, page 135. } and filled with numerous science fiction ideas, few people still read the story. { Magill&apos;s Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature Volume 3: Lest Darkness Fall by T. A. Shippey and A. J. Sobczak, Salem Press, 1996, page 767. } Brian Aldiss has called the story a &quot; tawdry illiterate tale &quot; and a &quot; sorry concoction &quot; while Lester del Rey called it &quot; simply dreadful. &quot; { The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction by Gary Westfahl, Liverpool University Press, 1999, page 92. } While most other modern critics have little positive to say about the story&apos;s writing, Ralph 124C 41+ is still considered an &quot; essential text for all studies of science fiction. &quot; { The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction by Gary Westfahl, Liverpool University Press, 1999, page 93. } Gernsback&apos;s second (and final) novel, written c.1958, was not published until 1971. Lester del Rey described it simply as &quot; a bad book, &quot; marked more by routine social commentary than by scientific insight or extrapolation. { &quot; Reading Room &quot;, } { If, June 1972, p.111 } Gernsback combined his fiction and science into Everyday Science and Mechanics magazine, serving as the editor in the 1930s. [ Legacy ] The Science Fiction Achievement awards, given to various works each year by vote of the members of the World Science Fiction Society, are named the &quot; Hugo s. &quot; He was one of 1996&apos;s inaugural inductees into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. { http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/ } In 1960 he received a special Hugo Award as &quot; The Father of Magazine Science Fiction. &quot; { http://worldcon.org/hy.html } Gernsback&apos;s importance to science fiction was acknowledged by BioWare, naming a vessel after him in Mass Effect 2. [ Broadcasting Influence ] Gernsback made significant contributions to the growth of early broadcasting, mostly through his efforts as a publisher. He originated the industry of specialized publications for radio with Modern Electrics and the Electrical Experimenter first. Later on, and more influentially, he published Radio News, which would have the largest readership among radio magazines in radio broadcasting’s formative years. Gernsback, who edited Radio News until 1929, made use of the magazine to promote his own interests, including having his radio station’s call letters on the cover starting in 1925. WRNY and Radio News were used to cross-promote each other, with programs on his station often used to discuss articles he had published, and articles in the magazine often covering program activities at WRNY. But he also advocated for future directions in innovation and regulation of radio. The magazine contained many drawings and diagrams, encouraging radio listeners of the 1920s to experiment themselves to improve the technology. WRNY, was often used as a laboratory to see if various radio inventions were worthwhile. Articles that were published about television were also tested in this manner when the radio station was used to send pictures to experimental television receivers in August 1928. The technology, however, was primitive and required sending the sight and sound one after the other rather than sending both at the same time. Such experiments were expensive, and eventually contributed to Gernsback’s Experimenter Publishing Company going into bankruptcy in 1929. { Massie, K., &amp; Perry, S. D. (2002).
