There are currently two parts of the company, Carl Zeiss AG located in Oberkochen with important subsidiaries in Aalen, Göttingen and Munich, and Carl Zeiss GmbH located in Jena. The organisation is named after a founder, the German optician Carl Zeiss (1816–1888). Carl Zeiss is the premier company of the Zeiss Gruppe, one of the two large divisions of the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung. The Zeiss Gruppe is located in Heidenheim and Jena. The other division of the Carl Zeiss Foundation, the glass manufacturer Schott AG and Jenaer Glaswerk, is located in Mainz and Jena. Carl Zeiss is one of the oldest existing optics manufacturers in the world. [ Zeiss corporate history ] Carl Zeiss Jena (1910) The manufacturer Zeiss in Göttingen Carl Zeiss opened an optics workshop in Jena in 1846. By 1847 he was making microscopes full-time. By 1861 Zeiss was considered to be among the best scientific instruments in Germany with about 20 people working under him with his business still growing. By 1866 the Zeiss workshop sold their 1,000 th microscope. In 1872 physicist Ernst Abbe joined Zeiss and along with Otto Schott designed greatly improve lenses for the optical instruments they were producing. After Carl Zeiss&apos;s death in 1888, the business was incorporated as the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung in 1889. By World War I, { Carl Zeiss—A History Of A Most Respected Name In Optics. } Zeiss was the world&apos;s largest location of camera production. Zeiss Ikon represented a significant part of the production along with dozens of other brands and factories, and also had major works at Dresden. In 1928 Hensoldt AG was acquired by Carl Zeiss and has produced the Zeiss binoculars and riflescopes since 1964., { 150 Years of Hensoldt } occasionally resulting in twin products being offered under both the Hensoldt and Zeiss brand names. The Hensoldt System Technology division (resulting from a merger of the military optics operations of Leica and Hensoldt) was continued by Zeiss under the Hensoldt name until 2006. As part of Nazi Germany Zwangsarbeiter program, Zeiss used forced labour during the Second World War. [ Gruner Wolf Jewish forced labor under the Nazis: economic needs and racial aims, 1938-1944 Cambridge University Press 2006 0-521-83875-4 http://ebookee.org/Jewish-Forced-Labor-under-the-Nazis-Economic-Needs-and-Racial-Aims-1938-1944_1120580.html ] [ Klemperer Victor Victor Klemperer To The Bitter End: The Diaries of Victor Klemperer 1942-45 Phoenix 2000 0-7538-1069-7 ] The destruction of the war caused many companies to divide into smaller subcompanies and others to merge together. There was great respect for the engineering innovation that came out of Dresden —before the war the world&apos;s first 35  mm single-lens reflex camera, the Kine Exakta, and the first miniature camera with good picture quality were developed there. At the end of the war Jena was occupied by the US Army. When Jena and Dresden were incorporated into the Soviet occupation zone, later East Germany, Zeiss Jena was assisted by the US army to relocate to the Contessa manufacturing facility in Stuttgart, West Germany, while the remainder of Zeiss Jena was taken over by the (Eastern) German Democratic Republic as Kombinat VEB Zeiss Jena. { http://www.contaxcameras.co.uk/history.asp } As part of the World War II reparations, the Soviet army took most of the existing Zeiss factories and tooling back to the Soviet Union as the Kiev camera works. The western business was restarted in Oberkochen (in southwestern Germany) as Opton Optische Werke Oberkochen GmbH in 1946, which became Zeiss-Opton Optische Werke Oberkochen GmbH in 1947, but was soon renamed to Carl Zeiss. West German Zeiss products were labelled Opton for sale in the Eastern bloc, while East German Zeiss products were labelled &quot; Zeiss Jena &quot; for sale in Western countries. In 1973, the Western Carl Zeiss AG entered into a licensing agreement with the Japanese camera company Yashica to produce a series of high-quality 35  mm film cameras and lenses bearing the Contax and Zeiss brand names. This collaboration continued under Yashica&apos;s successor, Kyocera, until the latter ceased all camera production in 2005. Zeiss later produced lenses for the space industry and, more recently, has again produced high-quality 35  mm camera lenses. The eastern Zeiss Jena was also well known for producing high-quality products Following German reunification, VEB Zeiss Jena--reckoned as one of the few East German firms that was even potentially able to compete on a global basis--became Zeiss Jena GmbH, which became Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH in 1990. In 1991, Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena was split in two, with Carl Zeiss AG (Oberkochen) taking over the company&apos;s divisions for microscopy and other precision optics (effectively reuniting the pre-war Carl Zeiss enterprise) and moving its microscopy and planetarium divisions back to Jena. Jenoptik GmbH was split off as a specialty company in the areas of photonics, optoelectronics, and mechatronics.

Zeiss nonetheless still continues to be a camera manufacturer, and still produces the Pentacon, Praktica, and special-use lenses (e.g., Exakta). Today, there are arguably three companies with primarily Zeiss Ikon heritage: Zeiss Germany, the Finnish/Swedish Ikon (which bought the West German Zeiss Ikon AG), and the independent eastern Zeiss Ikon. [ Innovations ] The Zeiss company was responsible for many innovations in optical design and engineering. Early on, Carl Zeiss realised that he needed a competent scientist so as to take the firm beyond just being another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of Dr Ernst Abbe was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology. Abbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate astigmatism from microscopes, he realised that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve, if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by Dr Otto Schott, who established the famous glassworks at Jena from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888 to be employed by Zeiss and other makers. The new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by Voigtländer, but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting astigmatism, and in the production of apochromatic lenses. Abbe started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further. Zeiss&apos; domination of photographic lens innovation was due to Dr Paul Rudolph. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, and appropriately named &quot; Anastigmat &quot;. This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark &quot; Protar &quot; which was first used in 1900. At the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by C.P. Goerz, designed by Emil von Hoegh. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length. But the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units. Rudolph also investigated the Double-Gauss concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive meniscii enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from coma which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage. Probably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for Dallmeyer of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed it was used extensively on hand cameras. The most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the Tessar, first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be a most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917, and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configuration. Rudolph left Zeiss after the First World War, but many other competent designers such as Merté, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designer was the ex-Ernemann man Dr Ludwig Bertele, famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens. With the advent of the Contax by Zeiss-Ikon, the first serious challenge to the Leica in the field of professional 35  mm cameras, both Zeiss-Ikon and Carl Zeiss decided to beat the Leica in every possible way. Bertele&apos;s Sonnar series of lenses designed for the Contax were the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars. The last important Zeiss innovation before the Second World War was the technique of applying anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces. A lens so treated was marked with a red &quot; T &quot;, short for &quot; Transparent &quot;. The technique of applying multiple layers of coating was developed from this basis after the war, and known as &quot; T✻ &quot; (T-star). After the partitioning of Germany, a new Carl Zeiss optical company was established in Oberkochen, while the original Zeiss firm in Jena continued to operate. At first both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena&apos;s new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for the 35  mm single-lens reflex camera, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for large format cameras, interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35  mm single-lens reflex Contaflex, and other types of cameras. Since the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme which allows other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included Voigtländer, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Ross, Koristka, Krauss, Kodak. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon got together with Yashica to produce the new Contax cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica&apos;s optical arm, Tomioka. As Yashica&apos;s owner Kyocera ended camera production in 2006, and Yashica lenses were then made by Cosina, who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is Sony who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras. [ Reputation ] Now over 150 years old, Zeiss continues to be associated with expensive and high-quality optical lenses. Zeiss lenses are generally thought to be elegant and well-constructed, yielding high-quality images. Even old lens designs such as the Tessar demonstrate engineering elegance and in the modern age of plastic parts, many Zeiss lenses are still made with predominantly metal components. Zeiss licenses its technology to be manufactured by third-party companies and indeed, many have done so. Notable names include Hasselblad, a famous name in medium format professional cameras. Rollei, Yashica, Sony, Logitech and Alpa amongst others, have used or manufactured lenses under Zeiss license. The Contax line of 35  mm cameras, first produced by Yashica and subsequently Kyocera until 2005 are perhaps the most well known to fit Zeiss lenses. Notably absent from this list are Canon, Nikon, and Pentax, who by and large produce their own lenses. On 27 April 2005 the company announced a collaboration with Nokia in the camera phone market. The first product to emerge out of this collaboration is the Nokia N90. Outside the world of cameras and imaging, Zeiss also produces spectacle lenses, particularly lenses made from high refractive index glass, allowing people whose prescriptions require stronger spectacles to use thinner lenses. These are sold in many countries. As of 2010 Carl Zeiss eyeglass lenses are sold in the United States through Carl Zeiss Vision Inc. { Carl Zeiss, Ophthalmic Products – About Us } The Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology subsidiary is a respected source of coordinate measurement machine s and mutidimensional metrology systems. Zeiss is a recognized partner to the automotive industry. { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – About Us } A unique triplet of ultra-fast 50  mm [ 0.7 ] lenses originally created by Zeiss for NASA&apos;s lunar program had the distinction of being reused by Stanley Kubrick in the filming of his historical drama, &quot; Barry Lyndon &quot;. The period atmosphere of the film demanded that several indoor scenes be filmed by candlelight. To facilitate this, Kubrick had, with great difficulty, the lenses modified to mount onto a cinema camera and two of them subsequently further modified in separate ways to give wider angles of view. { http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm } { http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luciolepri.it%2Flc2%2Fmarcocavina%2Fomaggio_a_kubrick.htm &amp; sl=it &amp; tl=en &amp; hl=en &amp; ie=UTF-8 } Zeiss is currently in the process of designing the optical components for the James Webb Space Telescope set to replace the Hubble Space Telescope sometime in 2014. [ Products ] { stereoscope } Zeiss and its subsidiaries offer a wide range of products related to optics and vision. These include camera and cine lenses, microscopes and microscopy software, binoculars and spotting scope s, eyeglasses and lenses, planetarium s and dome video-systems, optics for military applications ( head tracker systems, submarine periscope s, targeting systems), optical sensors, industrial metrology systems and ophthalmology products. Even video glasses belong to the product range. In the summer of 2012, the new video glasses Cinemizer OLED will come on the market. In addition to the viewing of 2D and 3D movies, it will be possible to play PC games when it is fitted with equipment. { 3D-capable video glasses with Head Tracker for Games (german), Golem, retrieved March 3, 2012. } The largest part of Carl Zeiss AG&apos;s revenue is generated by its Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologies division, which produces lithographic systems for the semiconductor industry as well as process control solutions (electron microscopes, mask repair tools, helium ion microscopes). { Slides of Half-Year Press Conference for fiscal year 2007/08, May 29th, 2008 } [ Sports Optics ] Carl Zeiss Sports Optics division produces rifle scopes, spotting scopes, binoculars, and distance measuring devices for outdoors enthusiasts. The two main product lines are the Conquest line, which is manufactured in Germany and assembled in the United States, and Victory line, which is produced entirely in Germany. Zeiss Sports Optics are revered among the best in the world, and are utilized by military and law enforcement angencies in countries around the world.

It is divided in Ophthalmology/Optometry, Neurosurgery, ENT, Spine, P &amp; R, Dentistry, Radiotherapy and Gynecology. [ Vision Care ] Carl Zeiss Vision Care division develops, manufactures and distributes ophthalmic lenses, lens coatings and dispensary technologies and services. [ Industrial Metrology ] [ section March 2012 ] Zeiss Industrial Metrology specializes in high accuracy measurement systems, including coordinate measuring machine s, computed tomography measurement machines (non-medical), optical measuring equipment, metrology software and measurement sensor systems. The Industrial Metrology subsidiary provides this equipment to a wide range of manufacturing facilities worldwide. { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – Products and Technology } Zeiss has manufactured coordinate measuring machine s (CMM&apos;s) since 1919, { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – 90 Years in Industrial Metrology } offering very basic manually operated CMM&apos;s. In 1973, Zeiss introduced the UMM 500, using a Zeiss sensor system and Hewlett Packard computer. { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – History } Zeiss has since vastly improved and diversified their product line and now feature many high accuracy CMM&apos;s, the Metrotom, { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – The Metrotom } a CT x-ray scanning measuring machine, with the ability to quickly and completely measure a part in 3 dimensions without ever touching the part, and the O-INSPECT, { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – The O-INSPECT } a fully optical measurement machine. Zeiss is currently a member of the International Association of CMM Manufacturers (IACMM). { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – About Us } Many of the sensor systems produced by Zeiss are proprietary technologies, using technologies exclusively patented by Zeiss, and therefore can offer better accuracy and repeatability than its competitors. { Carl Zeiss, Industrial Metrology – CMM Sensor Systems } Zeiss was the first manufacturer of coordinate measurement machine s to introduce computer numerical control (CNC) technology to a coordinate measuring machine. Zeiss was the first company to offer CNC stylus changer capability for coordinate measuring machine s. [ Microscopes ] [ February 2008 ] Zeiss offers many different types of microscopes: Optical microscope s Laser Scanning Microscopes (LSMs) Scanning Electron Microscope s (SEMs) Transmission Electron Microscope s (TEMs) Scanning Helium Ion Microscope s (SHIMs) [ Cameras ] [ Zeiss Ikon Camera ] Zeiss Ikon is the name given to a range of top-quality cameras produced by a sister company of Carl Zeiss. Over the years, a number of camera models had carried the same name, leading to confusion among users who are unfamiliar with Carl Zeiss naming system. Zeiss Ikon users usually refer to their cameras using Zeiss&apos; catalogue number, as everything sold by Zeiss was assigned one. The latest Zeiss Ikon rangefinder camera was introduced by Zeiss in 2004 and is similar to the Leica M series cameras. The new camera, manufactured in Japan by Cosina, is fully compatible with Leica and other lenses with the Leica M mount. The name Zeiss Ikon can also be found in old cinemas, for example on fire shutters on the projection windows. These had heat fuses that melted and dropped the shutter over the hole if the film caught fire in the projection booth. [ Camera lenses ] [ Cinema lenses ] Carl Zeiss AG has long been renowned for its motion picture lenses. Zeiss manufactures prime, and zoom lenses for 35mm, 16mm, and 65mm film production. They also make lenses for digital cinema, and high definition video.

For decades until the introduction of their 35mm camera still lenses (the ZM rangefinder lenses and the ZF.2 (formerly ZF)/ZE/ZA SLR lens ranges, as well as the SLR lenses&apos; industrial variants) this was Zeiss&apos;s mainstay in the photographic market. [ Large Format Lenses ] Although rarely seen today Zeiss once produced lenses for large format photography. One notable Zeiss lens used for large format photography was the Zeiss Biogon. The Biogon large format lens was designed to be used at a fully open aperture on 4x5 press cameras with limited degradation in image quality. { http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/zeiss75biogon.htm } While Zeiss large format lenses have entered a niche market, companies such as Schneider Optics, Rodenstock, and Nikon dominate the field; some modern lens designs are based on Zeiss&apos;s Biogon design including the popular Nikkor 90mm F8 SW large format lens. { http://www.thalmann.com/largeformat/future.htm } [ ZM lenses ] The ZM line are lenses made for the Leica M mount and for the new Zeiss Ikon camera. They are also compatible with other rangefinder camera bodies with M Mount e.g. the Konica Hexar RF (KM Mount), the Cosina Voigtländer Bessa RxM/RxA series ( VM mount ), the Rollei 35RF and the Epson R-D series.
