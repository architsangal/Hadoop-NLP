[ 44.973972 N 74.663590 W title ] Administration and community building of St. Regis Mohawk Reservation St. Regis Mohawk Reservation is a Mohawk Indian reservation in Franklin County, New York, United States. It is also known by its Mohawk name, Akwesasne. The population was 3,288 at the 2010 census. The reservation is adjacent to the Akwesasne reserve in Ontario and Quebec. The Mohawk consider the entire community to be one unit. The reservation contains the villages of Hogansburg and St. Regis. Under the terms of the Jay Treaty (1794), the Mohawk people may pass freely across the International Boundary. The two parts of the reservation are separated by the St. Lawrence River and the 45th parallel. The Mohawk are one of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois, historically based in present-day New York, and the &quot; Keepers of the Eastern Door &quot;. The reservation adopted gambling in the 1980s. It has caused deep controversy. Broadly speaking, the elected chiefs and the Warrior Society have supported gambling, while the traditional chiefs have opposed it. Today, the reservation is home to the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino and the Mohawk Bingo Palace. The elected tribal governments on the New York and Canadian sides and the traditional chiefs of Akwesasne often work together as a &quot; Tri-Council &quot; concerning areas of shared interest, for example to negotiate land claims settlements. The Mohawk Tribe views the reservation as a &quot; sovereign nation, &quot; but shares jurisdiction with the State of New York, the United States, and the Town of Bombay, in which it is located. [ Geography ] The reservation is at the international border of Canada and the United States along the St. Lawrence River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a total area of 21.0 mi² (54.3  km²). 19.0  mi² (49.2  km²) of it is land and 2.0  mi² (5.1  km²) of it (9.45%) is water. [ Demographics ] As of the census [ 2 ] of 2000, there were 2,699 people, 904 households, and 668 families residing in the Indian reservation within the US boundary. The population density was 142.2/mi² (54.9/km²). There were 977 housing units at an average density of 51.5/mi² (19.9/km²).

[ Controversies ] This reservation has allegedly become a center for smuggling of many items, including liquor, cigarettes and drugs. { BIA grant to help Akwesasne combat border drug smuggling, Indian Country Today, 17 Mar 2006 } [ February 2010 ] Federal agencies of the United States and Canada and those of the New York State government are collaborating to stop this activity. These allegations have been hotly contested by Akwesasne police and government spokespersons. The chief of the Akwesasne Mohawk police has suggested that Akwesasne has been singled out for criticism when the smuggling problems stretch across the entire US-Canada border. New York state has threatened to collect sales tax from sales of gasoline and cigarettes on the reservations but has not done so. The legislature often passes such a resolution. { http://www.tax.state.ny.us/pdf/publications/sales/pub750_804.pdf } [ February 2010 ] New York state citizens fail to report their applicable Use Tax es; this has become a problem both here and at areas surrounding other Indian reservations across New York. Merchants near the reservations complain that the tax-free sales constitute an unfair advantage for Indian-owned businesses. People on the reservation tend to respond that this is the only advantage they have. { &quot; New York Company States American Indians Supporting International Terrorists &quot;, American Chronicle } While the government officials argue, a Zogby poll in 2006 showed that 79% of New York residents did not think sales taxes should be collected from reservation sales. { David Staba, &quot; Analysis &quot;, Niagara Falls Reporter, 21 Mar 2006, accessed 25 Feb 2010 } [ History ] The original settlement was known as Saint Régis, presumably after the Catholic saint of the same name and was founded by Catholic Native American Iroquois from Caughnawaga Quebec in about 1755. {, The New international encyclopedia, Volume 15, edited by Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore Colby, c. 1904, accessed 8 July 2010 at www.googlebooks.org } [ In popular culture ] Although not directly named, the reservation is the setting for the 2008 movie Frozen River. It depicts smuggling of illegal immigrants by Mohawk and associated Americans across the international border between Canada and the U.S. The film was made in Plattsburgh, New York. The reservation was the setting for a Tom Swift children&apos;s book series (1910–1941).
