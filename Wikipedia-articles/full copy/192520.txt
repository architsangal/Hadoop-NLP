[ beliefs ] Tawhid ( Arabic : [ ar توحيد ] [ ar tawḥīd ]; [ doctrine of Oneness [of God ] ]; also transliterated Tawheed, and Tauheed.) is the concept of monotheism in Islam. { From the article on Tawhid in Oxford Islamic Studies Online } It is the religion&apos;s most fundamental concept and holds God (Arabic: Allah ) is one ( [ ar wāḥid ] ) and unique ( ahad ). [ Allah Encyclopædia Britannica Online 2008-05-28 http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005770/Allah ] The Qu&apos;ran asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique, independent and indivisible being, who is independent of the entire creation. { Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562 } God according to Islam is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal or parochial one—is an absolute, who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil. { Asma Barlas (2002), p.96 } Tawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession. { D. Gimaret, Tawhid, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } The first part of the Shahada is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God. To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur&apos;an. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid. { Tariq Ramadan (2005), p.203 } There is an uncompromising monotheism at the heart of the Islamic beliefs which distinguishes Islam from some other major religion s. { Turner (2006), p.75 } Islamic intellectual history can be understood as a gradual unfolding of the manner in which successive generations of believers have understood the meaning and implications of professing God&apos;s Unity.Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it. Islamic theology, jurisprudence, philosophy, Sufism, even to some degree the Islamic understanding of natural sciences, all seek to explain at some level the principle of tawhid. { Tabatabaei (1981), p.23 } [ Tawhid in the Qur&apos;an ] The Qur&apos;an is the main information source for understanding the oneness of God in Islam. All Muslim authorities maintain that a true understanding of God is impossible unless He introduces Himself due to the fact that God is beyond the range of human vision and senses [ April 2010 ]. Therefore God tells people who He is by speaking through the prophet. According to this view the fundamental message of all of the prophets is &quot; There is no god but God. &quot; { Chittick (2006), p.47 } The Qur&apos;an asserts the existence of a single, absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique being who is independent of the creation; a real being indivisible into hypostatic entities or incarnated manifestation. According to the Qur&apos;an: [ 112 1 4 ns ] [ 6 113 ns ] According to Vincent J. Cornall, the Qur&apos;an also provides a monist image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things: &quot; He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has full knowledge of all things. &quot; (Sura [ 57 3 nosup no ] ) &quot; Some Muslims have however vigorously criticized interpretations that would lead to a monist view of God for what they see as blurring the distinction between the creator and the creature, and its incompatibility with the genuine and absolute monotheism of Islam. { Roger S. Gottlie (2006), p.210 } The Qur&apos;anic passages Sura [ 34 20-24 nosup no ], Sura [ 35 40 nosup no ] and Sura [ 46 4 nosup no ] provide a basic understanding of the serious nature and consequences of assigning partners or equals to God, a sin known in Islam as Shirk. God will forgive any sin except a person who dies while committing Shirk. The verse [ 34 20-24 nosup no ] rejects the idea of duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate from God&apos;s creative act and that the evil forces have no creative power. { R. Kevin Jaques, Shirk, Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, pp.630-631 } The Qur&apos;an relates the story of Abraham in order to provide an example of an intellectual quest for understanding God as the Cause of Causes: Related in verses [ 6 75-79 nosup no ], Abraham moves progressively from worshipping the stars, the moon, and the sun to acknowledging God as the sole cause of the heavenly phenomena. [ Names of God in Islam ] [ 99 Names of God ] In order to explain the complexity of unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur&apos;an uses 99 terms referred to as &quot; Excellent Names of God &quot; (Sura 7:180). Aside from the supreme name &quot; Allah &quot; and the neologism al-Rahman (referring to the divine beneficence that creates and maintains the universe), other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God&apos;s immanence rather than being a sign of one&apos;s divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God&apos;s transcendent nature. Attribution of divinity to a created entity, shirk, is considered as a denial of the truth of God and thus a major sin. [ Shirk ] [ Shirk (Islam) ] Associating others with God is known as Shirk. It is usually but not always in the form of idolatry and supplicating others than Allah, or believing that they hold the same attributes as Him in an equal or lesser degree. Shirk is divided into two categories; *Greater shirk (Shirk-al-Akbar): open and apparent * Lesser shirk (Shirk-al-Asghar): concealed or hidden. Greater Shirk consists of the above mentioned deeds. A person commits lesser shirk (Shirk-al-Asghar) or hidden polytheism when he claims to believe in God but his thoughts and action does not reflect his belief. There are also minor forms of Shirk, they must be avoided as well; these include commiting a good deed to show off, making an oath in the name of anyone except for God. Within Islam, shirk is an unforgivable crime; God may forgive any sin if one dies in that state except for committing shirk, repentance is required for its forgiveness. { http://islamqa.info/en/ref/20482 } { http://islamqa.info/en/ref/34171 } This is mentioned in the Qur&apos;an: [ 4 48 ns ] [ Discerning unity of God ] Vincent J. Cornell, a scholar of Islamic studies quotes the following statement from Ali : { To know God is to know his oneness. To say that God is one has four meanings: two of them are false and two are correct. As for the two meaning that are false, one is that a person should say &quot; God is one &quot; and be thinking of number and counting. This is false because that which has no second cannot enter into the category of number. Do you not see that those who say that God is a third of a trinity fall into this infidelity? Another meaning is to say, &quot; So-and-So is one of his people, &quot; namely, a species of this genus or a member of this species. This meaning is also false when applied to God, because it implies likening something to God, whereas God is above all likeness. As to the two meaning that are correct when applied to God, one is that it should be said that &quot; God is one &quot; in the sense that there is no likeness to him among things. Another is to say that &quot; God is one &quot; in the sense that there is no multiplicity or division conceivable in Him, neither outwardly, nor in the mind, nor in the imagination. God alone possesses such a unity. } [ Arguments for the oneness of God ] [ Theological arguments ] Theologians usually use reason and deduction to prove existence, unity and oneness of the God. They use teleological argument for the existence of God as a creator based on perceived evidence of order, purpose, design, or direction—or some combination of these—in nature. Teleology is the supposition that there is purpose or directive principle in the works and processes of nature. { يك‌ برهان‌ لمّی نيز در اين‌ باب‌ مطرح‌ شده‌ است‌: يكدستی و يكتايی عالم‌ (خَلْق‌) از يك‌ پديدآورنده‌ و مدبّر حكايت‌ می كند....«ذهن‌ سليم‌ متنبه‌ میشود از شدت‌ ارتباط‌ عالَم‌، بعضی به‌ بعض‌ ديگر، بر وحدت‌ خالق توحيد در كلام Encyclopedia Islamica } The arguments are thereby circular and thus invalid from a syllogistic point of view. Another way which is used frequently by theologians is Reductio ad absurdum. They use it instead of positive arguments as a more efficient way to reject the idea of opponents. {. استدلال‌ بر توحيد، مسبوق‌ به‌ پذيرش‌ وجود خداست‌ و طبعاً در صورت‌بندی آن‌، غالباً مواجهه‌ با مدعيان‌ و معتقدان‌ به‌ دو يا چند خدا در نظر بوده‌ و نظريه‌ ثنويها و مجوس‌ و نصارا ابطال‌ میشده‌ است‌. به‌ همين‌ سبب‌ از قديمترين‌ زمان‌، متكلمان‌ برای دفاع‌ از آموزه‌ توحيد و اثبات‌ آن‌، احتجاج‌ به‌ روش‌ خُلف‌ را كارآمدتر از ارائه‌ ادله‌ اثباتی میدانسته‌اند. آنان‌ بيشترِ دلايل‌ توحيد را با اين‌ رويكرد ارائه كرده اند. توحيد در كلام Encyclopedia Islamica } Quran has also used this way in several cases. [ God as the Cause of Causes ] [ Kalam cosmological argument ] Against the polytheism of pre-Islamic Arabia, the Qur&apos;an argued that the knowledge of God as the creator of everything rules out the possibility of lesser gods since these beings must be themselves created. For the Qur&apos;an, God is an immanent and transcendent deity who actively creates, maintains and destroys the universe. The reality of God as the ultimate cause of things is however veiled from human understanding because of the secondary causes and contingent realities of things in the world. Thus the belief in the oneness of God is equated in the Qur&apos;an with the &quot; belief in the unseen &quot; (Sura [ 2 3 nosup no ] ). The Qur&apos;an summarizes its task in making this &quot; unseen &quot;, to a greater or lesser degree &quot; seen &quot; so that the belief in the existence of God becomes a Master-Truth rather than an unreasonable belief. The Qur&apos;an states that the God&apos;s signals are so near and yet so far, demanding its students to listen to what it has to say with humility (Sura [ 50 33 nosup no ], Sura [ 50 37 nosup no ] ). The Qur&apos;an aims to draw attention to certain obvious facts, turning them into &quot; reminders &quot; of God instead of providing lengthy &quot; theological &quot; proofs for the existence and unity of God. { Fazlur Rahman (1980), p.2 } Ash&apos;ari theologians rejected cause and effect in essence, but accepting it as something that facilitates humankind&apos;s investigation and comprehension of natural processes. These medieval scholars argued that the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were &quot; re-created &quot; at every instant by God. The laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes (customs of God), the ultimate cause of each accident being God himself. { Robert G. Mourison (2002) } [ God as the Necessary Existent ] [ Cosmological argument ontological argument ] An ontological argument for the existence of God was first proposed by Avicenna (965-1037) in the Metaphysics section of The Book of Healing { Steve A. Johnson (1984), &quot; Ibn Sina&apos;s Fourth Ontological Argument for God&apos;s Existence &quot;, The Muslim World 74 (3-4), 161–171. } [ Morewedge P. Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Malcolm and the Ontological Argument Monist 54 234–49 ] which is known as Contingency and necessity argument (Imakan wa Wujub). Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (Mahiat) and existence (Wujud). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect. [ Islam 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Online 2007-11-27 http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam ] This was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna&apos;s proof of God&apos;s existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument. &quot; It is ontological insofar as ‘necessary existence’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent &quot;. The proof is also &quot; cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent. &quot; [ Toby Mayer Ibn Sina&apos;s &apos;Burhan Al-Siddiqin&apos; 2001 Journal of Islamic Studies Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, Oxford Journals, Oxford University Press 12 1 18–39 10.1093/jis/12.1.18 ] Another argument Avicenna presented for God&apos;s existence was the problem of the mind-body dichotomy. [ Forming the Mind: Essays on the Internal Senses and the Mind/Body Problem from Avicenna to the Medical Enlightenment Springer Science+Business Media September 30, 2007 978-1-4020-6083-0 edited by Henrik Lagerlund. ] According to Avicenna, the universe consists of a chain of actual beings, each giving existence to the one below it and responsible for the existence of the rest of the chain below. Because an actual infinite is deemed impossible by Avicenna, this chain as a whole must terminate in a being that is wholly simple and one, whose essence is its very existence, and therefore is self-sufficient and not in need of something else to give it existence. Because its existence is not contingent on or necessitated by something else but is necessary and eternal in itself, it satisfies the condition of being the necessitating cause of the entire chain that constitutes the eternal world of contingent existing things. Thus his ontological system rests on the conception of God as the Wajib al-Wujud (necessary existent). There is a gradual multiplication of beings through a timeless emanation from God as a result of his self-knowledge. [ Nasr Seyyed Hossein Seyyed Hossein Nasr Avicenna 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Online 2007-11-05 http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011433/Avicenna ] { AVICENNA&apos;S COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR GOD&apos;S EXISTENCE } [ Indivisibility of God&apos;s sovereignty ] The Qur&apos;an argues that there can be no multiple sources of divine sovereignty since &quot; behold, each god would have taken away what [each] had created, And some would have Lorded it over others! &quot; The Qur&apos;an argues that the stability and order prevailing throughout the universe shows that it was created and is being administered by only one God (Sura [ 28 70-72 nosup no ] ). Verses 27:60-64 for example read: { Fazlur Rahman (1980), p.67, 6 } [ 6 60 64 ns ] The Qur&apos;an in verse 21:22 states: &quot; If there were numerous gods instead of one, [the heavens and the earth] would be in a sorry state &quot;. Later Muslim theologians elaborated on this verse saying that the existence of at least two gods would inevitably arise between them, at one time or another, a conflict of wills. Since two contrary wills could not possibly be realized at the same time, one of them must admit himself powerless in that particular instance. On the other hand, a powerless being can not by definition be a god. Therefore the possibility of having more than one god is ruled out. { Mustansir Mir, Polytheism and Atheism, } { Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } [ Other arguments ] The Qur&apos;an argues that human beings have an instinctive distaste for polytheism : At times of crisis, for example, even the idolaters forget the false deities and call upon the one true God for help. As soon as they are relieved from the danger, they however start associating other beings with God (Sura [ 29 65 nosup no ] ). Next, the Qur&apos;an argues that polytheism takes away from human dignity: God has honored human beings and given them charge of the physical world, and yet they disgrace their position in the world by worshipping what they carve out with their own hands. Lastly, the Qur&apos;an argues that monotheism is a not a later discovery made by the human race, but rather there is the combined evidence of the prophetic call for monotheism throughout human history starting from Adam. The Qur&apos;an suggests several causes for deviation from monotheism to polytheism: Great temporal power, regarded by the holder and his subjects as &apos;absolute&apos; — may lead the holder to think that he is God-like; such claims were commonly forced upon, and accepted by, those who were subject to the ruler. Also, certain natural phenomena (such as the sun, the moon and the stars) inspire feelings of awe, wonder or admiration that could lead some to regard these celestial bodies as deities. Another reason for deviation from monotheism is when one becomes a slave to his or her base desires and passions. In seeking to always satisfy the desires, he or she may commit a kind of polytheism. [ Atheism ] The following Qur&apos;anic verse is sometimes cited as a Qur&apos;an argument against atheism. The verse reads: [ 45 24 ns ] [ Interpretations ] [ Early Islamic philosophy ] Understanding of the meaning of Tawhid is one of the most controversial issues among Muslims. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it, comprising textualistic approach, theological approach, philosophical approach and Sufism and Irfan i approach. These different approaches lead to different and in some cases opposite understanding of the issue. [ Textualistic approach ] [ Athari ] The Textualistists or literalists by reason of their conception of the divine Attributes, came to represent the divinity as a complex of names and qualifications alongside the divine essence itself. The Athari methodology of textual interpretation is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation. { Corbin (1993), p. 115 } [ Theological viewpoints ] Certain theologians use the term Tawhid in a much broader meaning to denote the totality of discussion of God, his existence and his various attributes. Others go yet further and use the term to ultimately represent the totality of the &quot; principles of religion &quot;. In its current usage, the expressions &quot; Tawhid &quot; or &quot; knowledge of Tawhid &quot; are sometimes used as an equivalent for the whole Kalam, the Islamic theology. [ Mu&apos;tazili school ] [ Mu&apos;tazili ] The Mu&apos;tazilis liked to call themselves the men of the tawhid (ahl al-tawhid). In Maqalat al-Islamiyin, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&apos;ari describes the Mu&apos;tazilite conception of the tawhid as follows { Corbin (1993), pp. 109 and 110 } : God is unique, nothing is like him; he is neither body, nor individual, nor substance, nor accident. He is beyond time. He cannot dwell in a place or within a being; he is not the object of any creatural attribute or qualification. He is neither conditioned nor determined, neither engendered nor engendering. He is beyond the perception of the senses. The eyes cannot see him, observation cannot attain him, the imagination cannot comprehend him. He is a thing, but he is not like other things; he is omniscient, all-powerful, but his omniscience and his all-mightiness cannot be compared to anything created. He created the world without any pre-established archetype and without an auxiliary. According to Henry Corbin, the result of this interpretation is the negation of the divine attributes, the affirmation of the created Quran, and the denial of all possibility of the vision of God in the world beyond. { Corbin (1993), p. 110 } Mu&apos;tazilis believed thatGod is deprived of all positive attributes, in the sense that all divine qualifications must be understood as being the essence itself. They resorted to metaphorical interpretations of Qur&apos;anic verses or Prophetic reports with seemingly anthropomorphic content, e.g., the hand is the metaphorical designation of power; the face signifies the essence; the fact that God is seated on the Throne is a metaphorical image of the divine reign, and so on. [ Ash&apos;ari school ] [ Ash&apos;ari ] The solution proposed by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&apos;ari to solve the problems of tashbih and ta&apos;til concedes that the divine Being possesses in a real sense the Attributes and Names mentioned in the Qur&apos;an. Insofar as these Names and Attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they do not have either existence or reality apart from it. The inspiration of al-Ash&apos;ari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level—something which Mu&apos;tazilis thinking had failed to grasp. { Corbin (1993), pp. 115 and 116 } [ Twelvers theology ] [ Theology of Twelvers ] Twelvers theology is based on the Hadith which have been narrated from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth Imams and compiled by Shia scholars such as Al-Shaykh al-Saduq in al-Tawhid. { Tabatabaei (19981), pp. 23 and 24 } According to Shia theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God. Any suggestion of these attributes and names being convinced of as separate is thought to entail polytheism. It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence. Also God has no physical form and he is insensible. { Momen (1985), p.176 } [ Philosophical viewpoints ] [ Islamic Philosophy Avicennism ] Al-Farabi, Al-Razi and especially Avicenna put forward an interpretation of Tawhid in light of reason, with the Qur&apos;an and Hadith serving as a basis. Before Avicenna the discussions among Muslim philosophers were about the unity of God as divine creator and his relationship with the world as creation. The earlier philosophers were affected by the Plotinus &apos; ideas. &lt; ref &gt; [ Influences on the Muslim culture ] The Islamic doctrine of Tawhid puts forth a God whose rule, will or law are comprehensive and extend to all creatures and to all aspects of the human life. Early Muslims understood religion to thus cover the domains of state, law and society. { John Esposito (1998), p.24 } It is believed that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid. In the following, we provide a few examples of the influences of Tawhid on the Muslim culture: Interpersonal relationship According to the Qur&apos;an, one consequence of properly conceived relationship between God and Man as the served and servant, is the proper relationship among humans. In order to achieve the former, the Qur&apos;an consistently &quot; reminds &quot; men of two points: 1. That God is one; everything except God (including the entirety of nature) is contingent upon God. 2. With all His might and glory, God is essentially the all-merciful God. { Fazlur Rahman(1980), peacep.2-3 } Satanic Logic According to the Qur&apos;an, Satan deviated from the oneness of God in the story of creation of man by permitting his own hierarchical value system to supersede God&apos;s will: God asked the angels to bow to Adam, who he had created from clay. Satan refused, saying that &quot; I am better than him; you created me from fire and created him from clay &quot;. The Medieval Muslim scholar, al-Ghazali pointing out that the only legitimate &quot; preference principle &quot; in the sight of God is piety, writes: &quot; every time a rich man believes that he is better than a poor one, or a white man believes that he is better than a black one, then he is being arrogant. He is adopting the same hierarchical principles adopted by Iblis [Satan] in his jahl [ignorance], and thus falling into shirk [opposite of Tawhid]. &quot; { Azizah Al-Hibri (2003) } Secularism and the evolution of public policy The modern secular state (a by-product of European positivism) resulted from the evolution of public policy in west. Islamic scholarship has not however gone through the same process for a variety of reasons: The doctrine of Tawhid implies that the cosmos is a unified harmonious whole, centered around the omnipotent and omnipresent God. As interpreted by Muslim scholars, national sovereignty thus exclusively belonged to God and no room was left for evolution of nation-state ideas. According to Ozay Mehmet, &quot; Secularism, i.e. policies based on science and man-made rules rather than divine criteria, has been rejected as anti-Islamic. Traditionally, a Muslim is not a nationalist, or citizen of a nation-state; he has no political identity, only a religious membership in the Umma. For a traditional Muslim, Islam is the sole and sufficient identification tag and nationalism and nation-states are &apos;obstacles&apos; &quot;. { Ozay Mehmet (1990), p.57 } Islamic art The desire to preserve the unity and transcendence of God led to the prohibition of Muslims from creating representation or visual depictions of God, or of any Prophet including Muhammad. Many Arab Muslims later extended the ban to any representations in art of the human form. The key concern is that the use of statues or images may lead to idolatry. The dominant forms of expression in the Islamic art, thus, became calligraphy and arabesque.
