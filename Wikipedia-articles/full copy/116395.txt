The town Head of Elk was founded by Swedish mariners and fisherman from Fort Casimir, who settled the area in 1694. { Maryland: a new guide to the Old Line State. 1999. p.xiv. } { The Middle States: A Handbook for Travellers.4th ed edited by Moses Foster Sweetser.1881.p.387. } During the American Revolutionary War, the British army landed at Head of Elk before marching on Philadelphia in 1777. Aug. 25, 1777, Sir William Howe&apos;s Anglo-German army (13,000 British soldiers and 5,000 Germans) landed on the Elk River and marched 11 miles north to the Head of Elk, whence Howe soon advanced to the short and victorious campaign of the Brandywine, which resulted in the conquest of Philadelphia On March 8, 1781, the Marquis de Lafayette embarked his troops to attempt a capture of Benedict Arnold. Returning on April 9, he began his overland march to Virginia. George Washington and Rochambeau with their combined forces stopped in Elkton on September 6–7, 1781, while on their way to Yorktown. { Elkton Marker } Elkton was incorporated in 1787.

As a result, a number of Maryland towns near borders with other states became known as places to get married quickly and without many restrictions, or &quot; Gretna Green s &quot;. { State v. Clay, 182 Md. 639, 642, 35 A.2d 821, 822–23 (1944). } Elkton, being the northeasternmost county seat in Maryland (and thus closer to Philadelphia, New York, and New England), was particularly popular.

State, 221 Md. 235, 237–38, 155 A.2d 894, 896 (1959). } in its heyday, in the 1920s and 1930s, it was &quot; the elopement capital of the East Coast &quot; and thousands of marriages were performed there each year. While some of the marriages obtained in Elkton were of celebrities or celebrities-to-be ( Cornel Wilde, Joan Fontaine, Debbie Reynolds, Martha Raye, John and Martha Mitchell, Willie Mays, and Pat Robertson all got married in Elkton), the overall tawdry flavor grew to be too much for the state. A 48-hour waiting period was imposed in 1938, but Elkton continued to be a place to marry, and especially elope; it simply took longer. { Historic Marker Database, Elkton, Wedding Capital of the East. } In time, Las Vegas became the new &quot; American Gretna Green, &quot; although hundreds of people are still married in Elkton each year.
