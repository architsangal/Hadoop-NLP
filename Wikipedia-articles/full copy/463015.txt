[ Distribution and habitat ] Pinus jeffreyi occurs from southwest Oregon south through much of California (mainly in the Sierra Nevada ), to northern Baja California in Mexico. It is a high altitude species; in the north of its range, it grows widely at [ 1500 to 2100 m on ] altitude, and at [ 1800 to 2900 m on ] in the south of its range. [ Burns R.M. B.H. Honkala http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/pinus/jeffreyi.htm Pinus Jeffreyi Silvics of North America U.S. Department of Agriculture 1990 Agriculture Handbook 654 ] Jeffrey Pine is tolerant of serpentine soil s, and is often dominant in these conditions, even on dry sites at fairly low altitude. On other soils, it only becomes dominant at higher altitudes where the usually faster-growing Ponderosa Pine does not thrive. { Siskiyou Mountains of northwest California, growing on } { serpentine } [ Description ] The Jeffrey Pine is a large tree, reaching [ 25 to 40 m on ] tall, rarely up to [ 53 m on ] tall, though smaller when growing at or near tree line. The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of three, stout, glaucous gray-green, [ 12 to 23 cm on ] long. The cones are [ 12 to 24 cm on ] long, dark purple when immature, ripening pale brown, with thinly woody scales bearing a short, sharp inward-pointing barb. The seeds are [ 10 to 12 mm on ] long, with a large ( [ 15 to 25 mm on ] ) wing. Long, glaucous needles The Jeffrey Pine may be distinguished from Ponderosa Pine by the needles (image at left), which are glaucous, less bright green than those of Ponderosa Pine, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs (see image lower left).

Vizgirdas Edna M. Rey-Vizgirdas 2006 University Of Nevada Press Reno, Nevada ] compared to the turpentine or odorless scent of Ponderosa Pine. This may be tested by breaking a small shoot or some needles, or by sampling the scent of the resin in between the plates of the bark. This difference in scent is related to the very unusual composition of the resin, with the volatile component made up almost entirely of pure n-heptane. Jeffrey Pine can be distinguished from Ponderosa Pine by the smaller scales of bark as compared to the larger plates of more reddish-colored Ponderosa bark. Base of Jeffrey pine, showing bark plates [ Uses ] Jeffrey Pine wood is similar to Ponderosa Pine wood, and is used for the same purposes. The exceptional purity of n-heptane distilled from Jeffrey Pine resin led to n-heptane being selected as the zero point on the octane rating scale of petrol. As n-heptane is explosive when ignited, Jeffrey Pine resin cannot be used to make turpentine. Before Jeffrey Pine was distinguished from Ponderosa Pine as a distinct species in 1853, resin distillers operating in its range suffered a number of &apos;inexplicable&apos; explosions during distillation, now known to have been caused by the unwitting use of Jeffrey Pine resin.
