His byname, cuarán, is usually translated as &quot; sandal &quot;. His name appears in a variety of anglicized forms, including Olaf Cuaran and Olaf Sihtricson, particularly in relation to his short-lived rule in York. { In } { Old English he was Anlaf. To Irish speakers he may also have been Amlaíb mac ua Ímair or Amlaíb ua Ímair but others shared these names. Likewise, his Norse nickname, &quot; Olaf the Red &quot; was applied to several Norse rulers in Ireland and the Isles. } He was the last of the Uí Ímair to play a major part in the politics of Britain and Ireland. Amlaíb was twice, perhaps three times, ruler of Northumbria and twice ruler of Dublin and its dependencies. His reign over these territories spanned some forty years. He was a renowned warrior and a ruthless pillager of churches, but ended his days in retirement at Iona Abbey. Born when the Uí Ímair ruled over large areas of Britain and Ireland, by his death the kingdom of Dublin was a minor power in Irish politics. At the same time, Dublin became a major centre of trade in Atlantic Europe and mastery over the city and its wealth became the supreme prize for ambitious Irish kings. In death Amlaíb was the prototype for the character Havelok the Dane. In life he was a patron of Irish poets and Scandinavian skalds who wrote verses praising their paymaster. Amlaíb was married at least twice, and had many children who married into Irish and Scandinavian royal families. His descendants were kings in the Isle of Man and the Hebrides until the 13th century. [ Background ] [ Viking Age ] The earliest records of attacks by Vikings in Britain or Ireland are at the end of the eighth century. The monastery on Lindisfarne, in the kingdom of Northumbria, was sacked on 8 June 793, and the monastery of Iona in the kingdom of the Picts was attacked in 795 and 802. In Ireland Rathlin Island, off the north-east coast, was the target in 795, and so too was St Patrick&apos;s Island on the east coast in 798. Portland in the kingdom of Wessex in south-west Britain was attacked during the reign of King Beorhtric of Wessex (ruled from 786 to 802). { Keynes, &quot; Vikings in England &quot;, pp. 50 –51; Ó Corráin, &quot; Ireland, Wales, Man, and the Hebrides &quot;, pp. 83 –85. } These raids continued in a sporadic fashion throughout the first quarter of the ninth century. During the second quarter of the century the frequency and size of raids increased and the first permanent Viking settlements (called longphorts in Ireland) appeared. { Keynes, &quot; Vikings in England &quot;, pp. 51 –52; Ó Corráin, &quot; Ireland, Wales, Man, and the Hebrides &quot;, pp. 84 –89. } [ Origins ] [ Uí Ímair ] The Ímar from whom the Uí Ímair were descended is generally presumed to be that Ímar (English pronunciation Ivar): &quot; king of the Northmen of all Britain and Ireland &quot;, whose death is reported by the Annals of Ulster in 873. Whether this Ímar is to be identified with Ivar the Boneless, the leader of the Great Heathen Army, is rather less certain, although at the same time not unlikely. { Ó Cróinín, Early Medieval Ireland, pp. 250 –254, discusses Ímar&apos;s career and the various arguments. See also Woolf, Pictland to Alba, chapter 2; Downham, Viking Kings, chapters 1 –3, especially pp. 17 –23 &amp; 64 –67. Ó Corráin, &quot; Vikings in Scotland and Ireland &quot;, passim, sets out the case against the identification. } Amlaíb Cuarán was probably a great-grandson of Ímar. There is no contemporary evidence setting out the descent from Ímar to his grandsons, but it may be that the grandsons of Ímar recorded between 896 and 934 —Amlaíb Cuarán&apos;s father Sitriuc (d. 927), Ragnall (d. 921), Gofraid (d. 934), Ímar (d. 904) and Amlaíb (d. 896) —were brothers rather than cousins. { Thus Downham, Viking Kings, p. 29, figure 6. Cyril Hart&apos;s contributions to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography make Ragnall, Sitriuc and Gofraid brothers; likewise Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 31, figure 1, makes these three brothers, sons of } { Guthred. } Amlaíb&apos;s father Sitriuc first appears in the record in 917 when he seized Dublin, a settlement which had probably been under the control of an Irish king since the expulsion of the previous Viking rulers in 902. { Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 27 –35. } Sitriuc ruled Northumbria until his death in 927. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records his marriage to King Æthelstan &apos;s sister at Tamworth on 30 January 926. According to some late sources, such as the chronicler John of Wallingford, Amlaíb was the son of Sitriuc and this West Saxon princess. { According to } { William of Malmesbury, who states that he did not know the princess&apos;s name, she was Æthelstan&apos;s full sister, daughter of } { Edward the Elder and his first wife Ecgwynn, John of Wallingford gives her name as Orgiue, perhaps Eadgifu; Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 28 –29. } Sitriuc&apos;s other sons included Gofraid (died 951), king of Dublin, Aralt (died 940), ruler of Limerick, and, less certainly, Sichfrith and Auisle, listed among those killed at the battle of Brunanburh in 937 by the Annals of Clonmacnoise. { Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 31, figure 1, shows only Gofraid; Downham, Viking Kings, p. 29, figure 6 &amp; pp. 245, 247, 254 &amp; 269; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 931. } A daughter of Sitriuc named Gytha is said in the Heimskringla to have married Norwegian pirate king Olaf Tryggvason, but she was probably a daughter of Amlaíb Cuarán. { Hart, &quot; Sihtric Cáech &quot;; &quot; Saga of Olaf Tryggvason &quot;, chapter 32, Heimskringla, pp. 171 –173; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 31, figure 1 &amp; p. 84. } Following Sitriuc&apos;s death, Amlaíb may have become king in York for a short time, { Thus Keynes, &quot; Rulers of the English &quot;, p. 505. } but if he did it came to an end when Æthelstan took over the kingdom of Northumbria and defeated Sitriuc&apos;s brother Gofraid. According to William of Malmesbury, Amlaíb fled to Ireland while his uncle Gofraid made a second unsuccessful attempt to gain control of York. { Downham, Viking Kings, p. 100; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 29; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 151. Hudson, &quot; Óláf Sihtricson &quot;, presumes Amlaíb to have been born in York, in which case he was a child at this time. } In 937 an attack on Æthelstan&apos;s kingdom by Gofraid&apos;s son Amlaíb, assisted by Constantín mac Áeda, the king of Alba, and Owen, the king of Strathclyde, ended in defeat at the battle of Brunanburh. { Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 168 –173; Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 103 –105; Hudson, Viking Pirates, page numbers to be supplied. } William of Malmesbury wrote that Amlaíb was present at Brunanburh and spied out the English camp the night before the battle disguised as a skald. { Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 30 –31; Hudson states: &quot; If there is any historical basis to this story, Olaf Cuaran is clearly confused with his cousin... &quot;. } King Æthelstan died in 939 and his successor, his half-brother Edmund, was unable to keep control of York. Amlaíb mac Gofrith, ruling in Dublin, crossed to Britain where he was accepted as king of the Northumbrians. He died in 941, shortly after sacking the church of Saint Baldred at Tyninghame, struck dead by the saint&apos;s power according to the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto. { Hudson, &quot; Óláf Guthfrithson &quot;; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 174. } [ York ] Amlaíb Cuarán&apos;s career began in 941, following the death of his cousin Amlaíb mac Gofrith, when he became co-ruler of York, sharing power with his cousin Ragnall son of Gofraid. According to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, Amlaíb had been in Britain since 940, having left another son of Gofraid, Blácaire, as ruler of Dublin. { Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 43, 241 &amp; 248; Costambeys, &quot; Ragnall Guthfrithson &quot;; Hudson, &quot; Óláf Sihtricson &quot;; Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 33 –34; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 181; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 933. } Amlaíb and Ragnall ruled in York until 944. The dating of events in period between the death of Æthelstan and the expulsion of Amlaíb and Ragnall is uncertain as the various versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are in conflict. It appears that after Æthelstan&apos;s died, not only did Edmund lose control of Northumbria, but that the Five Burghs of the Mercia n Danelaw also pledged themselves to Amlaíb mac Gofrith. { Higham, &quot; Five Boroughs &quot;; Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 193; Miller, &quot; Edmund &quot;; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 174; but that either Amlaíb controlled the Mercian Danelaw is questioned by Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 108 –109. } One of the Amlaíbs stormed Tamworth according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: Here Olaf broke down Tamworth and a great slaughter fell on either side, and the Danes had the victory and led much war-booty away with them. Wulfrun was seized in the raid. Here King Edmund besieged King Olaf and Archbishop Wulfstan in Leicester, and he might have controlled them had they not escaped from the stronghold in the night. { Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 111, Ms. D, s.a. 943. } It is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place, and as a result historians disagree as to whether they concern Amlaíb mac Gofrith or Amlaíb Cuarán. { The events are associated with Amlaíb mac Gofrith by Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 193; Miller, &quot; Edmund &quot;; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 174. Others, such as Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 111, note 11; Downham, Viking Kings, p. 110; Hudson, &quot; Óláf Sihtricson &quot;, associate them with Amlaíb Cuarán. } Edmund reconquered the Five Burghs in 942, an event celebrated in verse by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The Chronicle reports the baptism of Amlaíb, with King Edmund becoming his godfather. { Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 110 –111, Ms. A, s.a. 942, Ms. D, s.a. 942 &amp; 943. } This need not mean that Amlaíb was not already a Christian, nor would such a baptism have permanently committed him to Christianity, as such baptisms were often political acts. Alfred the Great, for example, had sponsored the confirmation of Christian Welsh king Anarawd ap Rhodri. { Asser&apos;s Life of King Alfred the Great. Thus Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 34. Regarding the confirmation, Hudson describes it as &quot;...  a politically motivated act... a recognised means of sealing an alliance with a dominant individual... &quot;. Ragnall was baptised some time later according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. } Amlaíb was expelled from the kingship of York in 944. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that &quot; King Edmund conquered all Northumbria and caused to flee away two kings [or &quot; royally-born men &quot; ], Olaf and Rægnald &quot;. { Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 110 –111, Ms. A, s.a. 944, Ms. E., s.a. 944. } It is possible that rivalry between Amlaíb and Ragnall contributed to their fall. { Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 46 &amp; 111 –112; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 182. } Æthelweard &apos;s history reports that Amlaíb was deposed by a coup led by Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, and an unnamed Mercian ealdorman. { Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 35; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 182, suggests that the unnamed Mercian leader was } { Æthelstan Half-King. } [ Congalach and Ruaidrí ] Scandinavian settlements in 10th century Ireland After being driven out of Northumbria, Amlaíb returned to Ireland while Ragnall may have been killed at York. { Costambeys, &quot; Ragnall &quot;; Downham, Viking Kings, p. 46; the killing of Ragnall is reported in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 937. } The Uí Ímair in Ireland had also suffered in 944 as Dublin was sacked that year by the High King of Ireland Congalach Cnogba, whose power base lay in Brega, north of Dublin on the lower reaches of the River Boyne. The following year, perhaps as a result of the sack of Dublin, Amlaíb&apos;s cousin Blácaire was driven out and Amlaíb replaced him as ruler of Dublin. Amlaíb was allied with Congalach and may have gained power with his assistance. { Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 46, 241 &amp; 248; Hudson, Viking Pirates&apos;&apos;, pp. 35 –36. } Congalach and Amlaíb fought against Ruaidrí ua Canannáin, a rival for the High Kingship who belonged to the Cenél Conaill, based in modern County Donegal. In 945 the two defeated part of Ruaidrí&apos;s army in Conaille Muirtheimne (modern County Louth ) and the following year Amlaíb raided Kilcullen in the province of Leinster. In 947 Ruaidrí routed Congalach and Amlaíb at Slane. Losses among the Dublin men were heavy, with many drowning while fleeing the battle. This defeat appears to have lost Amlaíb his kingship, as the annals record that Blácaire not Amlaíb was the leader of the Dublin forces in the following year. Blácaire was killed in 948 by Congalach, and was succeeded by Amlaíb&apos;s brother Gofraid. { Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 46 –47 &amp; 241; Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp 36 –37; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 186. } [ York again ] { Raven, the reverse a cross. } The course of events in Northumbria while Amlaíb was in Ireland is uncertain. While Edmund certainly controlled Northumbria after Amlaíb was expelled and Ragnall killed, he may soon after have lost control of the north to a Scandinavia n king named Eiríkr, usually identified with Eric Bloodaxe. { For a contrary view of Erik&apos;s identity see Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 115 –120 and Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 187 –188. } If Erik did rule in Northumbria before Edmund&apos;s death, it was only for a short time. Edmund was killed in 946, and succeeded by his brother Eadred. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Eadred &quot; reduced all the land of Northumbria to his control; and the Scots granted him oaths that they would do all that he wanted &quot;. { Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 112 –113, Mss A &amp; D, s.a. 946, Ms. E, s.a. 948. } The Northumbrian submission to Eadred led to a meeting with the notables of York led by Archbishop Wulfstan in 947, but the following year King Erik was back ruling Northumbria and Eadred laid waste to the southern parts of the kingdom — Ripon is mentioned as a particular target —to force the Northumbrians to expel Erik, which they did. { Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 112 –113, Ms D, s.a. 947 &amp; 948. } The following year, 949, by which time Blacáire was dead and Amlaíb&apos;s brother ruling in Dublin, the Northumbrians invited Amlaíb to rule in York. { Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 112 –113, Ms E, s.a. 949. } His return to England may have been with Eadred&apos;s agreement. { Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 114 –115. } That year Máel Coluim mac Domnaill, the king of Alba, raided Northumbria as far south as the River Tees, capturing many slaves and much loot. Whether this invasion was directed against Amlaíb, or perhaps intended to support him by plundering only northern Northumbria which may have been outwith his control, is uncertain. A second invasion from the north in 952, this time an alliance including Máel Coluim&apos;s Scots and also Britons and Saxons, was defeated. Again, whether this was aimed against Amlaíb, who was deposed in 952 and replaced by Erik, or was mounted against King Erik in support of Amlaíb, is unclear. Erik&apos;s reign was short and the Viking kingdom of York was definitively incorporated into the kingdom of the English on his death in 954. Amlaíb returned to Ireland, never again to rule in York. { Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 178 –190; Hudson, Viking pirates, pp. 37 –38; Downham, Viking Kings, pp. 153 –155. } [ From Dublin to Iona ] [ Marriages and children ] He was succeeded by his son Glúniairn (Járnkné, literally &quot; Iron Knee &quot; ), son of his wife Dúnlaith, daughter of Muirchertach mac Néill. Among his wives was Gormflaith, daughter of Murchad mac Finn, King of Leinster, and future wife of Brian Boru. Gormflaith&apos;s son Sitric Silkbeard was king of Dublin after Glúniairn&apos;s death. Amlaíb&apos;s other children included Gytha, who married Olaf Tryggvason, Máel Muire, who married Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, and Harald, possibly the grandfather of Godred Crovan. { Downham, Viking Kings, p. 29, figure 6; Hudson, Viking Pirates, p. 49, figure 2 &amp; p. 83, figure 3; Etchingam, &quot; Gwynedd and Ireland &quot;, p. 167, fig. 7.1. } [ Cuarán ] Amlaíb&apos;s byname, cuarán, is usually translated as &quot; sandal &quot; or &quot; shoe &quot;. It derives from the Old Irish word cúar meaning bent or crooked. It is first applied to him in the report of the battle of Slane in 947 in the Annals of Ulster. The usual translation may be misleading. The epithet probably refers to a distinctive style of footwear. Benjamin Hudson points to the description of a cuarán in a twelfth century satire, where it is made of leather folded seven times and has a pointed toe. In Aislinge Meic Con Glinne and Scél Baili Binnbérlaig, the cuarán is waterproof. In the first story Mac Con Glinne cleans his by dipping them in his bath; in the second, a cuarán serves as a vessel to drink from. That the cuarán was a piece of footwear specific to Dublin is suggested by statements in other stories that have cobblers in the town owing a cuarán in taxes. { Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 36 –37. } [ Icelandic sagas ] Amlaíb Cuarán (Olaf Kvaran) is referred to at least twice in the Icelandic sagas, once in Njal&apos;s Saga and again in Saga of Gunnlaugr Serpent-Tongue { GunnlaugsSaga Ormstungu/The Story of Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue, Notes by P.G. Foote translated by R. Quirk, Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd. London, 1957, p. 18 } It is from these references that Einar Hjorleifsson Kvaran and his siblings chose the name &quot; Kvaran &quot; as their own.
