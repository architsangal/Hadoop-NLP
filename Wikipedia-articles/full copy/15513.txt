[ May 2012 ] Islamic eschatology is concerned with the al-Qiyāmah (Last Judgement). Like the other Abrahamic religion s, Islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the judgement of the soul; the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of Jannah ( Heaven ) while the unrighteous are punished in Jahannam ( Hell ). Eschatology relates to one of the six (seven according to Shī‘a traditions) articles of faith ( aqīdah ) of Islam according to the Sunni traditions. A significant portion (about one third [ November 2010 ] ) of the Qur&apos;an deals with these beliefs, with many hadith elaborating on the themes and details. It also emphasizes the inevitability of resurrection, judgment, and the eternal division of the righteous and the wicked. { http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e588?_hi=1 &amp; _pos=2 }. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing Armageddon is often known as fitna ( &quot; a test &quot; ) or malahim (or ghayba to the Shī‘a). [ Islamic eschatology ] The end of times is mentioned often in the Qur&apos;an. In the Qur&apos;an&apos;s description, the natural order of things becomes reversed, including the movement of the sun and the stability of the mountains and oceans. Following this apocalypse, humans will be bodily resurrected to stand in a grand assembly anxiously awaiting receipt of a script detailing their righteous and sinful deeds and with the appropriate divine judgment entered thereto. A favorable judgment permits entry into paradise where the saved ones will enjoy endless pleasure and bliss; but an unfavorable judgment condemns one to hell-fire to suffer all kinds of torments without respite. The Qur&apos;an proclaims this eschatology with a pervading aura of certitude that makes it sheer folly to doubt the inevitability of the end-time. [ Muhammad S. Umar Muslims&apos; Eschatological Discourses on Colonialism in Northern Nigeria. 1999 Oxford University Press 59-84 http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1466033.pdf ] [ Ya&apos;juj and Ma&apos;juj ] [ Gog and Magog ] During the reign of Isa people will live an extremely peaceful life filled with prosperity and abundance. Then the wall which imprisons Ya&apos;juj and Ma&apos;juj will break and they will surge forth in large numbers. There is much debate about the time of release of Ya&apos;juj and Ma&apos;juj. Some Islamic scholars like Imran Nazar Hosein believe that the wall containing the Ya&apos;juj and Ma&apos;juj has been brought down during the lifetime of Muhammad. This is supported by evidence from the sayings of Muhammad where he mentions that &quot; a hole has been made in the wall containing the Ya&apos;juj and Ma&apos;juj &quot;, indicating the size of the hole with his thumb and index finger. [ &quot; But when Ya&apos;jooj and Ma&apos;jooj are let loose and they rush headlong down every hill &quot; (Quran 21:96) http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/koran/koran-idx?type=DIV0 &amp; byte=498061 http://quran.com/21/96 ] [ The beast ] Qur&apos;an tells about the beast of earth [ &quot; And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), We shall produce from the earth a Beast to (face) them: he will speak to them, for that &quot; mankind did not believe with assurance in our Signs. &quot; (Quran 27:82) ] [ Day of resurrection (Qiyamah) ] [ Qiyamah ] A fundamental tenet of Islam is belief in the day of resurrection, Qiyamah. The trials and tribulation s of Qiyamah are explained in both the Qur&apos;an and the Hadith, as well as in the commentaries of Islamic scholar s such as al-Ghazali, Ibn Kathir, and Muhammad al-Bukhari. Muslims believe that God will hold every human, Muslim and non-Muslim, accountable for his or her deeds at a preordained time unknown to man. [ 74 38 ] The angel Israfil, is waiting for Allah to give him the command to sound the horn which will signal the beginning of day of judgment. Traditions say Muhammad will be the first to be brought back to life. { Esposito, John (2003). The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-512558-4, p.264 } Muslims also believe in &quot; the punishment of the grave, &quot; which supposedly takes place between death and the resurrection. { Leor Halevi, http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/opinion/04iht-edhalevi.1.5565834.html } The punishments in hell includes adhab, &quot; pain or torment inflicted by way of chastisement; punishment &quot;, a very painful punishment (see [ 29 55 ], [ 43 48 ] ); khizy, &quot; shame, disgrace, ignominy &quot; ( [ 16 27 ], [ 11 39 ] ). { &quot; Reward and Punishment &quot;, Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an (2005) } The descriptions in the Qur&apos;an of hell are very descriptive (see [ 4 56 ], [ 47 15 ] etc.). The punishments in the Qur&apos;an are contrasted not with release but with mercy ( [ 29 21 ], [ 2 284 ], [ 3 129 ], etc.). Islam views paradise as a place of joy and bliss. { &quot; Paradise &quot;, &quot; Heaven &quot;, The New Encyclopædia Britannica (2005) } [ Salvation ] According to all the traditional schools of jurisprudence, faith ( iman ) ensures salvation. There are however differing views concerning the formal constituents of the act of faith. &quot; For the Asharis it is centred on internal taṣdīḳ[internal judgment of veracity], for the Māturīdī-Ḥanafīs on the expressed profession of faith and the adherence of the heart, for the Muʿtazilīs on the performance of the &apos;prescribed duties&apos;, for the Ḥanbalīs and the Wahhābīs on the profession of faith and the performance of the basic duties. &quot; { &quot; Imam &quot;, Encyclopaedia of Islam Online } The common denominator of these various opinions is summed up in bearing witness that God is the Lord, L. Gardet states. There are traditions in which Muhammad stated that &quot; No one shall enter hell who has an atom of faith in his heart &quot; or that &quot; Hell will not welcome anyone who has in his heart an atom of faith &quot; however these passages are interpreted in different ways. Those who consider performance as an integral part of faith such as [ Ḵh̲ārid̲j̲īs ], consider anyone who does a grave sin to be out of faith, while the majority of Sunnis who view works as merely the perfecting the faith, hold that a believing sinner will be punished with a temporary stay in hell. Still there is disagreement over the possibility of a believing sinner being forgiven immediately (e.g. [ As̲h̲ʿarīs ] ) and in full rather than undergoing temporary punishment. (e.g. Māturīdīs) [ Rationalization ] Ibn al-Nafis dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his Theologus Autodidactus, where he rationalized the Islamic view of eschatology using reason, science, and philosophy to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic eschatology. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of Arabic fiction, hence his Theologus Autodidactus may be considered amongst the earliest science fiction work. { Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), &quot; Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher &quot;, Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis, Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ( } { cf.
