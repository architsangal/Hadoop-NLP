The Group of Seven — sometimes known as the Algonquin school — were a group of Canadian landscape painters from 1920 to 1933, originally consisting of Franklin Carmichael (1890 –1945), Lawren Harris (1885 –1970), A. Y. Jackson (1882 –1972), Frank Johnston (1888 –1949), Arthur Lismer (1885 –1969), J. E. H. MacDonald (1873 –1932), and Frederick Varley (1881 –1969). Two artists commonly associated with the group are Tom Thomson (1877 –1917) and Emily Carr (1871 –1945). Although he died before its official formation, Thomson had a significant influence on the group. In his essay &quot; The Story of the Group of Seven &quot;, Lawren Harris wrote that Thomson was &quot; a part of the movement before we pinned a label on it &quot;; Thomson&apos;s paintings &quot; The West Wind &quot; and &quot; The Jack Pine &quot; are two of the group&apos;s most iconic pieces.

Harris and MacCallum jointly built the Studio Building in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement. MacCallum owned land on Georgian Bay and Thomson worked as a guide in nearby Algonquin Park, both places where he and the other artists often travelled for inspiration. [ Hill Charles C.

They continued to travel throughout Ontario, especially the Muskoka and Algoma regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which did not exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven. [ Hill Charles C.

Prior to this, many artists believed the Canadian landscape was not worthy of being painted. Reviews for the 1920 exhibition were mixed [ Varley Christopher Group of Seven http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26amp%3BParams%3DA1ARTA0003476 The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica Foundation 18 Oct. 2011 ], but as the decade progressed the Group came to be recognized as pioneers of a new, Canadian, school of art. After Frank Johnston left the group in 1920 to move to Winnipeg, A. J. Casson was invited to join in 1926 [ Hill Charles C. Group of Seven http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview%3DMain%26amp%3Bentry%3Dt148.e692 The Oxford Companion to Canadian History Oxford University Press 18 Oct. 2011 ]. Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years beforehand. The Group&apos;s champions during its early years included Barker Fairley, a co-founder of Canadian Forum magazine [ Symington Rodney Fairley, Barker http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26amp%3BParams%3DA1ARTA0002703 The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica Foundation 18 Oct. 2011 ], and the warden of Hart House at the University of Toronto, J. Burgon Bickersteth. The members of the Group began to travel elsewhere in Canada for inspiration, including British Columbia, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and the Arctic. After Samuel Gurney Cresswell and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. [ October 2011 ] Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a &quot; national school of painters &quot; there should be members from outside of Toronto. So, in 1930, Edwin Holgate from Montreal, Quebec became a member and in 1932, also LeMoine Fitzgerald from Winnipeg, Manitoba [ Varley Christopher Group of Seven http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26amp%3BParams%3DA1ARTA0003476 The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica Foundation 18 Oct. 2011 ]. The Group&apos;s influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J.E.H. MacDonald&apos;s death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. They announced that the Group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the Canadian Group of Painters. The Canadian Group -which eventually consisted of the majority of Canada&apos;s leading artists- held its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967. Finally, the large and unmanageable group was exceeded by smaller groups which were more structured and tastefully united [ Hill Charles C.

[ Collections ] Large collections of work from the Group of Seven can be found at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. The National Gallery, under the directorship of Eric Brown, was an early institutional supporter of artists associated with the Group, purchasing art from some of their early exhibitions before they had identified themselves officially as the Group of Seven [ Varley Christopher Group of Seven http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26amp%3BParams%3DA1ARTA0003476 The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica Foundation 18 Oct. 2011 ].

The McMichael was founded by Robert and Signe McMichael, who began collecting paintings by the Group of Seven and their contemporaries in 1955 { McMichael gallery co-founder dies, CBC Arts, July 5, 2007. }. [ Other notes ] The Group of Seven has received criticism for its reinforcement of terra nullius presenting the region as pristine and untouched by humans when in fact the areas depicted have been lived on for many centuries [ Mitchell Thomas W.J. Landscape and Power http://books.google.com/books/about/Landscape_and_power.html?id%3D8E3yVlUUK9AC University of Chicago Press, 2002 19 Oct. 2011 ]. In 1995, the National Gallery of Canada compiled a Group of Seven retrospective show, for which they commissioned the Canadian rock band Rheostatics to write a musical score. That score was released on album as Music Inspired by the Group of Seven. Six members of the group, A.Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Lawren Harris, Frank Johnston, and A.J. Casson along with four of the artists&apos; wives are buried onsite at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in the small patch of consecrated land bordered by trees, with graves marked by large chunks of the Canadian Shield.
