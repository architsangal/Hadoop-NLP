Logo of Canada&apos;s centennial celebrations in 1967 1967 is remembered as one of the most notable years in Canada. { Berton (1997), p. 364. } It was Canada&apos;s centenary and celebrations were held throughout the nation. The most prominent event was Expo 67 in Montreal, the most successful World&apos;s Fair ever held up to that time, and one of the first events to win international acclaim for the country. The year saw the nation&apos;s Governor General, Georges Vanier, die in office; and two prominent federal leaders, Official Opposition Leader John Diefenbaker, and Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson announced their resignations. The year&apos;s top news-story was French President Charles de Gaulle &apos;s &quot; Vive le Québec libre &quot; speech in Montreal. The year also saw major changes in youth culture with the &quot; hippie s &quot; in Toronto&apos;s Yorkville area becoming front-page news over their lifestyle choices and battles with Toronto City Council. A new honours system was announced, the Order of Canada. In sports, the Toronto Maple Leaf&apos;s won their 13th and last Stanley Cup. [ Overview ] The nation began to feel far more nationalistic than before, with a generation raised in a country fully detached from Britain. The new Canadian flag served as a symbol and a catalyst for this. In Quebec, the Quiet Revolution was overthrowing the oligarchy of francophone clergy and anglophone businessmen, and French Canadian pride and nationalism were becoming a national political force. The Canadian economy was at its post-war peak, and levels of prosperity and quality of life were at all-time highs. Many of the most important elements of Canada&apos;s welfare state were coming on line, such as Medicare and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). These events were coupled with the coming of age of the baby boom and the regeneration of music, literature, and art that the 1960s brought around the world. The baby boomers who have since dominated Canada&apos;s culture tend to view the period as Canada&apos;s halcyon days. While to Montreal it was the year of Expo, to Toronto it was the culmination of the Toronto Maple Leafs dynasty of the 1960s, with the team winning its fourth Stanley Cup in six years by defeating its arch-rival, the Montreal Canadiens, in the last all-Canadian Stanley Cup Final until 1986. Author and historian Pierre Berton famously referred to 1967 as Canada&apos;s last good year. In his analysis, the years following saw much of 1967&apos;s hopefulness disappear. In the early 1970s, the oil shock and other factors hammered the Canadian economy. Quebec separatism led to divisive debates and an economic decline of Montreal and Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) terrorism. The Vietnam War and Watergate Scandal in the United States also had profound effects on Canadians. Breton reported that Toronto hockey fans also note that the Maple Leafs have not won a Stanley Cup since. { Berton (1997), pp. 357–367. } [ Incumbents ] Monarch : Elizabeth II Governor General : Georges Vanier then Roland Michener Prime Minister : Lester B.
