[ January 2009 ] [ 41.853101 N 87.612137 W inline,title ] { McPier } { 1958 } { November 1960 } { 1986 1997 2007 } { $ 35 million } [ 2670000 sqft on ] McCormick Place is the largest convention center in the United States. { U.S. Convention Center Directory } It is comprised of four interconnected buildings sited on and near the shore of Lake Michigan, about [ 4 km mi on ] south of downtown Chicago, Illinois, USA. McCormick Place hosts numerous trade shows and meetings. The largest regular events are the Chicago Auto Show each February, the International Home and Housewares Show each March and the National Restaurant Association Annual Show each May. [ History ] As early as 1927, Robert R. McCormick, a prominent member of the McCormick family, and publisher of the Chicago Tribune, championed a purpose-built lakeside convention center for Chicago. In 1958, ground was broken for a $35 million facility that opened in November 1960, and was named after McCormick, who died in 1955. The lead architect was Alfred Shaw, one of the architects of the Merchandise Mart. { Cowan, David, 2001. Great Chicago Fires: Historic Blazes that Shaped a City. Lake Claremont Press: p. 102. } This building included the Arie Crown Theater, designed by Edward Durrell Stone. { E. D. Stone entry at archiplanet. } It seated nearly 5,000 people and was the second largest theater (by seating capacity ) in Chicago. { Lake Shore Drive and 18th Street in 2007 } The 1960 exposition hall was destroyed in a spectacular 1967 fire, despite being thought fireproof by virtue of its steel and concrete construction. At the time of the fire, the building contained highly combustible exhibits, several hydrants were shut off, and there were no sprinklers on the main floor where the fire started. Thus the fire spread quickly and destructively, taking the life of a security guard. { Cowan (2001), chpt. 12. } The fire was investigated by a team led by Rolf H. Jensen, Professor of Fire Protection Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, who later went on to found RJA Group. Many lessons were learned and the city&apos;s building code was amended so a similar situation would not be repeated.Although many wanted to rebuild the hall on a different site, Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley elected to rebuild on the foundations of the burned building. The new design of dark steel and glass, by Gene Summers of C. F. Murphy and Associates (and formerly of Mies van der Rohe &apos;s office) contrasted markedly with the white look of the structure that had burned down. On January 3, 1971, the replacement building, later called the East Building and now called the Lakeside Center, opened with a [ 300000 sqft ] main exhibition hall. The Arie Crown Theatre sustained only minor damage in the 1967 fire, and so was incorporated into the interior of the new building. The theater, with the largest seating capacity of any active theater in Chicago (the Uptown Theatre having more seating, but currently closed), underwent major modifications in 1997 which improved its acoustics. [ Additions ] [ McCormick Square flanked by the West Building(left) and Hyatt Regency Hotel Grand concourse looking west ] The North Building, located west of Lake Shore Drive and completed in 1986, is connected to the East Building by an enclosed pedestrian bridge. In contrast to the dark, flat profile of the East Building, the North Building is white (as the original building was), with twelve concrete pylons on the roof which support the roof using 72 cables. The HVAC system for the building is incorporated into the pylons and give the building the appearance of a rigged sailing ship. The South Building, dedicated in 1997 and designed by tvsdesign, contains more than [ 1000000 sqft m2 on ] of exhibition space. It more than doubled the space in the complex and made McCormick Place the largest convention center in the nation, surpassing the Javits Center in New York City. On August 2, 2007, McCormick Place officials opened yet another addition to the complex, the West Building, also designed by tvsdesign and costing $882 million and completed 8 months ahead of schedule. The publicly-financed West Building contains [ 470000 sqft ] of exhibit space, bringing McCormick Place&apos;s total existing exhibition space to [ 2670000 sqft ]. The West Building also has [ 250000 sqft ] of meeting space, including 61 meeting rooms, as well as a [ 100000 sqft ] ballroom, the size of a football field and one of the largest ballrooms in the world. Archival materials are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The McCormick Place on the Lake 1971 Collection includes photographs, drawings and project files documenting its construction. [ Commuter station ] McCormick Place is the name of a station on the Metra Electric Line, and is located in the basement of McCormick Place.
