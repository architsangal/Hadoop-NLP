[ yes ] { China, } { Cuba, } { Laos, } { Vietnam, and } { North Korea. } Map of countries that declared themselves or were declared to be socialist states under the Marxist-Leninist or Maoist definition between 1979 and 1983 [ all ] A communist state is a state with a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist-Leninist communist ideology as the guiding principle of the state. Before, this meant public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party -run state is necessary for the possibility to further the interest of the working class; today, a communist state, as in China and Vietnam for instance, can exist alongside a mixed economy. According to Marxist-Leninists, the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling class, which in a socialist society is the working class, so a socialist state is, according to Leninists, a state of the working class. In practice, communist states do not refer to themselves as communist states. They do not do so to disguise the fact that the ruling party is communist, however, but because they do not consider themselves in the present time a communist society. Instead, they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist state s or workers&apos; states. The primary goal of these states, which also explains their official name, is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism, ultimately leading to communism. Communist states may have several legal political parties, but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government, { &quot; The first defining feature of a Communist system is the monopoly of power of the Communist Party &quot; : } { Archie Brown, The Rise and Fall of communism, Vintage Books, 2009, page 105 } often by statute or under the constitution. Consequently, the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined, such as in the development of parallel institutions. In the 20th century, most communist states adopted planned economies. However, there were exceptions: The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War II allowed limited markets and a degree of worker self-management, while China, Vietnam and Laos introduced far-reaching market reforms after the 1980s. In the 21st century, China and Vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to develop. The fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop. As a result, many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these states. For example, dissenting communists such as Trotskyist s were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century, claiming either that they had nothing to do with &quot; real &quot; communism or that the ideology of such states had reached a point of irrevocable corruption. [ Types of communist states ] While historically almost all claim lineage to Marxist thought, there are many varieties of communist states, with indigenous adaptions. For Marxist-Leninists, the state and the communist party claim to act in accordance with the wishes of the industrial working class. For Maoists, the state and party claim to act in accordance with the peasantry. Under Deng Xiaoping, the People&apos;s Republic of China proclaimed a policy of &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics &quot;. In most communist states, governments assert that they represent the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat. These Communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries; rather, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam &apos;s constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976, { VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992 Full Text. From the Preamble: &quot; On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country&apos;s name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty. &quot; } and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the Communist Party is to &quot; guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism &quot;. { Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992 Full Text. From Article 5: &quot; The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Martí’s ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society, &quot; } Alternative names that states adhering to an officially communist ideology may assign themselves is socialist state or socialist republic. This is because these nations have not yet transcended capitalism or state capitalism and progressed toward pure communism in the Marxist sense, which can only be achieved once capitalism exhausts itself. [ State institutions ] Communist states share similar institutions, which are organized on the premise that the communist party is a vanguard of the proletariat and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of democratic centralism, which was developed by Lenin as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large. { Furtak, Robert K. &quot; The political systems of the socialist states &quot;, St. Martin&apos;s Press, New York, 1986, pp. 8-9. } According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but, once a decision has been reached, all people have a duty to obey that decision and all debate should end. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a one-party system. The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy. { Furtak, Robert K. &quot; The political systems of the socialist states &quot;, St. Martin&apos;s Press, New York, 1986, p. 12. } Thus, they recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of representative parliament ary institutions. Communist states do not have a separation of powers; instead, they have one national legislative body (such as the Supreme Soviet in the Soviet Union) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government. { Furtak, Robert K. &quot; The political systems of the socialist states &quot;, St. Martin&apos;s Press, New York, 1987, p. 13. } Such national legislative politics in communist states often have a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in liberal republics, with two significant differences: first, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but the long-term interests of the people as a whole; second, against Marx&apos;s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days. { Furtak, Robert K. &quot; The political systems of the socialist states &quot;, St. Martin&apos;s Press, New York, 1986, p. 14. } When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a presidium ) which combines legislative and executive power, and, in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990), acts as a collective head of state. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law. [ State social institutions ] Another feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ( trade union s, youth organizations, women&apos;s organizations, associations of teachers, writers, journalists and other professionals, consumer cooperatives, sports clubs, etc.) which are integrated into the political system. In some communist states, [ March 2009 ] representatives of these organizations are guaranteed a certain number of seats on the national legislative bodies. In all communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society, and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members. { Furtak, Robert K. &quot; The political systems of the socialist states &quot;, St. Martin&apos;s Press, New York, 1986, p. 16-17. } [ Political power ] Historically, the political organization of many communist states has been dominated by a single-party monopoly. Some communist regimes, such as North Korea, East Germany or the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present. { Furtak, Robert K. &quot; The political systems of the socialist states &quot;, St. Martin&apos;s Press, New York, 1986, p. 18-19. } In addition, communist states are widely seen as being de facto dictatorships by historians and sociologists, as rigged elections have been commonplace under some communist governments. { United Nations Human Rights Website - Treaty Bodies Database - Document - State Party Report - Germany } Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of multi-party democracies, without seeking to establish a one-party state. Examples include San Marino, Republic of Nicaragua, [ http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/15/world/nicaragua-s-communist-party-shifts-to-opposition.html The New York Times Stephen Kinzer NICARAGUA&apos;S COMMUNIST PARTY SHIFTS TO OPPOSITION 15 January 1987 ] Moldova, Nepal (presently), Cyprus (presently), [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/mobile/europe/country_profiles/1016541.stm BBC News Country profile: Cyprus 3 March 2011 ] and the India n states of Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura. { Kerala Assembly Elections-- 2006 } However, for the purposes of this article, these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. [ Objections to use of term ] Not every country ruled by a communist party is viewed by left communists and Trotskyists { Tony Cliff: The Nature of Stalinist Russia } as a communist state, and the term &quot; communist state &quot; has traditionally been used in Western political scientists and mass-media to refer to a specific type of one-party state. Some communists, such as left communist s, { THE SO-CALLED &apos;SOCIALIST&apos; COUNTRIES } dispute the validity of the term &quot; communist state &quot;. In classical Marxism, communism is the final phase of history at which time the state would have &quot; withered away &quot; { The oft-cited quote is borrowed from a variation of the English translation of } { Anti-Dühring 1878 by } { Friedrich Engels, Part III: Socialism - «The proletariat seizes political power and turns the means of production in the first instance into state property. But, in doing this, it abolishes itself as proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need of the state, that is, of an organisation of the particular class, which was pro tempore the exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression corresponding with the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom, wage-labour). The state was the official representative of society as a whole; the gathering of it together into a visible embodiment. But it was this only in so far as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for the time being, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, the feudal lords; in our own time, the bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection; as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon our present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from these, are removed, nothing more remains to be repressed, and a special repressive force, a state, is no longer necessary. The first act by virtue of which the state really constitutes itself the representative of the whole of society—the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society—this is, at the same time, its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not &quot; abolished &quot;. It dies out.» } and therefore &quot; communist state &quot; is a contradiction in terms under premises of this theory. Current states are either in the capitalist or socialist phase of history making the term &quot; socialist state &quot; preferable to many communists and marxist theorists. { Badiou, Alain. The Communist Hypothesis, transl. by David Macey and Steve Corcoran; (New York: Verso, 2010 } Some socialists like left communists oppose the idea of a vanguard party pulling a nation towards communism, and thus the term &quot; socialist state &quot; is liable to cause confusion. Others assert that the role of the communist party (i.e. the vanguard party ) is to pull a nation toward the communist phase of history. Some Marxists have also opposed the usage of the term &quot; communist state &quot;. Their critique may be based on a variety of arguments, but nearly all anti-Stalinist communists argued that the Soviet model did not represent the interests of the working class. As such, Trotskyists { Leon Trotsky: The Revolution Betrayed } referred to the Soviet Union as a &quot; degenerated workers&apos; state &quot; and called its satellites &quot; deformed workers state s &quot;. [ Criticism ] [ Criticisms of communist party rule ] [ From the moderate liberal viewpoint ] Totalitarian communist regimes have been criticized for their one-party dictatorship s, totalitarian control of the economy and society and repression of civil liberties by the Council of Europe, { Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Resolution 1481 (2006) Need for international condemnation of crimes of totalitarian communist regimes } economic focus on heavy industry at the expense of consumer goods, sometimes resulting in shortages of vital products or even famine, { The Economics of Soviet Agriculture by Leonard E. Hubbard, p. 117-18 } and militarism and propaganda to cover up the mistakes of the government. [ The Birth of the Propaganda State: Soviet Methods of Mass Mobilization, 1917-1929 Kenez Peter Cambridge University Press 1985 0-521-31398-8 ] [ From the communist and socialist viewpoints ] Within the socialist and communist movements themselves, there are a number of criticisms of using the term &quot; communist states &quot;. Left communist s, { STATE CAPITALISM | International Communist Current } Anarchist s and some Trotskyists { Tony Cliff, for example. See: Tony Cliff&apos;s Internet Archive } contend that the so-called &quot; communist &quot; or &quot; socialist &quot; states or &quot; people&apos;s states &quot; were actually state capitalist and thus cannot be called &quot; socialist &quot;. [ Modern period ] [ List of current communist states ] The following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined; hence they fall under the definition of Socialist states seeking to build a communist society. They are listed here together with the year of their founding and their respective ruling parties: { CIA } { World Factbook : FIELD LISTING :: GOVERNMENT TYPE } [ People&apos;s Republic of China People&apos;s Republic of China ] [ Cuba Republic of Cuba ] [ Laos Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic ] [ Vietnam Socialist Republic of Vietnam ] Triumvirate: Nguyễn Phú Trọng Nguyễn Tấn Dũng Trương Tấn Sang Country Since Party Leader 1 October 1949 Communist Party of China Hu Jintao 1 May 1961 Communist Party of Cuba Raúl Castro 2 December 1975 Lao People&apos;s Revolutionary Party Choummaly Sayasone 2 July 1976 Communist Party of Vietnam [ Disputed ] [ North Korea Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea ] (since 1948); the Workers&apos; Party of Korea has removed all Marxist-Leninist and communist references in the constitution and government, a Party congress has not been held since 1980, hereditary rule, and officially follows Juche. [ Democratic states with communist governments ] There are multi-party states that currently have communist parties in government. Such states are not considered to be communist states as the countries themselves allow for multiple parties, and do not provide a constitutional role for their communist parties. [ Cyprus ] [ Nepal ] (since February 2008); Progressive Party of Working People (since April 2008); Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist); In Nepal, the ruling Communist parties participate in a multi-party coalition government, an alliance of 22 parties that holds 350 seats in the 601-member constituent assembly. [ Communist parties as part of other ruling coalition ] There are also some parties that participate as junior partners in ruling coalitions, as listed below.
