[ Superoxide dismutase 1.15.1.1 9054-89-1 1/15/1/1 0004784 Superoxide dismutase 2 PDB 1VAR.png Structure of a human Mn superoxide dismutase 2 tetramer. ] Superoxide dismutases (SOD, [ 1.15.1.1 ] ) are enzyme s that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. One of the exceedingly rare exceptions is Lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different mechanism. [ Reaction ] The SOD-catalysed dismutation of superoxide may be written with the following half-reactions : M (n+1)+ -SOD + O 2 &amp; minus; → M n+ -SOD + O 2 M n+ -SOD + O 2 &amp; minus; + 2H + → M (n+1)+ -SOD + H 2 O 2. where M = Cu (n=1); Mn (n=2); Fe (n=2); Ni (n=2). In this reaction the oxidation state of the metal cation oscillates between n and n+1. [ Types ] [ General ] Irwin Fridovich and Joe McCord first discovered and established their superoxide dismutase activity. However, SOD&apos;s were previously known as a group of metalloproteins with unknown function. For example, CuZnSOD was known as erythrocuprein and as the veterinary antiinflamatory drug &quot; Orgotein &quot;.

Thus, there are three major families of superoxide dismutase, depending on the metal cofactor: Cu/Zn (which binds both copper and zinc), Fe and Mn types (which bind either iron or manganese), and the Ni type, which binds nickel.

The Role of Superoxide Dismutase in Combating Oxidative Stress in Higher Plants The Botanical Review 66 1 89–98 2008 ] Specifically, molecular O2 is reduced to O2- (an ROS called superoxide) when it absorbs an excited electron released from compounds of the electron transport chain. Superoxide is known to denature enzymes, oxidize lipids, and fragment DNA. SODs catalyze the production of O2 and H2O2 from superoxide (O2-), which results in less harmful reactants. When acclimating to increased levels of oxidative stress, SOD concentrations typically increase with the degree of stress conditions. The compartmentalization of different forms of SOD throughout the plant makes them counteract stress very effectively. There are three well-known and studied classes of SOD metallic coenzymes that exist in plants. First, Fe SODs consist of two species, one homodimer (containing 1-2 g Fe) and one tetramer (containing 2-4 g Fe). They are thought to be the most ancient SOD metalloenzymes and are found within both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Fe SODs are most abundantly localized inside plant chloroplasts, where are they are indigenous. Second, Mn SODs consist of a homodimer and homotetramer species each containing a single Mn(III) atom per subunit. They are predominantly found in mitochondrion and peroxisomes. Third, Cu-Zn SODs have electrical properties very different from the other two classes. These are concentrated in the chloroplast, cytosol, and in some cases the extracellular space. Note that Cu-Zn SODs provide less protection than Fe SODs when localized in the chloroplast. [ Bacteria ] Human white blood cells generate superoxide and other reactive oxygen species to kill bacteria. During infection, some bacteria (e.g., Burkholderia pseudomallei ) therefore produce superoxide dismutase to protect themselves from being killed. [ Vanaporn M Superoxide dismutase C is required for intracellular survival and virulence of Burkholderia pseudomallei Microbiology 2011 21659326, Wand M Michell SL 3 Sarkar-Tyson M Ireland P Goldman S Kewcharoenwong C Rinchai D Lertmemongkolchai G 157 Pt 8 2392–400 10.1099/mic.0.050823-0 ] [ Biochemistry ] Simply stated, SOD out-competes damaging reactions of superoxide, thus protecting the cell from superoxide toxicity.The reaction of superoxide with non-radicals is spin forbidden. In biological systems, this means its main reactions are with itself (dismutation) or with another biological radical such as nitric oxide (NO) or with a transition-series metal. The superoxide anion radical (O 2 − ) spontaneously dismutes to O 2 and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) quite rapidly (~10 5 M −1 s −1 at pH 7). SOD is necessary because superoxide reacts with sensitive and critical cellular targets. For example, it reacts the NO radical, and makes toxic peroxynitrite. The dismutation rate is second order with respect to initial superoxide concentration. Thus, the half-life of superoxide, although very short at high concentrations (e.g., 0.05 seconds at 0.1mM) is actually quite long at low concentrations (e.g., 14 hours at 0.1 nM). In contrast, the reaction of superoxide with SOD is first order with respect to superoxide concentration. Moreover, superoxide dismutase has the largest k cat /K M (an approximation of catalytic efficiency) of any known enzyme (~7 x 10 9 M −1 s −1 ), [ Heinrich, Peter; Georg Löffler; Petro E. Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie (Springer-Lehrbuch) (German Edition) Springer Berlin 2006 123 3-540-32680-4 ] this reaction being only limited by the frequency of collision between itself and superoxide. That is, the reaction rate is &quot; diffusion limited &quot;. Even at the subnanomolar concentrations achieved by the high concentrations of SOD within cells, superoxide inactivates the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase, can poison energy metabolism, and releases potentially toxic iron. Aconitase is one of several iron-sulfur containing (de)hydratases in metabolic pathways shown to be inactivated by superoxide.

Chem. 270 22 13399–405 1995 June 7768942 10.1074/jbc.270.22.13399 ] [ Physiology ] Superoxide is one of the main reactive oxygen species in the cell. Consequently, SOD serves a key antioxidant role. The physiological importance of SODs is illustrated by the severe pathologies evident in mice genetically engineered to lack these enzymes. Mice lacking SOD2 die several days after birth, amid massive oxidative stress.

Drosophila lacking SOD1 have a dramatically shortened lifespan, whereas flies lacking SOD2 die before birth. SOD knockdowns in C. elegans do not cause major physiological disruptions. Knockout or null mutations in SOD1 are highly detrimental to aerobic growth in the yeast Sacchormyces cerevisiae and result in a dramatic reduction in post-diauxic lifespan. SOD2 knockout or null mutations cause growth inhibition on respiratory carbon sources in addition to decreased post-diauxic lifespan. Several prokaryotic SOD null mutants have been generated, including E. Coli. The loss of periplasmic CuZnSOD causes loss of virulence and might be an attractive target for new antibiotics.

Hence, high levels of free radicals can cause damage to them and induce dysraphic anomalies (neural tube defects). [ Pharmacological activity ] SOD has powerful antiinflammatory activity. For example, SOD is highly effective in treatment of colonic inflammation in experimental colitis. Treatment with SOD decreases reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress and, thus, inhibits endothelial activation and indicate that modulation of factors that govern adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Therefore, such as antioxidants may be important new therapies for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. [ Seguí J, Gironella M, Sans M, Granell S, Gil F, Gimeno M, Coronel P, Piqué JM, Panés J Superoxide dismutase ameliorates TNBS-induced colitis by reducing oxidative stress, adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed intestine J. Leukoc. Biol. 76 3 537–44 2004 September 15197232 10.1189/jlb.0304196 ] Similarly, SOD has multiple pharmacological activities. E.g., it ameliorates cis-platinum-induced nephrotoxicity in rodents [ 733940 10 3 Amelioration of cis-platinum nephrotoxicity by orgotein (superoxide dismutase) 1978 Physiol. Chem. Phys. 267–77 McGinness JE, Proctor PH, Demopoulos HB, Hokanson JA, Kirkpatrick DS ]. As &quot; Orgotein &quot; or &quot; ontosein &quot;, a pharmacologically-active purified bovine liver SOD, it is also effective in the treatment of urinary tract inflammatory disease in man [ 4615073 6 2 Orgotein: a new antiinflammatory metalloprotein drug evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety in inflammatory conditions of the urinary tract 1974 Int Urol Nephrol 61–74 Marberger H, Huber W, Bartsch G, Schulte T, Swoboda P ]. For a time, bovine liver SOD even had regulatory approval in several European countries for such use. This was truncated, apparently by concerns about prion disease. An SOD-mimetic agent, TEMPOL, is currently in clinical trials for radioprotection and to prevent radiation-induced hair-loss { http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/10/19/6411.full }. TEMPOL and similar SOD-mimetic nitroxides exhibit a multiplicity of actions in diseases involving oxidative stress. For a review, see Wilcox [ 20153367 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.01.003 126 2 Effects of tempol and redox-cycling nitroxides in models of oxidative stress 2854323 2010 May Pharmacol. Ther. 119–45 Wilcox CS ]. [ Cosmetic uses ] SOD may reduce free radical damage to skin-- for example, to reduce fibrosis following radiation for breast cancer. Studies of this kind must be regarded as tentative, however, as there were not adequate controls in the study including a lack of randomization, double-blinding, or placebo. [ Campana F, Zervoudis S, Perdereau B, Gez E, Fourquet A, Badiu C, Tsakiris G, Koulaloglou S Topical superoxide dismutase reduces post-irradiation breast cancer fibrosis J. Cell. Mol. Med. 8 1 109–16 2004 15090266 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2004.tb00265.x ] Superoxide dismutase is known to reverse fibrosis, perhaps through reversion of myofibroblasts back to fibroblasts. [ Vozenin-Brotons MC, Sivan V, Gault N, Renard C, Geffrotin C, Delanian S, Lefaix JL, Martin M Antifibrotic action of Cu/Zn SOD is mediated by TGF-beta1 repression and phenotypic reversion of myofibroblasts Free Radic.
