In its earliest days the MKT was commonly referred to as &quot; the K-T &quot;, which was its stock exchange symbol; this common designation soon evolved into &quot; the Katy &quot;. The Katy was the first railroad to enter Texas from the north. Eventually the Katy&apos;s core system would grow to link Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri; Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Temple, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and Galveston, Texas. An additional mainline between Fort Worth and Salina, Kansas, was added in the 1980s after the collapse of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad; this line was operated as the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad (OKKT). At the end of 1970 MKT and BM &amp; E operated 2623 miles of road and 3765 miles of track. [ History ] An 1881 advertisement for the line When it incorporated in May 1870 the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad immediately acquired the Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch and its [ 182 mi km 0 ] of track. The Union Pacific Railway was, for a period of several years in the late 19th century the official name of the Union Pacific Railroad who later acquired MKT as part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch had begun operations in 1865. At the time of 1870 incorporation, consolidations were also made with the Labette &amp; Sedalia Railway Co. and the Neosho Valley &amp; Holden Railway Co. At this time MKT also acquired the Tebo &amp; Nosho Railroad Co., the St. Louis &amp; Santa Fe Railroad Co., and the Hannibal &amp; Central Missouri Railroad Co. Combined with the Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch these small, newly built railroads formed the foundation on which the Katy would build. Congress had passed acts promising land grants to the first railroad to reach the Kansas border via the Neosho Valley and the part of the Katy had been the Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch was in a heated competition for the prize. On June 6, 1870, Katy workers laid the first rails across the Kansas border winning the race. Ironically the promised land grants never materialized; the courts overturned the grants promised by Congress because the land was in Indian Territory and was the property of the Indian tribes. Still the Katy continued its push southward, laying track and acquiring other small railroads, extending its reach to Dallas in 1886, Waco in 1888, Houston in April 1893 and to San Antonio 1901.

In 1896, as a publicity stunt set up by William George Crush, the Katy crashed two locomotives, pulling loaded trains, at a site that came to be known thereafter as Crush, Texas. The collision occurred before over 40 thousand spectators, three of whom died (and there were several injuries) when the exploding boilers sent debris flying. Ragtime composer Scott Joplin, who was performing in the area at the time, commemorated the event in &quot; The Great Crush Collision March &quot; (which he dedicated to the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway). { Scott Joplin, &quot; The Great Crush Collision March &quot; sheet music (Temple, TX: John R. Fuller, 1896). See Bill Edwards, Rags and Pieces by Scott Joplin. } From 1915 until January 4, 1959 the Katy, in a joint venture with the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway (popularly known as the Frisco), operated the Texas Special from St. Louis to Dallas, Ft. Worth, and San Antonio. It sported rail cars with names like Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, David Crockett, and James Bowie. { Baldwin DS-4-4-1000, on display in } { Parsons, Kansas. } The Katy&apos;s purchase by the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac) and the MoPac&apos;s owner, the Union Pacific, was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1988. With the merger movement in full swing across the industry by the 1980s, for the Katy this proved to be a major setback as it cost the railroad much overhead traffic, which it depended on. [ December 2009 ] Surrounded by much larger systems the railroad had to find a merger partner. On December 1, 1989 the Katy was merged into the MoPac, and the MKT is now part of the Union Pacific Railroad system. Much of the Missouri track has been converted into a Missouri State Park, the Katy Trail State Park. A [ 3.5 mi km 0 on ] long section, also called the Katy Trail, is being converted into a multi-use trail through downtown Dallas, linking White Rock Lake to the American Airlines Center. In 1997 the segment linking Katy to downtown Houston was abandoned and stripped soon after. The section between Katy and Interstate 610 was purchased by TxDOT in 1998 for the expansion of Katy Freeway, and the line that went into Houston was purchased by the City of Houston&apos;s Parks and Recreation Department. In 2009 it was paved and became the Heights Bike Trail. In July 2005 Union Pacific unveiled a new EMD SD70ACe locomotive, Union Pacific 1988, in MKT colors as part of a new heritage program. Herald [ Passenger trains ] The Katy operated the following named passenger trains: St. Louis, Missouri - San Antonio, Texas (March 4, 1917 – 1959)jointly with the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway), then Kansas City-San Antonio (1959-July 26, 1964), then Kansas City-Dallas (July 27, 1964 to June 30, 1965) { Train numbers 3 and 4: } { Katy Limited } { Train numbers 5 and 6: } { Katy Flyer } { Train numbers 7 and 8: } { Bluebonnet } [ Livery paint schemes ] [ Wood Sylvan R.

K. &amp; T. R. W. inside the oval and on the side of the crew cab, a one and one-half inch gold line on the outer edge and the number of the engine in the center of field in gold, black shaded and split on the rear of the tender. All passenger engines were finished with gold lettering and striping. Rolling stock used colors common in those days, i.e. boxcar brown, caboose red, etc. 1880′s-1900′s Steam locomotive livery was simplified after the infamous Jay Gould gained control of the railroad. Gould instructed shop personnel to paint all engines black and place the railroad initials M. K. &amp; T. in about 12 inch letters on the side of the tender tank bordered by half inch striping. The engine number was placed on side of the crew cab, side of the sand dome, coping of the tender and back of tender. Rolling stock used colors common in those days, i.e. boxcar brown, caboose red, etc. 1900′s-1923 Steam locomotive livery was simplified to overall shiny black, dark graphite smokebox, smokebox door and stack. The color of all lettering and numbers changed to white. The road name, M. K. &amp;. T. was moved to the side of the crew cab along with the engine number. The engine number was painted on the side of the tenders in large numerals and on the rear in smaller numerals, the number remained on the sand dome. Rolling stock used colors common in those days, i.e. boxcar brown, caboose red, etc. 1928-1947 Steam locomotives were shiny black with the MKT herald on their tenders. Rolling stock used colors common in those days, i.e. boxcar brown, caboose red, etc. 1947-1957 Diesels were bright red with silver side panels and cream yellow on top of the nose hoods. Passenger cars were painted to match. Boxcars, cabooses, and other rolling stock were frequently painted Sloan Yellow (named for MKT President Matthew S. Sloan) 1957-1965 Diesels were painted an orange-red with yellow MKT and road numbers. The herald was changed to read simply &quot; Katy &quot; in red letters on a gold background. The text and herald were outlined in black. 1965-1971 The Katy returned to a bright red paint, perhaps deeper than the original 1947 through 1957. They also returned to the original herald. 1971-1988 Diesel Locomotives, cabooses, and other rolling stock were painted green with yellow stripes, lettering and numbering. The first Katy locomotive painted into this scheme was GP7 #123. In its final years, the Katy acquired several locomotives second-hand which, due to its impending acquisition by Union Pacific were not painted into the standard green and yellow scheme. MKT acquired 18 GP40 s from Conrail in late 1983 that were numbered 231-248 ( example ). A set of nine GP39-2 s were acquired from Kennecott Copper Corporation in late 1984. Ex KCC #779-783, 785, and 787-789 were renumbered MKT #380-388 ( example ). In 1985, 3 additional GP38 s were purchased from Conrail that were numbered 322-324 and finally 19 GP38AC s were purchased from Illinois Central Gulf and numbered 325-343 ( example ). The changes in MKT&apos;s red paint were most likely due to problems with fading in the intense Texas sun. This may also have been the reason to change to green in 1970.

[ August 2008 ] [ In popular culture ] The Houston suburb of Katy, Texas, takes its name from the railroad&apos;s nickname. Named after this town is the &quot; Katy Freeway, &quot; which comprises the length of Interstate 10 between Katy and downtown Houston. The highway was originally built paralleling the MKT tracks west of Interstate 610, but with the abandonment of that portion of the rail line, the highway has been widened onto the former MKT right-of-way. This makes the name of the highway even more fitting. An early blues song, &quot; Bad luck blues &quot; by Blind Lemon Jefferson, mentions the railroad: Sugar, you catch the Katy, I&apos;ll catch that Santa Fe, doggone my bad luck soul, Sugar, you catch that Katy and I&apos;ll catch that Santa Fe; I mean the Santy, speakin&apos; about Fe, When you get in Denver, pretty mama, look around for me.
