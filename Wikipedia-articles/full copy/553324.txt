[ 1994 ] { Chris Johnston, Sam Dorsett } { No Idea Records, as well as other independent channels } { Punk rock, } { pop punk, } { folk punk, } { folk } { United States } { Bloomington, Indiana } Plan-It-X Records (also known as PIX) is an independent record label in the United States. Originally based in Georgetown, Indiana, PIX is currently based out of Bloomington, Indiana following brief stints in Olympia, Washington, Gainesville, Florida and Cairo, Illinois. They are best known for releasing folk punk and pop punk. Some consider the label most notable for releasing an EP by the band Against Me! ( Crime As Forgiven By ). However, and with great disappointment to Plan-It-X, the band has since requested to repress the record on their tour manager/merch guy&apos;s label, Sabot Productions, as the band felt alienated by the community surrounding the label and notably the message board. { Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://www.plan-it-x.org/release/against-me-/crime-as-forgiven-by-/ } Plan-It-X has also released other notable albums by This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb, Defiance, Ohio, Ghost Mice, Japanther, The Bananas, Operation: Cliff Clavin, and Antsy Pants (a project featuring Kimya Dawson of the Moldy Peaches ), and re-released albums by Fifteen, among others. { Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://www.punknews.org/labels/planitx } Founded in 1994 with a strict DIY punk ethic, the label sells all CDs for five dollars or less. PIX&apos;s slogan reads: &quot; If it ain&apos;t cheap, it ain&apos;t punk &quot;. PIX attempts to demonstrate that the practices of major record labels do not need to be duplicated by independent record labels in order to be successful. They support other small labels and encourage others to do so as well (and even go as far as to suggest starting your own label). The label is run by Chris Johnston and his friends. Johnston currently plays in the bands Ghost Mice and Imperial Can, as well as his solo acts Captain Chaos and Chris Clavin, and is a former band member of Operation: Cliff Clavin, The Devil Is Electric, The Ted Dancin&apos; Machine, Peanucle, The Sissies, and The Jammy Dodgers. Beyond the release of musical albums, Plan-It-X has released a book by author Greg Wells (Complete Control: An Anthology 1997-2005), the zine My Friend Bubby, as well as a DVD featuring live performances of bands filmed during Plan-It-X Fest 2004 (see below). A documentary was released in 2010, put together from footage shot across the week of the 2006 Plan It X Fest. { Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/videos/2685/ } [ Plan-It-X Fest ] In 2004 Plan-It-X Records celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a three day festival in Bloomington, Indiana. A large portion of the bands involved with the label performed throughout the three day event. With the success of the 2004 fest, Plan-It-X decided to take the festival on the road the following year in 2005 with a number of their bands in a school bus. The school bus toured throughout the Eastern and Midwestern United States. 2006 saw the third Plan-It-X fest return to Bloomington as a six-day &quot; Punk Rock Summer Camp, &quot; with bands playing every night and workshops and other activities throughout the afternoon. Like the two previous fests, 2006&apos;s fest raised money for charity. This year a total of $8,200 was split amongst three different charities. 2011 will see the fourth Plan-It-X Fest. It will take place on June 24, 25, and 26 in Bloomington, Indiana. Like previous fests, this one will be a benefit for several grassroots organizations. It will also mark the release of PIX99, a book based on founder Samantha Dorsett&apos;s life.

Plan-It-X carries all of the Plan-It-X South releases in their catalog. This arrangement benefits Chris Johnston, as Teddy operates and finances PIX South, so the burden is taken off of Johnston. And since the releases are distributed through the main PIX catalog, it allows Teddy the opportunity to take part in the production and release of more music, distributed through a channel already proven successful. PIX South shares the same DIY punk ethic of its mother label. { Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://www.plan-it-x.org/artist/future-virgins-the/ } [ PIX South Bands ] ADD/C Friday Knight The Future Virgins The Hidden Spots Landlord PantyShanty Rymodee Sexy Stressface This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb [ Notes ] [ See also ] List of record labels [ External links ] [ http://www.plan-it-x.org ] Official Message Board Official Plan-It-X Fest 2006 Site Official Plan-It-X Fest 2005 Site Category:American independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1994 Category:Punk record labels
