African countries where they are present include Mauritania, Ghana, Senegal, Guinea, The Gambia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Côte d&apos;Ivoire, Niger, Chad, Togo, the Central African Republic, Liberia, and as far as Sudan and Egypt in the East. Fula people form a minority in every country they inhabit, but in Guinea they represent a plurality of the population (40%). [ gv Guinea ] [ Terminology ] { Wodaabe subgroup performing Yaake dance } There are also many names (and spellings of the names) used in other languages to refer to the [ Fulɓe ]. Fulani in English is borrowed from the Hausa term, and it is also used by the Manding peoples, being the diminutive form of the word &quot; Fula &quot; in their language, essentially meaning &quot; little Fula &quot;. Fula, from Manding languages, is also used in English, and sometimes spelled Fulah or Foulah. Fula and Fulani are commonly used in English, including within Africa. The French borrowed the Wolof term Pël, which is variously spelled: Peul, Peulh, and even Peuhl. More recently the Fulfulde / Pulaar term [ Fulɓe ], which is a plural noun (singular, Pullo) has been Anglicised as Fulbe, { The letter &quot; } { ɓ &quot; is an implosive b sound, which does not exist in English. In the } { orthography for languages of Guinea (pre-1985), this sound was represented by } { bh, so one would have written Fulbhe instead of } [ Fulɓe ] { or Fulbe. } which some people use. In Portuguese, the terms Fula or Futafula are used. [ Related groups ] Fula society in some parts of West Africa features the &quot; caste &quot; divisions typical of the region. In Mali and Senegal for instance, those who are not ethnically Fula have been referred to as [ yimɓe pulaaku ] (people of the Fula culture). [ October 2007 ] One closely related group is the Tukolor (Toucouleur) in the central Senegal River valley, who had a strong kingdom paying a negotiated tribute to the Fula. Large numbers of other Fula-speakers live scattered in the region and have a lower status. They are descendants of Fula-owned slaves. Now legally emancipated, in some regions they still pay tribute to Fula elites, and they are often denied chances for upward social mobility. { Lotte Pelckmans (2011) Travelling hierarchies. Roads in and out of slave status in a central Malian Fulbe network. } In-between groups are the Fula-speaking fishermen and handcraftsmen. These groups are often collectively referred to (together with [ Fulɓe ] of the region) as Haalpulaar ( [ Haalpulaar&apos;en ], literally &quot; Pulaar-speakers &quot; ). The Wodaabe ( [ Woɗaaɓe ] ), are a subgroup of the Fula people. [ Traditional livelihood ] The Fulani are traditionally a nomadic, pastoralist, trading people, herding cattle, goat s and sheep across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations. [ History ] [ Origins and spread ] Young Fulani cattle herders circa 1967 Fula woman from Niger The people who are known to English speakers as Fulani refer to themselves as the Fulɓe (Pullo, singular). In Nigeria, the Fulani are often categorized with the Hausa as a conglomerated ethnic group Hausa-Fulani. Following the Fulani War, their histories in the region have been largely intertwined. Outside Nigeria, the two groups are usually considered distinct. [ Rise to political dominance ] [ Fula jihads ] Beginning as early as the 17th or was it the 9th and 18th centuries, but mainly in the 19th century, Fulas and others took control of various states in West Africa. These included the Fulani Empire, also known as the Sokoto Caliphate, founded by Usman dan Fodio (which itself included smaller states), Fouta Djallon, Massina and others. [ Culture and language ] The language of Fulas is called Pulaar or Fulfulde depending on the region, or variants thereof. It is also the language of the Tukulor. It is a language closely related to Wolof and Serer. All Senegalese who speak the language natively are known as the Halpulaar or Haalpulaar&apos;en, which stands for &quot; speakers of Pulaar &quot; ( &quot; hal &quot; is the root of the Pulaar verb haalugol, meaning &quot; to speak &quot; ). In some areas, e.g. in northern Cameroon, Fulfulde is a local lingua franca. With the exception of Guinea (where the Fula make up a ~40% plurality of the population), Fulas are minorities in every country they live in (most countries of West Africa and parts of Central and North Africa), so most also speak other languages of the countries they inhabit. [ Clothing ] Fulani women with traditional facial tattoos Fulani Herder from Mali The traditional dress of the Fula consists of long colourful flowing robes, modestly embroidered or otherwise decorated. Also characteristic Fula tradition is that of women using henna and indigo around the mouth, resulting in a blackening around the lips. Fula ethics are strictly governed by the notion of pulaaku. Men wear long robes to the lower calves with trousers of cotton. Herdsmen wear the distinctive conical straw hat and a turban. Women wear long robes and turbans. They decorate themselves with necklaces, earrings, nose rings and anklets. { Pulaaku Ethics } [ Herding ] Fula are primarily known to be pastoralists, but are also traders in some areas. Most Fula in the countryside spend long times alone on foot, moving their herds; they were the only major migrating people of West Africa, though most Fula now live in towns or villages. Wealth is counted by how large the herd of cattle is and how many cattle. Long ago Fulani tribes used to fight over cattle. [ Music ] The Fula have a rich musical culture and play a variety of traditional instruments including drums, hoddu (a plucked skin-covered lute similar to a banjo) and riti or riiti (a one-string bowed instrument similar to a violin), in addition to vocal music. The well known Senegalese Fula popular musician Baaba Maal sings in Pulaar on his recordings. &quot; Zaghareet &quot; or ululation is a popular form of vocal music formed by rapidly moving the tongue sideways and making a sharp, high sound. [ Food ] The Fulani traditionally eat millet, milk and meat as staples. Millet is eaten in the morning, noon and night as a porridge with a sauce or stew which usually contains tomatoes, peppers, bone, meat, onion and water and other vegetables. On special occasions they sometimes eat meat such as goat or beef. A thick beverage similar to the tuareg beverage eghajira is made by pounding goat cheese, milk, dates and millet. [ Houses ] Traditionally, Fula live in domed houses during the dry season. The domed house is supported by compact millet stalk pillars. During the wet season, the house is covered by reed mats. However many Fula now live in mud or concrete block houses.
