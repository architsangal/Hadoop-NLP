[ the Belgian band Flat Earth Society (band) ] { Antarctica as an ice wall surrounding a disk-shaped Earth. } The Flat Earth Society (also known as the International Flat Earth Society or the International Flat Earth Research Society) is an organization that seeks to further the belief that the Earth is flat instead of an oblate spheroid. The modern organization was founded by Englishman Samuel Shenton in 1956 [ http://science.howstuffworks.com/space-conspiracy-theory8.htm Flat Earth Society howstuffworks.com 2009-06-15 ] and was later led by Charles K. Johnson, who based the organization in his home in Lancaster, California. The formal society was inactive after Johnson’s death in 2001 but was resurrected in 2004 by its new president Daniel Shenton.

February 23, 2010 ] [ Origins—the Zetetic societies ] [ Flat Earth ] The belief that the Earth was flat was typical of ancient cosmologies until about the 4th century BC, when the Ancient Greek philosophers proposed the idea that the Earth was a sphere, or at least rounded in shape. { &quot; Wherefore he made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures... &quot; } [ Plato http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html Timaeus 2011-01-29 c. 360 BC. ] Aristotle was one of the first thinkers to propose a spherical Earth in 330 BC. By the early Middle Ages, it was widespread knowledge throughout Europe that the Earth was a sphere.

BBC News 2008-08-04 2009-06-15 ] Modern hypotheses supporting a flat Earth originated with English inventor Samuel Rowbotham (1816–1884). Based on his incorrect interpretation of experiments on the Bedford Level, Rowbotham published a 16-page pamphlet, called &quot; Zetetic Astronomy &quot;, which he later expanded into a 430-page book, Earth Not a Globe, expounding his views. According to Rowbotham&apos;s system, the earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice ( Antarctica ), with the sun and moon 3000 miles (4800  km) and the &quot; cosmos &quot; 3100 miles (5000  km) above earth. { Schick, Theodore; Lewis Vaughn How to think about weird things: critical thinking for a new age Houghton Mifflin (Mayfield) (31 October 1995) ISBN 978-1-55934-254-4 p.197 } He also published a leaflet entitled &quot; The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures!! &quot; which argued that the &quot; Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture &quot;. [ Garwood 2007 46 ] Rowbotham and his followers, like William Carpenter who continued his work, gained attention by engaging in public debates with leading scientists of the day. One such debate, involving the prominent naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, concerned the Bedford Level experiment (and later led to several lawsuits for fraud and libel ). { &apos;&apos;Nature&apos;&apos; April 7, 1870. } [ The Form of the Earth—A Shock of Opinions New York Times 1871-08-10 http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r%3D1%26amp%3Bres%3D9C00EFDF113EEE34BC4852DFBE66838A669FDE%26amp%3Boref%3Dslogin 2007-11-02 PDF ] { Hampden, John (1870): The Bedford Canal swindle detected &amp; exposed. A. Bull, London. } Rowbotham created a Zetetic Society in England and New York, shipping over a thousand copies of Zetetic Astronomy. Council members in New York included the US Consul to China and the superintendent of Baltimore public schools. He also edited &quot; The Zetetic and Anti-Theorist: a monthly journal of practical cosmography &quot;. [ Garwood 2007 133 ] After Rowbotham&apos;s death, Lady Elizabeth Blount, wife of the explorer Sir Walter de Sodington Blount, established a Universal Zetetic Society, whose objective was &quot; the propagation of knowledge related to Natural Cosmogony in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures, based on practical scientific investigation &quot;. The society published a magazine entitled The Earth Not a Globe Review, and remained active well into the early part of the 20th century. A flat Earth journal, Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science, was published between 1901–1904, edited by Lady Blount. [ Garwood 2007 155–159 ] In 1901, she repeated Rowbotham&apos;s Bedford Level Experiment and photographed the effect, sparking a correspondence in the magazine English Mechanic with several counter-claims. Later it achieved some notoriety by being involved in a scam involving dental practices. [ Garwood 2007 182–6 ] After World War I, the movement underwent a slow decline. [ Modern incarnation ] In 1956, Samuel Shenton, a signwriter by trade, created the International Flat Earth Society as a successor to the Universal Zetetic Society and ran it as &quot; organizing secretary &quot; from his home in Dover, in Britain.

[ Garwood 2007 220–225 ] This was just before the launch of the first artificial satellite and when satellite images taken from outer space showed the Earth as a sphere rather than flat, the society was undaunted; Shenton remarked: &quot; It&apos;s easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye. &quot; [ Schadewald RJ http://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer Six &quot; Flood &quot; Arguments Creationists can&apos;t answer National Center for Science Education 2010-04-24 ] However it was not until the advent of manned spaceflight that Shenton managed to attract wide publicity, being featured in The New York Times in January and June 1964, when the epithet &quot; flat-earther &quot; was also slung across the floor of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in both directions. The society also took the position that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax, staged by Hollywood and based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke, a position also held by others not connected to the Flat Earth Society. On hearing this, Clarke sent a facetious letter to NASA &apos;s chief administrator: &quot; Dear Sir, on checking my records, I see that I have never received payment for this work. Could you please look into this matter with some urgency? Otherwise you will be hearing from my solicitors, Messrs Geldsnatch, Geldsnatch and Blubberclutch &quot;.

[ Garwood 2007 320 ] Shenton died in 1971 and Charles K. Johnson, inheriting part of Shenton&apos;s library from Shenton&apos;s wife, established and became the president of the International Flat Earth Research Society of America and Covenant People&apos;s Church in California. Under his leadership, over the next three decades, the Flat Earth Society grew in size from a few members to about 3,000. Johnson distributed newsletters, flyers, maps, and other promotional materials to anyone who asked for them, and managed all membership applications together with his wife, Marjory, who was also a flat-earther. The most famous of these newsletters was Flat Earth News. Johnson paid for these publications through annual dues of members, which ranged from US$ 6 to $10 over the course of his leadership.

To help establish the United States...of the world on this flat earth. Replace the science religion...with SANITY. The International Flat Earth Society is the oldest continuous Society existing on the world today. It began with the Creation of the Creation. First the water...the face of the deep...without form or limits...just Water. Then the Land sitting in and on the Water, the Water then as now being flat and level, as is the very Nature of Water. There are, of course, mountains and valleys on the Land but since most of the World is Water, we say, &quot; The World is Flat &quot;. Historical accounts and spoken history tell us the Land part may have been square, all in one mass at one time, then as now, the magnetic north being the Center. Vast cataclysmic events and shaking no doubt broke the land apart, divided the Land to be our present continents or islands as they exist today. One thing we know for sure about this world...the known inhabited world is Flat, Level, a Plain World.

ALL inventors have been anti-science. The Wright brothers said: &quot; Science theory held us up for years. When we threw out all science, started from experiment and experience, then we invented the airplane. &quot; By the way, airplanes all fly level on this Plane earth. The Flat Earth Society recruited members by attacking the United States government and all of its agencies, particularly NASA. Much of the society’s literature in its early days focused on interpreting the Bible literally to mean that the Earth is flat, although they did attempt to offer scientific explanations and evidence. [ Flat Earth News ] Flat Earth News, was a quarterly, four-page tabloid.

Johnson. The organization faced overwhelming scientific evidence and public opinion that maintained that the Earth is a sphere. The term &quot; flat-earther &quot; became commonly used to refer to an individual who stubbornly adheres to discredited or outmoded ideas. The society fell to around 200 members by 1980. These members still held the belief that the Earth is flat due to the influence of the Bible. Members stated that it must be accepted that the Earth is flat because the Bible says that it is flat, regardless of what science tells us.

Johnson himself died on March 19, 2001. [ Canadian branch ] The Flat Earth Society of Canada was set up by Leo Ferrari (1927–2010), a philosophy professor at the St Thomas University in 1970, together with Raymond Fraser and Alden Nowlan and was active till about 1984. Their aims were quite different from other flat earth societies. They claimed a prevailing problem of the new technological age was the willingness of people to accept theories &quot; on blind faith and to reject the evidence of their own senses. &quot; &apos; [ http://www.lib.unb.ca/archives/finding/ferrari/s2.html UNB Archives 2010 ] They published a newsletter, The Official Chronicle and promoted their ideas more widely through television and press. Its primary aims were &quot; to combat the fallacious deification of the circle, &quot; &quot; to restore man&apos;s confidence in the validity of his own perceptions &quot;, and &quot; to spearhead man&apos;s escape from his metaphysical and geometrical prison. &quot; [ Contemporary activities ] The logo of the modern Flat Earth Society In 2004, Daniel Shenton [ February 2012 What&apos;s his relationship to the elder Shenton? ] resurrected the Flat Earth Society, basing it around a web-based discussion forum which continues to operate and grow in size.

Some claim that it is a finite plane of unknown extent accelerating upwards at 9.8 m/s 2, whilst others claim it is an infinite plane. Although Flat Earthers generally regard this as a positive, undogmatic approach, attempts have been made to agree on a &apos;core&apos; theory or set of attributes.

In the film Hopscotch, Miles Kendig ( Walter Matthau ) jokes that he is bequeathing all his money to the Flat Earth Society. In the 1980s, talk show host Wally George often sparred with and ridiculed members of the Flat Earth Society on his show Hot Seat. Australia n talk show host Don Lane also had Flat Earth Society advocates on his show. A tourism commercial for Newfoundland and Labrador states that the Flat Earth Society claimed that Newfoundland and Labrador was one of the four corners of the world. California-based punk rock band Bad Religion include a song entitled &quot; Flat Earth Society &quot; on their 1990 album Against the Grain, as well as their compilation album All Ages and their live release 30 Years Live, written by Brett Gurewitz. A prominent feature of the song is the refrain &quot; lie, lie, lie, &quot; indicating a strong denunciation of the society and its theories. The band has produced similar songs criticizing other movements it views as pseudoscientific. English band Carter USM make reference to the Flat Earth Society in the song Senile Delinquent on their 1995 album Worry Bomb. Klutz Press mention the Flat Earth Society in the book &quot; Mother Nature Goes Nuts! &quot; in a section about the argument on global warming, saying how it is practically impossible to get everyone on earth to agree on one thing. In the Stephen King novella The Mist, the main character uses the name Flat Earth Society to describe a group that refuse to accept the presence of monsters in the mist outside. In the Monty Python short &quot; The Crimson Permanent Assurance &quot;, business clerks turned pirates sail a pirated building and attack competing businesses to build a business empire, when the narrator reads &quot; or so it would have been, if certain modern theories concerning the shape of the world had not proved to be disastrously wrong. &quot; just as the building tumbles off the edge of the earth.
