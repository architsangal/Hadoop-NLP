[ May 2012 ] [ ] Americium ( [ icon ˌ æ m ə ˈ r ɪ s i ə m ] [ AM ə RIS ee-əm ] ) is a transuranic radioactive chemical element that has the symbol Am and atomic number 95. This transuranic element of the actinide series is located in the periodic table below the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after another continent, America. [ The Transuranium Elements Glenn T. Seaborg Science 104 2704 1946 379–386 10.1126/science.104.2704.379 17842184 1675046 1946Sci...104..379S ] Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with alpha particle s in nuclear reactor s – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100  grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron source s and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242m Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer. Americium is a relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance. Its most common isotopes are 241 Am and 243 Am. In chemical compounds, they usually assume the oxidation state +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +7 and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contains intrinsic defects, which are induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles and accumulate with time; this results in a drift of some material properties. [ History ] The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939. The triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium (as the hydroxide), produced in 1944. LBL NEWS Magazine, Vol.6, No.3, Fall 1981, p. 49 Although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the University of California, Berkeley by Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso. They used a 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. { Obituary of Dr. Leon Owen (Tom) Morgan (1919–2002), Retrieved 28 November 2010 } The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory ) of the University of Chicago. Following the lighter neptunium, plutonium, and heavier curium, americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered. At the time, the periodic table had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after another continent, America : &quot; The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series. &quot; { Seaborg, G.

First plutonium -239 nitrate ( 239 PuNO 3 ) solution was coated on a platinum foil of about 0.5  cm 2 area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO 2 ) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid, and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The residue was dissolved in perchloric acid. Further separation was carried out by ion exchange, yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as pandemonium (from Greek for all demons or hell) and delirium (from Latin for madness). { Krebs, Robert E. The history and use of our earth&apos;s chemical elements: a reference guide, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0-313-33438-2 p. 322 } [ pandemonium ] [ delirium ] Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: 241 Am, 242 Am, 239 Am and 238 Am. Americium-241 was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of one neutron. It decays by emission of a α-particle to 237 Np; the half-life of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years.

Upon rapid β-decay, 242 Am converts into the isotope of curium 242 Cm (which had been discovered previously).

Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the Quiz Kids, five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war.

The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100  °C. [ Westrum Edgar F.

Therefore, all primordial americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now. Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll ), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium; due to military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.

Elevated levels of americium were also detected at the crash site of a US B-52 bomber, which carried four hydrogen bombs, in 1968 in Greenland. [ Eriksson, Mats On Weapons Plutonium in the Arctic Environment Lund University April 2002 Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark 15 November 2008 http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf PDF 28 ] In other regions, the average radioactivity due to residual americium is only about 0.01   picocuries (0.37   mBq ). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils. { Human Health Fact Sheet on Americium, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Retrieved 28 November 2010 } Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100  grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241 Am and 243 Am. { Hoffmann, Klaus Kann man Gold machen? Gauner, Gaukler und Gelehrte.

From the history of the chemical elements), Urania-Verlag, Leipzig, Jena, Berlin 1979, no ISBN, p. 233 } Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, have to be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, but it is still being developed for americium. { Baetslé, L.

[ Emsley John Nature&apos;s Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements New 2011 Oxford University Press New York, NY 978-0-19-960563-7 ] [ Synthesis and extraction ] [ Isotope nucleosyntheses ] { Chromatographic } { elution curves revealing the similarity between the lanthanides Tb, Gd, and Eu and the corresponding actinides Bk, Cm, and Am. } Americium has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactor s for decades, and kilograms of its 241 Am and 243 Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. { Greenwood, p. 1262 } Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241 Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. { Smoke detectors and americium, World Nuclear Association, January 2009, Retrieved 28 November 2010 } The heavier isotope 243 Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100–160 USD/mg. { Hammond C. R. &quot; The elements &quot; in } { Emeléus, H. J. Advances in inorganic chemistry, Academic Press, 1987, ISBN 0-12-023631-1 p. 2 } Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope 239 Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process: \mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{239}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [23.5 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 93}Np\ \xrightarrow [2.3565 \ d] {\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 94}Pu} The capture of two neutrons by 239 Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in 241 Am: \mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {2(n,\gamma)} \ ^{241}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [14.35 \ yr]{\beta^-} \ ^{241}_{\ 95}Am} The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of 241 Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to 241 Am, 241 Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further 241 Am. However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of 241 Pu decays to 241 Am after about 15 years, and the 241 Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years. { BREDL Southern Anti-Plutonium Campaign, Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Retrieved 28 November 2010 } The obtained 241 Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a light water reactor (LWR), 79% of 241 Am converts to 242 Am and 10% to its nuclear isomer 242m Am: { The &quot; metastable &quot; state is marked by the letter m. } [ 10.3327/jnst.41.448 Sasahara, A. et al.

The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where 239 Pu captures four neutrons under high neutron flux : \mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {4(n,\gamma)} \ ^{243}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [4.956 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{243}_{\ 95}Am} [ Metal generation ] Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium need to be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel ) is dissolved in nitric acid, and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a PUREX -type extraction (Plutonium –URanium EXtraction) with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ( raffinate ) by a diamide -based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques { Penneman, pp. 34–48 } with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of work has been done on the solvent extraction of americium. For example, a recent EU funded project codenamed &quot; EUROPART &quot; studied triazine s and other compounds as potential extraction agents.

Both Am and Cm are mostly present in solutions in the +3 valence state; whereas curium remains unchanged, americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes which can be washed away. { Penneman, p. 25 } Metallic americium is obtained by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride was first used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten. { Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, System No. 71, transuranics, Part B 1, pp. 57–67. } { Penneman, p. 3 } \mathrm{2\ AmF_3\ +\ 3\ Ba\ \longrightarrow \ 2\ Am\ +\ 3\ BaF_2} An alternative is the reduction of americium dioxide by metallic lanthanum or thorium : \mathrm{3\ AmO_2\ +\ 4\ La\ \longrightarrow \ 3\ Am\ +\ 2\ La_2O_3} [ Physical properties ] Double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-americium (A: green, B: blue, C: red). In the periodic table, americium is located right to plutonium, left to curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12  g/cm 3, americium is lighter than both curium (13.52  g/cm 3 ) and plutonium (19.8  g/cm 3 ); but is heavier than europium (5.264  g/cm 3 )—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173  °C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639  °C) and europium (826  °C), but lower than for curium (1340  °C). [ Wade W Preparation and some properties of americium metal Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry 29 2577 1967 10.1016/0022-1902(67)80183-0 10 ] At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P6 3 /mmc with lattice parameters a  = 346.8   pm and c  = 1124  pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double- hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. [ McWhan D.B. Cunningham B.B. Wallmann J.C. Crystal structure, thermal expansion and melting point of americium metal Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry 24 1025 1962 10.1016/0022-1902(62)80246-2 9 ] The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fm [ 3 ] m and lattice constant a  = 489  pm. This fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. [ Benedict U Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures Journal of the Less Common Metals 100 153 1984 10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4 ] There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770  °C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075  °C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium. { Young, David A. Phase diagrams of the elements, University of California Press, 1991, ISBN 0-520-07483-1 pp. 226–227 } As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties, such as electrical resistivity. [ Benedict U Dufour C Low temperature lattice expansion of americium dioxide Physica B+C 102 303 1980 10.1016/0378-4363(80)90178-3 1980PhyBC.102..303B ] So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2  µOhm·cm to 10  µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16  µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69  µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60  K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium. Americium is paramagnetic in a wide temperature range, from that of liquid helium, to room temperature, and above. This behavior is markedly different from that of its neighbor curium which exhibit antiferromagnetic transition at 52  K. [ Kanellakopulos B The magnetic susceptibility of Americium and curium metal Solid State Communications 17 713 1975 10.1016/0038-1098(75)90392-0 6 1975SSCom..17..713K ] The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5  ± 0.2) [ -6 ] /°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2  ± 0.4) [ -6 ] /°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6  ± 1.3  kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (Δ f H°) of aqueous Am 3+ ion is −621.2  ± 2.0  kJ/mol −1.

Am 3+ is colorless at low and reddish at higher concentrations. Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in acid s. The most common oxidation state for americium is +3, { Penneman, p. 4 } in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am 3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am 4+ (yellow-reddish), Am V O 2 +; (yellow), Am VI O 2 2+ (brown) and Am VII O 6 5- (dark green). { Americium, Das Periodensystem der Elemente für den Schulgebrauch (The periodic table of elements for schools) chemie-master.de (in German), Retrieved 28 November 2010 } { Greenwood, p. 1265 } All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. { Penneman, pp. 10–14 } For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811  nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715  nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992  nm. Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the permanganate ion (MnO 4 - ) in acidic solutions. { Holleman, p. 1956 } Whereas the Am 4+ ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am 3+, the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as americium dioxide (AmO 2 ) and americium(IV) fluoride (AmF 4 ). All pentavalent and hexavalent americium compounds are complex salts such as KAmO 2 F 2, Li 3 AmO 4 and Li 6 AmO 6, Ba 3 AmO 6, AmO 2 F 2. These high oxidation states Am(IV), Am(V) and Am(VI) can be prepared from Am(III) by oxidation with ammonium persulfate in dilute nitric acid, [ Asprey L. B. Stephanou S. E. Penneman R. A.

There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241 Am and 243 Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370  years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242m1 Am has a long half-life of 141  years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64  microseconds for 245m1 Am to 50.8  hours for 240 Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass. Americium-241 decays to 237 Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486  MeV (85.2%) and 5.443  MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit gamma-rays with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5  keV. [ http://87.139.25.178:81/eng/theory.htm α-decay of 241 Am.

It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to 242 Cm, but also by electron capture to 242 Pu (17.3%). Both 242 Cm and 242 Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through 238 Pu down to 234 U. Nearly all (99.541%) of 242m1 Am decays by internal conversion to 242 Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to 238 Np. The latter breaks down to 238 Pu and then to 234 U. Americium-243 transforms by α-emission into 239 Np, which converts by β-decay to 239 Pu, and the 239 Pu changes into 235 U by emitting an α-particle. [ Applications ] [ vertical right Residential smoke detector.jpg InsideSmokeDetector.jpg 200 Outside and inside view of an americium-based smoke detector ] [ Ionization detectors ] [ Americium smoke detector ] Americium is the only synthetic element to have found its way into the household, where one common type of smoke detector uses 241 Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. { Smoke Detectors and Americium, Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 35, May 2002. (Internet Archive), Retrieved 28 November 2010 } This isotope is preferred against 226 Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little of harmful γ-radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1   microcurie (37   kBq ) or 0.28 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium -237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrode s, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms. { Residential Smoke Alarm Performance, Thomas Cleary, Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, UL Smoke and Fire Dynamics Seminar.

Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page) } Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7  mW/g for 241 Am and 6.31  mW/g for 243 Am (cf. 390  mW/g for 238 Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is planning to use americium for its space probes. { Space agencies tackle waning plutonium stockpiles, Spaceflight now, 9 July 2010 } Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of 242m Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles.

Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining &quot; cathode &quot;. A single 3.2  kg 242m Am charge of such battery could provide about 140  kW of power over a period of 80 days. { Genuth, Iddo Americium Power Source, The Future of Things, 3 October 2006, Retrieved 28 November 2010 } With all the potential benefits, the current applications of 242m Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer. [ Neutron source ] The oxide of 241 Am pressed with beryllium is an efficient neutron source. Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction: \mathrm{^{241\!\,}_{\ 95}Am\ \longrightarrow \ ^{237}_{\ 93}Np\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ +\ \gamma} \mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma} The most widespread use of 241 AmBe neutron sources a neutron probe – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. 241 Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in neutron radiography, tomography and other radiochemical investigations. [ Production of other elements ] Americium is a starting material for the production of other transuranic element s and transactinide s – for example, 82.7% of 242 Am decays to 242 Cm and 17.3% to 242 Pu. In the nuclear reactor, 242 Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to 243 Am and 244 Am, which transforms by β-decay to 244 Cm: \mathrm{^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm} Irradiation of 241 Am by 12 C or 22 Ne ions yields the isotopes 247 Es ( einsteinium ) or 260 Db ( dubnium ), respectively. { Harry H. Binder: Lexikon der chemischen Elemente, S. Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart 1999, ISBN 3-7776-0736-3, pp.  18–23. } Furthermore, the element berkelium ( 243 Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding 241 Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of 243 Am with 15 N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium, discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of 243 Am with 18 O. [ Spectrometer ] Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 60-keV gamma ray emissions from 241 Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauge s and nuclear densometer s. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). { Nuclear Data Viewer 2.4, NNDC } Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete. [ Health issues ] As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth. { Public Health Statement for Americium Section 1.5., Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, April 2004, Retrieved 28 November 2010 } If consumed, americium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, roughly 45% of it goes to the liver and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over cortical and trabecula r surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of 241 Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the gonad s (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity.
