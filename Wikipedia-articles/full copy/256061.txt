Pachauri has been vocal on the issue of climate change and said, &quot; What is happening, and what is likely to happen, convinces me that the world must be really ambitious and very determined at moving toward a 350 target. &quot; 350 refers to the level in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that top climate scientists such as NASA&apos;s James Hansen agree to be a safe upper limit in order to avoid a climate tipping point. [ 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for IPCC ] { Al Gore on balcony of } { Grand Hotel, Oslo. } The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who had earlier criticised Pachauri when he was first elected in 2002. In its press release, the Nobel Prize Committee said:...the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 is to be shared, in two equal parts, between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change. &quot; On 11 December 2007, Pachauri (representing the recipient IPCC) and co-recipient Al Gore delivered their acceptance speeches at an awards ceremony in Oslo, Norway, on a day when delegates to a United Nations climate conference were meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Pachauri referenced the Hindu philosophy of &quot; &apos; Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam &apos;, which means &apos;the whole universe is one family,&apos; &quot; must dominate global efforts to protect the global commons. &quot; Returning to this theme throughout his speech, he quoted president of the Maldives in 1987 ( Maumoon Abdul Gayoom ): &quot;...a mean sea level rise of two meters would suffice to virtually submerge the entire country of 1,190 small islands, most of which barely rise two meters above sea level. That would be the death of a nation. &quot; Pachauri repeatedly emphasized his concerns regarding the implications of climate change for the world&apos;s poorest nations, referring to studies that: &quot;...have raised the threat of dramatic population migration, conflict, and war over water and other resources, as well as a realignment of power among nations. Some also highlight the possibility of rising tensions between rich and poor nations, health problems caused particularly by water shortages and crop failures... [ Commitment to other organizations ] Rajendra K. Pachauri is a member of the Fondation Chirac &apos;s honour committee { Fondation Chirac&apos;s honour committee }, ever since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace.

[ Controversies ] Christopher Booker and Richard North wrote an article for the Daily Telegraph in January 2010 alleging potential conflicts of interest related to Pachauri&apos;s membership of the board of ONGC and to research grants for TERI, a non-profit institution of which Pachauri is director general. They further alleged that financial anomalies existed at TERI Europe. Pachauri denied all allegations. In response to the allegations, the audit firm KPMG carried out a review at TERI&apos;s request.

The report explains its objectives and methodology and states that &quot; Work done by us was as considered necessary at that point in time &quot; and that it is based on the information provided by TERI, Pachauri and Pachauri&apos;s tax counsel. In a caveat the review explains that its scope was &quot; significantly different from an audit and cannot be relied on to provide the same level of assurance as an audit &quot;. KPMG examined payments made by private sector companies and found that payments amounting to $17.66 million were made to TERI itself, not to Pachauri.
