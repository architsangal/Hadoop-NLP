[ β the German eszett ß other uses Beta (disambiguation) ] [ Β β ] [ beta ] Beta ( [ UK ˈ b iː t ə ] or [ US ˈ b eɪ t ə ]; uppercase Β, lowercase β; [ Βήτα ] Bḗta) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet. In Ancient Greek, beta represented the voiced bilabial plosive [ /b/ ]. In Modern Greek, it represents the voiced labiodental fricative [ /v/ ]. The letter Beta was derived from the Phoenician letter Beth Beth. Letters that arose from Beta include the Roman letter ⟨ B ⟩ and the Cyrillic letters ⟨ Б ⟩ and ⟨ В ⟩. In the system of Greek numerals Beta has a value of 2. [ Name ] Like the names of most other Greek letters, the name of beta was adopted from the acrophonic name of the corresponding letter in Phoenician, which was the common Semitic word *bayt (&apos;house&apos;). In Greek, the name was [ grc βῆτα ] bêta, pronounced [ bɛ̂ːta ] in Ancient Greek. It is spelled βήτα in the modern monotonic orthography, and pronounced [ ˈvita ]. In English, the name is pronounced either [ /ˈbeɪtə/ ] (US) or [ /ˈbiːtə/ ] (UK)).
