The college&apos;s motto is &quot; Where Success is a Tradition. &quot; SUNY Fredonia was one of the state teachers&apos; colleges traditionally specializing in music education, but now offers a large number of programs in many areas, including a growing graduate division. The most popular areas include Communication, Music, Education, and programs of the Social Sciences. There are 82 majors and 41 minors. The SUNY Fredonia campus, located in Chautauqua County (southwest of Buffalo ) was designed by prominent architects I.M. Pei and Henry N. Cobb in 1968. { Six buildings on campus have stamp of I.M. Pei, SUNY Fredonia Office of Media Relations Campus Report, Accessed 6/14/2007, http://www.fredonia.edu/prweb/releases/impei.asp } { Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; Partners Projects, Accessed 6/14/2007, http://www.pcf-p.com/a/i/ } [ History ] [ Fredonia Academy (1826–1867) ] Originally opened in 1826 as Fredonia Academy under its first principal Austin Smith, the academy enrolled eight students. The first classes began on October 4, 1826. Within one year the Academy had 136 students, 81 boys and 55 girls. { Academy to State University: Fredonia&apos;s StoryWritten by William Chazanof, Accessed 6/16/2007, http://www.fredonia.edu/175thanniversary/history.htm } The Academy reached peak enrollment in 1856 with 217 students. The school was plagued by financial shortages, and was forced to close its doors in 1867. [ Normal School (1867–1948) ] In 1867, the college emerged in its second phase of existence as a New York State Normal School. On December 2, 1867, the Normal (as it became commonly known) began classes with 147 students, 62 boys and 85 girls. For students preparing to be teachers, no tuition was charged, books were supplied, and travel costs were reimbursed; in return, students had to promise to teach after graduation. Those students not studying for the teaching profession paid tuition and provided their own textbooks. During its 82 years of existence, Fredonia Normal had a tumultuous existence. With a fluctuating student enrollment and threats of state funding reductions, the school seemed to be in constant jeopardy of closing. Nonetheless, gradually the school was upgraded. In 1930, [ 58 acre m2 ] of land west of Central Avenue in the Village of Fredonia were bought to house a future campus. In 1938 a music building was constructed on the Central Avenue site. New York State Governor Herbert Lehman signed the Feinberg Law in 1942 that changed the Normal Schools into Teacher Colleges. [ State University System (1948–present) ] With the formation of the State University of New York on March 13, 1948, the college created a Division of the Humanities in 1958 and in 1960 Fredonia was selected by State University to grant the A.B. degree. Previously, Fredonia&apos;s curriculum was restricted for teacher training only. In 1968, the master plan for the central avenue campus was drafted by the highly respected architectural firm of I.M. Pei &amp; Partners of New York at the request of then-president Oscar E. Lanford. A complex came into being that consisted of Jewett Hall (science), Dods Hall (health and physical education), Rockefeller Arts Center (building for fine arts), administration, library and an infirmary. In 1970, Pei and Cobb returned to the SUNY Fredonia campus to complete the Erie Dining Hall and the suite-style residence halls. { Six buildings on campus have stamp of I.M. Pei, SUNY Fredonia Office of Media Relations, Accessed 6/16/07, http://www.fredonia.edu/prweb/releases/impei.asp } [ Architecture ] Architects I.M. Pei and Henry Cobb, who designed the master plan for the modernized campus in 1968. Many of the buildings are listed in architectural guides as examples of exceptional modern architecture. Some are described in architectural history books. The National Building Museum listed the SUNY Fredonia campus as one of I.M. Pei&apos;s ideal places to visit in its 1991 journal &quot; Blueprints. &quot; { Campus bears unique stamp of I.M. Pei&apos;s vision, SUNY Fredonia News Services, Accessed 6/16/07, http://www.fredonia.edu/news/News/Archives/tabid/1101/ctl/ArticleView/mid/1878/articleId/84/Campus-bears-unique-stamp-of-IM-Peis-vision.aspx } Pei is credited with designing Maytum Hall, Williams Center, Reed Library, Rockefeller Arts Center, McEwen Hall, and Houghton Hall as well as its characteristic circular perimeter, aptly named Ring Road. The design of Daniel Reed Library earned Henry Cobb and I.M. Pei the 1969 Prestressed Concrete Institute Award. Maytum Hall Williams Center Daniel A. Reed Library with the addition built in 1992 Rockefeller Arts Center [ Academic and administrative buildings on and off campus ] Reed Library was constructed in 1969. It is approximately the size of a regulation football field, provides seating for over 850 readers, and houses over 250,000 books. It is named for the late Daniel A. Reed (1875–1959), U.S. Representative from the Fredonia area for over 40 years. The four story addition to Reed Library was constructed in 1992, and consists of several study areas, a scholarship center, atrium, elevators, tower study lounge which leads to a fifth story, and the Tutoring Center. Michael C. Rockefeller Arts Center, constructed in 1968, is named after the youngest son of former Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, who disappeared in 1961 during an anthropological expedition in New Guinea. Designed by I.M. Pei and Partners, Rockefeller Arts Center includes King Concert Hall (a 1,200-seat concert hall), Marvel Theatre (a 400 seat proscenium theatre), Alice E. Bartlett Theatre (a 200-seat maximum black box theatre), an art gallery, and 24 classrooms. This building houses the Department of Theatre and Dance, and the Department of Visual Arts and New Media. The arts center was opened in 1968 by Clint Norton as its first Managing Director. He was followed by Robert B. D&apos;Angelo who served from 1970 to 1974 while he also served as a speech writer and adviser to then Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Following D&apos;Angelo in the directorship were Ted Dede, Nancy Palmer, Katherine Rushworth and Radford Thomas. Jefferson Westwood has served as director since 1982. Fenton Hall was named for the late Reuben Fenton, U.S. Senator, and Governor, who was born in Carroll, Chautauqua County. Fenton Hall houses the office of the University President, the Graduate Studies office, as well as classrooms, academic departments and the Gazebo Cafe (part of Signature Cafe). Computer Science, Modern Languages, English, and Philosophy are some of the departments located in Fenton. Mason Hall is home to the School of Music and was named after American music education pioneer Lowell Mason. This hall is actually three buildings, &quot; Old Mason, &quot; &quot; New Mason, &quot; and the recent addition of two rehearsal rooms, which are all connected together. Mason Hall includes over 100 personal practice rooms, several small ensemble practice rooms, and large ensemble rooms. Both Juliet J. Rosch Recital Hall and Diers Recital Hall are located here, as well as two state-of-the-art MIDI technology labs, and an extensive Studio Recording Department. Maytum Hall is an eight-story semi-circular office building and computer center, and was named after Arthur Maytum (1866–1953). He served as Chairman of the Board of Visitors of the Fredonia Normal School and Teachers college from 1928 to 1953. He also served as supervisor of the Town of Pomfret from 1931 to 1938. There is much speculation as to how many stories Maytum hall contains. Many contend that the central offices, along with the elevator stop at floor eight, and so should the floor count. However, the original president office was to be on the constructed ninth floor, but was moved due to lack of handicap access, along with a fear of riots shutting the president in. When walking from Thompson or Fenton, you can see the very large patio window of the ninth floor. The building is currently closed for major renovations and upgrades, and is expected to reopen sometime during the Fall 2011 semester. http://www.fredonia.edu/admin/facilities/construction.asp Offices usually in Maytum are temporarily distributed between Gregory Hall and the Williams Center. Steele Hall is mainly used as a sports center with a basketball court and an ice rink which are used for both campus and community events. It also contains classrooms, a newly constructed natatorium, raquetball courts, dancing practice rooms, and many other facilities. Thompson Hall is the largest academic building at SUNY Fredonia. It houses the departments of Multicultural Affairs, Psychology, Political Science, Speech Pathology, Sociology, and History, among others, plus the College of Education. The building is designed as riot proof. It has narrow stairwells, dimly lighted hallways, and no operable windows. Houghton Hall and Jewett Hall are the two science buildings at SUNY Fredonia. They house the departments of Geology, Physics, Chemistry, and Biochemistry, and the 3-2 Cooperative Engineering Program. LoGrasso Hall On campus medical services, along with counseling, and the office of international education. McEwen Hall Four level building, Contains lecture halls, Sheldon Media Labs, and Fredonia Radio Systems. College Lodge operated by the Faculty Student Association at SUNY Fredonia – is a certified experiential training facility and conference and events center offering a variety of workforce development, employee training, meetings and other services for businesses and organizations. Located in Brocton, NY, surrounded by 198 acres of mostly wooded, natural surroundings in Chautauqua County, The College Lodge can also accommodate banquets and other social functions, with complete catering services. Technology Incubator SUNY Fredonia Technology Incubator promotes economic growth in the Western Southern Tier of New York by supporting entrepreneurship and the development of new, innovative, technology-based companies into successful business ventures. The incubator, located in the commercial waterfront district of Dunkirk, New York, provides new technology-based firms with a connection to the resources they need to grow and sustain long-term success. This takes place in an environment that fosters technology development, commercialization and successful business management practices. To accomplish this, the incubator makes available a variety of business and education services, mentoring, professional consulting, access to capital and work-ready space. The incubator combines these resources and those of SUNY Fredonia, state and local government, area businesses, and the community in order to graduate businesses that are financially viable and freestanding. [ Campus construction projects ] [ Science Center ] Not since the I.M. Pei-designed centerpiece of the “modern” campus (Maytum Hall, Daniel Reed Library, McEwen Hall and Michael C. Rockefeller Arts Center) took shape in the late 1960s has there been such a wide range of construction and design activity going on at once. Campus officials broke ground last summer on the new, $60 million Science Center, the largest capital project in Fredonia’s history. When combined with the renovation of Houghton Hall, the complex will house all of the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and math) and herald a new era in science education at Fredonia. The new, three-story structure, the initial planning for which began in 2006, will house chemistry, biology and science education classes, labs and offices, and also provide support for environmental science. At over 92,000 square feet, the building will be longer than a football field, though not quite as wide. Among its impressive features are a 120-seat auditorium that will accommodate traditional and group learning activities; two “smart” classrooms suitable for all learning styles; an atrium featuring a café, displays and open seating; a roof-top observatory; an attached greenhouse; and several student reading and conference rooms. Faculty offices, situated in pairs, will be placed between teaching and research laboratories and also include informal teaching spaces composed of write-on glass walls and seating. Its many architectural highlights include a science balcony with a vaulted roof and views into a courtyard that will contain native plants and local geologic features. Visitors will be able to view first-floor laboratories from corridors and windows from the courtyard. The center was designed by Mitchell/Giurgola Architects, a New York City-based firm with a global reputation for excellence in the design of academic and scientific research facilities. Its portfolio includes projects at Cornell University, New York University and the University of Buffalo. Rochester, N.Y.-based Pike Company, the lead contractor, has built facilities at Cornell and the University of Rochester, and also directed the recent renovation of Fredonia’s Nixon Hall. [ Williams Center ] The first and second floor interiors of this circular campus icon have been closed since last May so they can be updated and reconfigured to make the facility more appealing and inviting. New glass walls around the Multipurpose Room, combined with reviving the building’s signature skylights, will create an open atmosphere. Major entrances are being modified to improve accessibility and traffic flow inside the building; the loading dock is being reworked to create better sight lines that enhance pedestrian and vehicle safety. The two dated, wooden-barrel-styled wall protrusions inside the Multipurpose Room are being replaced with balconies positioned to accommodate small musical ensembles. New windows will also be installed throughout the facility and recessed display cases placed in high-traffic areas. Below-the-surface upgrades include new wiring, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, new audio/visual equipment in classrooms and conference areas, and an updated sprinkler system. The building will also have enhanced acoustics throughout. The basement, which houses the Centre Point Food Court, Trendz Café and Horizon Room, was upgraded two years ago and has remained open during the renovation. In addition to the Multipurpose Room, the Williams Center also housed Financial Aid, Student Accounts, Lifelong Learning and Special Programs, the Student Association, Campus Life, the ticket office, The Leader, and the SUNY Fredonia Federal Credit Union, which have all been relocated. Manning Squires Hennig Co., of Batavia, N.Y., is the general contractor for this project that’s included in the five-year capital plan launched in 2008. The first and second floors, which contain over 60,000 square feet, are expected to re-open this fall. [ Dods Hall Fitness Center ] Students can look forward to benefits of a state-of-the-art fitness center in the former pool area in Dods Hall. Its 7,000 square feet – more than double the size of the current fitness center – will offer new cardio and circuit machines, free weights, a modern sound system, lots of televisions and a designated stretching area. A 20-foot climbing wall will also be part of the air conditioned facility. JCJ Architecture of Hartford, Conn., has designed the facility. Construction will start in May, with a January 2013 opening anticipated. [ Rockefeller Arts Center addition ] Projected at 40,000 square feet, this long-sought, two-story addition will be the fine arts center’s first expansion. The project, targeted to go out to bid in December, will accommodate relatively new programs that were not offered when the center opened 42 years ago, and also consolidate other curriculum offerings under one roof. For example, Dance and the Media Arts programs – now tucked away in Dods Hall and McEwen Hall, respectively – will be relocated to Rockefeller. Ceramics and sculpture studios will vacate their second floor space in favor of more practical first floor spaces. Key features of the addition will include a multipurpose room to host an assortment of events, such as pre-concert lectures, post-performance discussions, film and video showings, and small receptions. It will also result in three new dance studios, including one with flexible, tiered seating that can double as a performance space; a new, attractive public entrance; and a café. [ Townhouses ] Apartment-style living, a growing trend in collegiate housing, will make its SUNY Fredonia debut in August 2013 with the opening of the new townhouse village adjacent to Ring Road. Nestled between the softball and baseball fields, this townhouse cluster will convey a neighborhood atmosphere with front porches, balconies, a separate community building, common green space, walkways and parking. There will be five different apartment layouts, each consisting of four single bedrooms, two baths, a fully equipped kitchen and living/dining area. Buildings will range from one to three stories and contain a total of 196 beds.

Our students are engaged in actively learning about what it means to be an educator in the 21st Century through frequent early field experiences connected to educational methods courses as well as meaningful student teaching experiences. Candidates have various opportunities to explore teaching and learning in various settings (i.e., rural, suburban, and urban), across grade levels, and with diverse student populations. We also have additional, optional cultural enrichment field experiences within the United States and abroad including the SUTEC project in New York City and our annual exchange program with universities in Exmouth, England and Swansea, Wales. During J term (i.e., the winter intersession that occurs during January) we sponsor two week, international expeditions to explore educational practices in various countries. Students also have the opportunity to do one of their student teaching experiences in Australia where the COE partners with the University of Sunshine Coast. [ School of Music ] Undergraduate degree programs include: Music in Performance, Music Education, Composition, Musical Theatre, Music Therapy, Sound Recording Technology, Music, Music Business, Jazz Studies Concentration. Fredonia&apos;s School of Music has a strong history for excellence and distinction.

A student at Fredonia is able to learn and choose from a broad range of musical interests, making Fredonia one of the best places to enter professional training in music. Mason Hall is home to the School of Music. It has evolved with the needs of students, and it is now a multifaceted building with a variety of rehearsal rooms, classrooms, office/studios, practice rooms, labs and gathering spaces. The computer and keyboard labs are frequently upgraded, new technology is added to the classrooms, and the facilities are modified or expanded. Just in the past few years, new performance spaces, offices, and rehearsal rooms were added to Mason Hall. One of our newer additions, a state-of-the-art recording studio, offers the flexibility to work on projects within the studio, to record musicians in the adjacent live rooms, and to make high quality recordings of events occurring in the performance halls in Mason and elsewhere on campus. Diers Recital Hall, part of the original building, is used for concerts, lectures, master classes and rehearsals. The newer, larger Rosch Recital Hall is a magnificent space in which students, faculty and guest artists perform concerts for the campus and the public. Next door is the Rockefeller Arts Center, which houses the Department of Theatre and Dance, the Department of Visual Art and New Media, an art gallery, multiple theatres and the grand, 1,200-seat King Concert Hall. With these facilities and collaborative partners, we have a suitable performance space for nearly any type of concert or production. Other venues also exist in the community, most notably the 1891 Opera House on the Square. [ School of Business ] Undergraduate majors include: Accounting, Economics, Finance, Management, and Marketing. The Department of Business Administration provides its majors with a contemporary quality education in Business Administration, Accounting, and Music Business. These majors gain an awareness of their individual strengths and vocational interests in order to make appropriate career decisions. The department offers a rigorous, up-to-date curriculum that prepares students for imaginative and responsible citizenship and domestic and international leadership roles in business management. While the programs offered are career-oriented, the department realizes that successful contemporary business professionals must bring a broad and varied perspective to their crafts. Accordingly, the department requires that its majors take at least 66 of the total credit hours needed for a degree outside the department, with particular emphasis given to the development of written and oral communication skills and the acquisition of the ability to think creatively and critically.
