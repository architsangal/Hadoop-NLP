Visionaire is an art and fashion publication that has come out in limited, numbered editions three times a year since spring 1991. Each issue has a specific format and theme around which prominent artists, designers, photographers, and others guests edit the publication. The New Yorker called it a &quot; gallery in print &quot; [ February 2007 ] and W called it &quot; the couture version of a magazine. &quot; [ February 2007 ] The publication is one of only two still remaining out of a 1994 Vanity Fair list of 10 &quot; upstart &quot; magazines to watch, alongside Surface (magazine). { http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/11/28/LVG3V9UH0U1.DTL } Visionaire also has a monthly, wide-circulation magazine called V, edited by Stephen Gan, the focus of which is art, culture, and fashion.
