The player controls Samus Aran as she searches the planet for a Metroid that was stolen by Ridley, the leader of the Space Pirates. Along the way, the player collects power-up s that enhance Samus&apos;s armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities such as the Space Jump, which allows her to jump infinite times to cover great distances. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible. The game introduces several new concepts to the series. Among them are the ability to enable and disable weapons and abilities in an inventory screen, and a Moon Walk ability, named after the popular dance move of the same name, which allows Samus to walk backwards while firing her weapon. The game also features the ability to combine Samus&apos;s weapon beams. In addition, the save system from Metroid II: Return of Samus returns in Super Metroid, which allows the player to save and restart the game at any of the save points scattered around the planet. The player can also save the game at Samus&apos;s gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. [ Plot ] Chronologically, Super Metroid takes place seventh in the Metroid universe and immediately after the events of Metroid II: Return of Samus, and begins with a narrative by bounty hunter Samus Aran. Samus describes how a Metroid larva hatched from an egg and immediately imprinted upon her, believing her to be its mother. She brought the larva to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists learned that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen. The game begins as she follows the leader of the Space Pirates, Ridley, to the planet Zebes, where she searches for the stolen larva in a network of caves. [ Super Metroid instruction manual Nintendo 1994-04-18 ] Along the way, Samus defeats four of the Space Pirate bosses, including Ridley, and arrives in Tourian, the heart of the Space Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has now grown to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of her energy before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges her energy and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the base&apos;s systems. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn destroyed by Samus with an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetwide self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes. [ Development ] Super Metroid was developed by Nintendo R &amp; D1 with a staff of 15 people managed by Gunpei Yokoi. The game was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano, with music composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano.

When asked why the game took so long to make, Sakamoto responded, &quot; We wanted to wait until a true action game was needed. [...] And also to set the stage for the reappearance of Samus Aran. &quot; Super Metroid attempts to stay true to its predecessors. Its music uses 16-bit versions of music from previous games, and previously visited areas reappear. Nintendo Power complimented, &quot; This is great for fans who get an almost seamless transition from the previous games, &quot; noting that it also made it easier for the developers of Super Metroid to build the game because they could reuse existing material. Reused areas were modified &quot; to correct parts we were unhappy about in the original game &quot;. Previously seen areas were added to Super Metroid to add a sense of familiarity that would satisfy players of previous Metroid games, and &quot; the new sections also give a much greater sense of drama to the game. &quot; Sakamoto noted that Super Metroid was deeper and more involved than previous Metroid games, and considered it to have a more dramatic overtone. [ Everything you always wanted to know about Samus Game Players May 1994 7 5 18–20 ] The developers&apos; primary goal was to make the game a &quot; good action game &quot;. They wanted the game to have a large map, but found it difficult to organize the amount of graphic data involved. Coming up with several ideas, the developers decided to break the game up into many mini-adventures. Sakamoto observes, &quot; Thus, the major goal was how to create an effective mix of all the separate elements. We believe that we have almost completely succeeded in our objective. &quot; New weapons are introduced to the &apos;&apos;Metroid&apos;&apos; series in Super Metroid, including the Grapple Beam, used to latch a laser beam onto the ceiling. The game is the first in the series to let Samus fire in all directions while moving, and it is among the first open world games to offer the player a mapping facility. The feature shows the outlines of rooms, locations of important rooms, and dots for special items.
