[ inline,title 47 20 32 N 97 17 21 W region:US-ND_type:landmark ] { August 13, 1963 } [ 628.8 m ft 0 on ] { Hoak Media } { Hamilton Directors } { Kline Iron and Steel } The KVLY-TV mast (formerly the KTHI-TV mast) is a [ 628.8 m ft 0 on ] tall television -transmitting mast in Blanchard, Traill County, North Dakota, United States, used by Fargo station KVLY-TV channel 11. Completed in 1963, it was the tallest structure ever built until succeeded by the Warsaw radio mast in 1974; that mast collapsed in 1991, making the KVLY-TV mast again the tallest structure in the world until the Burj Khalifa overtook it in 2010. It remains the third-tallest structure in the world (since the construction of the Tokyo Skytree ), and the tallest structure in the United States. It is a guyed mast, not a self-supporting structure, and is therefore not included in lists of tallest buildings. The height of the transmitting antenna itself is [ 113 ft m ] and is included in the height of the tower as the lattice tower itself ends around [ 1950 ft m ]. [ N.D.

It became the tallest artificial structure, and the first man-made structure to exceed [ 2000 ft m ] in height, upon the completion of its construction on August 13, 1963. The tower was built by Hamilton Erection Company of York, South Carolina and Kline Iron and Steel, and took thirty days to complete, at a cost of US$ 500,000. Owned by Hoak Media of Dallas, Texas, the tower broadcasts at 356 kW for television station KVLY-TV (channel 11 PSIP, an NBC affiliate) which is based in Fargo. The tower provides a broadcast area of roughly [ 9700 sqmi km2 on ] which is a radius of about [ 55.6 mi km ]. Its height above mean sea level is [ 3038 ft m on ]. Some time after its completion, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a policy that states, &quot; Although there is no absolute height limit for antenna towers, both agencies have established a rebuttable presumption against structures over 2,000 feet above ground level. &quot; [ http://www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/dtv/lighting.html Antenna Tower Lighting and Marking Requirements Federal Communications Commission 2011-12-06 ] The FCC and FAA may approve a taller structure in &quot; exceptional cases. &quot; When the mast was built the call letters of the television station for which it was built were changed to KTHI, the &quot; HI &quot; referring to the height of the mast. The top is reachable by a two-person service elevator or ladder. The height of the structure allows for a broader range of frequency transmission.
