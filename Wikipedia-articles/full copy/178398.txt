The Church lies majestically on the top of Urnes. The Stave church is one of four Norwegian Churches on UNESCO `s list of the most precious cultural monuments in the world. The Stave church es are constructions of high quality, richly decorated with carvings. In virtually all of them the door frames are decorated from top to bottom with carvings. This tradition of rich ornamentation appears to go back to the animal carvings of the Viking age. The dragons are lovingly executed and transformed into long-limbed creatures of fantasy, here and there entwined with tendrils of vine, with winding stems and serrated leaves. The elaborate designs are executed with supreme artistic skill. The stave church doorways are, therefore, among the most distinctive works of art to be found in Norway. However, it is difficult to connect them with the Christian gospel. [ Gaupne old church ] This magnificent church was built in 1647 on a hill directly opposite Gaupne centre. [ Dale church ] This church is a stone church that was built in gothic style in the year 1250. [ Breheim center ] The Breheim Center contains a comprehensive exhibition.
