It had an estimated population of two million as of 2009. Basra is also Iraq&apos;s main port, although it does not have deep water access, which is handled at the port of Umm Qasr. The city is part of the historic location of Sumer, the home of Sinbad the Sailor, and a proposed location of the Garden of Eden. It also played an important role in early Islamic history, being built in 636 CE, or 14 AH. It is Iraq&apos;s second largest and most populous city after Baghdad. [ Etymology ] The city was called by many names throughout its history, Basrah being the most common. Although some Chaldean Christian s argue that the name has Akkadian roots, other sources claim that the name is derived from the Persian word Bas-rah, which means &quot; where many paths meet &quot;. During the pre-Islamic era, the area was known to the Arabs as al-Khariba due to the existence of an ancient city called al-Kharba. After the present city was built, it was called by many names, including &quot; the mother of Iraq &quot;, &quot; the reservoir of Arabs &quot;, &quot; the prosperous city &quot;, and &quot; al-Faiha &quot;. Mnawi Basha Hotel A Canal in Basra circa 1950 [ Overview ] The city is located along the Shatt al-Arab waterway near the Persian Gulf, [ 55 km mi us ] from the Persian Gulf and [ 545 km mi us ] from Baghdad, Iraq&apos;s capital and largest city. { The area surrounding Basra has substantial large } { petroleum resources and many } { oil well s. The city also has } { an international airport, with service into Baghdad with } { Iraqi Airways —the nation&apos;s flag airline. Basra is in a fertile } { agricultural region, with major products including } { rice, } { maize corn, } { barley, } { pearl millet, } { wheat, } { dates, and } { livestock. Iraq has the world&apos;s } { 4th largest oil reserves estimated to be more } [ 115 Goilbbl ] {, most of it from Basra. 80% of Basra&apos;s oil bearing fields is unexplored. } In Basra the vast majority of the population are ethnic Arabs of the Adnanite or the Qahtanite tribes. The main tribes that are located in Basra are Al-Emarah, Bani Tamim, Bani Assad, Bani Ka&apos;ab, Bani Malik, Shammar, Bani Khalid, Bani Sa&apos;ad, Al-shwelat `Anizzah, Suwa&apos;id, Al-bo Mohammed, Al-Jboor, Duwasir, Dhufair, Shreefat, Al-Badr [ February 2012 ], Al-Ubadi, Ruba&apos;ah Sayyid tribes (descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammed ) and hundreds of Arab tribes.In 2006, Muslim adherents were about 85% Shiite and 15% Sunni,, also a small number of Chaldean Christians live there. There are also remnants of the pre-Islamic gnostic sect of Mandaeans, whose headquarters were in the area formerly called Suk esh-Sheikh and they are a small community of 3000 people or less. A network of canal s flowed through the city, giving it the nickname &quot; The Venice of the Middle East &quot; at least at high tide. The tides at Basra fall by about [ 2.7 m ft us ]. [ March 2007 ] For a long time, Basra was known for the superior quality of its dates. { Produced the finest dates known 1st paragraph. retrieved 26 August 2007 } [ History ] [ First millennium ] { Shanasheel of the old part of Basra city, 1954 } The present city was founded in 636 as an encampment and garrison for the Arab tribesmen constituting the armies of amir ` Umar ibn al-Khattab, a few kilometres south of the present city, where a tell still marks its site. While defeating the Sassanid forces there, the Muslim commander Utbah ibn Ghazwan first set up camp there on the site of an old Persian settlement called Vaheštābād Ardašīr, which was destroyed by the Arabs. { according to } { Encyclopædia Iranica, } { E. Yarshater, } { Columbia University, p851 } The name Al-Basrah, which in Arabic means &quot; the over watching &quot; or &quot; the seeing everything &quot;, was given to it because of its role as a military base against the Sassanid empire. Other sources however say its name originates from the Persian word Bas-rāh or Bassorāh meaning &quot; where many ways come together &quot;. { See Mohammadi Malayeri, M. Dil-i Iranshahr. } In 639 Umar established this encampment as a city with five districts, and appointed Abu-Musa al-Asha&apos;ari as its first governor. Abu Musa led the conquest of Khuzestan from 639 to 642. After this, `Umar ordered him to aid `Uthman ibn Abu al-`As, then fighting Iran from a new, more easterly misr at Tawwaj. In 650, the amir ` Uthman reorganised the Persian frontier, installed `Abdallah ibn `Amir as Basra&apos;s governor, and put the invasion&apos;s southern wing under Basra&apos;s responsibility. Ibn `Amir led his forces to their final victory over Yazdegard III, king of Persia. in 656, Uthman was murder, Ali ibn Abu Talib was appointed Khalifa in a period that witnessed turmoils and distributions. In 656, the Sayabiga (possibly of Indian/Indonesian origin) were ordered to guard the treasury. Ali first installed `Uthman ibn Hanif as Basra&apos;s governor and then `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas. These men held the city for `Ali until the latter&apos;s death in 661. The Sufyanids held Basra until Yazid I &apos;s death in 683. Their first governor there was an Umayyad `Abd Allah, who proved to be a great general (under him, Kabul was forced to pay tribute) but a poor mayor. In 664, Mu`awiyah replaced him with Ziyad ibn Abu Sufyan, often called &quot; Ibn Abihi (son of his own [unknown] father) &quot;, who became famed for his Dracon ian methods of public order. On Ziyad&apos;s death in 673, his son Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad became governor. In 680, Yazid I ordered Ubayd Allah to keep order in Kufa as a reaction to Imam Hussein ibn `Ali, Mohammad&apos;s grandson, popularity there; Ubayd-Allah took over the control of Kufa, Imam Hussein, who wanted to restore the principles of Islam, sent his cousin as an ambassador to the people of Kufa, but Ubayd Allah executed Hussein&apos;s cousin Muslim ibn Aqeel amidst fears of an uprising. Then he ordered and assembled a big army of thousands from the Kufa people and other provinces and fought Iman Hussein ibn Ali&apos;s army of around 70 faithful in a land called Karbala near Kufa. All, including Imam Hussein, were killed and their heads were sent to Yazid as a proof. Ibn al-Harith spent his year in office trying to put down Nafi&apos; ibn al-Azraq&apos;s Kharijite uprising in Khuzestan. Islamic tradition condemns him as feckless abroad and corrupt at home, but praises him on matters of doctrine and prayer. In 685, Ibn al-Zubayr required a practical man, and so appointed Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma&apos;mar { (Madelung p. 303-4) } Finally, Ibn al-Zubayr appointed his own brother Mus`ab. In 686, the self-proclaimed prophet Al-Mukhtar led an insurrection at Kufa, and put an end to Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad near Mosul. In 687, Mus`ab defeated Mukhtar, with the help of Kufans whom Mukhtar had exiled. { (Brock p.66) } ` Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reconquered Basra in 691, and Basra remained loyal to his governor al-Hajjaj during Ibn Ash`ath&apos;s mutiny 699-702. However, Basra did support the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against Yazid II during the 720s. In the 740s, Basra fell to al-Saffah of the `Abbasids. [ Abbasid dynasty ] During the time of the Abbasid dynasty Basra became an intellectual centre as it was the home city of the Arab universal genius Ibn al-Haytham, the Arab literary giant al-Jahiz, and the Sufi mystic Rabia Basri. [ Zanj Rebellion led by Ali bin Muhammad, or Sahib az-Zanji ] This was a rebellion by the agricultural slaves of the lowlands, brought from different fringes of the empire. In 871, the Zanj sacked Basra. In 923, the Qarmatians, an extremist Muslim sect, invaded and devastated Basra (Encyclopædia Britannica). In 965, Alhazen was born in Basra. From 945 to 1055, a Buwayhid dynasty ruled Baghdad and most of Iraq. Abu al Qasim al Baridis, who still controlled Basra and Wasit, were defeated and their lands taken by the Buyids in 947. [ Daylamite period ] Sanad Al-Daula (al-habashi) was the governor of Basra and built a library of 15,000 books. Diya&apos; al-Dawla was the Buyid ruler of Basra during the 980s. He was the son of &apos;Adud al-Dawla : see Samsam al-Dawla page for more details as there appears to have been a great deal of rivalry in the al-Daula group. [ Second millennium ] [ Seljuk period ] The Great Friday Mosque was constructed in Basra. In 1122, Zengi received Basra as a fief. { Penny Encyclopedia } In 1126, Zengi suppressed a revolt. In 1129, Dabis looted the Basra state treasury. A 1200 map &quot; on the eve of the Mongol invasions &quot; shows the Abbasid Caliphate as ruling lower Iraq and, presumably, Basra. In 1258, the Mongols sacked Bagdhad and end Abbasid reign. By some accounts, Basra capitulated to the Mongols to avoid a massacre. The Mamluk Bahri Dynasty map (1250–1382) shows Basra as being under their area of control, and the Mongol Dominions map (1300–1405) shows Basra as being under their control. In 1290 { Buscarello de Ghizolfi } internal fight erupted at the Persian Gulf port of Basra among the Genoese (between the Guelfe and the Gibelin families). In 1327, Ibn Battuta visited Basra, which was in decline with the great mosque being [ 2 mi km ] out of town. An Ilkhanid governor received him. In 1411, Jalayrid leader was ousted from Basra by Kara Koyunlu of the Black Sheep Turkmen. In 1523, the Portuguese António Tenreiro crossed from Aleppo to Basra. By 1546, the Turks had reached Basra. In 1550, the Portuguese threatened Basra. In 1624, the Portuguese assisted Basra Pasha in repelling a Persian invasion. The Portuguese were granted a share of customs and freedom from tolls. From about 1625 until 1668, Basra and the Delta marshlands were in the hands of local chieftains independent of the Ottoman administration at Baghdad. [ 1668: Ottoman Empire ] Basra was, for a long time, a flourishing commercial and cultural centre. It was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1668. It was fought over by Turks and Persians and was the scene of repeated attempts at resistance. [ 1775-1779 Zands ] The Zand Dynasty under Karim Khan Zand briefly occupied Basra after a long siege. Zand introduced Shi&apos;iah religious practices in Basra. { Yitzhak Nakash, The Shi&apos;is of Iraq (Princeton: University Press, 1994), p. 15 } [ 1911: Ottoman Empire ] In 1911, the Encyclopædia Britannica reported some Jews and a few Christians living in Basra, but no Turks other than Ottoman officials. The wealthiest and most influential personage in Basra was the nakib, or marshal of the nobility (i.e. descendants of the family of Muhammad, who are entitled to wear the green turban). In 1884 the Ottomans responded to local pressure from the Shi&apos;a s of the south by detaching the southern districts of the Baghdad vilayet and creating a new vilayet of Basra. [ 1914 : World War I ] After the Battle of Basra (1914) during World War I, the occupying British modernized the port (works designed by Sir George Buchanan ); these British commercial interests made it one of the most important ports in the Gulf &quot; with shipping and trade links to the Far East. &quot; [ http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate? Milton-Edwards Beverley May 2003 History &amp; Policy History &amp; Policy English 9 December 2010 United Kingdom ] [ 1939 : World War II ] During World War II it was an important port through which flowed much of the equipment and supplies sent to Russia by the other allies. At the end of the second world war the population was some 93,000 people. [ 1945-1990: peacetime and the Iran–Iraq War ] The University of Basrah was founded in 1964. By 1977, the population had risen to a peak population of some 1.5 million. The population declined during the Iran–Iraq War, being under 900,000 in the late 1980s, possibly reaching a low point of just over 400,000 during the worst of the war. The city was repeatedly shelled by Iran and was the site of many fierce battles, such as Operation Ramadan and Operation Karbala 5. [ 1991: Persian Gulf War ] After the first Persian Gulf War (See Operation Desert Storm by the US.) in 1991, Basra was the site of widespread revolt against Saddam Hussein, which was violently put down with much death and destruction inflicted on the city. [ 1999: Second revolt ] On 25 January 1999, Basra was the scene of scores of civilian casualties when a missile fired by a US warplane was dropped in a civilian area. Eleven persons were killed and fifty-nine injured. General Anthony Zinni, then commander of US forces in the Persian Gulf, acknowledged that it was possible that &quot; a missile may have been errant &quot;. While such casualty numbers pale in comparison to later events, the bombing occurred one day after Arab foreign ministers, meeting in Egypt, refused to condemn four days of air strikes against Iraq in December 1998. This was described by Iraqi information minister Human Abdel-Khaliq { His proper name and position description appears to be in error, in that he appears to have held a more junior role at the time. Humam Abd al-Khaliq Abd al-Ghafur was Iraqi Information Minister between 1997 and 2001. The Iraqi Information Minister between 1991 and 1996 was Hamid Yusuf Hammadi. See } { List of Iraqi Information Ministers. } as giving the United States and Britain &quot; an Arab green card &quot; to attack Iraq. { Paul Koring, &quot; USAF air strikes kill 11, injure 59: Iraq &quot;. The } { Globe and Mail (Toronto), 26 January 1999: A8. These air strikes, by British and USAF warplanes and U.S. cruise missiles, were said to be in response to a release of a report by UN weapons inspectors stating that, as of 1998, the government of Iraq was obstructing their inspection work. Following the four days of bombing in December, the Iraqi government commenced challenging the &quot; no fly zones &quot; unilaterally imposed on the country by the United States, following the 1991 Persian Gulf war. During the month of January, 1999, there were more than 100 incursions by Iraqi aircraft and 20 instances of Iraqi surface-to-air missiles being filed. The January bombing of Basra occurred in the context of retaliatory attacks by the United States. } A second revolt in 1999 led to mass executions in and around Basra. Subsequently the Iraqi government deliberately neglected the city, and much commerce was diverted to Umm Qasr. These alleged abuses are to feature amongst the charges against the former regime to be considered by the Iraq Special Tribunal set up by the Iraq Interim Government following the 2003 invasion. [ Third millennium ] Workers in Basra&apos;s oil industry have been involved in extensive organization and labour conflict. They held a two-day strike in August 2003, and formed the nucleus of the independent General Union of Oil Employees (GUOE) in June 2004. The union held a one-day strike in July 2005, and publicly opposes plans for privatizing the industry. [ 2003: Iraq War and occupation ] [ Battle of Basra (2003) ] In March through to May 2003, the outskirts of Basra were the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. British forces, led by the 7th Armoured Brigade, took the city on 6 April 2003. This city was the first stop for the United States and the United Kingdom during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. [ 2004: Car bombs ] On 21 April 2004, a series of bomb blasts ripped through the city, killing 74 people. The Multi-National Division (South-East), under British Command, is engaged in Security and Stabilization missions in Basra Governorate and surrounding areas. [ 2005 ] Political groups and their ideology which are strong in Basra are reported to have close links with political parties already in power in the Iraqi government, despite opposition from Iraqi Sunni s and the more secular Kurd s. January 2005 elections saw several radical politicians gain office, supported by religious parties. American journalist Steven Vincent, who had been researching and reporting on corruption and militia activity in the city, was kidnapped and killed on 2 August 2005. On 19 September 2005, two undercover British SAS soldiers disguised in Arab civilian clothes and headdresses opened fire on Iraqi police officers after having been stopped at a roadblock, killing at least one. It was reported that they planned to explode the car they were driving in the city. After being arrested, the British Army raided the jail they were being held in to rescue them, killing several people from among their nominal allies - the Iraqi security forces.

The prison is operated by the Defense Ministry, and none of the inmates have ever been tried or given access to legal assistance. Thamer said that the 200 prisoners only had access to one flooded and dirty latrine, and the commission has demanded the authorities shut down the prison immediately. [ May 2009 ] [ Geography and climate ] Basra is located on the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, downstream of which is the Persian Gulf. The Shatt-Al-Arab and Basra waterways define the eastern and western borders of Basra, respectively. The city is penetrated by a complex network of canals and streams; vital for irrigation and other agricultural use. These canals were once used to transport goods and people throughout the city, but during the last 2 decades, pollution and a continuous drop in water levels have made river navigation impossible in the canals. Basra is 110  km away from the Persian Gulf. Basra has a hot desert climate ( Köppen climate classification BWh), like the rest of the surrounding region, though it receives slightly more precipitation than inland locations due to its location near the coast. Temperatures during the summer months, June to August, may easily exceed [ 45 °C °F on ]. During the winter, Basra experiences mild weather with average high temperatures around [ 20 °C °F on ]. High humidity is common due to the proximity to the marshy Persian Gulf.
