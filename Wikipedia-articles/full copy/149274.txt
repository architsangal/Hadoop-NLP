Slavonia consists of five counties — Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Syrmia, although the territory of the counties includes Baranja, and the definition of the western extent of Slavonia as a region varies. The five counties comprise territory of [ 12556 km2 off ] and a population of 806,192. The largest city in the region is Osijek, followed by Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Vukovar and Požega. Slavonia has undergone considerable demographic changes, reflecting the course of its political history and conquests. It is located in the Pannonian Basin, largely bordered by the Danube, Drava and Sava rivers. The western part of the region consists of the Sava and Drava valleys, and the mountains and hills surrounding the Požega valley; the highest among them is [ 984 m on ] Psunj. The eastern part of the region largely consists of plains. Slavonia enjoys a moderately warm and rainy continental climate, with relatively low precipitation. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which ruled the territory occupied by modern-day Slavonia, Ostrogoths and Lombards controlled the area until the arrival of Avars and Slavs, when the Principality of Pannonian Croatia was established. The Principality was later incorporated into the Kingdom of Croatia and, after its decline, the kingdom was ruled through a personal union with Hungary. The Ottoman conquest of Slavonia was largely completed in 1536   – 1552. In 1699, the Treaty of Karlowitz formally transferred Slavonia to the Habsburg Empire, which had virtually ruled Croatia since the Parliament on Cetin (1527). Furthermore, the Slavonian Military Frontier was established as a defence against further Ottoman incursions. Reform of the empire through the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 assigned Slavonia to the Hungarian part of the realm, and a year later it became a part of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. The military frontier was abolished in 1881 after Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1918, when Austria-Hungary dissolved, Slavonia became a part of the short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which in turn became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia. During the Croatian war of independence, Slavonia saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war —including the Battle of Vukovar. The economy of Slavonia is largely based on processing industry, trade, as well as transport and civil engineering sectors. Another significant component of the economy is agriculture: Slavonia contains 45% of Croatia&apos;s agricultural land and accounts for a significant proportion of Croatia&apos;s livestock farming and production of permanent crop s. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the five counties of Slavonia is worth 6,454  million euro or 8,005  euro per capita —27.5% below Croatia&apos;s national average. The GDP of the five counties represents 13.6% of Croatia&apos;s GDP. The cultural heritage of Slavonia is a blend of historical influences, especially those since the end of the 17th century and its traditional culture. A particular impact was made by the 18th century Baroque, when Slavonia started developing, once stability had been restored after the Ottoman wars. Slavonia contributed to the culture of Croatia as a whole, both through artistic works, especially of writers and poets, and through patrons of the arts. In traditional music Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia, and the traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals, with prominence given to tamburica music and bećarac —a form of traditional song, recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO. The cuisine of Slavonia reflects the culture of the region, through its diverse culinary influences, representing a blend of traditional and foreign elements. Slavonia is one of Croatia&apos;s winemaking areas, where grapes were first grown in the region of Ilok, as early as the 3rd century AD, and the oldest wine cellar in continuous use for winemaking, built in 1232, is located in Kutjevo. [ History ] { Vučedol Dove } The name Slavonia originated in the Early Middle Ages when the area was named after the Slav s who inhabited it and who called themselves *Slověne —and the root *Slověn- appeared in various dialects, used for people inhabiting the area west of the Sutla river, between the Sava and Drava rivers, South Slavs living in the area of the former Illyricum. The area bounded by those rivers was called *Slověnьje in the Proto-Slavic language. The word subsequently evolved to its various present forms in the Slavic languages, and other languages adopted the term.

By 1540, Osijek was also under firm control of the Ottomans, and regular administration in Slavonia was introduced by establishing the Sanjak of Pojega. The Ottoman control in Slavonia expanded as Novska surrendered the same year. Turkish conquest continued — Našice were seized in 1541, Orahovica and Slatina in 1542, and in 1543, Voćin, Sirač and, after a 40-day siege, Valpovo. In 1544, Ottoman forces conquered Pakrac. Lessening hostilities brought about a five-year truce in 1547 and temporary stabilization of the border between Habsburg and Ottoman empires, with Virovitica becoming the most significant defensive Habsburg fortress and Požega the most significant Ottoman centre in Slavonia, as Ottoman advances to Sisak and Čazma were made, including a brief occupation of the cities. Further westward efforts of the Turkish forces presented a significant threat to Zagreb and the rest of Croatia and the Hungarian kingdom, prompting a greater defensive commitment by the Habsburg Empire. One year after the 1547 truce ended, Ivan Lenković devised a system of fortifications and troops in the border areas, a forerunner of the Croatian Military Frontier.

A particular impact was made by Baroque art and architecture of the 18th century, when the cities of Slavonia started developing after the Ottoman wars ended and stability was restored to the area. The period saw great prominence of the nobility, who were awarded estates in Slavonia by the imperial court in return for their service during the wars. They included Prince Eugene of Savoy, the House of Esterházy, the House of Odescalchi, Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich, the House of Prandau-Normann, the House of Pejačević and the House of Janković. That in turn encouraged an influx of contemporary European culture to the region. Subsequent development of the cities and society saw the influence of Neoclassicism, Historicism and especially of Art Nouveau.
