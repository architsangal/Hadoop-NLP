[ History ] In 1872, after a scientist discovered a European snail ( Helix aspersa ) living on a small mountain, Rufus King Porter the founder of what is now unincorporated Spring Valley, California named the peak Mt. Helix. Then in 1885, the U.S. Postal Service rejected the use of two words for a post office name, so Rufus submitted just the name Helix and also became the first postmaster in Spring Valley; the Helix Post Office was operated out of his home. Around this same time, Hubert Howe Bancroft came to the area. He bought the Porter&apos;s ranch and also acquired neighboring properties, accumulating about [ 500 acre km2 ]. He began calling his property &quot; Helix Farms. &quot; Bancroft hired workers to help develop Helix Farms, planting orchards and building structures for his ranch. By the early 1900s, Helix Farms was home to the largest olive ranch in southern California (some of the original olive trees can still be found today). Bancroft died in 1918 and eventually, his family sold the property.
