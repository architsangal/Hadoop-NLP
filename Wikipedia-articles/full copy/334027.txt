[ http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/medved.php Interview with John Hawkins The Michael Medved Interview March 7, 2011 undated Right Wing News ] [ Early life ] Medved was born into a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised in San Diego, California, where his scientist father, David Medved, worked for the defense contractor Convair and later for NASA. Medved attended Palisades High School when the family moved to Los Angeles, California. He entered Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut, as a 16-year-old undergraduate, and graduated with honors in 1969, and then entered Yale Law School. After his first year of law school, he left to work as a head speech writer for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, { Medved, Michael (2004).

Retrieved March 7, 2011. } and then for four years as a speech writer and political consultant. After political campaign work, including a position as an aide to Congressman Ron Dellums, Medved worked in advertising, and coordinated a campaign to recruit more African Americans and Hispanics to the police departments of the California cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley. After writing more than 40 articles for the book The People&apos;s Almanac, Medved wrote What Really Happened to the Class of &apos;65?, with David Wallechinsky. Focusing on the post-graduation lives of 30 of Medved&apos;s Palisades High School classmates who were featured in a 1965 cover story in &apos;&apos;Time&apos;&apos;, the book became a bestseller in 1976. The book also became the basis for a weekly television series on NBC that ran for 13 weeks in 1978. Medved then wrote The Shadow Presidents: The Secret History of the Chief Executives and Their Top Aides (1979), a study of the leading White House assistants since the establishment of the presidential staff in 1857. The book included interviews with the chiefs of staff of presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. After the interviews, Medved continued his involvement in politics, befriending Ford&apos;s chief of staff, Dick Cheney, affiliating himself with the Republican Party, and campaigning for Ronald Reagan in 1980. In 1984, Medved wrote Hospital: The Hidden Lives of a Medical Center Staff, which was discussed in Time, on ABC&apos;s Nightline, and Good Morning America. The book focused on 30 staff people who worked together in a California teaching hospital. [ Movie reviews ] Medved continued his screenwriting work, writing for feature film projects and television miniseries, and he joined the Writers Guild of America. He also collaborated with his brother, Harry Medved, on four satirical books about movies: The Fifty Worst Films of All Time (1979), The Golden Turkey Awards (1980), The Hollywood Hall of Shame (1984) and Son of Golden Turkey Awards (1986). Medved continued to review movies, through a weekly review on CNN (1980–1983) and a show he hosted on British network Channel 4 called The Worst of Hollywood. His commentary centered on what he considered to be bad movies, particularly in &quot; The Golden Turkey Awards &quot;. The film selected by the Medved Brothers as The Worst Film of All Time, Plan 9 from Outer Space, has since become a cult classic. In 1984, Medved joined Sneak Previews, the weekly movie review show originated by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, co-hosting the program for 12 years with Jeffrey Lyons. In 1993, Medved became chief film critic for the New York Post, a position he held for five years, during which he reviewed more than 700 movies for the newspaper. More recently, Medved has played a prominent role in some movie-related controversies. Medved became an outspoken defender of Mel Gibson &apos;s film, The Passion of the Christ (2004), which had been criticized as antisemitic by many prominent Jewish groups. After Gibson&apos;s DUI arrest in July 2006, Medved wrote that he felt &quot; betrayed &quot; by Gibson&apos;s antisemitic outburst and urged Gibson to seek &quot; reconciliation &quot; with the Jewish community.

Medved stated that the inclusion of this theme in the film was &quot; deeply misleading &quot; because it was marketed as a Rocky -esque tale of a plucky female underdog in the boxing arena. [ http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id%3D110006305 My &apos;Million Dollar&apos; Answer January 22, 2007 Medved, Michael February 2, 2005 The Wall Street Journal ] Medved said that he carefully avoided revealing the final turn in the plot, but felt honor bound to inform his listeners and readers about the movie&apos;s content and provocative point of view. Roger Ebert criticized Medved, saying he &quot; has for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic. &quot; [ http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20050129%2FCOMMENTARY%2F501290301 Critics Have No Right To Play Spoiler January 22, 2007 Ebert, Roger January 29, 2005 Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert ] [ Talk radio and political commentary ] While focusing on the theme of Hollywood vs. America, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh interviewed Medved and then asked Medved to guest-host his talk show. Medved went on to serve as a regular guest-host for Limbaugh on close to 30 occasions. [ October 2011 ] In 1996, Medved was offered his own local show on a major Seattle radio station. In his 2005 autobiographical book Right Turns: From Liberal Activist to Conservative Champion in 35 Unconventional Lessons, Medved says he welcomed the chance to escape &quot; the movie ghetto &quot; and to speak to a wider audience about politics and morality, which were a focus of his written commentary and books. Medved&apos;s show was broadcast from Seattle and syndicated through Salem Radio Network. His three-hour daily show is now broadcast on 200 stations coast to coast and reaches more than 4.75 million listeners weekly.

[ http://www.talkers.com/heavy-hundred/ The Talkers Magazine Heavy Hundred September 6, 2011 2011 Talkers Magazine ] Medved describes the show as &quot; Your Daily Dose of Debate &quot;, often focused on listeners who call in to debate issues with the host. Guests have included those who are generally considered left-of-center, including Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, John Shelby Spong, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, Ralph Nader, Barbara Boxer, Al Gore, Madeleine Albright, Ben Cohen, George Galloway, Thom Hartmann, Naomi Wolf, Christopher Hitchens, and Al Franken. Guests who are generally considered right-of-center include Robert Spencer, Condoleezza Rice, and Dinesh D&apos;Souza. Medved describes himself as &quot; your cultural crusader on politics and pop culture &quot; and common themes on his show include current events, politics, American history and the entertainment industry. He reviews four or more new movies or DVD releases per week. The program also includes a monthly &quot; Conspiracy Day, &quot; which usually occurs within a few days of the full moon due to the superstition s surrounding that event, where callers from across the country expose what they consider the &quot; hidden forces &quot; behind &quot; perplexing and painful present events. &quot; Medved writes a regular column for USA Today and is a member of the Board of Contributors for USA Today &apos;s Forum Page, part of the newspaper’s Opinion section. He writes occasional op-ed pieces for The Wall Street Journal and blogs daily at Townhall.com. He also wrote the 1992 book Hollywood vs. America: Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values, a condemnation of violence in cinema. Liberal film critic David Denby wrote a harshly critical review of Hollywood vs. America in the political magazine The New Republic. In October 2007, Medved drew critics&apos; fire after publishing a controversial column regarding the history of Slavery in the United States, in which he wrote, &quot; No, it&apos;s not true that the &apos;peculiar institution&apos; featured kind-hearted, paternalistic masters and happy, dancing field-hands, any more than it&apos;s true that America displayed unparalleled barbarity or enjoyed disproportionate benefit from kidnapping and exploiting innocent Africans. &quot; { Medved, Michael (undated; circa late 2010). &quot; Michael Medved   – Six Inconvenient Truths About the U.S. and Slavery &quot;. } { townhall.com.

The follow up volume The 5 Big Lies About American Business: Combating Smears Against the Free-Market Economy was released in December of 2009. He has argued that voters in the American Jewish community don’t necessarily embrace candidates based on their support for the state of Israel as much as they passionately oppose candidates based on their identification with Christianity, especially the Christian Right. { Etheridge, Eric (September 9, 2009). &quot; The Neoconservative Question &quot;.

For fifteen years, Medved served as president of PJC, which states that its mission is outreach to unaffiliated and disconnected Jews. In his book Right Turns: Unconventional Lessons from a Controversial Life, he states that his commitment to religion led to his conservative political outlook.
