Its capital is Koronadal City, and it borders Sultan Kudarat to the north and west, Sarangani to the south and east, and Davao del Sur to the east. To the southeast lies Sarangani Bay. General Santos City, on the shores of Sarangani Bay, is the largest and most important city in the region, and is a major seaport. The province of Sarangani used to be part of South Cotabato until it was made an independent province in 1992. [ History ] Centuries ago, the area that would be the South Cotabato was sparsely inhabited by Malay Pioneers which later evolved into various ethnic groupings that still exist in the Province today. Settlers, who would lay the foundation of what would become a progressive province, started trooping down 1914. The significant thrust occurred during the term of President Quezon in late 1930s. Gen. Paulino Santos, a man whose undaunted pioneering spirit inspired thousand, led the first of wave of settlers that time. After World War II, the final exodus of settler from Luzon and Visayas poured into the virgin land of promise. In the early 1960s as population, trade and industries grew in southern part of Cotabato, a clamor of local self-governance arose. Thus, on July 18, 1966, South Cotabato was finally formed as an independent province raring to push its own development. In 1992, South Cotabato gave birth to a new province. Seven towns in southern and coastal section of the province now form part of the Province of Sarangani. This was a new challenge. In addition, South Cotabateños, with their indomitable pioneering spirit have proven once more their ability to face and hurdle diverse challenges ably went through with the demands of time. South Cotabato sparks new interest having emerged as a favorite venue for conventions and big events of national significance like the National Secondary School Press Conference, Palarong Pambansa and 9 th Mindanao Business Conference to name few. The new millennium ushers in a new beginning for the province with the coming in of regional offices in the area in consonance with EO 429 dated October 12, 1990 issued by President Corazon C. Aquino and EO No. 36 dated September 19, 2001 issued by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, provide for the reorganization of the new Administrative Region in Mindanao and having the city of Koronadal as the regional center of Region XII. In four decades since its provincehood, South Cotabato has already surpassed dozens of provinces establish half a century ahead in almost every aspect of development. In a short span, it becomes one of the leading provinces in Mindanao. What it got to show today are vivid result of human synergy and the richness of its resources. [ People and culture ] [ Language ] The people of South Cotabato are multilingual, able to communicate in Hiligaynon and/or Cebuano, as well as in both Tagalog and English. Other languages spoken are Ilocano and Maguindanao. The indigenous tribes, in addition, use their own tribal dialects. A situation wherein several people, each speaking solely in his own dialect and are still able to communicate with the others, is not unheard of. [ People ] The people of South Cotabato have diverse heritages. Ilonggo s from Panay and Negros in the Visayas settled the municipalities of Norala, Banga, Surallah, Sto. Niño and the province&apos;s capital, Koronadal, The province&apos;s major communication media is Filipino, English or Hiligaynon. On the other hand, people from the Ilocano speaking regions of Luzon settled in Tampakan, Tantangan and Tupi, and the Ilocano language may still be heard spoken in these towns. The Visayan language, Cebuano is also the main ethnic ethnolinguistic group of the municipality of Polomolok and is one of the main ethnolinguistic groups of Tupi (along with Ilonggo and Tagalog, which slightly differs from Manila Tagalog). Both towns are near to General Santos City. The Maguindanao tribe is the major Muslim Filipino tribe in the province. Although many of them still wear their traditional costumes and practice their native customs, others have come to adapt the more liberal practices of their Christian neighbors such as wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts, eschewing the use of the headscarf, and attending dances/mixed gatherings. Other indigenous Filipino tribes are the T&apos;boli and B&apos;laan tribes in Lake Sebu and T&apos;boli municipalities, famous for their brassworks, beadwork and t&apos;nalak weave. The people of these tribes wear colorful embroidered native costumes and beadwork accessories. The women of these tribes, particularly, wear heavy brass belts with brass &apos;tassels&apos; ending in tiny brass bells that herald their approach even when they are a long way off. The people of South Cotabato still retain many of the practices and traditions of their particular tribal heritages, although infused with a flavor that is distinctly Mindanaoan and the product of cultural interaction between the immigrants and the indigenous peoples of the area. One vivid example of this is the predominant use of the native &apos;malong&apos;, the colorful, tubelike garment used as a skirt by the indigenous tribes, in place of a blanket or sleeping bag.

[ Strategic location ] The province is a key player in the merging of South Cotabato, Sarangani and General Santos City into one of the country&apos;s fastest growing development clusters known as SOCSARGEN. SOCSARGEN serves as a gateway for the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia- Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA). With its location, it is easily accessible from neighboring ASEAN countries via SOCSARGEN&apos;s entryway, General Santos City, with its International Standard Airport that puts key cities in Asia just three to four hours flying time away. There&apos;s a Fish Port Complex that serves the region&apos;s thriving fishing industry. The Makar Wharf is a major port-of-call in international shipping, and one of the most important ports in Mindanao. All have paved the way to make the constantly evolving SOCSARGEN the venue for a synergetic relationship. SOCSARGEN&apos;s gateway, General Santos City, is merely five minutes away from one of South Cotabato &apos;s municipalities, Polomolok. [ Land area ] South Cotabato has a total Land area of 370,589 Hectares (3,706  km 2 ). [ Provincial capital ] The Local Provincial Government holds its official functions in the City of Koronadal.

[ Territorial composition ] 2 Districts District I Tampakan Tupi Polomolok with General Santos City District II Banga Koronadal City Lake Sebu Norala Sto.Niño Surallah T&apos;boli Tantangan Political Subdivisions Upon its creation as a regular province, South Cotabato consisted of 11 municipalities, namely: Banga, General Santos (now a city), Glan, Kiamba, Koronadal, Maitum, Norala, Polomolok, Surallah, Tantangan and Tupi. These municipalities were established long before the creation of the province. Other component municipalities were constituted after it fully functioned as a province. A total of 18 municipalities have contributed much to the development of South Cotabato being one of the fast growing provinces in the country. The birth of Sarangani Province, conceived from the municipalities of Malungon, Alabel, Malapatan, Glan, Maasim, Kiamba and Maitum has brought changes in the geography and political subdivisions of the province. That event left South Cotabato with 11 remaining municipalities. Further, on August 16, 2000, Republic Act No. 8803 was approved. This marks another milestone in the history of South Cotabato. This is an act that converts the municipality of Koronadal into a component city of South Cotabato. Thus, at present the province is left with ten (10) progressing municipalities and the City of Koronadal remains as its Provincial Capital. Moreover, South Cotabato has a total of 199 barangays and two (2) more are being proposed and still waiting for the approval of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). These proposed barangays are both under the municipality of T&apos;boli. The table below shows the total number of barangays in the different municipalities, including their respective land area. The distance of each municipality from the provincial capital, Koronadal is likewise shown on the succeeding table as well as the date of creation of each municipalities comprising the province of South Cotabato.
