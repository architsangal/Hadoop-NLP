This article is about the historical foreign relations of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. For the foreign relations of the current de facto Libyan government, see Foreign relations of Libya. [ August 2011 ] The foreign relations of Libya under Gaddafi  (1969 –2011) underwent much fluctuation and change. They were marked by severe tension with the West (especially the United States, although relations were normalized in the early 21st century prior to the 2011 Libyan civil war ) and by Gaddafi&apos;s activist policies in the Middle East and Africa, including his financial and military support for numerous paramilitary and rebel groups. [ Timeline ] { Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1969. Gaddafi moved Libya away from the West and initially sought Pan-Arabism. } Since 1969, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi had determined Libya &apos;s foreign policy. His principal foreign policy goals were Arab unity, elimination of Israel, advancement of Islam, support for Palestinians, elimination of outside—particularly Western—influence in the Middle East and Africa, and support for a range of &quot; revolutionary &quot; causes. After the 1969 coup, U.S.-Libyan relations became increasingly strained because of Libya&apos;s foreign policies supporting international terrorism and subversion against moderate Arab and African governments. Gaddafi closed American and British bases on Libyan territory and partially nationalized all foreign oil and commercial interests in Libya. [ 1970s ] Export controls on military equipment and civil aircraft were imposed during the 1970s. On 11 June 1972, Gaddafi announced that any Arab wishing to volunteer for Palestinian armed groups &quot; can register his name at any Libyan embassy will be given adequate training for combat &quot;. He also promised financial support for attacks. [ Qaddafi, terrorism, and the origins of the U.S. attack on Libya. Brian Lee Davis 182 ] { Washington Post 12 June 1972 } { The New York Times 12 June 1972 } In response, the United States withdrew its ambassador. On 7 October 1972, Gaddafi praised the Lod Airport massacre, carried out by the Japanese Red Army, and demanded Palestinian terrorist groups to carry out similar attacks. Gaddafi played a key role in promoting the use of oil embargo es as a political weapon for challenging the West, hoping that an oil price rise and embargo in 1973 would persuade the West—especially the United States—to end support for Israel. Gaddafi rejected both Soviet communism and Western capitalism and claimed he was charting a middle course for his government. { The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, (2001–2005), &lt; u &gt; &quot; Qaddafi, Muammar al- &quot; &lt; u &gt;, Bartleby Books.

We have sent them to the Irish revolutionaries so that the British will pay the price for their past deeds &quot;. Together with Fidel Castro and other Communist leaders, Gaddafi supported Soviet protege Haile Mariam Mengistu, the military ruler of Ethiopia, who was later convicted for a genocide that killed thousands. In October 1978, Gaddafi sent Libyan troops to aid Idi Amin in the Uganda-Tanzania War when Amin tried to annex the northern Tanzania n province of Kagera, and Tanzania counterattacked. Amin lost the battle and later fled to exile in Libya, where he remained for almost a year. { Biography, &lt; u &gt; &quot; Idi Amin &quot; &lt; u &gt;, Cape Breton-Victoria Regional School Board. Retrieved July 19, 2006. } Libya also was one of the main supporters of the Polisario Front in the former Spanish Sahara [ November 2011 ] – a nationalist group dedicated to ending Spanish colonialism in the region. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was proclaimed by Polisario on 28 February 1976, and Libya began to recognize the SADR as the legitimate government of Western Sahara starting 15 April 1980. It is still common for Sahrawi students to attend their schooling in Libya.

The U.S. government declared Libya a &quot; state sponsor of terrorism &quot; on 29 December 1979. [ 1980s ] In May 1981, the U.S. government closed the Libyan &quot; people&apos;s bureau &quot; (embassy) in Washington, D.C. and expelled the Libyan staff in response their conduct generally violating internationally accepted standards of diplomatic behavior. { Brent L. Smith: &apos;&apos;Terrorism in America: Pipe Pombs and Pipe Dreams&apos;&apos;, Ann Arbor (MI) 1992, p. 141. } In August 1981, in the first incident of the Gulf of Sidra, two Libyan jets fired on U.S. aircraft participating in a routine naval exercise over international waters of the Mediterranean Sea claimed by Libya. The U.S. planes returned fire and shot down the attacking Libyan aircraft. 11 On December 1981, the State Department invalidated U.S. passport s for travel to Libya (a de facto travel ban) and, for purposes of safety, advised all U.S. citizens in Libya to leave. In March 1982, the U.S. government prohibited imports of Libyan crude oil into the United States [ Proclamation 4907 – Imports of Petroleum US Office of the Federal Register 1982-03-10 http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1982/31082a.htm President Ronald Reagan ] and expanded the controls on U.S.-origin goods intended for export to Libya. Licenses were required for all transactions, except food and medicine. In March 1984, U.S. export controls were expanded to prohibit future exports to the Ra&apos;s Lanuf petrochemical complex. In April 1985, all Export-Import Bank financing was prohibited. In October 1981, Egypt ian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated. Gaddafi applauded the murder and remarked that it was a &quot; punishment &quot; for Sadat&apos;s signing of the Camp David Accords with the United States and Israel.

[ Qaddafi, terrorism, and the origins of the U.S. attack on Libya. Brian Lee Davis 183 ] After the December 1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks, which killed 19 and wounded around 140, Gaddafi indicated that he would continue to support the Red Army Faction, the Red Brigades, and the Irish Republican Army as long as European countries support anti-Gaddafi Libyans.

On 5 April 1986, Libyan agents bombed &quot; La Belle &quot; nightclub in West Berlin, killing three people and injuring 229 people who were spending the evening there. Gaddafi&apos;s plan was intercepted by Western intelligence. More detailed information was retrieved years later when Stasi archives were investigated by the reunited Germany. Libyan agents who had carried out the operation from the Libyan embassy in East Germany were prosecuted by reunited Germany in the 1990s. { Flashback: The Berlin disco bombing. BBC on 13 November 2001. } Germany and the United States learned that the bombing in West Berlin had been ordered from Tripoli. On 14 April 1986, the United States carried out Operation El Dorado Canyon against Gaddafi and members of his regime. Air defenses, three army bases, and two airfields in Tripoli and Benghazi were bombed. The surgical strikes failed to kill Gaddafi but he lost a few dozen military officers. [ http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0504/excerpt1.html Rediscovering Libya Salak Kira National Geographic Adventure ] { Qaddafi, terrorism, and the origins of the U.S. attack on Libya. Brian Lee Davis } Gaddafi announced that he had won a spectacular military victory over the United States and the country was officially renamed the &quot; Great Socialist People&apos;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah &quot;. However, his speech appeared devoid passion and even the &quot; victory &quot; celebrations appeared unusual. Criticism of Gaddafi by ordinary Libyan citizens became more bold, such as defacing of Gaddafi posters. The raids against Gaddafi had brought the regime to it&apos;s the weakest point in 17 years. The Chadian–Libyan conflict (1978–1987) ended in disaster for Libya in 1987 with the Toyota War. France supported Chad in this conflict and two years later on 19 September 1989, a French airliner, UTA Flight 772, was destroyed by an in-flight explosion for which Libyan agents were convicted in absentia. The incident bore close similarities to the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 (the Lockerbie Bombing) a year earlier. [ Paul Reynolds 19 August 2003 BBC News UTA 772: The forgotten flight http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3163621.stm ] The downing of these two airliners along with the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing seemed to establish a pattern of reprisal attacks—in the form of terrorist bombings—by Libya or at least Libyan agents. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya for these two acts (with UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748 and 883 ). The UN eventually lifted these sanctions (with Resolution 1506 ) in 2003 when Libya &quot; accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials, renounced terrorism and arranged for payment of appropriate compensation for the families of the victims. &quot; [ Press Release SC/7868 September 12, 2003 United Nations Security Council http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sc7868.doc.htm ] In 2008 Libya established a fund to compensate victims of these three terrorist acts (and the 1986 US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi). Gaddafi fueled a number of Islamist and communist terrorist groups in the Philippines, [ http://www.meforum.org/878/libya-and-the-us-qadhafi-unrepentant Libya and the U.S.: Qadhafi Unrepentant The Middle East Quarterly Mohamed Eljahmi 2006 ] [ Geoffrey Leslie Simons Libya: the struggle for survival 281 ] [ Niksch, Larry Abu Sayyaf: Target of Philippine-U.S. Anti-Terrorism Cooperation Federation of American Scientists 25 January 2002 CRS Report for Congress http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31265.pdf PDF ] as well as paramilitaries in Oceania. He attempted to radicalize New Zealand &apos;s Maori people in a failed effort to destabilise the U.S. ally. In Australia, he financed trade unions and some politicians who opposed the ANZUS alliance with the United States. In May 1987, Australia deported diplomats and broke off relations with Libya because of its activities in Oceania. In late 1987 French authorities stopped a merchant vessel, the MV Eksund, which was delivering a 150 ton Libyan arms shipment to European terrorist groups. [ September 2011 ] In 1988, Libya was found to be in the process of constructing a chemical weapon s plant at Rabta, a plant which became the largest such facility in the Third World. [ September 2011 ] Libya&apos;s relationship with the former Soviet Union involved massive Libyan arms purchases from the Soviet bloc and the presence of thousands of east bloc advisers. Libya&apos;s use—and heavy loss—of Soviet-supplied weaponry in its war with Chad was a notable breach of an apparent Soviet-Libyan understanding not to use the weapons for activities inconsistent with Soviet objectives. As a result, Soviet-Libyan relations reached a nadir in mid-1987. In January 1989, there was another encounter over the Gulf of Sidra between U.S. and Libyan aircraft which resulted in the downing of two Libyan jets. [ 1990s ] [ United Nations Security Council Resolution 731 United Nations Security Council Resolution 748 ] In 1991, two Libyan intelligence agent s were indicted by prosecutors in the United States and United Kingdom for their involvement in the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Six other Libyans were put on trial in absentia for the 1989 bombing of UTA Flight 772 over Chad and Niger. The UN Security Council demanded that Libya surrender the suspects, cooperate with the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 investigations, pay compensation to the victims&apos; families, and cease all support for terrorism. Libya&apos;s refusal to comply led to the approval of Security Council Resolution 748 on 31 March 1992, imposing international sanctions on the state designed to bring about Libyan compliance. Continued Libyan defiance led to further sanctions by the UN against Libya in November 1993. { (2003), &quot; Libya &quot;, Global Policy Forum. Retrieved July 19, 2006. } After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, Libya concentrated on expanding diplomatic ties with Third World countries and increasing its commercial links with Europe and East Asia. Following the imposition of U.N. sanctions in 1992, these ties significantly diminished. Following a 1998 Arab League meeting in which fellow Arab states decided not to challenge U.N. sanctions, Gaddafi announced that he was turning his back on pan-Arab ideas, one of the fundamental tenets of his philosophy. Instead, Libya pursued closer bilateral ties, particularly with Egypt and Northwest Africa n nations Tunisia and Morocco. It also has sought to develop its relations with Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to Libyan involvement in several internal African disputes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. Libya also has sought to expand its influence in Africa through financial assistance, ranging from aid donations to impoverished neighbors such as Niger to oil subsidies to Zimbabwe. Gaddafi has proposed a borderless &quot; United States of Africa &quot; to transform the continent into a single nation-state ruled by a single government. This plan has been moderately well received, although more powerful would-be participants such as Nigeria and South Africa are skeptical. Gaddafi also trained and supported Charles Taylor, who was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in Sierra Leone.

Gaddafi aligned himself with the Orthodox Serbs against Bosnia and Herzegovina &apos;s Muslims and Kosovo &apos;s Albanians. Gaddafi supported Milošević even when Milošević was charged with large-scale ethnic cleansing against Albanians in Kosovo.

ILSA was renewed in 2001, and the investment cap lowered to $20  million. In 1999, less than a decade after the UN sanctions were put in place, Libya began to make dramatic policy changes in regard to the Western world, including turning over the Lockerbie suspects for trial. This diplomatic breakthrough followed years of negotiation, including a visit by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to Libya in December 1998, and personal appeals by Nelson Mandela. Eventually UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook persuaded the Americans to accept a trial of the suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law, with the UN Security Council agreeing to suspend sanctions as soon as the suspects arrived in the Netherlands for trial. Libya also paid compensation in 1999 for the death of British policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, a move that preceded the reopening of the British embassy in Tripoli and the appointment of ambassador Sir Richard Dalton, after a 17-year break in diplomatic relations. [ 2000s ] { Vladimir Putin in 2008 } As of January 2002, Libya was constructing another chemical weapons production facility at Tarhuna.

In 1973, Libya engaged in military operations in the Aouzou Strip to gain access to minerals and to use it as a base of influence in Chadian politics. Libya argued that the territory was inhabited by indigenous people who owed allegiance to the Senussi Order and subsequently to the Ottoman Empire, and that this title had been inherited by Libya. It also supported its claim with an unratified 1935 treaty between France and Italy, the colonial powers of Chad and Libya, respectively. After consolidating its hold on the strip, Libya annexed it in 1976. Chadian forces were able to force the Libyans to retreat from the Aouzou Strip in 1987. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, followed by unsuccessful negotiations over the next several years, leading finally to the 1994 International Court of Justice decision granting Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou Strip, which ended Libyan occupation. Chadian-Libyan relations were ameliorated when Libyan-supported Idriss Déby unseated Habré on 2 December. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new regime, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels; but regarding the Aouzou Strip Déby followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya&apos;s hands.
