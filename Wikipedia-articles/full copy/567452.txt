In English, the Dutch prefix is translated as &quot; HNLMS &quot; for &quot; Her/His Netherland Majesty&apos;s Ship &quot;. Some authors translate Hr./Zr.Ms. as &quot; HNMS &quot; but that abbreviation is ambiguous: the &quot; N &quot; might stand for &quot; Netherlands &quot; or &quot; Norway &quot;. The most common way to avoid this ambiguity is to use &quot; HNLMS &quot; and &quot; HNoMS &quot; respectively.
