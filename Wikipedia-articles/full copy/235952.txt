He is the son of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and the American actress Grace Kelly. His sisters are Hereditary Princess Caroline and Princess Stéphanie of Monaco. In July 2011, Prince Albert married Charlene Lynette Wittstock, now Princess Charlene. Prince Albert is one of the wealthiest Royals in the World, valued at more than $1 billion. This includes vast amounts of land both in Monaco and France, and which does not include the Prince&apos;s Palace but does include Société des bains de mer de Monaco. His wealth does not include that of other members of the House of Grimaldi, which are valued altogether at over $2.5 billion (as of 2010). [ Early life ] { Grace Kelly, the Princess of Monaco, arriving at the } { Madrid Airport, 1964. } Albert was born in the Prince&apos;s Palace of Monaco, Monaco, and his godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain. Albert attended the Albert I High School, graduating with distinction in 1976. He was a camper and later a counselor for six summers at Camp Tecumseh on Lake Winnipesaukee, Moultonborough, New Hampshire in the 1970s. He spent a year training in various princely duties, and enrolled at Amherst College in Massachusetts in 1977 as Albert Grimaldi, studying political science, economics, music, and English literature, and also joined Chi Psi fraternity. He speaks French, English, German and Italian. He spent the summer of 1979 touring Europe and the Middle East with the Amherst Glee Club and graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. Albert also undertook an exchange program with the University of Bristol, at the Alfred Marshall School of Economics and Management in 1979. Albert was an enthusiastic sportsman, participating in cross country, javelin throwing, handball, judo, swimming, tennis, rowing, sailing, skiing, squash and fencing. He is a patron of Monaco&apos;s football teams. He competed in the bobsled at every Winter Olympics from Calgary to Salt Lake City. [ April 2012 ] He has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1985. (His maternal grandfather John B. Kelly, Sr., and maternal uncle John B. Kelly, Jr., were both Olympic medal winners in rowing and were actively involved in the Olympic movement.) The press reported the prince refused any special treatment during his Olympic stints, and lived in the same bare-bones quarters as all the other athletes. [ http://sports.espn.go.com/page2/s/caple/020222.html ESPN.com – Page2 – Bobsledding prince is a royal treat ESPN 2 July 2011 ] On 25 October 2002, Albert visited Miami, Florida for a World Olympians Association fund-raiser at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. The group&apos;s mission was to have the 100,000 Olympians get involved with their communities and talk to young athletes about dedication and training. [ Regency ] On 7 March 2005, Albert&apos;s father Rainier III, Prince of Monaco was admitted to a hospital in the principality; he was later moved to an intensive care ward. The Prince was being treated for breathing, kidney, and heart trouble. On 31 March 2005, the Palace of Monaco announced that Hereditary Prince Albert would take over the duties of his father as Regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his sovereign functions. This decision was reached by the Crown Council of Monaco, a body made up of notable local figures with residual powers to make judgments about certain constitutional matters. The 47-year-old prince spent his first day as regent of Monaco caring for his critically ill 81-year-old father, who was Europe’s longest-serving monarch and the world&apos;s third longest-serving monarch. [ Accession ] On 6 April 2005, Prince Rainier III died and Hereditary Prince Albert became Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco. The first part of Prince Albert II&apos;s enthronement as ruler of the Principality was on 12 July 2005, after the end of the three-month mourning period for his father. A morning Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral presided over by the Archbishop of Monaco, the Most Reverend Bernard Barsi, formally marked the beginning of his reign. Afterward Albert II returned to the princely palace to host a garden party for 7,000 Monégasques born in the principality. In the courtyard, the Prince was presented with two keys of the city as a symbol of his investiture. The evening ended with a spectacular fireworks display on the waterfront. The second part of his investiture was on 19 November 2005. Albert was enthroned at Saint Nicholas Cathedral. His family was there in attendance, including his elder sister (and now his heir presumptive) Princess Caroline with her husband Ernst, Prince of Hanover and three of her four children, Andrea, Pierre and Charlotte; as well as his younger sister Princess Stéphanie, his paternal aunt Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy, his godson, Jean-Léonard Taubert-Natta de Massy, and his cousin Elisabeth-Anne de Massy. Royalty from 16 delegations were present for the festivities throughout the country. The evening ended with an opera performance in Monte Carlo. [ Albert&apos;s reign ] { Princely standard of Albert II } { Albert } continues the policy, initiated by previous rulers of the statelet, of using his position to draw the world&apos;s attention to the need to protect the (marine) environment. Just like his great-great-grandfather Albert I he traveled to Spitsbergen in July 2005. During this trip, he visited the glaciers &quot; Lillihöök &quot; and &quot; Monaco &quot;.Prince Albert II also engaged in a Russia n Arctic expedition, reaching the North Pole on Easter, 16 April 2006. [ lefigaro.fr http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060530.WWW000000427_article_albert.html Albert, à nouveau père Le Figaro France 20 April 2011 2 July 2011 ] As a result, he is the first incumbent head of state to have reached the North Pole. Prince Albert is the Vice-Chairman of the American charity founded in 1982, after his mother&apos;s death, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, which supports, as Princess Grace did in her lifetime, emerging artists in theater, dance and film. In 2006, Prince Albert created the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation which continues the Principality of Monaco&apos;s commitment by supporting sustainable and ethical projects around the world which focus on three main challenges: climate change and developing renewable energies; combating the loss of biodiversity; and water management (improving universal access to clean water) and fighting desertification. Prince Albert is also a Global Advisor to Orphans International. { Barack Obama and First Lady } { Michelle Obama, 2009. } [ Economic activities ] Prince Albert is one of the owners of Yoctocosmos and member of the World Economic Forum. [ July 2011 ] [ Personal life and relationships ] Over the years, there was much discussion of the prince&apos;s continual bachelor status. Although he had received much press attention for dating well-known fashion models and actresses, his apparent disinclination to marry gave rise to rumors that he is homosexual. Prince Albert has consistently denied this suggestion, most notably in a 1994 interview published in the French magazine Madame Figaro. &quot; At first it was amusing &quot;, he said, &quot; but it becomes very irritating in the long term to hear people say that I am homosexual &quot;. { &quot; } { Madame Figaro &quot;, 1994; reported in } { Daily Mail, 13 August 1994, page 17 } He has since confirmed that he is the father of two children, and in July 2011, Prince Albert married Charlene Lynette Wittstock, now Princess Charlene. In October 2005, the German magazine Bunte reported that Prince Albert was dating Telma Ortiz Rocasolano, a sister-in-law of the Prince of Asturias. However, in November 2005, the Prince instructed his lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, to commence legal proceedings against the French newspaper France Dimanche for violation of privacy and false information regarding the story. [ Children born out of wedlock ] [ Jazmin Grace Grimaldi ] In 1992, a California woman, Tamara Rotolo, filed a paternity suit against the prince, claiming that he was the father of her daughter, whom she named Jazmin Grace Grimaldi. Prince Albert was also listed as the father on the child&apos;s Riverside County, California, birth certificate, { according to the website of the } { Desert Sun, a newspaper in } { Palm Springs } and the child was legally surnamed Grimaldi. However, the case, which went to trial in 1993, eventually was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Graham Anderson Cribbs, who claimed that there was &quot; insufficient contact between Albert and the state of California to justify hearing a suit there &quot; { Evening Standard article, 24 March 1993, page 20 } agreeing with an assertion by the prince&apos;s lawyer, Stanley Arkin, that the California court had no jurisdiction. In court documents and legal depositions, Case#IND78459 in Riverside County Superior Court Family Law Division under Superior Court Judge Graham Anderson Cribbs, Prince Albert admitted that he had been with Tamara Rotolo, who was traveling with a friend, Barbara Welker (per her deposition filed with the court), in Monaco on &quot; a couple of occasions &quot; in July 1991. (The child had been born approximately nine months later, on 4 March 1992.) As reported by a local newspaper covering the case, &quot; Arkin asserted that the Riverside County court had no jurisdiction in the case since the romantic encounter supposedly occurred in Monaco and Albert has had no contacts with California that relate to the issues in the suit. &quot; On 31 May 2006, after DNA test results confirmed the child&apos;s parentage, Prince Albert admitted, in a statement from his lawyer, that he is Jazmin&apos;s father. He also extended an invitation for the girl to study and live in Monaco. [ Alexandre Coste ] In May 2005, Nicole Coste, a former Air France flight attendant from Togo, claimed that her youngest son, whom she calls Alexandre Coste, is Prince Albert&apos;s son, proven by DNA tests conducted by Swiss technicians working on orders from the Monegasque government. She further claimed the prince had signed a notarized certificate confirming paternity but that she had not received a copy of it. The French weekly Paris Match published a ten-page interview with Coste and included photographs of the prince holding and feeding the child. Coste also told Paris Match that she was living in the prince&apos;s Paris apartment and receiving an allowance from him while pretending to be the girlfriend of one of his friends in order to maintain privacy. She also said that the prince had last seen the boy in February 2005. A spokesman for Prince Albert had no comment, though upon news of Coste&apos;s claims, the prince&apos;s lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, announced that &quot; A judicial strategy will be determined within the next few days. &quot; In mid-May 2005, Lacoste announced that as a result of the international publicity over the revelations of the prince&apos;s son, Prince Albert is suing the Daily Mail, Bunte, and Paris Match for delving too deeply into his private life. On 6 July 2005, a few days before he was enthroned on 12 July, Albert II officially confirmed via his lawyer Thierry Lacoste that the 22-month-old is his biological son. { Monaco prince admits love child, BBC News, 6 July 2005. Accessed 18 September 2009. } [ Additional paternity suit ] An earlier paternity suit, brought by Bea Fiedler, a German topless model whom the Daily Telegraph described as a &quot; sex-film star &quot;, reportedly was dismissed. A blood test, which was refused by the judge, did not prove that the prince was the father of Fiedler&apos;s son, Daniel. { &quot; Bea in His Bonnet, &quot; &quot; } { Daily Telegraph &quot;, 29 July 1987. Also &quot; } { Sunday Mirror &quot;, 8 March 1998, pages 1+ } [ Marriage ] { Princess Charlene of Monaco. } [ Wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Charlene Wittstock ] Prince Albert married former South African swimmer Charlene Wittstock on 1 July 2011. They announced their engagement on 23 June 2010. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/10391167.stm Prince Albert of Monaco engaged to Charlene Wittstock BBC News 23 June 2010 2 July 2011 ] They had been seen together since 10 February 2006, at the opening ceremony of the Torino Olympics when Prince Albert was accompanied by Wittstock. They were seen again together at the Monaco Grand Prix. The Prince and Wittstock attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the &quot; Bal de la Rose &quot; and the Princess Grace Awards Gala in 2009. They also attended the opening ceremony of the Vancouver Olympics. As a couple, they also attended the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling in Stockholm four days before their own engagement was announced and the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011. The wedding took place over two days: the civil marriage ceremony took place on 1 July 2011, followed by the religious ceremony on 2 July 2011. { &apos;&apos;The program&apos;&apos; from } { Prince&apos;s Palace of Monaco, 30 June 2011 } { Princess Charlene of Monaco (centered) with Hermann Bühlbecker (left) and fashion designer } { Karl Lagerfeld, 2011. } [ Succession issues ] As Rainier III&apos;s health declined, his son&apos;s lack of legitimate children became a matter of public and political concern due to the legal and international consequences if Albert were to die without lawful heirs. Prior to 2002, Monaco&apos;s constitution specified that only the last reigning prince&apos;s &quot; direct and legitimate &quot; descendants could inherit the crown. On 2 April 2002 Monaco promulgated Princely Law 1.249 which provides that if a reigning prince dies without surviving legitimate issue, the throne passes to his siblings and their descendants of both sexes, according to the principle of male-preference primogeniture. { The Constitution (2002) } In October 2005 (after Albert&apos;s accession to the throne), this law took full effect when ratified by France, pursuant to the 2002 Franco-Monégasque Treaty regulating relations between the Sovereign Principality and its more powerful neighbour. His sisters and their legitimate children thereby acquired the right to succeed to the throne. Under the current constitution, neither Jazmin nor Alexandre has a claim to the throne of Monaco because they are not legitimate. Monegasque law stipulates that any non-adulterine child is legitimatized by the eventual marriage of his/her parents, thereupon obtaining the rights to which that child would have been entitled if born in lawful marriage. Thus Alexandre would become Monaco&apos;s heir apparent under current law if Albert were to ever marry his son&apos;s mother. But in a 2005 exchange with US interviewer Larry King, Albert stated that this will not happen. { Larry King Live. Interview with Prince Albert II. 25 October 2005, retrieved 26 June 2010. } In 2011 he married Charlene Wittstock. Albert specified that neither of these children is eligible for the throne in statements confirming his paternity. His older sister, Princess Caroline, remains first in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. Though she is only the heiress presumptive and not heiress apparent, Caroline is the Hereditary Princess of Monaco, according to the Grimaldi house law. { The House Laws } Until Albert II has legitimate descendants born of a dynastic marriage, Caroline is first, and her son Andrea Casiraghi is second in succession to the throne. [ Environmental issues ] [ Year of the Dolphin ] The year 2007 was declared as (International) Year of the Dolphin [ http://www.yod2007.org International Year of the Dolphin Website Yod2007.org 2 July 2011 ] by the United Nations and United Nations Environment Programme. Prince Albert served as the International Patron of the &apos;Year of the Dolphin&apos;, saying &quot; The Year of the Dolphin gives me the opportunity to renew my firm commitment towards protecting marine biodiversity. With this strong initiative we can make a difference to save these fascinating marine mammals from the brink of extinction. &quot; [ Jardin Animalier ] Monaco&apos;s Jardin Animalier, or zoo, was founded by Prince Rainier. Prince Albert has begun to return the animals to the wild and intends to convert the Jardin to a zoo for children. This project, undertaken in conjunction with the Born Free Foundation, started after the Prince met the Foundation&apos;s founder Virginia McKenna for lunch. { Gilchrist, Roderick. Leopards incredible journey to freedom, Daily Telegraph, 26 January 2008. Accessed 18 September 2009. } [ Expedition to Antarctica ] In January 2009, Prince Albert left for a month-long expedition to Antarctica, where he visited 26 scientific outposts and met with climate-change experts in an attempt to learn more about the impact of global warming on the continent. { Monaco&apos;s Prince Albert Heads to Antarctica Yahoo News, 5 January 2009 } [ CITES and bluefin tuna ] In June 2009, Prince Albert co-authored an open letter to the Wall Street Journal with Charles Clover, the author of The End of the Line, a book about overfishing and ocean conservation issues that had recently been made into a documentary by Rupert Murray. In the letter, Prince Albert acknowledges that bluefin tuna has been severely overfished in the Mediterranean, and decries the common European Union practice of awarding inflated quotas to bluefin fleets. { Clover, Charles; Grimaldi, Albert. It&apos;s Not Too Late to Save the Tuna, The Wall Street Journal, 5 June 2009. Accessed 18 September 2009. } He announced that Monaco would seek to award endangered species status to the Mediterranean bluefin Thunnus thynnus, (also called the Northern bluefin) under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ). If upheld by the voting CITES delegates, this proposal would effectively ban the international trade in Mediterranean bluefin. This was the first time a nation had called for the inclusion of Mediterranean bluefin under CITES since Sweden at the 1992 CITES Conference, which was vehemently opposed by Japan who eventually threatened retaliation through trade barriers. [ http://www.outdoor.se/sportfishnews/articles/bluefin/ The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Outdoor.se 31 July 1926 2 July 2011 ] Sweden withdrew its proposal. On 16 July 2009, France declared that it too would seek to have Mediterranean bluefin listed as an endangered species. { France Supports International Trade Ban for Endangered Bluefin Tuna, NatGeo News Watch, 16 July 2009.
