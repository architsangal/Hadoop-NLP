The referenced n-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves. The face-transitive bipyramids are the dual polyhedra of the uniform prisms and will generally have isosceles triangle faces. A bipyramid can be projected on a sphere or globe as n equally spaced lines of longitude going from pole to pole, and bisected by a line around the equator. Bipyramid face s, projected as spherical triangle s, represent the fundamental domains in the dihedral symmetry D nh. [ Volume ] The volume of a bipyramid is \scriptstyle{V =} \tfrac{2}{3} \scriptstyle{Bh} where B is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. This works for any location of the apex, provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane which contains the base. The volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular n-sided polygon with side length s and whose height is h is therefore: V = \frac{n}{6}hs^2 \cot\frac{\pi}{n} [ Equilateral triangle bipyramids ] Only three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are equilateral triangle s, and thus the bipyramid is a deltahedron ): the triangular, tetragonal, and pentagonal bipyramids. The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or regular octahedron, counts among the Platonic solid s, while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the Johnson solid s (J12 and J13). 100px 100px 100px Triangular bipyramid Square bipyramid ( Octahedron ) Pentagonal bipyramid [ Forms ] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 100px 100px 90px 80px 100px 100px [ Symmetry groups ] If the base is regular and the line through the apexes intersects the base at its center, the symmetry group of the n-agonal bipyramid has dihedral symmetry D nh of order 4n, except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger octahedral symmetry group O h of order 48, which has three versions of D 4h as subgroups. The rotation group is D n of order 2n, except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D 4 as subgroups. [ Star bipyramids ] Self-intersecting bipyramids exist with a star polygon central figure, defined by triangular faces connecting each polygon edge to these two points. For example, a pentagrammic bipyramid is an isohedral star polyhedron composed of ten intersecting isosceles triangle s. It is the dual to the pentagrammic prism. 240px [ Polychora with bipyramid cells ] The dual of the rectification of each convex regular polychoron is a cell-transitive polychoron with bipyramidal cells. In the following, the apex vertex of the bipyramid is A and an equator vertex is E. The distance between adjacent vertexes on the equator EE=1, the apex to equator edge is AE and the distance between the apexes is AA. The bipyramid polychoron will have V A vertexes where the apexes of N A bipyramids meet. It will have V E vertexes where the type E vertexes of N E bipyramids meet. N AE bipyramids meet along each type AE edge. N EE bipyramids meet along each type EE edge. C AE is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an AE edge. C EE is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an EE edge. As cells must fit around an edge, N AA cos -1 (C AA ) &lt; 2 \pi, N AE cos -1 (C AE ) &lt; 2 \pi Polychoron Properties Bipyramid Properties Dual Cells V A V E N A N E N AE N EE Base AA AE C AE C EE Rectified Pentachoron 10 5 5 4 6 3 3 triangle \scriptstyle \frac{2}{3} 0.667 \scriptstyle - \frac{1}{7} \scriptstyle - \frac{1}{7} Rectified hexadecachoron 24 8 16 6 6 3 3 square \scriptstyle \sqrt{2} 1 \scriptstyle - \frac{1}{3} \scriptstyle - \frac{1}{3} Rectified Tesseract 32 16 8 4 12 3 4 triangle \scriptstyle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} 0.624 \scriptstyle - \frac{2}{5} \scriptstyle \frac{1}{5} Rectified Octaplex 96 24 24 8 12 4 3 triangle \scriptstyle \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} 0.745 \scriptstyle \frac{1}{11} \scriptstyle - \frac{5}{11} Rectified hexacosichoron 720 120 600 12 6 3 3 pentagon \scriptstyle \frac{5+3\sqrt{5}}{5} 1.447 \scriptstyle - \frac{11+4\sqrt{5}}{41} \scriptstyle - \frac{11+4\sqrt{5}}{41} Rectified hecatonicosachoron 1200 600 120 4 30 3 5 triangle \scriptstyle \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1 }{3} 0.613 \scriptstyle - \frac{10+9\sqrt{5}}{61} \scriptstyle \frac{12\sqrt{5} - 7}{61} The 24 cell is the regular octaplex and vertexes are all equivalent – octahedra are regular bipyramids. Given numerically due to more complex form. [ Higher dimensions ] In general, a bipyramid can be seen as an n- polytope constructed with a (n−1)-polytope in a hyperplane with two points in opposite directions, equal distance perpendicular from the hyperplane. If the (n−1)-polytope is a regular polytope, it will have identical pyramids facets.
