{ Dacian } [ Dacian Indo-European Daco-Thracian ? Romania, northern Bulgaria, eastern Serbia; also (possibly): Moldova, SW Ukraine, SE Slovakia, eastern Hungary, southern Bulgaria, northern Greece, European Turkey, NW Anatolia (Turkey) probably by the 6th century AD xdc ] The extinct Dacian language may have developed from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) in the Carpathian region around 2,500 BC and probably died out by AD 600. In the 1st century AD, it was the predominant language of the ancient regions of Dacia, probably Moesia and possibly of some surrounding regions. It belonged to the Indo-European language family. The available evidence, which is scarce, suggests that the Dacian language might have belonged to the satem group of the Indo-European (IE) languages. [ Oltean 2007 45 ] [ MacKenzie 1986 26 ] Dacian is considered by some scholars e.g. Baldi (1983) and Trask (2000), to be a dialect of the Thracian language, or vice versa; the term Daco-Thracian, or Thraco-Dacian, is used by linguists to denote such a common language, or its presumed parent-branch of Indo-European. It is alternatively considered to be a language separate from Thracian but related to it and to Phrygian; [ Cambridge ancient history 1970 I. E. S. Edwards C. J. Gadd N. G. L. Hammond Cambridge University Press Cambridge [England] 978-0-521-07791-0 840 ] or a language unrelated to either Thracian or Phrygian, except in the distant sense of sharing an Indo-European origin, as was theorised by Vladimir Georgiev in 1977. [ Georgiev 1977 282 ] The Dacian language is poorly attested. Unlike Phrygian, only one Dacian inscription is known to have survived. [ Asenova 1999 212 ] [ Nandris 1976 730 ] In ancient literary sources, the Dacian names of a number of medicinal plants and herbs survive in ancient texts { Dioscurides } { Pseudo-Apuleius } this includes about 60 plant names with Dioscorides. [ Glanville 1998 120 ] Dacian is also known through about 1,150 proper names [ Nandris 1976 730 ] [ Petrescu-Dîmbovița 1978 130 ] and about 900 toponyms. [ Nandris 1976 730 ] A few hundred words in modern Albanian and Romanian may have originated in ancient Balkan languages such as Dacian (see List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin ). [ Origin ] There is scholarly consensus that Dacian was a member of the Indo-European family of languages. These descended, according to the two leading theories of the expansion of IE languages, from a proto-Indo European (proto-IE) tongue that originated in an urheimat ( &quot; original homeland &quot; ) in S. Russia/ Caucasus region, ( Kurgan hypothesis ) or in central Anatolia ( Anatolian hypothesis ). According to both theories, proto-IE reached the Carpathian region no later than ca. 2,500 BC. { Renfrew (1987) 149 (map) } { Mallory (1989) 107, 109 } Supporters of both theories have suggested this region as IE&apos;s secondary urheimat, in which the differentiation of proto-IE into the various European language-groups (e.g. Italic, Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Celtic) began. There is thus considerable support for the thesis that Dacian developed in the Carpathian region during the third millennium BC, although its evolutionary pathways remains uncertain. [ August 2011 ] According to one scenario, proto-Thracian populations emerged during the Bronze Age from the fusion of the indigenous Eneolithic (Chalcolithic) population with the intruders of the transitional Indo-Europeanization Period. [ Dumitrescu Boardman 1982 53 ] [ Hoddinott 1989 52 ] From these proto-Thracians, in the Iron Age, developed the Dacians / North Thracians of the Danubian-Carpathian Area on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula on the other. [ Dumitrescu Boardman 1982 53 ] [ Hoddinott 1989 52 ]. According to Georgiev, the Dacian language was spread south of the Danube by tribes from Carpathia, who reached the central Balkans in the period 2,000–1,000 BC, with further movements (e.g. the Triballi tribe) after 1,000 BC, until ca. 300 BC. { Georgiev (1977) 287 } According to the ancient geographer Strabo, Daco-Moesian was further spread into Asia Minor in the form of Mysian by a migration of the Moesi people; Strabo asserts that Moesi and Mysi were variants of the same name. { Strabo VII.3.2 } [ Sources ] { Mihail Dimitriu at the site of } { Poiana, Galaţi ( } { Piroboridava ), } { Romania illustrating the use of Greek and Latin letters by a Dacian potter (source: } { Dacia journal, 1933) } Many characteristics of the Dacian language are disputed or unknown. No lengthy texts in Dacian exist, only a few glosses and personal names in ancient Greek and Latin texts. No Dacian-language inscriptions have been discovered, except some of names in the Latin or Greek alphabet. What is known about the language derives from: { stater &apos;&apos; coin found in Dacia. &apos;&apos;Obverse&apos;&apos;: } { Roman magistrate with } { lictors. Legend } { ΚΟΣΩΝ (&apos;&apos;Coson&apos;&apos;) and (&apos;&apos;left centre&apos;&apos;) monogram BR or OΛB. &apos;&apos;Reverse&apos;&apos;: Eagle clutching laurel-wreath.

The coin inscription KOΣON may also be a personal name, of the king who issued the coin. The Dacian names of about fifty plants written in Greek and Roman sources (see List of Dacian plant names ). Etymologies have been established for only a few of them. Substratum words found in Romanian, the language that is spoken today in most of the region once occupied by Dacian-speakers. These include about 400 words of uncertain origin. Romanian words for which a Dacian origin has been proposed include: balaur ( &quot; dragon &quot; ), brânză ( &quot; cheese &quot; ), mal ( &quot; bank, shore &quot; ), strugure ( &quot; bunch of grapes &quot; ). However, the value of the substratum words as a source for the Dacian language is limited because there is no certainty that these are of Dacian origin. This can be seen in the Dicţionar Explicativ al Limbii Române (DEX), which shows multiple possible etymologies for most of the words: [ DEX &quot; melc &quot; ] [ August 2011 ] [ August 2011 ] [ DEX balaur ] [ DEC brad ] [ Polome 1982 998 ] [ DEX brad ] [ Duridanov 1969 94 ] Many of the words may not be &quot; substratum &quot; at all, as Latin etymologies have been proposed for them. These are inherently more likely than a Dacian origin, as the Romanian language is descended from Latin, not Dacian e.g. melc ( &quot; snail &quot; ) may derive from Latin limax/proto-Romance *limace (cf. It. lumaca), by metastasis of &quot; m &quot; with &quot; l &quot;. Some may derive from other little-known ancient languages at some time spoken in Dacia or Moesia: for example, the Iranic Sarmatian, or the Turkic Avar, Bulgar or Cuman languages, or, conceivably, some unknown pre-Indo-European language(s) of the Carpathians or Balkans. An illustration of the latter possibility are pre-Indo-European substratum (i.e. Iberian / Basque ) in Spanish e.g. &quot; fox &quot; = zorro, from Basque azeri, instead of proto-Romance *vulpe. A pre-Indo-European origin has been proposed for several Romanian substratum words e.g. balaur, brad ( &quot; fir-tree &quot; ). About 160 of the Romanian substratum words have cognate s in Albanian and therefore may be of Illyrian origin rather than Dacian, as many contemporary scholars consider Albanian to be a modern descendant of the ancient Illyrian language. A possible example is Romanian brad ( &quot; fir-tree &quot; ), Alb. cognate bradh (same meaning). Duridanov has reconstructed *skuia as a Dacian word for fir-tree, strengthening the possibility that brad may be an Illyrian word for this tree. The numerous Romanian substratum words which have cognates in Bulgarian may derive from Thracian, which may have been a different language from Dacian (see below, Thracian ). Balaur ( &quot; dragon &quot; ), ascribed a Dacian origin by some scholars, exemplifies the etymological uncertainties. According to DEX, balaur has also been identified as: a pre-Indo-European relic; or derived from Latin belua or beluaria ( &quot; beast &quot; cf. It. belva), or ancient Greek pelorion ( &quot; monster &quot; ); or as a cognate of Alb. buljar ( &quot; water-snake &quot; ) [ DEX balaur ] thus possibly of Illyrian origin. DEX argues that these etymologies, save the Albanian one, are dubious, but they are no more so than the unverifiable assertion that balaur is derived from an unknown Dacian word. Another possibility is that balaur could be a Celtic derivation cf. the Irish mythical giant Balor ( [ aka ] Balar), who could kill with flashes of light from his eye or with his poisonous breath. However, the substratum words can be used to corroborate Dacian words reconstructed from place- and personal names. This has been possible in some cases, for example Dacian *balas = &quot; white &quot; (from personal name Balius), Rom bălan = &quot; white-haired &quot;; (although, even in this case, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the Romanian word derives from the presumed Dacian word or from its Old Slavic cognate belu). The Romanian substratum word spânz ( &quot; hellebore &quot; cf. Albanian spëndër) is another example, used along with a Dacian form and Baltic words to support a Dacian word that meant &quot; shiny &quot;. [ September 2011 specify Dacian word and IE etymology ] [ Geographical extent ] Celtic, Illyrian and Dacian languages 4th  – 3rd century BC { Dacia 1st century BC } { Ptolemy &apos;s } { Geographia (ca. 140 AD) } [ Linguistic area ] Dacian was probably one of the major languages of south-eastern Europe, spoken in the area between modern-day eastern Hungary to the Black Sea shore. [ August 2011 ] According to historians, as a result of the linguistic unity of the Getae and Dacians that result from the record of ancient writers Strabo, Cassius Dio, Trogus Pompeius, Appian and Pliny the Elder, contemporary historiography often uses the term Geto-Dacians to refer to the people living in the area between the Carpathians, the Haemus (Balkan) Mountains and the Black Sea. Strabo gave more specific information, recording that “the Dacians speak the same language as the Getae” a dialect of the Thracian language. [ Bolovan Treptow 1997 10 ] The information provided by the Greek geographer is complemented by other literary, linguistic, and archaeological evidence. According to these, the Geto-Dacians may have occupied territory in the west and north-west, as far as Moravia and the middle Danube, to the area of present-day Serbia in the south-west, and as far as the Haemus Mountains in the south. The eastern limit of the territory inhabited by the Geto-Dacians may have been the shore of the Black Sea and the Tyras River, possibly at times reaching as far as the Bug River, the northern limit reached the Trans-Carpathian Ukraine and southern Poland. [ Bolovan Treptow 1997 10-11 ] Over time, some peripheral areas of the Geto-Dacians&apos; territories were affected by the presence of other people, such as the Celts in the west, the Illyrians in the south-west, the Greeks and Scythians in the east and the Bastarnae in the north-east. Nevertheless, between the Tisza River, the Haemus Mountains, the Black Sea, the Dniester River, and the northern Carpathians, a continuous Geto-Dacian presence was maintained, according to some scholars. [ Bolovan Treptow 1997 11 ] According to the Bulgarian linguist Georgiev, the Daco-Mysian region included Dacia (approximately contemporary Romania and Hungary to the east of the Tisza River, Mysia (Moesia) and Scythia Minor (contemporary Dobrogea). [ Georgiev 1981 148 ] [ Chronology ] [ 1st century BC ] In 53 BC, Julius Caesar stated that the lands of the Dacians started on the eastern edge of the Hercynian Forest. [ Mountain 1998 59 ] This corresponds to the period between 82–44 BCE, when the Dacian state reached its widest extent during the reign of King Burebista : in the west it may have extended as far as the middle Danube River valley in present-day Hungary, in the east and north to the Carpathians in present-day Slovakia and in the south to the lower Dniester valley in present-day south-western Ukraine and the western coast of the Black Sea as far as Appollonia. [ Magocsi Ivanovich Pop 2002 71 ] At that time, some scholars believe, the Dacians built a series of hill-forts at Zemplin (Slovakia), Mala Kopania (Ukraine), Onceşti, Maramureş (Romania) and Solotvyno (Ukraine). [ Magocsi Ivanovich Pop 2002 71 ] The Zemplin settlement appears to belong to a Celto-Dacian horizon, as well as the river Patissus (Tisa)&apos;s region, including its upper stretch, according to Shchukin (1989). [ Shchukin 1989 347 ] According to Parducz (1956) Foltiny (1966), Dacian archaeological finds extend to the west of Dacia, and occur along both banks of the Tisza. [ Ehrich 1970 228 ] Besides the possible incorporation of a part of Slovakia into the Dacian state of Burebista, there was also Geto-Dacian penetration of south-eastern Poland, according to Mielczarek (1989). [ Mielczarek 1989 121 ] The Polish linguist Milewski Tadeusz (1966 and 1969) suggests that in the southern regions of Poland appear names that are unusual in northern Poland, possibly related to Dacian or Illyrian names. [ Milewski 1969 304 ] [ Antoniewicz 1966 12 ] On the grounds of these names, it has been argued that the region of the Carpathian and Tatra Mountains was inhabited by Dacian tribes linguistically related to the ancestors of modern Albanians. [ Milewski 1969 306 ] [ Antoniewicz 1966 12 ] Also, a formal statement by Pliny indicated the river Vistula as the western boundary of Dacia, according to Nicolet (1991). [ Nicolet 1991 109 ] Between the Prut and the Dniester, the northern extent of the appearance of Geto-Dacian elements in the 4th century BC coincides roughly with the extent of the present-day Republic of Moldova, according to Mielczarek. [ Mielczarek 1989 13 ] According to Müllenhoff (1856), Shütte (1917), Urbannczyk (2001) and Matei-Popescu (2007), Agrippa ’s commentaries mention the river Vistula as the western boundary of Dacia. [ Urbannczyk 2001 510 ] [ Müllenhoff 1856 19 ] [ Schütte 1917 87 &quot; The Romans knew the dimensions of Dacia, as it is stated by Agrippa (c. 63 BC  – 12 BC) in his Commentaries: &apos;Dacia, Getica finiuntur ab oriente desertis Sarmatiae, ab occidente flumine Vistula, a septentrione Oceano, a meridie flumine Histro. quae patent in longitudine milia passuum CCLXXX, in latitudine qua cognitum est milia passuura CCCLXXXVI&apos; &quot; ] [ Matei-Popescu 2007 79 ] Urbannczyk (1997) speculates that according to Agrippa’s commentaries, and the map of Agrippa (before 12 BC), the Vistula river separated Germania and Dacia. [ Urbannczyk 1997 13 ] This map is lost and its contents are unknown { See one possible reconstruction: ) } [ June 2011 ] However, later Roman geographers, including Ptolemy (AD 90  – c. AD 168) (II.10, III.7) and Tacitus (AD 56  – AD 117) (ref: Germania XLVI) considered the Vistula as the boundary between Germania and Sarmatia Europaea, or Germania and Scythia. [ Urbannczyk 2001 510 ]. [ 1st century AD ] Around 20 AD, Strabo wrote the Geographica [ Strabo Jones Sterrett 1967 28 ] that provides information regarding the extent of regions inhabited by the Dacians. On its basis, Lengyel and Radan (1980), Hoddinott (1981) and Mountain (1998) consider that the Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisza river before the rise of the Celtic Boii and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians. [ Taylor 2001 215 ] [ Strabo VII.3.1 &quot; As for the southern part of Germany beyond the Albis, the portion which is just contiguous to that river is occupied by the Suevi; then immediately adjoining this is the land of the Getae, which, though narrow at first, stretching as it does along the Ister on its southern side and on the opposite side along the mountain-side of the Hercynian Forest (for the land of the Getae also embraces a part of the mountains), afterwards broadens out towards the north as far as the Tyregetae; but I cannot tell the precise boundaries. &quot; ] { Strabo (20 AD) v. 1.6; vii 1.3; vii 5.2 } [ Lengyel &amp; Radan 1980 87 &quot; No matter where the Boii first settled after they left Italia, however, when they arrived at the Danube they had to fight the Dacians who held the entire territory  — or at least part of it. Strabo tells us that later animosity between the Dacians and the Boii stemmed from the fact that the Dacians demanded the land from the latter which the Dacians pretended to have possessed earlier. &quot; ] The hold of the Dacians between the Danube and the Tisza appears to have been tenuous. [ Lengyel Radan 1980 87 ] However, the Hungarian archaeologist Parducz (1856) argued for a Dacian presence west of the Tisza dating from the time of Burebista (Ehrich 1970). [ Ehrich 1970 228 ] According to Tacitus (AD 56  – AD 117) Dacians were bordering Germany in the south-east while Sarmatians bordered it in the east. [ Gruen 2011 204 : Germany as a whole is separated from the Gauls and from the Raetians and Pannonians by the rivers Rhine and Danube, from the Sarmatians and Dacians by mutual fear or mountains; the ocean surrounds the rest of it ] In the 1st century AD, the Iazyges settled in the west of Dacia, on the plain between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, according to some scholars&apos; interpretation of Pliny &apos;s text: “The higher parts between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest) as far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum and the plains and level country of the German frontiers there are occupied by the Sarmatian Iazyges, while the Dacians whom they have driven out hold the mountains and forests as far as the river Theiss”. [ Hrushevskyi 1997 93 ] [ Bosworth 1980 60 ] [ Pliny&apos;s Natural History [77–79 AD] 2000 179 ] [ Carnap-Bornheim 2003 228 ] [ Scott Shelley 1997 10 ] Archaeological sources indicate that the local Celto-Dacian population retained its specificity as late as the 3rd century AD. [ Mielczarek 1989 13 ] Archaeological finds dated to the 2nd century AD, after the Roman conquest, indicate that during that period, vessels found in some of the Iazygian cemeteries reveal fairly strong Dacian influence, according to Mocsy. [ Mocsy 1974 95 ] M. Párducz (1956) and Z. Visy (1971) reported a concentration of Dacian-style finds in the Cris-Mures-Tisza region and in the Danube bend area near Budapest. These maps of finds remain valid today, but they have been complemented with additional finds that cover a wider area, particularly the interfluvial region between the Danube and Tisza (Toma 2007). [ Toma 2007 65 ] However, this interpretation has been invalidated by late 20th-century archaeology, which has discovered Sarmatian settlements and burial sites all over the Hungarian Plain on both sides of the Tisza e.g. Gyoma in south-eastern Hungary and Nyiregyhaza in north-eastern Hungary. [ June 2011 ] The Barrington Atlas shows the Iazyges occupying both sides of Tisza (map 20). [ 2nd century AD ] Central Europe map that includes Dacia Written a few decades after the Roman conquest of Dacia 105–106 AD [ Mattern 2002 61 ], Ptolemy&apos;s Geographia defined the boundaries of Dacia. There is a consensus among scholars that Ptolemy&apos;s Dacia was the region between the rivers Tisza, Danube, upper Dniester, and Siret. [ Mykhailo Hrushevskyi 1997 97 &quot; Dacia, as described by Ptolemy, occupied the region between the Tisza, Danube, upper Dnister, and Seret, while the Black Sea coast  — namely, the Greek colonies of Tyras, Olbia, and others  — were included in Lower Moesia. &quot; ] [ Bunbury 1979 517 ] [ Mocsy 1974 21 ] [ Barbulescu Nägler 2005 71 ] The mainstream of historians accepted this interpretation: Avery (1972) Berenger (1994) Fol (1996) Mountain (1998), Waldman Mason (2006). [ Berenger 1994 25 ] [ Mountain 1998 59 ] [ Waldman Mason 2006 205 ] [ Avery 1972 113 ] [ Fol 1996 223 ] Ptolemy also provided Dacian toponyms in the Upper Vistula (Polish: Wisla) river basin in Poland: Susudava and Setidava (with a manuscript variant Getidava [ Dobiás 1964 70 ] ). [ Berindei Candea 2001 429 ] [ Schütte Gudmund Schütte 1952 270 ] [ Giurescu C Giurescu D 1974 31 ] This may be an echo of Burebista’s expansion. [ Berindei Candea 2001 429 ] It appears that this northern expansion of the Dacian language as far as the Vistula river lasted until AD 170–180 when the Hasdings, a Germanic tribe, expelled a Dacian group from this region, according to Schütte (1917) and Childe (1930). [ Gordon Childe 1930 245 ] [ Schütte 1917 143 and p=109 ] This Dacian group is associated by Schütte (1952) with towns having the specific Dacian language ending &apos;dava&apos; i.e. Setidava. [ Schütte 952 270 ] A previous Dacian presence that ended with the Hasdings&apos; arrival is considered also by Heather (2010) who says that the Hasdings Vandals “attempted to take control of lands which had previously belonged to a free Dacian group called the Costoboci” [ Heather 201a 131 ] Several tribes on the northern slopes of the Carpathians were mentioned that are generally considered Thraco-Dacian, i.e. Arsietae (Upper Vistula) [ Schütte 1952 270 ] [ Popescu-Spineni 1987 53 ] [ Radulescu 1987 249 ] [ Russu 1969 27 ] [ Wald Slusanschi Băltăceanu 1987 117 ], Biessi / Biessoi [ Russu 1969 27 ] [ Popescu-Spineni 1987 53 ] [ Schütte 1917 99 ] [ Georgiev 1972 63 ] and Piengitai. [ Popescu-Spineni 1987 53 ] [ Wald Slusanschi Băltăceanu 1987 117 ] Schütte (1952) associated the Dacian tribe of Arsietae with the Arsonion town. [ Schütte 1952 270 ] The ancient documents attest names with the Dacian name ending -dava &apos;town&apos; in the Balto-Slavic territory, in the country of Arsietae tribe, at the sources of the Vistula river. [ Poghirc Frisch 1983 92 ] The Biessi inhabited the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, which on Ptolemy&apos;s map are located on the headwaters of the Dnister and Sian Rivers, the right-bank Carpathian tributary of the Vistula river. [ Mykhailo Hrushevskyi 1997 98 ] The Biessi (Biessoi) probably left their name to the mountain chain of Bieskides that continues the Carpathian Mountains towards the north (Schütte 1952). [ Schütte 1952 270 ] Ptolemy (140 AD) lists only Germanic or Balto-Slavic tribes, and no Dacians, [ June 2011 ] on both sides of the Vistula (ref: II.10; III.7), as does the Barrington Atlas (map 19) [ June 2011 ] After the Marcomannic Wars (166–180 AD), Dacian groups from outside Roman Dacia had been set in motion, and thus were the 12,000 Dacians &quot; from the neighbourhood of Roman Dacia sent away from their own country &quot;. Their native country could have been the Upper Tisza region but other places cannot be excluded. [ Opreanu 1997 249 ] [ Dacian linguistic zone in the Julio-Claudian era (49 BC &amp; amp;nbsp;– AD 68) ] [ Core &quot; dava &quot; zone ] { Bosporus. But Strabo&apos;s view is controversial among modern linguists: dava placenames are absent south of the } { Balkan mountains, with one exception (see } { Thracian, below) } At the start of the Roman imperial era (30 BC), the Dacian language was predominant in the ancient regions of Dacia and Moesia. Strabo&apos;s statement that the Moesian people spoke the same language as the Dacians and Getae is confirmed by the distribution of placenames, attested in Ptolemy&apos;s Geographia, which carry the Dacian suffix -dava ( &quot; town &quot; or &quot; fort &quot; ). North of the Danube, the dava-zone is largely consistent with Ptolemy&apos;s definition of Dacia&apos;s borders (III.8.1–3) i.e. the area contained by the river Ister ( Danube ) to the south, the river Thibiscum ( Timiş ) to the west, the upper river Tyras ( Dniester ) to the north and the river Hierasus ( Siret ) to the east. { Ptolemy III.8.1–3 } To the west, it appears that the -dava placenames in Olteanu&apos;s map lie within the line of the Timiş, extended northwards. However, four davas are located beyond the Siret, Ptolemy&apos;s eastern border. But three of these, Piroboridava, Tamasidava and Zargidava, are described by Ptolemy as pará (Gr. &quot; very close &quot; ) to the Siret: Piroboridava, the only one securely located, was 3  km from the Siret. [ Barrington Atlas Map 22 ] The location of Clepidava is uncertain: Olteanu locates it in north-east Bessarabia, but Georgiev places it further west, in south-west Ukraine, between the upper reaches of the Siret and Dniester rivers. [ Georgiev 1977 191 (map) ] South of the Danube, a dialect of Dacian, called Daco-Moesian was probably spoken in the region known to the Romans as Moesia, which was divided by them into the Roman provinces of Moesia Superior (roughly modern Serbia) and Moesia Inferior (modern northern Bulgaria as far as the Balkan range plus Roman Dobrogea region). This is evidenced by the distribution of -dava placenames, which occur in the eastern half of Moesia Superior and all over Inferior. [ Georgiev 1977 191 map ] These regions were inhabited by tribes believed to have been Dacian-speaking, such as the Triballi, Moesi and Getae. However, the dava zone was not exclusively or uniformly Dacian-speaking during historical times. The dates when the language became established are unknown, but most scholars believe it was established before 1000 BC north of the Danube and before 500 BC south of the river. However, starting around 400 BC, Celtic groups moving out of their La Tene heartland in southern Germany, penetrated and settled south-eastern Europe as far as the Black Sea and into Anatolia. By ca. 260 BC, much of the modern states of Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, and Bessarabia and Moesia, were under Celtic cultural influence or political domination. [ Philips Atlas of the Celts 59 ] This migratory process brought the advanced Celtic material culture, skilled in metallurgy, to the Illyrian and Dacian peoples. Especially intensive Celtic settlement, as evidenced by concentrations of La Tene cemeteries, took place in Austria, Slovakia, the Hungarian Plain, Transylvania, Bessarabia and eastern Thrace. [ Philips Atlas of the Celts 69 ] Transylvania appears to have become either a Celtic enclave or a unitary kingdom. It is likely that during the period of Celtic pre-eminence, the Dacian language was eclipsed by Celtic dialects in Transylvania. By 60 BC, the Celtic political hegemony in Transylvania appears to have collapsed, and the indigenous Dacian tribes appear to have reasserted their identity and political independence. [ 91 ] This process may have been partly due to the career of the Getan king Burebista (ruled ca 80  – 44 BC), who appears to have coalesced the Geto-Dacian tribes under his leadership. It is likely that in this period, the Dacian language regained its former predominance in Transylvania. Nevertheless, significant Celtic elements survived there into the 2nd century AD: Ptolemy (III.8.3) lists two Celtic peoples, the Taurisci and Anartes, as resident in the northernmost part of Dacia, in the northern Carpathians. The partly Celtic Bastarnae are also attested in this region in literature and the archaeological record during the 1st century BC; they probably remained in the 1st century AD, according to Batty. [ Batty 2009 378 ] In 29–26 BC, Moesia was conquered and annexed by the Romans. There followed an intensive process of Romanisation. The Danube, as the new frontier of the empire and main fluvial supply route for the Roman military, was soon dotted with forts and supply depots, which were garrisoned by several legions and many auxiliary units. Numerous colonies of Roman army veterans were established. The presence of the Roman military brought alarge quantity of non-Dacian immigrants, such as soldiers, their dependents, ancillary workers and merchants, from every part of the Roman Empire into the province. It is likely that by the time the emperor Trajan invaded Dacia (101–6), the Dacian language had been largely replaced by Latin in Moesia. The conquest of Dacia saw a similar process of Romanisation north of the Danube, so that by AD 200, Latin was probably predominant in the zone permanently occupied by the Romans. In addition, it appears that some unoccupied parts of the dava zone were overrun, either before or during the Dacian Wars, by Sarmatian tribes; for example, eastern Wallachia, which had fallen under the Roxolani by AD 68. { Tacitus Histories I.79 } By around 200 AD, it is likely that the Dacian language was confined to those parts of the dava zone occupied by the Free Dacian groups, which may have amounted to little more than the eastern Carpathians. [ Other regions ] It has been argued that the zone of Dacian speech extended beyond the confines of Dacia, as defined by Ptolemy, and Moesia. An extreme view, presented by some scholars, is that Dacian was the main language spoken between the Baltic sea and the Black and Aegean seas. But the evidence for Dacian as a prevalent language outside Dacia and Moesia appears inconclusive: [ Balkans/Anatolia ] To the east, beyond the Siret river, it has been argued by numerous scholars that Dacian was also the main language of the modern regions of Moldavia and Bessarabia, as far east as the Dniester river. The main evidence used to support this consists of three -dava placenames which Ptolemy located just east of the Siret; and the mainstream identification as ethnic-Dacian of two peoples resident in Moldavia: the Carpi and Costoboci. However, the Dacian ethnicity of the Carpi and Costoboci is disputed in academic circles, and they have also been variously identified as Sarmatian, Germanic, Celtic or proto-Slavic. Numerous non-Dacian peoples, both sedentary and nomadic, the Scytho-Sarmatian Roxolani and Agathyrsi, Germanic Bastarnae and Celtic Anartes, are attested to in the ancient sources and in the archaeological record as inhabiting this region. { Barrington Map 22 } The linguistic status of this region during the Roman era must therefore be considered uncertain. To the south, it has been argued that the ancient Thracian language was a dialect of Dacian, or vice versa, and that therefore the Dacian linguistic zone extended over the Roman province of Thracia, occupying modern-day Bulgaria south of the Balkan Mountains, northern Greece and European Turkey, as far as the Aegean sea. But this theory, based on the testimony of the Augustan-era geographer Strabo&apos;s work Geographica VII.3.2 and 3.13, is disputed; opponents argue that Thracian was a distinct language from Dacian, either related or unrelated. In addition, Strabo (VII.3.2) equates the Moesi people with the Mysi ( Mysians ) of north-west Anatolia, and states that the two forms were Greek and Latin variants of the same name. The Mysians, he adds, were Moesi who had migrated to Anatolia and who both spoke the Dacian language. But there is insufficient evidence about either Dacian or the Mysian language to verify Strabo&apos;s claim. [ August 2011 ] It is possible that Strabo made a false identification based solely on the similarity between the two tribal names, which may have been coincidental. The need for caution about Strabo&apos;s linguistic linkages is demonstrated by his further claim (VII.3.2) that the Mysians&apos; neighbours, the Phrygians, were descended from a Thracian tribe and thus spoke a similar language to the Thracians and Dacians.This is rejected by modern mainstream scholarship, which considers the Phrygian language, which is better documented than the other two, a separate branch of Indo-European, and unrelated to Thracian or Dacian. [ Georgiev 1977 282 ] [ Polomé 1982 888 ] [ Hungarian Plain/Slovakia ] The hypothesis that Dacian was widely spoken to the north-west of Dacia is primarily based on the career of Dacian king Burebista, who ruled approximately between 80  – 44 BC. According to Strabo, Burebista coalesced the Geto-Dacian tribes under his leadership and conducted military operations as far as Pannonia and Thracia. Although Strabo appears to portray these campaigns as simply raids to punish his enemies, many Romanian scholars have argued, on the basis of controversial interpretation of archaeological data, that they resulted in longer-term Dacian occupation and settlement of large territories beyond the dava zone. [ April 2012 ] Some scholars have asserted that Dacian was the main language of the sedentary population of the Hungarian Plain, at least as far as the river Tisza, and possibly as far as the Danube. Statements by ancient authors such as Caesar, Strabo and Pliny the Elder have been controversially interpreted as supporting this view, but these are too vague or ambiguous to be of much geographical value. [ August 2011 ] There is little hard evidence to support the thesis of a large ethnic-Dacian population on the Plain: [ Muller 1883 ] [ Almassy 2006 263 ] [ Almassy 2006 253 (fig. 2 ) 254 (fig 3) ] [ Visy 1995 280 ] [ Almassy 2006 253 ] [ CAH Vol X 1996 ] [ http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle%3DAE%2B1905%2C%2B00014%26amp%3Br_sortierung%3DBelegstelle Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss / Slaby EDCS 26 April 2012 ] [ August 2011 ] [ August 2011 ] Toponyms: None of the eight placenames on the Plain given by Ptolemy (III.7.1) carry the -dava suffix. At least three -Uscenum, Bormanum and the only one which can be located with confidence, Partiscum ( Szeged, Hungary)  – have been identified as Celtic placenames by scholars. Archaeology: The archaeology of the sedentary population of the Plain has been interpreted by some scholars as showing Dacian (Mocsy 1974) or Celto-Dacian (Parducz 1956) features. But more recent scholar, e.g. Szabó (2005) and Almássy (2006), favour the view that the sedentary population of the Hungarian Plain in the period 100 BC  – AD 100 was predominantly ethnically Celtic and that any Dacian-style features were cultural imports. Of 94 sites dated to this period excavated between 1986–2006, the vast majority have been identified as Celtic, while two as possibly, and none as certainly, Dacian, according to Almassy. Visy (1995) also concludes that there is little archaeological evidence of a Dacian population on the Plain before the Sarmatian occupation by the late 1st century AD. Epigraphy: Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign of the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius across the Danube, dated to 10 BC or 8 BC i.e. during or just after the Roman conquest of Pannonia (bellum Pannonicum 14–9 BC). The inscription states: &quot; Marcus Vinucius... Consul [in 19 BC], etc... governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Bastarnae, and subjected the Cotini, Osi,...[missing tribal name] and Anartes to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome. &quot; It has been suggested that the latter Celtic tribes constituted the native population of the Plain who, until Vinucius&apos; offensive, had been under Dacian political hegemony, but became Rome&apos;s clients thereafter. To the north-west, the argument has been advanced that Dacian was also prevalent in modern-day Slovakia and parts of Poland. The basis for this is the presumed Dacian occupation of the fortress of Zemplin in Slovakia in the era of Dacian king Burebista  – whose campaigns outside Dacia have been dated ca. 60–44 BC  – and Ptolemy&apos;s location of two -dava placenames on the lower Vistula river in Poland. [ April 2012 ] The hypothesis of a Dacian occupation of Slovakia during the 1st century BC is contradicted by the archaeological evidence that this region featured a predominantly Celtic culture from ca. 400 BC; [ Bazovski SNM summary ] and of a sophisticated Celtic kingdom based in modern-day Bratislava during the 1st century BC, which issued its own gold and silver coinage (the Biatec coins), which bear the names of several Celtic kings. This kingdom is also evidenced by numerous Celtic-type fortified hill-top settlements (oppida), of which Zemplin is the foremost example in south-east Slovakia. Furthermore, the archaeological Puchov culture, present in Slovakia in this period, is considered Celtic by mainstream scholars [ Bazovski SNM summary ], although Dacian influence, in the form of cultural imports, appears to have increased during the 1st century AD. Some scholars argue that Zemplin was occupied by Burebista&apos;s troops from about 60 BC onwards, but this is based on the presence of Dacian-style artefacts alongside the Celtic ones, which may have been cultural imports. But even if occupation by Dacian troops under Burebista were true, it does not follow that the indigenous population became Dacian-speakers. Karol Pieta&apos;s discussion of the ethnicity of the Puchov people shows that opinion is divided between those who attribute the culture to a Celtic group  – primarily the Cotini  – and those who favour a Germanic group. Despite wide acknowledgement of Dacian influence, there is little support for the view that the people of this region were ethnic Dacians. { Pieta Die Puchov Kultur (1982) pp 204–9 } The hypothesis of a substantial Dacian population in Poland is not widely supported among modern scholars, as this region is generally regarded as inhabited predominantly by Germanic tribes during the early Roman imperial era e.g. Heather (2009). [ Heather 2009 620 (map) ] [ Barrington Atlas 2000 map 19 ] { cf. Tacitus&apos; } { Germania 43: ca. AD 100 } [ Dacian vocabulary ] [ Placenames ] [ Davae ] Onomastic range of the Dacian towns with the dava ending, covering Dacia, Moesia, Thrace and Dalmatia Ptolemy gives a list of 43 names of towns in Dacia, out of which arguably 33 were of Dacian origin. Most of the latter included the suffix ‘dava&apos;, meaning settlement or village. But, other Dacian names from his list lack the suffix, for example Zarmisegethusa regia = Zermizirga, and nine other names of Dacian origin seem to have been Latinised. [ Oltean 2007 114 ] The Dacian linguistic area is characterised mainly with composite names ending in -dava, or variations such as -deva, -daua, -daba, etc. The settlement names ending in these suffixes are geographically grouped as follows: [ April 2012 ] In Dacia: Acidava, Argedava, Argidava, Buridava, Cumidava, Dokidaua, Karsidaua, Klepidaua, Markodaua, Netindaua, Patridaua, Pelendova, *Perburidava, Petrodaua, Piroboridaua, Rhamidaua, Rusidava, Sacidaba, Sangidaua, Setidava, Singidaua, Sykidaba, Tamasidaua, Utidaua, Zargidaua, Ziridava, Zucidaua  – 26 names altogether. In Lower Moesia (the present northern Bulgaria ) and Scythia Minor ( Dobruja ): Aedabe, *Buteridava, *Giridava, Dausdavua, Kapidaua, Murideba, Sacidava, Scaidava (Skedeba), Sagadava, Sukidaua (Sucidava)  – 10 names in total. In Upper Moesia (the present districts of Nish, Sofia, and partly Kjustendil): Aiadaba, Bregedaba, Danedebai, Desudaba, Itadeba, Kuimedaba, Zisnudeba  – 7 names in total. Besides these regions, similar village names are found in three other places: Thermi-daua (Ptolemy), a town in Dalmatia, a Grecised form of *Germidava. This settlement was probably founded by immigrants from Dacia. Gil-doba  – a village in Thrace, of unknown location. Pulpu-deva in Thrace  – today Plovdiv in Bulgaria. A number of Dacian settlements do not have the -dava ending or variant suffix. Some of these are: Acmonia, Aizis, Amutria, Apulon, Arcina, Arcobadara, Arutela, Berzobis, Brucla, Diacum, Dierna, Dinogetia, Drobeta, Egeta, Genucla, Malva (Romula), Napoca, Oescus, Patruissa, Pinon, Potaissa, Ratiaria, Sarmizegetusa, Tapae, Tibiscum, Tirista, Tsierna, Tyrida, Zaldapa, Zeugma and Zurobara. [ April 2012 ] [ Tribal names ] [ List of Dacian tribes ] In the case of Ptolemy&apos;s Dacia, most of the tribal names are similar to those on the list of civitates, with few exceptions. [ Oltean 2007 46 ] Georgiev counts the Triballi, the Moesians and the Dardanians as Daco-Moesians. [ Papazoglu 1978 78 ] [ Georgiev 1981 150 ] [ Plant names ] [ March 2011 ] [ List of Dacian plant names ] { Dioscorides, &apos;&apos;De Materia Medica&apos;&apos;, } { Byzantium, 15th century. } In ancient literary sources, the Dacian names for a number of medicinal plants and herbs survive in ancient texts, including about 60 plant names in Dioscorides. [ Glanville 1998 120 ] The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, of Anazarbus in Asia Minor, wrote the medical textbook De materia medica (Gr. Περί ύλης ιατρικής) in the mid-1st century AD. In Wellmann’s opinion (1913), accepted by Russu (1967), the Dacian plant names were added in the 3rd century AD from a glossary published by the Greek grammarian Pamphilus of Alexandria (1st c. AD). [ Russu 1967 45 ] The Dacian glosses were probably added to the Pseudo-Apuleius texts by the 4th century. The mixture of indigenous Dacian, Latin and Greek words in the lists of Dacian plant names may be explained by a linguistic crossing process occurring in that period. [ Rosetti Graur 1969 315 ] Although many Dacian toponyms have uncertain meanings, they are more reliable as sources of Dacian words than the names of medicinal plants provided by Dioscorides, which have led to speculative identifications: out of 57 plants, 25 identifications may be erroneous, according to Asher &amp; Simpson. [ Asher Simpson 1969 1665 ] According to the Bulgarian linguist Decev, of the 42 supposedly Dacian plant names in Dioscorides only 25 are truly Dacian, while 10 are Latin and 7 Greek. Also, of the 31 &quot; Dacian &quot; plant names recorded by Pseudo-Apuleius, 16 are really Dacian, 9 are Latin and 8 are Greek. [ Rosetti Graur 1969 315 ] Examples of common Dacian, Latin and Greek words in Pseudo-Apuleius : [ Poghirc 1986 348 ] [ Poghirc 1986 348 ] [ Pelletier 1985 81 Campani amolocia Tusci abiana Daci amolusta (Pseudo-Apuleius, 23) ] [ Poghirc 1986 348 ] Dacian blis and Latin blitum (from Greek bliton) ( &quot; purple amaranth &quot; ) Dacian amolusta and Campanian amolocia ( &quot; chamomile &quot; ) Dacian dracontos and Italic dracontes ( &quot; rosemary &quot; ) [ Reconstruction of Dacian words ] [ March 2011 ] [ List of reconstructed Dacian words ] Both Georgiev and Duridanov use the comparative linguistic method to decipher ancient Thracian and Dacian names, respectively. Georgiev (1977) argues that the meaning of an ancient placename in an unknown language can be deciphered by comparing it to its successor-names and to cognate placenames and words in other Indo-European languages, both ancient and modern. Georgiev considers decipherment by analysis of root-words alone to be devoid of scientific value. { Georgiev (1976) 276 } He gives several examples of his methodology, one of which refers to a town and river (a tributary of the Danube) in eastern Romania called Cernavodă, which in Slavic means &quot; black water &quot;. The same town in antiquity was known as Ἀξίοπα (Axiopa) or Ἀξιούπολις (Axioupolis) and its river as the Ἀξιός (Axios). The working assumption is that Axiopa meant &quot; black water &quot; in Dacian, on the basis that Cernavodă is probably a loan-translation of the ancient Dacian name. [ Polome 1982 879 ] According to Georgiev, the likely IE root-word for Axios is *n̥-ks(e)y-no ( &quot; dark, black &quot; cf. Avestan axsaena). [ Georgiev 1981 109 ] On the basis of the known rules of formation of IE composite words, Axiopa would break down as axi = &quot; black &quot; and opa or upa = &quot; water &quot; in Dacian; the -polis element is ignored, as it is a Greek suffix meaning &quot; city &quot;. The assumption is then validated by examining cognate placenames. There was another Balkan river known in antiquity as Axios, which is today called Crna reka (Slavic for &quot; black river &quot; ): although it was in Dardani a (Rep. of Macedonia), a mainly Illyrian-speaking region. Georgiev considers this river-name to be of Daco-Moesian origin. The axi element is also validated by the older Greek name for the Black Sea, Ἄξεινος πόντος  – Axeinos pontos, later altered to the euphemism Εὔξεινος πόντος Euxeinos pontos meaning &quot; Hospitable sea &quot;. The opa/upa element is validated by the Lithuanian cognate upė, meaning &quot; water &quot; ). { Georgiev (1977) 277 } The second component of the town&apos;s name *-upolis may be a diminutive of *upa cf. Lithuanian diminutive upelis. [ Polome 1982 879 ] [ September 2011 ] This etymology was questioned by Russu: Axiopa, a name attested to only in Procopius &apos; De Aedificiis, may be a corrupt form of Axiopolis. { See } [ Russu 1963 131 ] { and } [ Russu 1969 76 ] {. Ἀξιό πλ is an abbreviation for Axiopolis in the manuscripts of De Aedificiis. } However, even if correct, Russu&apos;s objection does not affect the interpretation of the axi- element as meaning &quot; black &quot;. Fraser (1959) noted that the root axio that occurs in the place-name Axiopa is also found in Samothrace and in Sparta, where Athena Axiopoina was worshiped. Therefore, he considers this pre-Greek root to be of Thracian origin, meaning &quot; great &quot;. [ Fraser 1959 28 ] This objection may not be relevant, if Thracian was a separate language to Dacian. Some linguists are sceptical of this reconstruction methodology of Dacian. The phonetic systems of Dacian and Thracian and their evolution are not reconstructed directly from indigenous elements but from their approximative Greek or Latin transcripts. [ Fisher 2003 570 ] [ Polome 1982 885 ] Greek and Latin had no dedicated graphic signs for phonemes such as č, ġ, ž, š and others. Thus, if a Thracian or Dacian word contained such a phoneme, a Greek or Latin transcript would not represent it accurately. [ Paliga 1986 120 ] The etymologies that are adduced to back up the proposed Dacian and Thracian vowel and consonant changes, used for word reconstruction with the comparative method, are open to divergent interpretations because the material is related to placenames, with the exception of Dacian plant names and the limited number of glosses. [ Polome 1982 878 and 879 ] Because of this, there are divergent and even contradictory assumptions for the phonological structure and development of the Dacian and Thracian languages. [ Polome 1982 878 and 879 ] It is doubtful that the Dacian phonological system has been accurately reproduced by Greek or Latin transcripts of indigenous lexica. [ Panayotou 2007 742 ] In the case of personal names, the choice of the etymology is often a matter of compliance with assumed phonological rules. [ Polomé 1982 881 ] Since the geographical aspect of the occurrence of sound changes (i.e. o &gt; a) within Thracian territory, based on the work of V. Georgiev, began to be emphasised by some researchers, the chronological aspect has been somewhat neglected. [ Poghirc 1989 297 ] There are numerous cases where lack of information has obscured the vocalism of these idioms, generating the most contradictory theories. [ Poghirc 1989 306 ] Today, some 3,000 Thraco-Dacian lexical units are known. In the case of the oscillation *o / *a, the total number of words containing it is about 30, many more than the ones cited by both Georgiev and Russu, and the same explanation is not valid for all of them. [ Poghirc 1989 298 ] [ Sound changes from Proto-Indo-European ] Phonologically Dacian is a conservative Indo-European (IE) language. [ September 2011 ] From the remaining fragments, the sound changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Dacian can be grouped as follows: [ September 2011 ] [ Present alternative views: some sound changes below are controversial September 2011 ] [ Short vowels ] PIE *a and *o appear as a. PIE accented *e, appears as ye in open syllable or ya in closed ones. Otherwise, PIE un-accented *e remains e. PIE *i, was preserved in Dacian as i. [ Long vowels ] PIE *ē and *ā appears as *ā PIE *ō was preserved as *ō [ Diphthongs ] PIE *ai was preserved as *ai PIE *oi appears in Dacian as *ai PIE *ei evolution is not well reconstructed yet. It appears to be preserved to ei or that already passed to i. PIE *wa was preserved as *wa. PIE *wo appears as *wa. PIE *we was preserved as *we. PIE *wy appears as *vi. PIE *aw was preserved as *aw. PIE *ow appears as *aw. PIE *ew was preserved as *ew. [ Consonants ] Like many IE stocks it has merged the two series of voiced stops. Both *d and *dh became d, Both *g and *gh became g Both *b and *bh became b PIE *ḱ passed to ts PIE *ǵ passed to dz PIE *kʷ when followed by e, i passed to c^ (like in English chart) Otherwise passed to k. Same fate for PIE cluster *kw. PIE *gʷ and *gʷh when followed by e or i passed to g^ Otherwise passed to g. Same fate for PIE cluster *gw PIE *m, *n, *p, *r, *l were preserved. Note: In the course of the diachronic development of Dacian, a palatalisation of k and g appears to have occurred before front vowels according to the following process [ Polome E. C. Boardman John The Cambridge ancient history London, Cambridge University Press, 1970–2001. 978-0-521-22496-3 20e ] k &gt; [kj] &gt; [tj] &gt; [t∫] ~ [ts] {ts} or {tz} &gt; [s] ~ [z] {z} e.g.:*ker(s)na is reflected by Tierna (Tabula Peutingeriana) Dierna (in inscriptions and Ptolemy), *Tsierna in station Tsiernen[sis], AD 157, Zernae (notitia Dignitatum), (colonia) Zernensis (Ulpian) g &gt; [gj] &gt; [dj] &gt; [dz] ~ &gt; [z] {z} e.g.:Germisara appears as Γερμιζερα, with the variants Ζερμιζίργα, Ζερμίζιργα [ Linguistic classification ] Dacian was an Indo-European language (IE). Russu (1967, 1969 and 1970) suggested that its phonological system, and therefore that of its presumed Thraco-Dacian parent-language, was relatively close to the primitive IE system. [ Vraciu 1974 283 ] Several linguists classify Dacian as a satem IE language: Russu [ Polome 1982 878 ], Radulescu (1987), [ Radulescu 1987 243 ], Katicic (1976) and Krizman (1976). [ Katicic Krizman 1976 150 ] In Crossland’s opinion (1982), both Thracian and Dacian feature one of the main satem characteristics, the change of Indo-European *k and *g to s and z. But the other characteristic satem changes are doubtful in Thracian and are not evidenced in Dacian. [ Crossland 1982 848 ] In any case, the satem/centum distinction, once regarded as a fundamental division between IE languages, is no longer considered significant in historical linguistics by mainstream scholars. [ Renfrew 1990 190 ] It is now recognised that it is only one of many isogloss es in the IE zone; that languages can exhibit both types at the same time, and that these may change over time. In other words, the isogloss is worthless as a tool to determine the genetic descent of IE languages. [ April 2012 ] There is much controversy about the place of Dacian in the IE evolutionary tree. According to a dated view, Dacian derived from a Daco-Thraco-Phrygian (or &quot; Paleo-Balkan &quot; ) branch of IE. Today, the Phrygian is no longer widely seen as linked in this way to Dacian and Thracian. [ April 2012 ] In contrast, the hypothesis of a Thraco-Dacian or Daco-Thracian branch of IE, indicating a close link between the Thracian and Dacian languages, has numerous adherents, including Russu 1967 [ Rădulescu 1987 243 ], Georg Solta 1980 [ Rosetti 1982 5 ], Vraciu 1980 [ Rădulescu 1984 85 &quot; Russu&apos;s conviction about the existence of a &apos;Thraco-Dacian Language&apos;, shared by Crossland and by Vraciu (1980) and the reservations expressed by Polome and Katicic (see above) are thus fully justified &quot; ], Crossland 1982 [ Crossland 1982 838 &quot; V. I. Georgiev (1977) has claimed in addition that names from the Dacian and Mysian areas approximately Roman Dacia and Moesia) show different and generally less extensive changes in Indo-European consonants and vowels than do those found in Thrace itself. The evidence seems to indicate divergence of a &apos;Thraco-Dacian&apos; language into northern and southern groups of dialects, not so different as to rank as separate languages, with the development of special tendencies in word formation and of certain secondary phonetic features in each group &quot; ], Radulescu 1984 [ Rădulescu 1984 85 &quot; Georgiev had the merit to state that Daco-Moesian possesses a certain degree of dialectal individuality, but the data presented here clearly label as wrong any theory which claims a more profound separation between Daco-Moesian and Thracian proper, even if Daco-Moesian proves to be more closely related to Illyrian than to Thracian or, as it seems more likely to be the case, if we will eventually have to conclude that we deal with three different different dialects of the same language &quot; ], 1987 [ Rădulescu 1987 243 &quot; Russu defended two important theses: 1) the close relationship between Daco-Moesian and Thracian (the title of his book is The language of the Thraco- Dacians), and 2) the nonexistence of a “consonantal shift” in Thracian, contrasting it with Daco-Mysian, firmly supporting the position that, in both dialects, the IE *MA and M merged into M and the *T remained unmodified &quot; ]. Mihailov (2008) and Trask 2000 [ Trask 2000 343 &quot;...Thracian An extinct and poorly known Indo-European language of ancient Bulgaria and Romania. Its slightly distinct northern variety is sometimes distinguished as Dacian, in which case the label Daco-Thracian is applied to the whole complex... &quot; ]. The Daco-Thracian theory is ultimately based on the testimony of several Greco-Roman authors: most notably the Roman imperial-era historian and geographer Strabo, who states that the Dacians, Getae, Moesians and Thracians all spoke the same language. { Strabo Geographica VII.3.2, 3.13 } Herodotus states that &quot; the Getae are the bravest and the most just amongst the Thracians &quot;, linking the Getae, and thus the Dacians, with the Thracians. [ Mihailov 2008 598 ] Some scholars also see support for a close link between the Thracian and Dacian languages in the works of Cassius Dio, Trogus Pompeius, Appian and Pliny the Elder. [ Bolovan Treptow 1997 10 ] But the Daco-Thracian theory has been challenged since the 1960s by the Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev and his followers. Georgiev argues, on phonetic, lexical and toponymic grounds, that Thracian, Dacian and Phrygian were completely different languages, each a separate branch of IE, and that no Daco-Thraco-Phrygian or Daco-Thracian branches of IE ever existed. [ Georgiev 1977 282 ] Georgiev argues that the distance between Dacian and Thracian was approximately the same as that between the Armenian and Persian languages [ Georgiev 1977 298 ], which are completely different languages. In elaborating the phonology of Dacian, Georgiev uses plant-names attested to in Dioscorides and Pseudo-Apuleius, ascertaining their literal meanings, and hence their etymology, using the Greek translations provided by those authors. The phonology of Dacian produced in this way is very different from that of Thracian; the vowel change IE *o &gt; * a recurs and the k-sounds undergo the changes characteristic of the satem languages. [ Poultney 1968 338 ] For the phonology of Thracian, Georgiev uses the principle that an intelligible placename in a modern language is likely to be a translation of an ancient name. [ Poultney 1968 338 ] Georgiev (1977) also argues that the modern Albanian language is descended from Dacian, specifically from what he called Daco-Moesian or Daco-Mysian, the Moesian dialect of Dacian. [ Georgiev 1977 283 ] But this view has not gained wide acceptance among scholars and is rejected by most Albanian linguists, who consider that Albanian belongs to the Illyrian branch of IE. (Ref: Lloshi, 1999, p283). Polome accepts the view that Albanian is descended from Illyrian but considers the evidence inconclusive. [ Polome 1982 888 ] [ Relationship with ancient languages ] [ Thracian ] [ Thraco-Dacian Thracian language Classification of Thracian ] There is general agreement among scholars that Dacian and Thracian were Indo-European languages; however, widely divergent views exist about their relationship: [ Mihailov 2008 598 ] [ Trask 2000 343 ] [ Encyclopædia Britannica 1993 645 ] [ Trask 2000 343 ] [ Shashi 1992 107 ] [ Academic American encyclopedia 1994 198 ] [ Georgiev 1977 282 ] [ Duridanov 1969 100 ] Dacian was a northern dialect or a slightly distinct variety of the Thracian language. Alternatively, Thracian was a southern dialect of Dacian which developed relatively late. Linguists use the term Daco-Thracian or Thraco-Dacian to denote this presumed Dacian and Thracian common language. On this view, these dialects may have possessed a high degree of mutual intelligibility. Dacian and Thracian were distinct but related languages, descended from a hypothetical Daco-Thracian branch of Indo-European. One suggestion is that the Dacian differentiation from Thracian may have taken place after 1500 BC. In this scenario, the two languages may have possessed only limited mutual intelligibility. Dacian and Thracian were not related, constituting separate branches of IE. However, they shared a large number of words, which were mutual borrowings due to long-term geographical proximity. Nevertheless, they would not have been mutually intelligible. Georgiev (1977) and Duridanov (1985) argue that the phonetic development from proto-Indo-European of the two languages was clearly divergent.

[ Georgiev 1977 282 ] [ Duridanov 1985 ] However, the validity of this conclusion has been challenged due to a fundamental weakness in the source-material for sound-change reconstruction. Since the ancient Balkan languages never developed their own alphabets, ancient Balkan linguistic elements (mainly placenames and personal names) are known through their Greek or Latin transcripts. [ Fisher 2003 570 ] [ Polome 1982 885 ] These may not accurately reproduce the indigenous sounds e.g. Greek and Latin had no dedicated graphic signs for phonemes such as č, ġ, ž, š and others. Thus, if a Thracian or Dacian word contained such a phoneme, a Greek or Latin transcript would not represent it accurately. [ Paliga 1986 120 ] Because of this, there are divergent and even contradictory assumptions for the phonological structure and development of the Dacian and Thracian languages. [ Polome 1982 878 and 879 ] This can be seen from the different sound-changes proposed by Georgiev and Duridanov, reproduced above, even these scholars agree that Thracian and Dacian were different languages. Also, some sound-changes proposed by Georgiev have been disputed e.g. that IE *t became Thracian ta, and *m = t: it has been argued that in both languages IE *ma fused into m and that *t remained unchanged. [ Radulescu 1987 243 ] Georgiev&apos;s claim that IE *o mutated into a in Thracian, has been disputed by Russu. [ Radulescu 1984 78 ] A comparison of Georgiev&apos;s and Duridanov&apos;s reconstructed words with the same meaning in the two languages shows that, although they shared some words, many words were different. [ Georgiev 1977 280, p=285 and p=298 ] However, even if such reconstructions are accepted as valid, an insufficient quantity of words have been reconstructed in each language to establish that they were unrelated. [ April 2012 ] According to Georgiev (1977), Dacian placenames and personal names are completely different from their Thracian counterparts. [ Georgiev 1977 298 ] However, Tomaschek (1883) and Mateescu (1923) argue that some common elements exist in Dacian and Thracian placenames and personal names. [ Tomaschek 1883 402 ] [ Rosetti 1978 220 ] But Polomé considered that research had, by 1982, confirmed Georgiev&apos;s claim of a clear onomastic divide between Thrace and Moesia/Dacia. [ Polome 1982 876 ] Georgiev highlighted a striking divergence between placename-suffixes in Dacia/Moesia and Thrace: Daco-Moesian placenames generally carry the suffix -dava (variants: -daba, -deva), meaning &quot; town &quot; or &quot; stronghold &quot;. But placenames in Thrace proper, i.e. south of the Balkan mountains commonly end in -para or -pera, meaning &quot; village &quot; or &quot; settlement &quot; [ Polome 1982 872 ] (cf Sanskrit pura = &quot; town &quot;, from which derives Hindi town-suffix -pur e.g. Udaipur = &quot; city of Udai &quot; ). [ Georgiev 1977 p. 191 (map) ] [ Georgiev 1977 279 ] [ Bynon 1974 271-3 ]. Map showing -dava/-para divide Georgiev argues that such toponymic divergence renders the notion that Thracian and Dacian were the same language implausible. However, this thesis has been challenged on a number of grounds: [ Papazoglu 1978 79 ] [ Tacheva 1997 200 ] [ Georgiev 1977 p. 191 (map) ] [ Fisher 2003 570 ] [ Papazoglu 1978 79 &quot;... To explain the appearance of Desudaba and Pulpudeva on Thracian territory we must suppose that word dava was understandable to the Thracians although they used it infrequently. It is quite common thing in the same linguistic area to find that one type of place-name appears more frequently, or even exclusively in one district, another in another... &quot; ] [ Georgiev 1977 191 ] [ Georgiev 1977 279 ] [ Georgiev 1977 191 ] Papazoglu (1978) and Tacheva (1997) reject the argument that such different placename-suffixes imply different languages (although, in general historical linguistics, changes in placename-suffixes are regarded as potentially strong evidence of changes in prevalent language). A particular objection is that, in 2 regions of Thrace, -para is not the standard suffix: in NE Thrace, placenames commonly end in -bria ( &quot; town &quot; ), while in SE Thrace, -diza/-dizos ( &quot; stronghold &quot; ) is the most common ending. Following Georgiev&apos;s logic, this would indicate that these regions spoke a language different than Thracian. But there is no evidence that this was the case. If, on the other hand, the different endings were due simply to Thracian regional dialectal variations, the same could be true of the dava/para divide. Papazoglu (1978) and Fisher (2003) point out that that two -dava placenames are found in Thrace proper, in contravention of Georgiev&apos;s placename divide: Pulpudeva and Desudaba. However, according to Georgiev (1977), east of a line formed by the Nestos and Uskur rivers, the traditional western boundary of Thrace proper, Pulpudeva is the only known -dava-type placename, and Georgiev argues that it is not linguistically significant, as it was an extraneous and late foundation by the Macedonian king Philip II ( Philippopolis ) and its -dava name a Moesian import. The dava/para divide appears to break down West of the Nestos-Uskur line, where -dava placenames, including Desudaba, are intermingled with -para names. However, this does not necessarily invalidate Georgiev&apos;s thesis, as this region was the border-zone between the Roman provinces of Moesia Superior and Thracia and the mixed placename suffixes may reflect a mixed Thracian/Moesian population. Georgiev&apos;s thesis has by no means achieved general acceptance: the Thraco-Dacian theory retains substantial support among linguists. Crossland (1982) considers that the divergence of a presumed original Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects is not so significant as to rank them as separate languages. [ Crossland 1982 838 ] According to Georg Solta (1982), there is no significant difference between Dacian and Thracian. [ Fisher 2003 570 ] [ Rosetti 1982 5 &quot; Solta montre qu’il n’y a pas de difference entre le thrace et le dace &quot; ] Radulescu (1984) accepts that Daco-Moesian possesses a certain degree of dialectal individuality, but argues that there is no fundamental separation between Daco-Moesian and Thracian. [ Radulescu 1984 85 ] Renfrew (1990) argues that there is no doubt that Thracian is related to the Dacian which was spoken in modern-day Romania before that area was occupied by the Romans. [ Renfrew 1990 71 ] Polomé (1982) considers that the evidence presented by Georgiev and Duridanov, although substantial, is not sufficient to determine whether Daco-Moesian and Thracian were two dialects of the same language or two distinct languages. [ Polomé 1982 887–888 ] [ Moesian ] [ Moesi Moesia Dacia Aureliana ] The ethnonym Moesi was used within the lands alongside the Danube river, in north-western Thrace. As analysed by some modern scholars, the ancient authors used the name Moesi speculatively to designate Triballians and also Getic and Dacian communities. [ Theodossiev 2000 88 ] [ Illyrian ] [ Illyrian language Thraco-Illyrian ] It is possible that Illyrian, Dacian and Thracian were three dialects of the same language, according to Radulescu. [ Rădulescu 1984 85 ] Georgiev (1966), however, considers Illyrian a language closely related to Venetic and Phrygian but with a certain Daco-Moesian admixture. [ Poultney 1966 339 ] Venetic and Phrygian are considered centum languages, and this may mean that Georgiev, like many other paleolinguists, viewed Illyrian as probably being a centum language [ September 2011 ] with Daco-Moesian admixture. Georgiev proposed that Albanian, a satemised language, developed from Daco-Moesian, a satemised language group, and not from Illyrian. But lack of evidence prevents any firm centum/satem classification for these ancient languages. Renfrew argues that the centum/satem classification is irrelevant in determining relationships between languages. This is because a language may contain both satem and centum features and these, and the balance between them, may change over time. [ Renfrew 1990 190 ] Mainstream scholarship rejects Georgiev&apos;s theory and considers Albanian to be a direct descendant of Illyrian. [ Lloshi 1999 283 ] If this thesis represents the objective reality, the marked grammatical and lexical similarities between Albanian and Romanian, e.g. the post-posited definite article, may imply that Illyrian, rather than Dacian, forms the main substratum of Romanian. This thesis would lend support to the view that proto-Romanian was a Latin dialect which developed south of the Danube, in the Illyrian-speaking part of Moesia Superior or somewhere in Illlyria itself, and which was not introduced into Dacia until relatively late, during the medieval era. [ April 2012 ] [ Bactrian ] [ March 2011 ] [ Bactrian language ] Tomaschek (1883) considers that etymologies proposed for Dacian names, toponyms and plant names are better explained by the Aryan language dialects, specifically the Indian language and the Bactrian language. [ Tomaschek 1883 400 ] [ Outdated scholarship September 2011 ] [ Gothic ] [ July 2011 ] [ Gothic language ] There was a well-established tradition in the 4th century that the Getae, believed to be Dacians by mainstream scholarship, and the Gothi were the same people e.g. Orosius: Getae illi qui et nunc Gothi. This identification, now discredited, was supported by Jacob Grimm. [ Momigliano 1984 216 ] In pursuit of his hypothesis, Grimm proposed many kindred features between the Getae and Germanic tribes. [ Hehn 1976 428 ] [ Outdated scholarship September 2011 ] [ Celtic ] [ July 2011 ] Among the Dacian plant names, the only two that can be identified, propedula (cinquefoil) and dyn (nettle) are purely Celtic, according to Hehn. [ Hehn 1976 428 ] [ Slavic ] [ July 2011 ] [ Slavic language ] An analogy between the Getic (Dacian) and Slavic languages was recognised by Mullenhof. [ Hehn 1976 428 ] [ Relationship with modern languages ] [ Romanian ] [ List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin ] The mainstream view among scholars is that Daco-Moesian forms the principal linguistic substratum of modern Romanian, a neo-Latin ( Romance ) language, which evolved from eastern Balkan Romance in the period AD 300–600, according to Georgiev. The possible residual influence of Daco-Moesian on modern Romanian is limited to a modest number of words and a few grammatical peculiarities. { cf. Georgiev (1977) pp } According to Georgiev (1981), in Romanian there are about 70 words which have exact correspondences in Albanian, but the phonetic form of these Romanian words is so specific that they cannot be explained as Albanian borrowings. These words belong to the Dacian substratum in Romanian, while their Albanian correspondences were inherited from Daco-Moesian. [ Georgiev 1981 142 ] As in the case of any Romance language, it is argued that Romanian language derived from Vulgar Latin through a series of internal linguistic changes and because of Dacian or northern Thracian influences on Vulgar Latin in the late Roman era. This influence explains a number of differences between Romanian -Thracian substrate-, French -Celtic substrate-, Spanish -Basque substratum-, Portuguese -Celtic substrate ?- [ Appel and Pieter Muysken René Language Contact and Bilangualism (Amsterdam University Press  – Amsterdam Archaeological Studies) 2006 Amsterdam University Press Amsterdam 90-5356-857-3 ] Romanian has no major dialects, probably a reflection of its origin in a small mountain region, which was inaccessible but permitted easy internal communication. The origin of Romanian is based on speculation because there are virtually no written records of the area from the time of the withdrawal of the Romans around 300 AD until the end of the barbarian invasions around 1300 AD. [ Walters Garrison The other Europe: Eastern Europe to 1945 1988 Syracuse University Press Syracuse, N.Y. 0-8156-2440-9 18 ] [ Substratum of Proto-Romanian ] [ Eastern Romance substratum ] [ Daco-Romanian Daco-Romanian continuity Thraco-Roman ] { Roman Empire. Red = area populated by Free Dacians. Language map based on the range of Dacian toponyms. } The Romanian language has been denoted &quot; Daco-Romanian &quot; by some scholars because it derives from late Latin superimposed on a Dacian substratum, and evolved in the Roman colony of Dacia between AD 106 and 275. [ Campbell George Frederick Concise compendium of the world&apos;s languages 1998 Routledge London 0-415-16049-9 ] Modern Romanian may contain 160–170 words of Dacian origin. By comparison, modern French, according to Bulei, has approximately 180 words of Celtic origin. [ Bulei 2005 26 ] The Celtic origin of French is certain, as the Celtic languages are abundantly documented, whereas the Dacian origin of Romanian is in most cases speculative. It is also argued that the Dacian language may form the substratum of the Proto-Romanian language, which developed from the Vulgar Latin spoken in the Balkans north of the Jirecek line, which roughly divides Latin influence from Greek influence. About 300 words in Eastern Romance languages, Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, may derive from Dacian, and many of these show a satem-reflex. [ September 2011 ] Whether Dacian forms the substratum of Proto-Romanian is disputed, yet this theory does not rely only on the Romanisation having occurred in Roman Dacia, as Dacian was also spoken in Moesia and northern Dardania. Moesia was conquered by the Romans more than a century before Dacia, and its Latinity is confirmed by Christian sources. [ Polome Edgar C. 1983 Linguistic situation in the western provincesin Sprache Und Literatur (Sprachen Und Schriften) 978-3-11-009525-8 Walter de Gruyter 539 ] { Jireček Line, an imaginary line through the ancient } { Balkans that divided the influences of the } { Latin (in the north) and } { Greek (in the south) languages until the 4th century. This line is important in establishing the Romanization area in Balkans } The Dacian / Thracian substratum of Romanian is often connected to the words shared between Romanian and Albanian. The correspondences between these languages reflect a common linguistic background. [ Polome Edgar C. 1983 Linguistic situation in the western provincesin Sprache Und Literatur (Sprachen Und Schriften) 978-3-11-009525-8 Walter de Gruyter 540 ] Russu sees the Romanian language as a completely Romanised Daco-Moesian language, whereas Albanian is a partly Romanised Daco-Moesian language. However, Dacian and Illyrian may have been more similar than most linguists believe, according to Van Antwerp Fine. { Van Antwerp Fine, John (2000) 11 } [ Albanian ] [ Origin of the Albanians Albanian language ] Russu asserts a Thraco-Dacian origin for the pre-Roman lexical items shared by Albanian and Romanian. He argues that the Albanians descend from the Carpi, which he considers a tribe of Free Dacians. { Madgearu, Gordon (2007) } By rejecting the thesis of Illyrian- Albanian identification, Georgiev concludes that the Albanians originated in modern-day Romania or Serbia and that their language developed during the 4th to 6th centuries, when proto-Romanian appeared. Georgiev further suggested that Daco-Moesian is the ancestor of modern Albanian, based on the phonologies of the two languages. Based on certain marked lexical and grammatical affinities between Albanian and Romanian, he also suggested proto-Albanian speakers migrated from Dardania into the region where Albanian is spoken today. { Georgiev (1977) 283 } However, this theory is rejected by most Albanian linguists, who consider Albanian a direct descendant of ancient Illyrian. { Lloshi (1999) p. 283 } Polomé supports this view on balance, but considers the evidence inconclusive. { Polomé (1982) 888 } Other linguists argue that Albanian is a direct descendant of the language of the Bessi, a Thracian tribe that lived in the Rhodope Mountains. [ 152 &lt; /ref &gt; Witczak 1994 25 ] [ Baltic languages ] A number of scholars have pointed to the many close parallels between Dacian and Thracian placenames and those of the Baltic language-zone  – Lithuania, Latvia and East Prussia  – where an extinct but well-documented Baltic language, Old Prussian, was spoken until it was displaced by German during the Middle Ages. { Duridanov (1969) 9-11 } These parallels have enabled linguists to decipher many Dacian and Thracian placenames. Of the 74 Dacian placenames analysed by Duridanov in his 1969 essay, a total of 62 have Baltic cognates, most of which were rated &quot; certain &quot; by Duridanov. { Duridanov (1969) 95-6 } Duridanov suggests that proto-Dacian and proto-Thracian speakers were in close geographical proximity with proto-Baltic speakers for a prolonged period, perhaps during the period 3000–2000 BC. { Duridanov (1969) 100 } Mayer ventures further, suggesting that Dacian and Thracian were what he terms &quot; southern pre-Baltoidic &quot; languages, meaning either proto-Baltic or its close descendants. { Mayer (1992) } The partially satem characteristics of Thracian and Dacian and their similarities to the Baltic group suggest that an ancestral Thraco-Dacian people was settled in Dacia until some migrated into Thrace, according to Crossland. { Crossland (1982) 849 } [ April 2012 ] [ Fringe theories ] Another theory maintains that the Dacians spoke a Latin language and that people who settled the Italian Peninsula shared the same ancestors, but no ancient texts support this idea. The Romanian philologist Nicolae Densuşianu argued in his book Dacia Preistorică (Prehistoric Dacia) that Latin and Dacian were the same language or were mutually intelligible. His work was considered by mainstream linguists to be pseudoscience but it was revived by the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime, which encouraged an ideology called Protochronism, and hypothesised that the Dacians played an important part in the creation of the modern Romanian people. [ April 2012 ] The first article to revive Densuşianu&apos;s theory was an unsigned article named &quot; The Beginnings of the History of the Romanian People &quot; published in Anale de istorie, { Anale de istorie, 4th issue (1976) } a journal published by the Romanian Communist Party &apos;s &quot; Institute of History of the Party &quot;. [ Lucian_Boia Lucian Boia History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness &quot; Central European University Press &quot; 2001 103–105 963-9116-97-1 ] The article claims that the Thracian language was a pre-Romance or Latin language; it used a demonstration which Lucian Boia describes as &quot; a lack of basic professionalism and a straightforward contempt for the truth &quot;. Arguments used in the article include the lack of interpreters between the Dacians and the Romans, as depicted on the bas-reliefs of Trajan&apos;s column. The bibliography includes, apart from Densuşianu, the work of a French academician Louis Armand, an engineer, who allegedly showed that &quot; the Thraco-Dacians spoke a pre-Romance language &quot;. Similar arguments are found in Iosif Constantin Drăgan &apos;s We, the Thracians (1976). Similar theories about latinity of Dacian were found in: Sextus Rufus (Breviarum C.VIII, cf. Bocking Not, Dign. II, 6) in Ovid (Trist. II, 188–189) and in Horace (Odes, I, 20) This article prompted more research on the history of Dacia, and Ion Horaţiu Crişan wrote &quot; Burebista and His Age &quot; (1975). Some writers claimed there was a need to reconstruct the language and for the creation of a Dacian Language department at the University of Bucharest, but such proposals failed because of the lack of the object of study. After the 1989 Romanian Revolution, Drăgan and the New York City -based physician Napoleon Săvescu continued to support this theory and published a book named We are not Rome&apos;s Descendents. [ Napoleon Săvescu http://www.dacia.org/carte Noi nu suntem urmaşii Romei ] They also published a magazine called Noi, Dacii ( &quot; Us Dacians &quot; ) and organised a yearly &quot; International Congress of Dacology &quot;.

From the earliest times that they are attested, Dacians lived on both sides of Danube [ http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7C%2A.html Strabo Geography, Book VII, Chapter 3 2011-01-29 ] { Dio Cassius LI, 22, 6 } and on both sides of the Carpathians, evidenced by the northern Dacian town Setidava. It is unclear exactly when the Dacian language became extinct, or whether it has a living descendant. The first Roman conquest of part of Dacia did not extinguish the language, as Free Dacian tribes may have continued to speak Dacian in the area north-east of the Carpathians as late as the 6th or 7th century AD. [ September 2011 ] According to one hypothesis, a branch of Dacian continued as the Albanian language ( Hasdeu, 1901). Another hypothesis (Marius) considers Albanian to be a Daco-Moesian dialect that split off from Dacian before 300 BC and that Dacian itself became extinct. [ April 2012 ] However, mainstream scholarship considers Albanian to be a descendant of the Illyrian language and not a dialect of Dacian. [ Polome 1982 888 ] In this scenario, Albanian/Romanian cognates are either Daco-Moesian loanwords acquired by Albanian, or, more likely, Illyrian loanwords acquired by Romanian. [ April 2012 ] The argument for a split before 300 BC is that inherited Albanian words (e.g. Alb motër &apos;sister&apos; &lt; Late IE ma:ter &apos;mother&apos;) show the transformation Late IE /a:/ &gt; Alb /o/, but all the Latin loans in Albanian having an /a:/ show Latin a: &gt; Alb a. This indicates that the transformation PAlb /a:/ &gt; PAlb /o/ happened and ended before the Roman arrival in the Balkans. However, Romanian substratum words shared with Albanian show a Romanian /a/ that corresponds to an Albanian /o/ when the source of both sounds is an original common /a:/ (mazăre / modhull &lt; *ma:dzula &apos;pea&apos;, raţă / rosë &lt; *ra:tya: &apos;duck&apos;), indicating that when these words had the same common form in Pre-Romanian and Proto-Albanian, the transformation PAlb /a:/ &gt; PAlb /o/ had not yet begun. [ September 2011 ] The correlation between these two theories indicates that the hypothetical split between the pre-Roman Dacians, who were later Romanised, and Proto-Albanian happened before the Romans arrived in the Balkans. [ September 2011 ] [ Extinction ] According to Georgiev, Daco-Moesian was replaced by Latin as the everyday language in some parts of the two Moesias during the Roman imperial era, but in others, for instance Dardania in modern-day southern Serbia and the northern Macedonian Republic, Daco-Moesian remained dominant, although heavily influenced by eastern Balkan Latin. The language may have survived in remote areas until the 6th century. [ Du Nay 1977 262 ] Thracian, also supplanted by Latin, and by Greek in its southern zone, is documented as a living language in approximately 500 AD. { Jones (1964) 998 } [ See also ] List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin List of Dacian names List of Dacian plant names List of reconstructed Dacian words List of Dacian towns List of Dacian kings Megleno-Romanian language Thracian language Thraco-Roman Paleo-Balkan languages Phrygian language Scythian languages Davae List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia [ Notes ] [ 3 ] [ References ] [ Ancient ] [ harv Pliny (the Elder) Natural history Volume 2, Issues 3–7 77–79 AD Harvard University Press 2000 ] Ammianus Marcellinus Res Gestae (ca. 395) Dioscorides De Materia Medica (ca.
