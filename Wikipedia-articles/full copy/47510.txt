A sky filled with many types of cirrus clouds accompanied by cirrocumulus upper centre and upper right Cirrus clouds ( cloud classification symbol: Ci) are a genus of atmospheric clouds generally characterized by thin, wispy strands, giving them their name from the Latin word cirrus meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair. [ Cirrus Clouds http://chalk.richmond.edu/education/projects/webunits/weather/cirrus.html Clouds University of Richmond 29 January 2011 ] [ March 2012 H3llBot ] [ Funk Ted Cloud Classifications and Characteristics http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/soo/docu/cloudchart.pdf The Science Corner National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 30 January 2011 PDF 1 ] The strands of cloud sometimes appear in tufts of a distinctive form referred to by the common name of mares&apos; tails. [ http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wcirrus.htm USA Today: Cirrus Clouds Palmer Chad 13 September 2008 USA Today 16 October 2005 ] Cirrus clouds generally appear white or light grey in color. They form when water vapor undergoes deposition at altitudes above [ 16500 ft m flip on ] in temperate regions and above [ 20000 ft m flip on ] in tropical regions. They also form from the outflow of tropical cyclone s or the anvils of cumulonimbus cloud s. Since these cirrus clouds arrive in advance of the frontal system or tropical cyclone, they indicate that the weather conditions may soon deteriorate. While they indicate the arrival of precipitation (rain), cirrus clouds themselves produce only fall streak s (falling ice crystals that evaporate before landing on the ground). Jet stream -powered cirrus clouds can grow long enough to stretch across continents, but they remain only a few kilometers deep. [ Dowling Radke 1990 974 ] When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus clouds, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dog s and haloes. Cirrus clouds are known to raise the temperature of the air beneath them by an average of 10  °C (18  °F). When they become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water. Cirrus clouds form on other planets, including Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and possibly Neptune. They have even been seen on Titan, one of Saturn&apos;s moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar cloud s composed of sub- micrometer sized dust grains. [ Description ] Cirrus clouds merging to cirrocumulus clouds Cirrus clouds range in thickness from [ 100 m ft on 2 ] to [ 8000 m ft on ], with an average thickness of [ 1500 m ft on ]. There are, on average, 30   ice crystals per liter (96  ice crystals per gallon ), but this ranges from one ice crystal per 10,000 liters (3.7  ice crystals per 10,000 gallons) to 10,000 ice crystals per liter (37,000 ice crystals per gallon), a difference of eight orders of magnitude. The length of each of these ice crystals is usually 0.25  millimeters long, [ Dowling Radke 1990 977 ] but they range from as short as 0.01  millimeters or as long as several millimeters. The ice crystals in contrail s are much smaller than those in naturally-occurring cirrus clouds, as they are around 0.001  millimeters to 0.1  millimeters in length. Cirrus clouds can vary in temperature from [ -20 C F on on ] to [ -30 C F on ]. [ McGraw-Hill Editorial Staff 2005 1 ] The ice crystals in cirrus clouds have different shapes in addition to different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the ice crystals is determined by the air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to be at the top of the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus clouds tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal. Fall streaks in a cirrus cloud Scientists have studied the characteristics of cirrus using several different methods. One, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), gives highly accurate information on the cloud&apos;s altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried hygrometer s give information on the humidity of the cirrus clouds, but are not accurate enough to measure the depth of the cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. [ Dowling Radke 1990 971 ] Another data source is satellite measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. [ Dowling Radke 1990 972 ] The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration &apos;s (NASA) MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cloud cover by detecting the Earth&apos;s infrared emissions. The clouds reflect this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the &quot; shadow &quot; it casts into space. [ Cirrus Cloud Detection http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/sat_training/nexsat/cirrus/NexSat_Cirrus.pdf Satellite Product Tutorials NASA (NexSat) 29 January 2011 PDF 2, 3, &amp; 5 ] Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds. &apos;&apos;Cirrus fibratus&apos;&apos; clouds Based upon data taken from the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The researchers found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, with an average of 23% of the United States&apos; land area covered by cirrus clouds. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth&apos;s surface. In the tropical regions, these clouds cover around 70% of the region&apos;s surface area. Many cirrus clouds produce hair-like filaments, similar to the virga produced in liquid–water clouds, called fall streaks, and they are made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the clouds. The sizes and shapes of fall streaks are determined by the wind shear. [ Cirrus Clouds: Thin and Wispy http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cld/cldtyp/hgh/crs.rxml Cloud Types Department of Atmospheric Sciences at University of Illinois 29 January 2011 ] The &apos;&apos;cirrus uncinus&apos;&apos; subform of cirrus clouds Cirrus clouds come in five distinct species; Cirrus castellanus, cirrus fibratus, cirrus radiatus, cirrus spissatus, and cirrus uncinus; which are each divided into four varieties: Cirrus intortus, cirrus vertebratus, cirrus radiatus, and cirrus duplicatus. [ http://www.clouds-online.com/cloud_atlas/cirrus/cirrus.htm Cirrus – Clouds Online 20 March 2012 ] Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and is the most common cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare&apos;s tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear. [ Audubon 2000 446 ] [ Formation ] Cirrus clouds are formed when water vapor undergoes deposition at high altitudes where the atmospheric pressure ranges from 600   mbar at [ 4000 m ft on ] above sea level to 200  mbar at [ 12000 m ft on ] above sea level. [ Dowling Radke 1990 973 ] These conditions commonly occur at the leading edge of a warm front. Because humidity is low at such high altitudes, these clouds tend to be very thin. [ Cyclones ] { Hurricane Isabel } Cirrus clouds form from tropical cyclones, and they are commonly seen fanning out from the eyewalls of hurricane s. A large shield of cirrus and cirrostratus typically accompanies the high altitude outflow of hurricanes or typhoon s, and these can make the underlying rain band s —and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs. [ http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/sat_training/tropical_cyclones/ssmi/composite/index.html Tropical Cyclone SSMI – Composite Tutorial United States Navy 18 February 2011 ] [ Thunderstorms ] Cirrus clouds in an anvil cloud Thunderstorm s form dense cirrus often in the shape of anvils. As the cumulonimbus cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze when the air temperature reaches the freezing point. [ Lydolph 1985 122 ] The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. [ Grenci Nese 2001 212 ] In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus clouds from their anvils. [ Computer-simulated Thunderstorms with Ice Clouds Reveal Insights for Next-generation Computer Models http://www.pnl.gov/science/highlights/highlight.asp?id%3D709 Atmospheric Sciences &amp; Global Change Division Research Highlights Pacific Northwest National Laboratory 30 January 2011 42 December 2009 http://www.webcitation.org/60P8FdqAp 24 July 2011 ] High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers. Cirrus clouds also are the remnant anvil clouds of thunderstorms. In the dissipating stage of a cumulonimbus cloud, when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated, the mat of cirrus in the anvil is all that is left. [ Grenci Nese 2001 213 ] [ Contrails ] Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles, which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, [ http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/apr/HQ_04140_clouds_climate.html National Aeronautics and Space Administration Clouds Caused By Aircraft Exhaust May Warm The U.S. Climate 27 April 2004 Gretchen Cook-Anderson Chris Rink Julia Cole 24 June 2011 ] and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing number of cirrus clouds. [ Minnis Ayers Palikonda Phan 2004 1671 ] [ Use in forecasting ] [ Weather forecasting Tropical cyclone track forecasting ] Random, isolated cirrus do not have any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. [ Battan Louis Louis J. Battan Weather Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 1974 Foundations of Earth Science Series 74 0-13-947762-4 ] If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. [ Audubon 2000 447 ] When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus cloud s. [ Whiteman 2000 84 ] When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels. Within the tropics, 36  hours prior to the center passage of a tropical cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the direction of the cyclone. [ Central Pacific Hurricane Center 23 July 2006 http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/pages/FAQ/Observations.php Tropical Cyclone Observations 5 May 2008 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Central Pacific Hurricane Center ] In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s, the president of Belen College (located in Havana, Cuba ), Benito Vines, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. [ Sheets 1990 190 ] He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Vines began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.

[ Stephens Tsay Stackhouse Flatau 1990 1742 ] When cirrus clouds are [ 100 m ft on ] thick, they reflect only around 9% of the incoming sunlight, but they prevent almost 50% of the outgoing infrared radiation from escaping, thus raising the temperature of the atmosphere beneath the clouds by an average of 10  °C (18  °F) [ Liou 1986 1191 ] —a process known as the greenhouse effect.

[ http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/role.html Cloud Climatology International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program National Aeronautics and Space Administration 12 July 2011 ] &apos;&apos;Cirrus fibratus&apos;&apos; clouds As a result of their warming effects when relatively thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. [ McGraw-Hill Editorial Staff 2005 2 ] In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth&apos;s infrared radiation to balance out. A similar hypothesis put forth by Richard Lindzen is the iris hypothesis in which an increase in tropical sea surface temperatures results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space.

A glory is a set of concentric, faintly-colored glowing rings that appear around the shadow of the observer. [ http://www.weather.gov.hk/education/edu06nature/ele_glory1106_e.htm The Mysterious Glory The Hong Kong Observatory 27 June 2011 ] These clouds only form glories when the constituent ice crystals are aspherical, and researchers suggest that the ice crystals must be between 0.009  millimeters and 0.015  millimeters in length. [ Sassen Arnott Barnett Aulenbach 1998 1433 ] Cirrus mixed with cirrostratus can produce halo s around the sun and sundog s, which are arcs of brightness near the sun. The cirrus/cirrostratus combination can also produce colorful arcs such as the circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arc s. [ Gilman Victoria Photo in the News: Rare &quot; Rainbow &quot; Spotted Over Idaho http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060619-rainbow-fire.html 30 January 2011 National Geographic News 19 June 2006 ] The top color of a circumhorizontal arc is red, followed by orange, then running through all the colors of the rainbow to violet on the bottom.

Light comes from the sun and passes through a cirrus/cirrostratus cloud. The sun must be either below 32° or more than 58° above the horizon to produce a circumzenithal or circumhorizontal arc, respectively. The sunlight enters one face of a crystal and refracts through it, exiting with its colors spread in a rainbow-like pattern. [ Relation to other clouds ] [ List of cloud types ] The heights of various cloud genera including high, middle, low, and vertical Cirrus clouds are one of three different genera of high-étage (high-level) clouds. High-étage clouds form at [ 16500 ft m flip on ] and above in temperate regions. The other two genera, cirrocumulus and cirrostratus, are also high clouds. In the intermediate range, from [ 6500 ft m flip on ] to [ 23000 ft m flip on ] in temperate regions, are the mid-étage clouds. They comprise two or three genera depending on the system of height classification being used: altostratus, altocumulus, and, according to WMO classification, nimbostratus. These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets. [ http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/clouds_max.htm Cloud Classifications National Weather Service JetStream 18 June 2011 ] Low-étage clouds, form at less than [ 6500 ft m flip on ]. The two genera that are strictly low-étage are stratus, and stratocumulus. These clouds are composed of water droplets, except during winter when they are formed of supercolled waterdroplets or ice crystals if the temperature at cloud level is below freezing. Two additional genera usually form in the low altitude range, but may be based at higher levels under conditions of very low humidity. They comprise the genera cumulus, and cumulonimbus, which along with nimbostratus, are often classified separately as clouds of vertical development, [ Paul Hancock and Brian Skinner 2000 http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/cloud.aspx#1-10112%3Aclouds-full &quot; clouds &quot;. The Oxford Companion to the Earth 2012-04-02 ] [ http://vortex.plymouth.edu/clouds.html/ Plymouth State Meteorology Program Cloud Boutique Jim Koermer 2011 2012-04-02 Plymouth State University ] especially when their tops are high enough to be composed of super-cooled water droplets or ice crystals. The altitudes of high-étage clouds like cirrus vary considerably with latitude. In the polar regions, they are at their lowest, with a minimum altitude of only [ 10000 ft m flip on ] to a maximum of [ 25000 ft m flip on ]. In tropical regions, they are at their highest, ranging in altitude from about [ 20000 ft m flip on ] to around [ 60000 ft m flip on ]. In temperate regions, they range in altitude from [ 16500 ft m flip on ] to [ 45000 ft m flip on ] —a variation in contrast to low-étage clouds, which do not appreciably change altitude with latitude. [ Summary of high cloud genera ] A solar halo There are three main genera in the family of high clouds: cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. [ Hubbard Hubbard 2000 340 ] Cirrostratus clouds commonly produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. [ http://www.weather.com/glossary/c.html Weather Glossary – C Weather Glossary The Weather Channel 12 February 2011 ] Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as &quot; cirriform cloud s &quot; because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix &quot; cirro- &quot;, but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. Cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and cirrostratus is stratiform, like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds. [ Cirrocumulus ] A large field of cirrocumulus clouds [ Cirrocumulus cloud ] Cirrocumulus clouds form in sheets or patches [ Miyazaki Yoshida Dobashi Nishita 2001 364 ] and do not cast shadows. They commonly appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like other members of the cumuliform category, formed via convective processes. [ Parungo 1995 251 ] Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. [ Parungo 1995 252 ] These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. [ Parungo 1995 254 ] Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. [ Common Cloud Names, Shapes, and Altitudes PDF Georgia Institute of Technology http://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/Cloud/Clouds.pdf 12 February 2011 2, 10 –13 ] They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size. [ Audubon 2000 448 ] [ Cirrostratus ] A cirrostratus cloud [ Cirrostratus cloud ] Cirrostratus clouds can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. [ Day 2005 56 ] Cirrostratus come in two species, fibratus and nebulosus. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around [ -35 C F ] to [ -45 C F ], the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around [ -47 C F ] to [ -52 C F ], the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. [ Parungo 1995 256 ] These clouds produce halos very commonly, and sometimes the halo is the only thing that indicates the presence of the cloud. [ Ahrens 2006 120 ] They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. [ Hamilton 24 ] When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds deepen and lower into altostratus, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later. [ Extraterrestrial ] Cirrus clouds on Mars Cirrus clouds have been observed on several other planets.

They lasted through early morning before being burned away by the sun. The crystals in these clouds were formed at a temperature of [ -65 C F ], and they were shaped roughly like ellipsoids 0.127  millimeters long and 0.042  millimeters wide.
