About [ 125 mi km ] long, it drains an area of the high western Sierra Nevada and the Central Valley. A large alluvial fan has formed where the river&apos;s gradient decreases in the Central Valley so the river divides into distributaries. Southern distributaries enter the endorheic basin surrounding Tulare Lake while northern distributaries join the San Joaquin River, eventually reaching San Francisco Bay via the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta. Tulare Lake was formerly the largest freshwater lake in western North America, but heavy agricultural and urban diversions have left it dry. The Kings River was named by the commander of a Spanish military expedition into the Central Valley in 1805. { A Synopsis of Kings River History, from El Rio Reyes Trust website, accessed September 12, 2011 } [ Course ] { Ansel Adams of the Middle Fork and from the south Fork of } { Cartridge Creek } It arises in the Sierra Nevada, consisting of three forks. The Middle and South Forks start in Kings Canyon National Park, while the North Fork starts in the John Muir Wilderness. The South Fork flows in Kings Canyon: a spectacular [ 8000 ft m -2 on ] deep glacial valley. The forks join in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Fresno County, California, where the river becomes an attraction for whitewater rafting (class 3 rapids). From that point, the Kings River flows about [ 125 mi km -1 ] to the Tulare Lake bed, with a surface elevation at [ 56 m on ], near Stratford, California.

In the Central Valley, the river flows south of Fresno, California, where its water is diverted for agriculture. The Kings River splits six miles (10  km) north of Lemoore into a set of North and South Fork distributaries. These forks join again nearly five miles (8  km) west of Lemoore. Clark&apos;s Fork distributary splits off from the South Fork and flows 5.5 miles (9  km) to join the returning North Fork distributary. The North Fork distributary flows westward to the point where it joins the Fresno Slough, a link to the San Joaquin River when in flood, where its channel turns southwest and rejoins the main channel 6 miles (10  km) west-northwest of Lemoore. The river flows through an artificial channel into the normally dry Tulare Lake bed about ten miles (16  km) south of Stratford. [ Durham David L. Place-Names of Central California 146 Word Dancer Press Clovis, California 2001 1-884995-33-0 ] [ History ] The Kings River was named by Lieutenant Gabriel Moraga on one of the first expeditions by the Spanish to the Central Valley of California on January 6, 1805. The river was originally named Rio de los Santos Reyes (River of the Holy Kings) to honor the Biblical Magi. [ K 2009-08-21 ] On the valley floor the Kings River is responsible for certain groundwater recharge. There is evidence in the Hanford area that depths to groundwater are increasing, indicating concern for safe yields of the Tulare Lake groundwater subbasin. { J. Torrey, P. Awosika et al., Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall, Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990 } [ Ecology ] The Middle and South forks of the river converge to form the main Kings River. North American beaver (Castor canadensis) have recolonized the Kings River including Kings Canyon National Park. Although there is some controversy as to whether beaver were native, fur trapper accounts place beaver in the river before they were trapped out in the late nineteenth century. A 14-man party led by Ewing Young which included Jonathan J. Warner in the fall of 1832 trapped the Kings River &quot; up to and some distance into the mountains and then passed on to the San Joaquin River, trapped that river down to canoe navigation in the foothills, where a canoe was made... &quot;.

Williams similarly interpreted accounts of Colonel Warner&apos;s expedition, stating that &quot; Warner, had been trapping fur-bearing animals at the headwaters of the Kings River about the same time that the Walker party was descending the Merced River &quot;.

Williams San Joaquin Historian 1973-06 9 http://www.sanjoaquinhistory.org/documents/HistorianOS9-2.pdf 2011-06-10 ] These interpretations of Young and Warner trapping high up on the Kings River is buttressed by an eyewitness account taken by Tappe from a retired game warden in 1940, who stated that beaver were &quot; apparently not uncommon on the upper part of the Kings River &quot; until 1882-1883.

The Pine Flat Dam, built in 1954, impounds the river near Piedra as it flows out of the foothills into the Central Valley. Built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the dam is [ 440 ft m ] high and stores [ 1000000 acre.ft km3 ] of water, and primarily serves to regulate the river&apos;s highly seasonal discharge.

Wishon and Courtright form impoundments for the Helms Pumped Storage Plant, one of the largest pumped-storage stations in California with a capacity of 1,212 megawatt s. A second large dam on the Kings River, the Rogers Crossing Dam, was proposed for construction in the late 1980s, upstream from Pine Flat. At a planned [ 600 ft m ] high, it would have backed water up through the foothills for [ 12 mi km ]. Environmental and recreational concerns have halted the project thus far.

The canal then continues southwards towards Bakersfield.

Maintenance efforts have focused on approximately [ 140 mi km ] of levees along the river from below Kingsburg near 8½ Avenue in Kings County to Highway 41 near Stratford on the South Fork of the river, and to McMullin Grade (Highway 145) on the North Fork. During flood releases, KRCD maintains 24-hour patrols monitoring the levee banks for sloughing, erosion and boils.
