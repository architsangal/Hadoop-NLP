Others who were influenced by and followed him included Madam Cama, Pran Sukh Yadav, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Lala Hardayal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Ram Prasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Swami Shraddhanand Swami Shradhanad gave Mohan Das Karam Chand Gandhi the title of Mahatma Gandhi when Gandhi visited Gurukul Kangri along with Madan Mohan Malviya, Mahatma Hansraj and Lala Lajpat Rai. { Lala Lajpat Rai Biography - Lala Lajpat Rai Life &amp; Profile } { Lala Lajpat Rai (Indian writer and politician) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia } One of his most influential works is the book Satyarth Prakash, which contributed to the Indian independence movement. He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from boyhood, and a scholar, who believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas. Dayananda advocated the doctrine of karma and skepticism in dogma, and emphasized the ideals of brahmacharya ( celibacy ) and devotion to God. The Theosophical Society and the Arya Samaj were united from 1878 to 1882, becoming the Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj.

[ Early life ] Dayananda was born on 12 February 1824 in the town of Tankara near Morvi (Morbi) in the Kathiawar region of the princely state of Gujarat (now in Rajkot district ), in the affluent and devout Saryupareen Brahmins family of Karshanji Lalji Tiwari and his wife Yashodabai. Since he was born under Mul Nakshatra, he was named &quot; Moolshankar &quot;, and led a comfortable early life, studying Sanskrit, the Vedas and other religious texts to prepare himself for a future as a Hindu priest.

Life and Teachings ] A number of incidents in early childhood resulted in Dayananda&apos;s questioning the traditional beliefs of Hinduism and inquiring about God. While still a young child, when his family went to a temple for overnight worship on the night of Maha Shivratri, he stayed up waiting for Lord Shiva to appear to accept the offerings made to his idol. While his family slept, Dayananda saw a mouse eating the offerings. He was utterly surprised and wondered how a God who cannot protect even his own offerings would protect humanity. He argued with his father that they should not be worshipping such a helpless God. { Dayanand Saraswati - Swami Dayanand Saraswati Biography - Dayanand Sarasvati Life History } { Swami Dayanand Saraswati Biography - Swami Dayanand Saraswati Life &amp; Profile } The deaths of his younger sister and his uncle from cholera caused Dayananda to ponder the meaning of life and death and he started asking questions which worried his parents. He was to be married in his early teens, as was common in nineteenth-century India, but he decided marriage was not for him and in 1846 ran away from home. Dayananda was disillusioned with the form of Hinduism being practiced in his surroundings and became a wandering monk to search for the eternal truths through direct interaction with enlightened sanyasis. He learned Panini&apos;s grammar &quot; Mahabhashya &quot; to read Sanskrit texts, and understood from them that God can be realised. After wandering in search of God for over two decades, he found Swami Virajananda near Mathura, Uttar Pradesh who became his guru. { The Meaning of the Word Guru } Swami Virajananda told him to throw away all his books he was studying earlier, as he wished Dayananda to start from a clean slate and learn directly from the Vedas, the oldest and most foundational scriptures of Hinduism. Dayananda stayed under Swami Virajananda&apos;s tutelage for two and a half years. After finishing his education, Virajananda asked him to spread the knowledge of the Vedas in society as his gurudakshina, or tuition-dues. [ Dayanand&apos;s mission ] { Aum or Om is considered by the ((Arya Samaj)) to be the highest and most proper name of God. } Dayananda mission was not to start or set up any new religion but to tell the humankind for Universal Brotherhood through nobility as spelt out in Vedas. For that mission he founded Arya Samaj enunciating the Ten Universal Principles as a code for Universalism Krinvanto Vishwaryam meaning the whole world be an abode for Nobles (Aryas). His next step was to take up the difficult task of reforming Hinduism with dedication despite multiple repeated attempts on his personal life. He traveled the country challenging religious scholars and priests to discussions and won repeatedly on the strength of his arguments based on his knowledge of Sanskrit and Vedas. { Swami Dayananda Sarasvati by V. Sundaram } He believed that Hinduism had been corrupted by divergence from the founding principles of the Vedas and that Hindus had been misled by the priesthood for the priests&apos; self-aggrandizement. Hindu priests discouraged the laity from reading Vedic scriptures and encouraged rituals, such as bathing in the Ganges River and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as superstitions or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to Go back to the Vedas. He wanted the people who followed Hinduism to go back to its roots and to follow the Vedic life, which he pointed out. He exhorted the Hindu nation to accept social reforms like the abolition of untouchability, sati, and dowry, Education of women, Swadeshi and importance of Cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of Hindi as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preachings, sermons and writings, he inspired the Hindu nation to aspire to Swarajya (self governance), nationalism, and spiritualism. He advocated the equal rights and respects to women and advocated the education of a girl child like the males. Swami Dayananda did logical, scientific and critical analyses of all faiths i.e. Islam and Christianity as well as of other Indian faiths like Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism, in addition to denouncing idolatry in Hinduism, as may be seen in his book Satyartha Prakash. { Light of Truth } He was against what he considered to be the corruption of the true and pure faith in his own country. Unlike many other reform movements of his times within Hinduism, the Arya Samaj&apos;s appeal was addressed not only to the educated few in India, but to the world as a whole as evidenced in the sixth principle of the Arya Samaj.In fact his teachings professed universalism for the all living beings and not for any particular sect, faith, community or nation. Arya Samaj allows and encourages converts to Hinduism. Dayananda’s concept of dharma is stated in the &quot; Beliefs and Disbeliefs &quot; section of Satyartha Prakash. He said: [ &quot; I accept as Dharma whatever is in full conformity with impartial justice, truthfulness and the like; that which is not opposed to the teachings of God as embodied in the Vedas. Whatever is not free from partiality and is unjust, partaking of untruth and the like, and opposed to the teachings of God as embodied in the Vedas —that I hold as adharma &quot; He also said: &quot; He, who after careful thinking, is ever ready to accept truth and reject falsehood; who counts the happiness of others as he does that of his own self, him I call just. &quot; Satyarth Prakash ] Dayananda&apos;s Vedic message was to emphasize respect and reverence for other human beings, supported by the Vedic notion of the divine nature of the individual–divine because the body was the temple where the human essence (soul or &quot; atma &quot; ) had the possibility to interface with the creator ( &quot; Paramatma &quot; ). In the ten principles of the Arya Samaj, he enshrined the idea that &quot; All actions should be performed with the prime objective of benefiting mankind &quot;, as opposed to following dogmatic rituals or revering idols and symbols. The first five principles speak of Truth and the other five of a society with nobility, civics, co-living and disciplined life. In his own life, he interpreted moksha to be a lower calling (due to its benefit to one individual) than the calling to emancipate others. Dayananda&apos;s &quot; back to the Vedas &quot; message influenced many thinkers and philosophers the world over. [ Arya Samaj ] [ Arya Samaj ] Swami Dayananda&apos;s creation, the Arya Samaj, unequivocally condemns idol worship, animal sacrifice, ancestor worship, pilgrimages, priest craft, offerings made in temples, the caste system, untouchability, child marriages and discrimination against women on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction.The Arya Samaj discourages dogma and symbolism and encourages skepticism in beliefs that run contrary to common sense and logic. To many people, the Arya Samaj aims to be a &quot; universal society &quot; based on the authority of the Vedas. [ Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 3 Hastings James John A. Selbie (Ed.) 2003 Kessinger Publishing 0-7661-3671-X 57 http://books.google.com/?id%3Di53tYSX9SZEC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA61%26amp%3Bdq%3DSwami%2BDayananda%2BSaraswati%26amp%3Bcd%3D52#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D ] [ Death ] In 1883 Dayananda was invited by the Maharaja of Jodhpur to stay at his palace. The Maharaja was eager to become his disciple and learn his teachings. One day Dayananda went to the Maharaja&apos;s rest room and saw him with a dance girl named Nanhi Jan. Dayananda boldly asked the Maharaja to forsake the girl and all unethical acts and follow dharma like a true Aryan. Dayananda&apos;s suggestion offended the dance girl and she decided to take revenge. She bribed Dayananda&apos;s cook to poison him. At bedtime, the cook brought him a glass of milk containing poison and powdered glass. Dayananda drank the milk and went to sleep only to wake up later with a burning sensation. He immediately realized that he had been poisoned and attempted to purge his digestive system of the poisonous substance, but it was too late. The poison had already entered his bloodstream. Dayananda was bedridden and suffered excruciating pain. Many doctors came to treat him but all was in vain. His body was covered all over with large bleeding sores. On seeing Dayananda&apos;s suffering the cook was overcome with unbearable guilt and remorse. He confessed his crime to Dayananda. On his deathbed, Dayananda forgave him and gave him a bag of money and told him to flee the kingdom lest he be found out and executed by the Maharaja&apos;s men. [ &quot; A man of spirit has passed away from India. Pandit Dayananda Saraswati is gone, the irrepressible, energetic reformer, whose mighty voice and passionate eloquence for the last few years raised thousands of people in India from, lethargic, indifference and stupor into active patriotism is no more. &quot; – Col Henry Steel Olcott Indian Political Tradition : Pg 118 ] [ Mohanty D.K D.K Mohanty Indian Political Tradition Anmol Publishers 81-7488-791-1 Mohnty ] { : Pg 118 } &apos;&apos; [ Works ] Dayananda Saraswati wrote more than 60 works in all, including a 16 volume explanation of the six Vedangas, an incomplete commentary on the Ashtadhyayi (Panini&apos;s grammar), several small tracts on ethics and morality, Vedic rituals and sacraments and on criticism of rival doctrines (such as Advaita Vedanta, Islam and Christianity).
