Also gives cause of depopulation. E Hiram Golani Kfar Hananya Mandatory Palestine ] Kafr ʿInān (كفر عنان) was a Palestinian village in the District of Acre around [ 33 km mi ] east of Acre. Until 1949, it was an Arab village situated upon ancient ruins. Archaeological surveys indicate the village was first founded in the early Roman period with settlement persisting through to the Byzantine period, existing again in the Middle Ages and the modern era. Captured by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, many of the villagers fled the fighting. Those few hundred who managed to remain or to return were subsequently transferred out of the village by the Israel Defense Forces to the West Bank or to other Arab towns in the newly established State of Israel on three separate occasions in January and February 1949. A shrine for the Sheikh Abu Hajar Azraq and the remains of a small domed building are still standing, and there are many archaeological remains of interest, including cisterns and domestic wells which used to supply the village with fresh drinking water from nearby springs. The Israeli communal settlement of Kefar Chananya was established on the land of Kfar &apos;Inan in 1989. [ History ] During the period of Roman and Byzantine rule in Palestine, it was a Jew ish village known as Kfar Hananya (or Kfar Hanania), that served as a center for pottery production in the Galilee. { Crossan, 1999, p. 224. } { Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 279. } An archaeological site in the village revealed shafts and bases of columns, caves, a pool, and a burial ground. Archaeological surveys determined that most of the cooking ware in the Galilee between the 1st century BCE and the beginning of the 5th century CE was produced in Kafr &apos;Inan. { Leibner, 2009, p. 130. } An Aramaic inscription initially dated to the 6th century, and recently redated to Abbasid or Umayyad period, was found on a kelila (a type of chandelier) found in the synagogue. { Flood, 2001, p. 50. } Rabbinic literature mentions the village in relation to the production of pottery; in the Tosefta, there is a reference to, &quot; those who make black clay, such as Kefar Hananya and its neighbors. &quot; { Gale, 2005, p. 70. } Ancient sepulchres believed to be the burial sites of rabbi s were located in the village, including those of Halafta (buried with his wife and children), Jacob and Eliezer. { Carmoly, 1847, p. 260. } { Adler, 2004, p. 147. } Ya&apos;akov ben Netan&apos;el, who visited the village in the 12th century during the period of Crusader rule, writes about the ruins of a synagogue quarried into the hill. Potential references to the village include a mention of the &quot; widow of Ben al-&apos;Anani &quot; in a 12th century Genizah document and to Kfar Hanan in the 13th century. { Leibner, 2009, p. 129. } In 1211, Samuel ben Samson travelled from Tiberias and Kefar Hanania before stopping in Safed. { Winter and Levanoni, 2004, p. 164. } In the 14th century, another traveller transcribes the village&apos;s name as Kefar Hanin. It is during the rule of the Ottoman Empire over Palestine that the form Kafr ʿInān (Kafr &apos;Anan) first appears. The village is listed in 1596, as forming part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira under the Liwa of Safad, with a population of 259. It paid taxes on goats, beehives and on its press, which was used either for olives or grapes. { Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 178. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 } In the late 19th century, the village was described as being built of stone and having 150-200 Muslim residents. The arable land in the village comprised gardens and olive trees. { SWP, 1881, Vol. 1, p.203, Also cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 } The village houses, made of stone with mud mortar, were bunched close together and were separated by semi-circular, narrow alleys. Many new houses were constructed during the last years of the British Mandate of Palestine. Springs and domestic wells supplied the villagers´drinking water. Olives and grain were the main crops. Grain was grown in the nearby flat zones and valleys. In 1944-45 a total of 1,740 dunum s was used for the cultivation of cereal s, 1,195 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards and most of these (1,145 dunums) were planted with olive trees. { Hadawi, 1970, p.80 } [ 1948 War and aftermath ] [ Palestinian refugees ] [ Internally displaced Palestinians ] The village was captured on 30 October 1948 by the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Hiram. According to Walid Khalidi, the villagers stayed put, refusing to be pushed out like most of the population in the area. Morris reports that along with several other villages (like Saffuriyya and Farradiyya ) in the region, the new Israeli authorities had classified the village as &quot; abandoned &quot; ( &quot; kefarim netushim &quot; ); however, the villagers kept returning. { Morris, 2004, p. 516-17 } In January 1949, the IDF expelled 54, and moved another 128 inhabitants from Kafr &apos;Inan and Farradiyya to other villages inside Israel. { Morris, 2004, p. 517. } But the two villages gradually filled up again. On 4 February, 1949, units of the 79th Battalion surrounded the two villages and expelled 45 people to the West Bank, while the remaining about 200 villagers, who had permits to stay ( &quot; almost all old men, women and children &quot; ), were transferred to Majd al Kurum. Yet again, the villagers returned. By mid-February 1949 there were about 100 back in the two villages, according to IDF -sources. The two villages were again scoured and emptied by the IDF. The expulsion of the villagers upset some members of Mapam, who condemned Ben-Gurion and the army. However, a suggestion for a Knesset motion calling for the establishment of an inquiry to probe the expulsions of the villagers of Kafr &apos;Inan, Farradiyya and Al-Ghabisiyya, was apparently never brought to the Knesset plenum. { Morris, 2004, p. 516, note 80, p. 541, 542 } In 1950, Article 125 of the Defence regulation of 1945 was invoked in order to confiscate the land belonging to a number of Palestinian villages in Galilee, among them Kafr &apos;Inan. { Nazzal, 1978, p. 100. The other villages were } { Amqa, } { Al-Damun, } { Al-Birwa, } { Al-Ghabisiyya, } { Al-Ruways, } { Mi&apos;ar, } { Kuwaykat, } { Al-Mansura, Safad, } { Kafr Bir&apos;im, } { al-Majdal, Tiberias and } { Saffuriyya. } This law was also used to prevent the villagers from returning to their homes, even by legal means. { Nazzal, 1978, p. 101 } The Israeli communal settlement of Kefar Chananya was first planned to the south of the village site in 1982, but it was eventually established in 1989 on village land. Chazon, built in 1969 on the lands of Al-Mansura, Tiberias, and Parod, built in 1949 on the lands of Al-Farradiyya ( District of Safad ), are both close to the village site, but not on village land. Of the village site in 1992, the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi writes: &quot; The site is covered with piles of stones that lie scattered around clumps of cactuses and fig trees. There are remains of a domed building on a slope facing the village and the small shrine of Shaykh Abu Hajar Azraq on an adjacent hill to the east. The land around the site is forested and planted with fruit trees by the settlement of Parod &quot; { Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 } [ See also ] List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War [ References ] [ Bibliography ] [ Jewish Travellers Elkan Nathan Adler Reprint, illustrated, abridged Routledge 2004 0-415-34466-2, 9780415344661 ] [ http://books.google.com/?id%3Dp8wWAAAAQAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA260%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22kefar%2Banan%22%26amp%3Bq%3D%22kefar%20anan%22 Itinéraires de la Terre Sainte des XIIIe, XIVe, XVe, XVIe et XVIIe siècle, traduits de l&apos;hébreu, et accompagnés de tables, de cartes et d&apos;éclaircissements Eliakim Carmoly A.
