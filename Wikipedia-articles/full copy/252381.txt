It consists of a series of maple leaf -like stars imbedded in 13 designated blocks&apos; worth of sidewalks in Toronto, located in front of Roy Thomson Hall, The Princess of Wales Theatre, and The Royal Alexandra Theatre on King Street as well as Simcoe Street. The first group of members was inducted in 1998, and it has since expanded to include a young filmmakers competition and there are plans for a permanent museum. There are 137 Canadians on the walk of fame, including athletes; coaches; actors, directors, writers and producers of movies, television and stage; singer s, songwriter s and musicians; playwright s; authors; comedian s; cartoonists and models. [ History ] A line of stars along Simcoe Street The Walk of Fame was first conceived in 1996 when founder and current president Peter Soumalias suggested the idea of a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea, but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians in partnership with Bill Ballard, Dusty Cohl and Gary Slaight. In spite of a lack of funds, research and no media plan, they managed to succeed and the first class of inductees was inducted in 1998. The Walk of Fame has since become a popular tourist attraction in Toronto and has been named the number one Canadian recognition event. In 2005, the board of directors held a contest to design a new location for the Walk of Fame. The winner was announced in September 2006 and that it would move to Pecaut Square, next to Roy Thomson Hall.

There is also a music competition that was launched in 2007, and a book is planned, which at the moment is titled &quot; 108 Great Canadians &quot;. There are also plans to manage a festival of Canadian films and plans for a permanent &quot; Museum of Canadian Achievement &quot;.

The process differs greatly from that of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Hollywood version allows only celebrities of the silver screen, television, radio, live theatre and singers/musicians, while Canada&apos;s Walk allows people of more diverse occupations, as listed above. While most celebrities on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are American or have achieved their fame in the United States, Canada&apos;s Walk of Fame is exclusive to Canadians. For someone to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they must be nominated by a sponsor who must agree to field the approximately $25,000 cost of installing a star.
