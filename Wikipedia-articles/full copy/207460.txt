She is the second U.S. warship to bear the name of two naval battles of Port Royal Sound, South Carolina, of the American Revolutionary War and the American Civil War. However, during the initial building phase, the builders and crew were unaware of this history of the first &apos;&apos;Port Royal&apos;&apos;, as a result, the Engineering Control Center bears a plaque &quot; First ship named &quot;. The cruiser was ordered 25 February 1988, laid down 18 October 1991 by Ingalls Shipbuilding at Pascagoula, Mississippi, launched on 20 November 1992, christened on 5 December 1992 by Susan G. Baker (wife of James A. Baker III, Chief of Staff to President George H. W. Bush and former Secretary of State ), and formally commissioned on 9 July 1994 at Savannah, Georgia; Captain Nicholas L. Richards Commanding, Lieutenant Commander Derek B. Kemp Executive Officer, and Master Chief Petty Officer Dennis W. Mills, Command Master Chief. Decommissioning is set for March 31, 2013. { http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2012/NAV12087.txt } [ Vicksburg CG-69 6 ] was originally named Port Royal but the name was formally changed during construction. { http://www.navysite.de/cg/cg69.html } [ October 2009 ] [ Characteristics ] Port Royal and [ Lake Erie CG-70 6 ] are the original cruisers for the Navy&apos;s Linebacker program (Milestone Phase  I, II and III), which provided theater ballistic missile defense capability, as test platforms to detect, track, cue, intercept, and interact with other national assets to shoot down ICBM s. { http://ftp.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/dote99/99natbmd.htm } The vessel&apos;s Aegis and Stand Missile Tracking systems have been upgraded with &quot; long range surveillance and track (LRS &amp; T) &quot;, and the ships were outfitted to carry the modified SM-2 Block  IVA TMD. { Pike, John. Ballistic Missile Defense Program Status Update, Arms Control Today, July 1998 } As of 2009, USS Port Royal along with USS Lake Erie and [ Shiloh CG-67 6 ] are the only three [ Ticonderoga cruiser ] s to be equipped for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program. Port Royal participated as a tracking ship during operation &quot; Stellar Athena &quot; FTM 12 on Jun 22, 2007 off of Hawaii. The Lake Erie continues its role, but the Port Royal s role has been taken by the USS Hopper. { De Coster, Jamie Lynn. USS Hopper Supports Ballistic Missile Defense in Sky Hunter, Armed Forces News Service Pacific Ocean, 1  March 2006. } Originally, Port Royal was to be outfitted with the experimental shipboard mounted High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWEPS). Based on a megawatt-class deuterium/fluorine chemical laser, HELWEPS would have replaced the standard 5-inch forward gun. HELWEPS was to have been used to destroy missiles up to about 4  km away, or to burn out electro-optical sensors about 10  km away. The outfitting, scheduled to occur in Port Hueneme, California in 1994 was cancelled, along with all plans to install HELWEPS on Ticonderoga-class cruisers. Four powerful gas turbine engines ( LM2500 ) propel Port Royal with 80,000 shaft horsepower at speeds greater than 30  knots. Two five-bladed controllable reversible pitch propellers (17  foot diameter) and two rudders assist in rapid acceleration and deceleration. Sensors include: AN/SPY-1B(V) Multi-Function Radar (Four Mounts) AN/SPS-49(V)8 Air Search Radar AN/SPS-55 Surface Search Radar AN/SPS-64(V)9 Navigation Radar AN/SPQ-9 Gun Fire Control Radar AN/SPG-62 Illuminators (Four Mounts) AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Sonar Suite AN/SLQ-32A(V)3 Electronic Warfare Suite [ Operations ] Port Royal deployed from December 1995 until May 1996 as part of the [ Nimitz CVN-68 2 ] battle group Carrier Group Seven. The CVBG was participating in Operation Southern Watch, but was deployed to the South China Sea in March 1996 to act as a stabilizing force the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. During this deployment, Captain Richards transferred command to Captain Gary Roughead on 21  January 1996. Following her first deployment, Port Royal became the first US  Naval cruiser to integrate women into the crew. Port Royal deployed with Nimitz battle group for participation in Operation Southern Watch from September 1997 until March, 1998. Port Royal deployed with the John C. Stennis battle group, participating in Operation Southern Watch. Leaving in January 2000, she returned to Hawaii early after sustaining damage to her port shaft and Hub during pursuit of a vessel suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N.  sanctions. She returned in June and then in August went into drydock for repairs and upgrades. Port Royal deployed early Pearl Harbor on 17 November 2001 to join the John C. Stennis battle group on deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In March 2003 she was assigned to Carrier Group Seven. { http://www.hazegray.org/worldnav/usa/surface.htm, accessed May 2012 } Port Royal deployed with [ Peleliu LHA-5 2 ] Expeditionary Strike Group-One (ESG-1) in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) from 3  September 2003 until 11  March 2004.

Port Royal deployed with Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group-Three (ESG-3) in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) from 27  February 2006 until 5  August 2006. On 6 January 2008 the destroyer [ Hopper DDG-70 6 ], the USS Port Royal and the frigate [ Ingraham FFG-61 6 ] were entering the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz when five Iranian boats approached them at high speed and in a threatening manner. The U.S. ships had been in the Arabian Sea searching for a sailor who had been missing from the USS Hopper for one day. The US Navy says the Iranian boats made &quot; threatening &quot; moves toward the U.S. vessels, coming as close as [ 200 yd m ]. The U.S. Navy allegedly received a radio transmission saying, &quot; I am coming at you. You will explode in a couple of minutes. &quot; As the U.S. ships prepared to fire, the Iranians abruptly turned away, the U.S. officials said. Before leaving, the Iranians dropped white boxes into the water in front of the U.S. ships. The U.S. ships did not investigate the boxes.
