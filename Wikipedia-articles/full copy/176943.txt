He is currently serving a life sentence without parole in a super maximum security prison in the United States. [ Background ] Reid was born a British citizen in Bromley, South London, [ http://www.nndb.com/people/828/000058654/ Profile NNDB ] { In an email sent to his mother, Reid stated he was part of the war &quot; against unbelief &quot; and was sacrificing his life to &quot; help remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim lands &quot; } to Leslie Hughes, who was of white English descent, and Colvin Robin Reid, whose father was a Jamaica n immigrant of African descent.

Reid left school at age 16, becoming a petty crook who was in and out of jail himself, the first time for assaulting an elderly woman. He began writing graffiti under the name Enrol with FRF crew, [ Loner Vowed to Make His Evil Mark Millbank James December 30, 2001 News of the World ] [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jan/11/muslim-extremists-crime-gangs-london Islamists target teen crime gangs in London Syal Rajeev Mark Townsend January 11, 2001 The Observer ] and ultimately accumulated more than 10 convictions for crimes against persons and property, [ http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/28/inv.reid/ Judge denies bail to accused shoe bomber December 28, 2001 CNN ] serving sentences at the Feltham Young Offenders Institution [ http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/07/reid.timeline/index.html Timeline: The shoe bomber case January 7, 2002 CNN ] and at the Blundeston Prison.

His father advised him to convert to Islam, telling him that Muslims were more egalitarian and they got better food in prison. The next time Reid was incarcerated (in 1995 for petty theft), he converted.

By 1998 Reid was voicing extremist views, and may have fallen under the sway of &quot; terrorist talent spotters and handlers &quot; allied with Al Qaeda. He spent 1999 and 2000 in Pakistan and trained at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, according to several informants. He may also have attended an anti-American religious training center in Lahore, Pakistan as a follower of Mubarak Ali Gilani.

After his return Reid set about obtaining duplicate passport s from British government consulates abroad. Reid next resided at numerous places in Europe, communicating via an address in Peshawar, Pakistan, a city known for its Al Qaeda connections. In July 2001, Reid flew to Israel, passing through the El Al airline&apos;s very tight security network, in what was possibly a test of his ability to pass through airport security screening anywhere. He then moved to Amsterdam, living there from August 2001 through November 2001, working as a dishwasher. Reid and Badat returned to Pakistan in November 2001, and reportedly traveled overland to Afghanistan. They were given &quot; shoe bombs &quot;, casual footwear adapted to be covertly smuggled onto aircraft before being used to destroy them. Later forensic analysis of both bombs showed that they contained the same plastic explosive and that the respective lengths of detonator cord had come from the same batch: indeed, the cut mark on Badat&apos;s cord matches exactly that on Reid&apos;s. The pair returned separately to Great Britain in early December 2001. Reid went to Belgium for 10 days before catching a train to Paris on December 16. On December 21, 2001, Reid attempted to board a flight from Paris, France to Miami, Florida, but his boarding was delayed because his disheveled physical appearance aroused the suspicions of the airline passenger screeners. Reid also did not answer all of their questions, and had not checked any luggage for the transatlantic flight. Additional screening by the French National Police resulted in Reid&apos;s being re-issued a ticket for a flight on the following day. He returned to the Paris airport on December 22, 2001, and he boarded American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami, wearing his special shoes packed with plastic explosives in their hollowed-out bottoms. [ Bombing attempt on American Airlines Flight 63 ] [ 2001 shoe bomb plot ] One of Reid&apos;s shoes On December 22, 2001, passengers on Flight 63 from Paris, France to Miami, Florida complained of a smoke smell in the cabin shortly after a meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, thinking she smelled a burnt match, walked the aisles of the plane, trying to assess the source. A passenger pointed to Reid, who was sitting alone near a window and attempting to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane. Reid then promised to stop. A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaned over in his seat. Her attempts to get his attention failed. After asking &quot; What are you doing? &quot; Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse which led into the shoe, and a lit match. She tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she yelled for help, and then ran to get water. When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb and Moutardier threw water in his face. The 6 foot 4  inch (193  cm) tall, 200+ pound (90+ kg) Reid was next subdued by several passengers on the airliner, and then bound up using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords. A physician on board the airliner administered to Reid a tranquilizer that he found in the emergency medical kit of the airliner. [ http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020909/aattendants.html 11 Lives  — The Flight Attendants Thomas Cathy Booth September 1, 2002 Time ] This flight was immediately diverted to the Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, the closest US airport. { nefafoundation.org } The explosive apparently did not detonate due to the one-day delay in the take-off of Reid&apos;s flight. He had worn his shoes for more than one day, and the rainy weather, perhaps along with Reid&apos;s accumulated foot perspiration, caused the fuse to be too damp to ignite.

Two days later he was charged before a federal court in Boston with &quot; interfering with the performance of duties of flight crew members by assault or intimidation &quot;, a crime which by itself carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. (Additional charges were added when he was formally indicted by a grand jury.) The judge ordered Reid to be held in jail without bail pending trial due to the seriousness of the crimes he was charged with, and the perceived high risk that he would attempt to flee. [ http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/24/investigation.plane/ Shoe bomb suspect to remain in custody December 25, 2001 CNN ] At that time, forensic results indicated Reid&apos;s shoes contained 10 ounces (283g) of C-4 plastic explosive s, enough to blow a hole in the plane and cause it to crash. During a preliminary hearing which was held on December 28, an FBI agent testified that forensic analysis had identified the chemicals as PETN, the primary explosive, and TATP (triacetone triperoxide), a chemical needed to detonate the bomb. The prosecutor proceeded to obtain a grand jury indictment and on January 16, 2002, Reid was charged with eight criminal counts related to his acts of terrorism, namely: attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted homicide, placing an explosive device on an aircraft, attempted murder, interference with flight crew members and attendants, attempted destruction of an aircraft, using a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence and attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle.

To call you a soldier gives you far too much stature. (points to U.S. flag) You see that flag, Mr. Reid? That is the flag of the United States of America.

Later on, a British-born man, Saajid Badat from Gloucester, England, admitted that he had conspired with Richard Reid and a Tunisian man who is in jail in Belgium, Nizar Trabelsi, in a plot to blow up two airliners bound for the United States more-or-less simultaneously, using their shoe bombs.

Badat never got on board the flight, and he withdrew from his part of the conspiracy. However, Badat did not warn criminal or aviation authorities about the dangers of Mr. Reid. Badat confessed immediately after being arrested by the British police. The detonator cord in Badat&apos;s bomb was found by experts to be an exact match for cord on Reid&apos;s bomb, and their explosive chemicals were essentially identical. Badat said that he had received the bomb-making materials from an Arab in Afghanistan. Badat was sentenced to 13 years in prison by a British judge.
