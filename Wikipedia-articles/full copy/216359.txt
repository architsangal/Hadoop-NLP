He was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal (in 1961) and the 1987 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. [ Biography ] Robert Solow was born in Brooklyn, New York in a Jewish family on August 23, 1924, the oldest of three children. He was well educated in the neighborhood public schools of New York City and excelled academically early in life.

Solow – Autobiography Nobelprize.org 1924-08-23 2010-03-16 ] In September 1940, Solow went to Harvard College with a scholarship at the age of 16. At Harvard, his first studies were in sociology and anthropology as well as elementary economics. By the end of 1942, Solow left the university and joined the U.S. Army. He served briefly in North Africa and Sicily, and later served in Italy during World War II until he was discharged in August 1945. He returned to Harvard in 1945, and studied under Wassily Leontief. As his research assistant he produced the first set of capital-coefficients for the input-output model. Then he became interested in statistics and probability models. From 1949–50, he spent a fellowship year at Columbia University to study statistics more intensively. During that year he was also working on his Ph.D. thesis, an exploratory attempt to model changes in the size distribution of wage income using interacting Markov process es for employment-unemployment and wage rates. In 1949, just before going off to Columbia he was offered and accepted an Assistant Professorship in the Economics Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At M.I.T. he taught courses in statistics and econometrics. Solow’s interest gradually changed to Macroeconomics. For almost 40 years, Solow and Paul Samuelson worked together on many landmark theories: von Neumann growth theory (1953), Theory of capital (1956), linear programming (1958) and the Phillips Curve (1960). Solow also held several government positions, including senior economist for the Council of Economic Advisers (1961–62) and member of the President’s Commission on Income Maintenance (1968–70). His studies focused mainly in the fields of employment and growth policies, and the theory of capital. In 1961 he won the American Economic Association&apos;s John Bates Clark Award, given to the best economist under age forty. In 1979 he was president of that association. In 1987, Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize for his analysis of economic growth. In 1999, he received National Medal of Science. Solow is Founder of the Cournot Foundation and Cournot Centre. He is a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security. In 2011, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Science from Tufts University.&apos;&apos;&apos; Several of his students have gone on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize including Peter Diamond, Joseph Stiglitz and George Akerlof. [ Economic contributions ] Solow&apos;s model of economic growth, often known as the Solow-Swan neo-classical growth model as the model was independently discovered by Trevor W. Swan and published in &quot; The Economic Record &quot; in 1956, allows the determinants of economic growth to be separated out into increases in inputs ( labour and capital ) and technical progress. Using his model, Solow calculated that about four-fifths of the growth in US output per worker was attributable to technical progress. { Bill Clinton awarding Solow the } { National Medal of Science in 1999. } Solow also was the first to develop a growth model with different vintages of capital.

Within the confines of Solow&apos;s model, this known technology is assumed to be constantly improving. Consequently, the products of this technology (the new capital) are expected to be more productive as well as more valuable. Both Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, Jr. subsequently developed alternatives to Solow&apos;s neo-classical growth model. Since Solow&apos;s initial work in the 1950s, many more sophisticated models of economic growth have been proposed, leading to varying conclusions about the causes of economic growth. In the 1980s efforts have focused on the role of technological progress in the economy, leading to the development of endogenous growth theory (or new growth theory). Today, economists use Solow&apos;s sources-of-growth accounting to estimate the separate effects on economic growth of technological change, capital, and labor. Solow currently is an emeritus Institute Professor in the MIT economics department, and previously taught at Columbia University. [ Quotations ] [ September 2008 ] [ March 2010 ] &quot; Everything reminds Milton Friedman of the money supply. Everything reminds me of sex, but I try to keep it out of my papers. &quot; &quot; You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics. &quot; Robert Solow, “We’d better watch out”, New York Times Book Review, July 12 1987, page 36. &quot; Over the long term, places with strong, distinctive identities are more likely to prosper than places without them. Every place must identify its strongest most distinctive features and develop them or run the risk of being all things to all persons and nothing special to any...Livability is not a middle-class luxury. It is an economic imperative. &quot; &quot; If it is very easy to substitute other factors for natural resources, then there is, in principle, no problem. The world can, in effect, get along without natural resources. &quot; &quot; There is no evidence that God ever intended the United States of America to have a higher per capita income than the rest of the world for eternity. &quot; &quot; Every discussion among economists of the relatively slow growth of the British economy compared with the Continental economies ends up in a blaze of amateur sociology. &quot; Robert M.
