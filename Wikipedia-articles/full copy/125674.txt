As of the 2010 United States Census, the township population was 25,850. [ History ] West Milford started out as New Milford in what was then western Bergen County in the 18th century, having been settled by disenchanted Dutch from Milford, New Jersey (later renamed by the British as Newark). These same Dutch also built a town of New Milford in eastern Bergen County. After both New Milfords applied for post offices in 1828, a clerk in Washington, D.C. is said to have approved the other application first and assigned the name &quot; West Milford &quot; to the New Milford in western Bergen County in order to distinguish between the two locations. [ November 2011 ] West Milford became a municipality by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 10, 1834, when it was formed from the westernmost portions of both Franklin Township and Saddle River Township, while the area was still part of Bergen County. On February 7, 1837, Passaic County was created from portions of both Bergen County and Essex County, with West Milford as the western end of the newly formed county. { &quot; The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968 &quot;, John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 211. } There are old name places in the township like Postville, Utterville, Corterville, Browns, Awosting, Echo Lake, Macopin, Charlotteburg (named after King George III &apos;s wife, Queen Charlotte and the town is now under the Charlotteburg Reservoir), Clinton (or sometimes called Clinton Furnace, now under the Clinton Reservoir, and the furnace still stands), Moe Mountain, Oak Ridge (a nameplace, but town is under the Oak Ridge Reservoir), Newfoundland, Apshawa, New City, and Smith Mills. Newfoundland is divided by the Pequannock River, which divides Passaic and Morris Counties; a small part of Newfoundland lies within Jefferson Township. A large part of the township is reservoir property owned by the City of Newark in Essex County for their water supply. Prior to the Second World War, the township was a resort area with trains coming from New York City to stations at Charlotteburg, Newfoundland, Oak Ridge in the south and Hewitt (also known as Sterling Forest station) and Awosting in the north. Railroad service in the south was from the New Jersey Midland starting around the 1850s and in the north around the 1870s from the Montclair Railroad, out of Montclair, New Jersey and later the Erie Railroad (before their merger with the Lackawanna Railroad). Greenwood Lake is an interstate lake approximately [ 9 mi km ] long lying in both New Jersey and New York State. It was originally called Long Pond. It was dammed up to increase the size of the lake for water power down stream. During the resort era, several steamboats operated on the lake, the most famous and grand was the two deck steamer, Montclair. These steamboats met the trains and took passengers to the various resorts around the lake in both states. There is a seaplane area on Greenwood Lake, a few large marinas and lakeside restaurants with docks. There is a public airport called Greenwood Lake Airport just south of the lake on top of a mountain ridge and has two landing strips; one is long enough to handle small jets. Plus there is one private airport in the township on a private estate. After World War II and for the next 20 years the area underwent a major change from a resort area to year round residences. Before there were year-round houses, the summer residence of Cecil B. Demille was West Milford. Road maps of the 1950s showing the population on the backside said 2,000 winter and 10,000 summer. { Hagstrom Maps } Jeremiah &quot; Jerry &quot; Goodfellow, a white German shepherd and the senior canine member of the New Jersey Search and Rescue was inducted into the Animal Hall of Fame in 2009. { Local search dog inducted into hall of fame } Jerry lives with his owner and trainer, Sue Lavoie, on Union Valley Road in West Milford.

[ Newfoundland and Green Pond ] Newfoundland is a neighborhood of West Milford located along the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYS &amp; W Rwy, formerly NYS &amp; W RR) tracks (freight service only) and Route 23. It is also a mailing address for Green Pond (just north of the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway Township, Morris County ), a private lake community owned by Green Pond Corporation and Lake End Corporation, which lays in Rockaway Township where the Pequannock River divides Passaic County from Morris County. The 2003 film The Station Agent was set, and filmed, largely in Newfoundland. There was an early non-talking movie produced in the township at the Mine Hole in the Hewitt section of the township. A still photo of that movie is published in the township&apos;s Sesquicentennial book entitled The Day the Earth Shook and the Sky Turned Red, copyright 1984. [ Commerce ] For decades, West Milford was rural with only a couple service stations, a couple small eating establishments, and a bank or two. The community was mostly residential. In the mid 1960s a then-average-sized [ 20000 sqft m2 on ] A &amp; P Supermarket was built. In 1972, Warner Brothers opened up a wildlife theme park called Jungle Habitat. This park consisted of a drive through safari and a small park with various shows. Initially, this brought huge tourist revenue to the township. Jungle Habitat was a mixed blessing due to the amount of summer and weekend traffic into this rural area made up of small two lane roads. Jungle Habitat wanted to expand and become a huge amusement park, but residents concerned with excessive traffic voted this proposal down in 1976, which resulted in an abrupt closing and exit. Some of the animals in the wildlife park were subsequently moved to the then-recently established drive through safari at Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The former site of Jungle Habitat, in recent years has become a location for various Township activities such as the annual Fourth of July Fireworks display. With the loss of tax revenue and the needs of the residents in mind, the township did approve the addition of more businesses to the township. In the late 1970s, a [ 45000 sqft m2 on ] ShopRite supermarket was built, and was expanded in the mid-1980s. Shortly after other businesses joined the area. Near the ShopRite are several restaurants and fast food establishments were built including McDonald&apos;s as well as a four-screen movie theater, which recently closed down.In the late 1990s, A &amp; P closed its obsolete store and built a [ 60000 sqft m2 on ] supermarket a few miles away from the town center, but next door to their former store. West Milford businesses are represented by the West Milford Chamber of Commerce, an organization of business men and women that has worked to improve and enhance the business community in West Milford since it was established in 1949. { About Us, West Milford Chamber of Commerce.

County officials used money from the Farmland Preservation Funds to purchase development rights to the farm. { Eden Farms forever preserved, West Milford Messenger, June, 2009 } Owners George and Diana Cluff initially began working on the agreement in 2007. The deal prevents the farm from being built upon. { Eden Farms gains preserved status, Suburban Trends, May, 2009 } [ Law and government ] [ Local government ] The Township of West Milford operates under the Faulkner Act : New Jersey’s Optional Municipal Charter Law, Mayor-Council-Administrator Plan as of January 1, 2004. This plan is described as a &quot; Faulknerized &quot; version of the borough form of government. The Legislature accepted the recommendation of the commission, and added the Mayor-Council-Administrator plan to the Faulkner Act as the fourth optional form of municipal government in 1981. { Government, West Milford Township. Accessed July 1, 2008. } The voters of West Milford Township adopted the Mayor-Council-Administrator Plan at a Special Election held on December 10, 2002. Under the mayor-council-administrator plan, West Milford is governed by an elected mayor and council, with an appointed municipal administrator. The government consists of a Mayor and a Township Council made up of six council members, with all positions elected at large. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Township Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year. { 2005 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book, } { Rutgers University } { Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, April 2006, p. 121. } The Mayor holds executive power under the mayor-council-administrator plan. The Mayor presides over meetings of the Township Council but does not vote except to break a tie. When the Township Council passes an ordinance, the Mayor has ten days upon receiving it to exercise one of three options: 1. sign the ordinance into law; or, 2. veto all or any part of it by delivering it to the Township Clerk with a written statement of his objections for return to the Township Council; or 3. let the ordinance become law automatically by neither signing nor vetoing it within the ten days of receiving it. If the Mayor vetoes an ordinance, the Township Council can override it by a ⅔ majority vote. The Mayor’s veto, however, in the mayor-council-administrator plan, as in the borough form, is rather ineffectual. In both forms of government the four vote simple majority needed to pass an ordinance is also the ⅔ extra-majority needed to override the Mayor’s veto. In both forms, the Mayor’s veto is more of a symbolic gesture. The Mayor appoints, with the advice and consent of the Township Council, the Township Administrator, the Township Clerk, the Township Attorney, the Tax Assessor, the Tax Collector, the Treasurer and such other officers as may be provided by ordinance. The Township Council’s responsibilities include enacting ordinances and resolutions, establishing policies, preparing the annual budget with the assistance of the Township Administrator and the Treasurer, and levying taxes. Additionally, the council makes appointments to both the policy and decision-making boards and various advisory committees in accordance with general law and Township ordinances and resolutions. The Township Administrator in the mayor-council-administrator plan supervises the administration of each of the departments established by ordinance, may investigate the organization and operation of any municipal department, prescribe standards and rules of administrative practice and procedure, and consult with the department heads. The Township Administrator also directs the business affairs of the Township, and has, as provided by ordinance, such powers and performs such duties which are not required by the mayor-council-administrator plan or by general law to be exercised by the Mayor, Township Council or other officer, board or body. The Township Administrator serves during the term of the Mayor appointing him, however the Township Council may remove the administrator by a ⅔ majority vote. { West Milford Township Government, West Milford Township.
