It is located 10.8  km (6.7  mi) from the center of Paris. [ History ] [ Toponomy ] The name Drancy comes from Medieval Latin Derenciacum, and before that Terentiacum, meaning &quot; estate of Terentius &quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner. [ Origins to 20th century ] In the 17th century, Drancy was divided into two distinct villages: Drancy le Grand and le Petit Drancy. The village is built on the old location of the hamlet of Groslay which was surrounded by the forest of Bondy — hence the name of rue des Bois de Groslay. The end of nineteenth century was marked by the industrialisation and by the development of rail transports. During the Franco-Prussian war, Le Bourget was the site of an important battle and the castle of Ladoucette in Drancy was destroyed.
