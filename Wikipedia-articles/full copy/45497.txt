He was spotted by Ajax at the age of 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Good form led to an international call-up a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club Internazionale in 1993 where he had two disappointing seasons, before joining Arsenal in 1995. It was at Arsenal where Bergkamp rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three Premier League titles, four FA Cup trophies and reach the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, which marked his last appearance as a player. With the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp surpassed Faas Wilkes &apos;s record to become the Netherlands&apos; top goalscorer of all time in 1998, later surpassed by Patrick Kluivert. Bergkamp was selected by Pele as one of the FIFA 100 greatest living players and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in his generation. In 2007, he was inducted into the FIFA Hall of Fame, the first and so far only Dutch player ever to receive such honour. Bergkamp has also finished third in the FIFA World Player of the Year award twice. Due to his fear of flying, Bergkamp has been affectionately nicknamed the Non-Flying Dutchman by Arsenal supporters.

I can&apos;t do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can&apos;t explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can&apos;t fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can&apos;t sleep. The condition severely limited his ability to play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such that he would not travel at all. In the build up to Arsenal&apos;s Champions League match against Lyon in February 2001, Wenger spoke of his concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.

Sometimes just one, when others need two or three. &quot; &lt; /p &gt; ] Bergkamp was schooled in Total Football – a playing style and philosophy which relied on the complete versatility of the players who played it. This was primarily to maximise the footballer&apos;s potential; trying out every outfield position before finding one that suit them best. Every age group at Ajax played in the same style and formation as the first team – namely 3–4–3 – to allow individuals to slot in without effort, when moving up the pyramid. Bergkamp &quot; played in every position apart from goalie &quot; and believed he benefited from the experience of playing as a defender, as it helped him &quot; know how they think and how to beat them &quot;. When he made his debut as a substitute against Roda JC, Bergkamp was positioned on the right wing, where he remained for three years in the team. During his time at Internazionale, he was switched to a main striker, but failed to cooperate with partner Ruben Sosa, who he later called &quot; selfish &quot;. When Bergkamp joined Arsenal in 1995, he enjoyed a successful strike partnership with Ian Wright, and in later seasons Nicolas Anelka and Thierry Henry, playing in his preferred position as a second striker. The arrival of Marc Overmars in the 1997–98 season enhanced Bergkamp&apos;s play, as he was getting more of the ball – between August and October 1997, he scored seven goals in seven league matches. [ Palmer 81 ] A similar rapport was developed between him and Freddie Ljungberg during the 2001–02 season. Bergkamp throughout his playing career has been referred to as a &apos;cheat&apos; and &apos;dirty player&apos;, something his former manager Wenger has refuted.
