With John Heisman, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Pop Warner, Fielding H. Yost, and George Halas, Camp was one of the most accomplished persons in the early history of American football. He played college football at Yale College from 1876 to 1882. Camp served as the head football coach at Yale from 1888 to 1892 before moving to Stanford University, where he coached in December 1892 and in 1894 and 1895. Camp&apos;s Yale teams of 1888, 1891, and 1892 have been recognized as national champions. Camp was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951. [ Life ] Camp was born in the city of New Britain, Connecticut, the son of Leverett Lee and Ellen Sophia (Cornwell) Camp. He attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, entered Yale College in 1876, and graduated in 1880. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and Skull and Bones.

He worked for the New Haven Clock Company beginning in 1883, working his way up to chairman of the board of directors. On June 30, 1888, Camp married Alice Graham Sumner, sister of William Graham Sumner. They had two children: Walter Camp, Jr. (born 1891) who attended Yale as well and was elected as a member of Scroll and Key in 1912, and Janet Camp Troxell (born 1897).

He is credited with innovations such as the snap-back from center, the system of downs, and the points system, as well as the introduction of the now-standard offensive arrangement of players (a seven-man offensive line and a four-man backfield consisting of a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback). Camp was also responsible for introducing the &quot; safety &quot;, the awarding of two points to the defensive side for tackling a ball carrier in his own end zone followed by a free kick by the offense from its own 20-yard line (to change possession). This is significant, as rugby union has no point value award for this action, but instead awards a scrum to the attacking side five meters from the goal line and Rugby League awards the defense by receiving a drop out on the goal line by the team caught inside their goal area. In 2011, reviewing Camp&apos;s role in the founding of the sport and of the NCAA, Taylor Branch also credited Camp with cutting the number of players on a football team from 15 to 11 and adding measuring lines to the field. However, Branch noted that the revelation in a contemporaneous McClure&apos;s magazine story of &quot; Camp&apos;s $100,000 slush fund &quot;, along with concern about the violence of the growing sport (25 college players killed during the 1905 football season), helped lead to President Theodore Roosevelt &apos;s intervention in the sport. The NCAA emerged out of the national talks but worked to Yale&apos;s disadvantage relative to rival (and Roosevelt&apos;s alma mater ) Harvard, according to Branch. { Branch, Taylor, &quot; The Shame of College Sports &quot;, The Atlantic, September 14, 2011 (October 2011 issue). In 1905 in McClure&apos;s, Henry Beach Needham published two stories, &quot; The College Athlete: His Amateur Code: Its Evasion and Administration. &quot; (July; 25:3 p. 260) and &quot; The College Athlete: How Commercialism Is Making Him a Professional &quot; (June; 25:2) with Yale content, per &quot; The early history of football at Yale: Contemporary sources &quot;, Critical Sport Studies.

By the time of his death, he had written nearly 30 books and more than 250 magazine articles. His articles appeared in national periodicals such as Harper&apos;s Weekly, Collier&apos;s, Outing, Outlook, and The Independent, and in juvenile magazines such as St. Nicholas, Youth&apos;s Companion, and Boys&apos; Magazine. His stories also appeared in major daily newspapers throughout the United States. He also selected an annual &quot; All-American &quot; team. According to his biographer, Richard P. Borkowski, &quot; Camp was instrumental through writing and lecturing in attaching an almost mythical atmosphere of manliness and heroism to the game not previously known in American team sports. &quot; By the age of 33, twelve years after graduating from Yale, Walter Camp had already become known as the &quot; Father of American Football &quot;. In a column in the popular magazine Harper&apos;s Weekly, sports columnist Caspar Whitney had applied the nickname; the sobriquet was appropriate because, by 1892, Camp had almost single-handedly fashioned the game of modern American football. [ The Daily Dozen exercise regimen ] Camp was a proponent of exercise, and not just for the athletes he coached. While working as an adviser to the United States military during World War I, he devised a program to help servicemen become more physically fit. Walter Camp has just developed for the Naval Commission on Training Camp Activities a &quot; short hand &quot; system of setting up exercises that seems to fill the bill; a system designed to give a man a running jump start for the serious work of the day. It is called the &quot; daily dozen set-up, &quot; meaning thereby twelve very simple exercises. { &quot; A Daily Dozen Set-Up. Walter Camp&apos;s New Shorthand System of Morning Exercises &quot;, &apos;&apos;Outing&apos;&apos;, November 1918, p. 98 } Both the Army and the Navy used Camp&apos;s methods. { &quot; Walter Camp, Father of Football, &quot; Atlanta Constitution, September 19, 1920, p. 2D } The names of the exercises in the original Daily Dozen, as the whole set became known, were hands, grind, crawl, wave, hips, grate, curl, weave, head, grasp, crouch, and wing. As the name indicates, there were twelve exercises, and they could be completed in about eight minutes. { &quot; Camp&apos;s Daily Dozen Exercises, &quot; Boston Globe, July 11, 1920, p. 64 } A prolific writer, Camp wrote a book explaining the exercises and extolling their benefits. During the 1920s, a number of newspapers and magazines used the term &quot; Daily Dozen &quot; to refer to exercise in general. { Lulu Hunt Peters, &quot; Diet and Health: The Daily Dozens—Take &apos;Em. &quot; Los Angeles Times, June 8, 1927, p. A6 } Starting in 1921 with the Musical Health Builder record sets, Camp began offering morning setting-up exercises to a wider market. { &quot; Recent Acquisitions 2007 &quot;, National Library of Medicine, Walter Camp Musical Health Builder (New York, 1921).
