An accomplished storyteller, Berton was one of Canada&apos;s most prolific and popular author s. He wrote 50 books, including ones on popular culture, Canadian history, critiques of mainstream religion, anthologies, children&apos;s books and historical works for youth. [ Biography ] He was born on July 12, 1920, in Whitehorse, Yukon, where his father had moved for the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush. [ Gerard Warren He was &apos;all fire and sparkling with ideas&apos; Toronto Star Toronto A08-A09 Torstar 2004-12-01 2010-01-12 ] His family moved to Dawson City, Yukon in 1921, where they lived until moving to Victoria, British Columbia in 1932. His mother, Laura Beatrice Berton (née Thompson) was a school teacher in Toronto until she was offered a job as a teacher in Dawson City at the age of 29 in 1907. She met Frank Berton in the nearby mining town of Granville shortly after settling in Dawson and teaching kindergarten. Laura Beatrice Berton&apos;s autobiography of life in the Yukon entitled I Married the Klondike was published in her later years and gave her, what her son Pierre describes as &apos;a modicum of fame, which she thoroughly enjoyed.&apos; [ Starting Out, 1920-1947 Berton Pierre 1987 McClelland and Stewart Toronto 0-7710-1342-6 ] Like his father, Pierre Berton worked in Klondike mining camps during his years as a history major at the University of British Columbia, [ Parker Janice Craats, Rennay Writers http://books.google.com/books?id%3D_ncaoq19ajkC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA42 2 March 2011 2002-01-01 Weigl Educational Publishers 978-1-896990-90-3 42 ] where he also worked on the student paper The Ubyssey.

Berton himself was conscripted into the Canadian Army under the National Resources Mobilization Act in 1942 and attended basic training in British Columbia, nominally as a reinforcement soldier intended for The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. He elected to &quot; go Active &quot; (the euphemism for volunteering for overseas service) and his aptitude was such that he was appointed Lance Corporal and attended NCO school, and became a basic training instructor in the rank of corporal. Due to a background in university COTC and inspired by other citizen-soldiers who had been commissioned, he sought training as an officer. { Klondike Gold Rush } Berton spent the next several years attending a variety of military courses, becoming, in his words, the most highly trained officer in the military. He was warned for overseas duty many times, and was granted embarkation leave many times, each time finding his overseas draft being cancelled. A coveted trainee slot with the Canadian Intelligence Corps saw Berton, now a Captain, trained to act as an Intelligence Officer (IO), and after a stint as an instructor at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, he finally went overseas in March 1945. In the UK, he was told that he would have to requalify as an IO because the syllabus in the UK was different from that in the intelligence school in Canada. By the time Berton had requalified, the war in Europe had ended. He volunteered for the Canadian Army Pacific Force (CAPF), granted a final &quot; embarkation leave &quot;, and found himself no closer to combat employment by the time the Japanese surrendered in September 1945. Berton moved to Toronto in 1947. At the age of 31 he was named managing editor of Macleans. In 1957, he became a key member of the CBC &apos;s public affairs flagship program, Close-Up, and a permanent panelist on the popular television show Front Page Challenge.

Berton&apos;s television career included spots as host and writer on My Country, The Great Debate, Heritage Theatre, The Secret of My Success and The National Dream.

[ May 2010 ] He is a member of Canada&apos;s Walk of Fame, having been inducted in 1998. In The Greatest Canadian project, he was voted #31 in the list of great Canadians.
