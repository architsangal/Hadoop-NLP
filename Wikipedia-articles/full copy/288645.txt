She was launched on 11 November 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas J. McIntyre, and commissioned on 25 September 1971 with Commander William A. Kennington in command. [ Service history ] On the day of her commissioning, Sand  Lance s home port was changed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Charleston, South Carolina. She spent the remainder of 1971 on shakedown. She operated in the Charleston area for the whole of 1972, then, in February 1973, stood out of Charleston for special operations. She returned to Charleston on 21 April 1973, remained in port until 11 June 1973, and then departed again on special operations. She completed these operations in August 1973 and put in at Faslane Naval Base, Scotland, on 13 August 1973. Sand  Lance left Faslane on 20 August 1973 and arrived in Charleston on 5 September 1973. Sand Lance was sent to the Mediterranean to monitor shipping going through the Straits of Gibraltar during the October 1973 War (known in Israel as the Yom Kippur War). She then operated out of Charleston in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through at least June 1974. She went through overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in 1975 and 1976 (15 months). [ history from 1974 to 1994 January 2010 ] In 1994 Sand  Lance, moored ahead of one of her sister ship s, the attack submarine [ Grayling SSN-646 ], at Charleston, almost sank next to the pier due to flooding in the engine room lower level when a main seawater hull valve was being removed for maintenance. Plates called blanks which had been placed over her hull penetrations by divers to avoid flooding during removal of the valve had been placed over the wrong main seawater openings. The flooding was stopped, but not before most of the engine room lower level was flooded. [ history from 1994 to 1998 January 2010 ] In 1995, the Sand Lance left Charleston and found a new homeport in Groton Connecticut, where she became a member of Submarine Squadron 2. In 1996, the Sand Lance was sent on a patrol to the Arctic Circle. While there, the submarine surfaced through the polar ice cap at the North Pole on July 12. [ Decommissioning and disposal ] Sand  Lance was decommissioned on 7 August 1998 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 April 1998 and was completed on 30 August 1999.
