[ April 2012 ] [ October 2009 ] [ 1938 2 2 y ] { Chelmsford, } { United Kingdom } { Conservative } { Trinity Hall, Cambridge; } { King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford } (Peter) Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler, [ 56266 1 6 July 2001 ] PC (born 2 February 1938) is a British Conservative politician who was from 1981 to 1990 a member of Margaret Thatcher &apos;s Cabinet. [ Early life ] He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford, in the county of Essex; after which he did National Service as a Second Lieutenant in the Essex Regiment. Whilst studying at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association in Michaelmas 1960, in which term he entertained both the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary (and de facto Deputy Prime Minister, although he did not hold the title until 1962) Rab Butler. He then became a journalist, and worked on The Times. [ Member of Parliament ] [ In opposition ] During the mid 1970s Fowler was shadow Minister of Transport. In April 1976 he was photographed outside the Palace of Westminster having just taken delivery of his third four cylinder MG MGB GT, having reportedly rejected the idea of buying a V8 version on account of the cost. [ Ray Hutton (Ed) News: An MG for Shadow Minister Autocar 144 (nbr 4146) pages 27 date 24 April 1976 ] At a time when a recently promoted Minister of Transport had imputed ownership of the family car to his wife, apparently on grounds of political correctness, former journalist Fowler&apos;s acknowledgment of his choice of a sports car provided an interesting contrast. [ In government ] As Secretary of State for Transport, Fowler drove through Lord Nugent &apos;s 1981 bill to make seat belt s compulsory, a law that came into force in 1983.

Edwina Currie (Health) and John Major (Social Security) both served under him as junior ministers. [ Backbenches, retirement and Shadow Cabinet ] Fowler later resigned from the cabinet as Employment Secretary in January 1990, becoming the first politician to cite &quot; to spend more time with my (his) family &quot; as his reasoning. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/05/familyandrelationships Family first Guardian Unlimited Norman Fowler 2008-07-05 2008-09-29 ] Although it was the truth in Fowler&apos;s case, the expression later became a smokescreen for politicians who had quit high-profile roles for slightly more dark or controversial reasons. Having spent more time with his family, Fowler then returned twice to the Conservative front bench, first as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1992 to 1994, during which time he oversaw the Boundary Changes in the early 1990s, then as Shadow Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions Secretary in 1997 to 1998 and Shadow Home Secretary in 1998 to 1999. In 2001, he was made a life peer as Baron Fowler, of Sutton Coldfield, in the county of West Midlands. In 2003, he proposed that the European Union should appoint a high-level coordinator with ambassador ial rank to deal with the AIDS epidemic.

His book, A Political Suicide (Politico&apos;s Publishing ISBN 978-1-84275-227-2), was published in 2008 and it was shortlisted for the Channel 4 Political Book of the Year Award. [ Work in industry ] He has been deeply involved in industry, having been on the board of directors of several companies. He is Non-Executive Chairman of Aggregate Industries plc. { http://www.aggregate.com/about-us/the-board/lord-fowler/ } He is a member of the National Union of Journalists. { http://www.londonfreelance.org/fl/0005foi.html?i=flolder &amp; d=2000_05 } [ News International phone hacking scandal ] The Conservative peer had demanded an independent inquiry into the phone hacking inquiry on 7 July 2011. He was also chairman of the Birmingham Post newspapers for five years. He said that the UK was faced by &quot; one of the biggest scandals affecting the press in living memory &quot;.
