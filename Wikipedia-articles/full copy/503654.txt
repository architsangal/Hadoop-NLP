Normally, it extends south from the Wilmette terminal at Linden Avenue, passing through Evanston to Howard Street, on Chicago &apos;s northern city limits. In 2011, the average weekday boardings on the Purple Line was 40,859. [ Annual Ridership Report: Calendar Year 2011 http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/ridership_reports/2011-Annual.pdf Chicago Transit Authority 2012-05-31 ] The Purple Line operates weekdays 4 a.m. to 1 a.m., Saturdays 5 a.m. to 2 a.m., and Sundays 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. During weekday rush hours (approximately 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.), the Purple Line extends another [ 10.3 mi km ] south from Howard Street to downtown Chicago running express from Howard Street to Belmont Avenue, and then making all local stops to the Loop. The express service is known as the Purple Line Express, while the Linden-Howard shuttle service is the Purple Line Shuttle. { Train Schedules. Chicago Transit Authority. Retrieved on 2006-09-23. } Prior to the color-coding of CTA rail lines in 1993, the Purple Line was known as the Evanston Line, Evanston Service, or Evanston Shuttle, while the Purple Line Express was called the Evanston Express. Many Chicagoans still refer to the Purple Line by these names. { Purple Line. Chicago &quot; L &quot;.org. Retrieved on 2006-09-23. } The Purple Line is useful for reaching Northwestern University ( Davis, Foster, and Noyes stops in Evanston), including the athletic arenas ( Central Street ), and the Bahá&apos;í House of Worship (Linden stop). The selection of purple as the line&apos;s color was likely no accident, as Northwestern&apos;s official school color is purple. [ Operation ] [ Trackage ] Beginning at the Linden Avenue terminal in Wilmette, which contains a small storage yard and car service shop, the Purple Line traverses the North Shore area on private right-of-way which begins at street grade. Running southeasterly from Wilmette, the line rises past Isabella Street on the Wilmette-Evanston border then bridges the North Shore Channel immediately north of Central Street, the first stop in Evanston. The line, now on an elevated embankment, curves southward parallel to Sherman Avenue. Continuing south, the line enters downtown Evanston and stops at Davis, then curves southeasterly again to parallel Chicago Avenue and Metra &apos;s Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way to Clark Street just north of the CTA&apos;s Howard Yard facilities. Here the line crosses through the yard area before the junction with the Red Line and the Yellow Line. The tracks are split on grade separated structures to allow Yellow Line trains to enter the junction from the west. Immediately south of the yard lies the Howard Street terminal, where Red, Purple, and Yellow Line trains all terminate. There are four operational tracks starting at the Howard station, continuing on to the Armitage station. During weekday rush hours, the Purple Line runs express on the outermost tracks, skipping all stops until Belmont. At that point the Red and Purple Lines merge into two inner tracks, and meet the Brown Line on the outer local tracks at that point. From Belmont to Merchandise Mart, the Purple Line and Brown Line share the outside tracks and both make all stops along the route. South of Armitage, they are on a two track line on a 4-track structure. The reason the trains share two tracks on a four-track structure is that the exterior tracks deteriorated so much that they were no longer functional, abandoned and no longer necessary once the North Shore Line ceased operations in 1963. { Armitage Tower.

Beginning April 2, 2007, the Purple Line Express was rerouted onto the Outer Loop along with the Brown Line due to construction at Belmont and Fullerton stations (see below ). { CTA Outlines Plans for Three-Track Operation This Spring. Chicago Transit Authority. 2007-01-10. Retrieved on 2007-01-11. } Prior to this, Purple Line Express trains were occasionally diverted to the Outer Loop in the event of emergencies or signal problems in the Loop. On December 4, 2008, the CTA announced that Purple Line Express would return to the original Inner Loop routing on December 29. { Purple Express Trains to Resume Operating on Inner Loop Track December 29. Chicago Transit Authority. 2008-12-04.

Chicago Transit Authority. 2006-09-28. Retrieved on 2006-12-04. } For several years, southbound afternoon Purple Line Express trains stopped at the Addison Red Line station before weekday evening Chicago Cubs baseball games, in order to provide direct service to Wrigley Field for passengers from northern Chicago, Evanston, and Skokie. However, trains had to cross over to the inner Red Line tracks, as there is no platform access to the outer tracks at Addison. { CTA Best Choice for Baseball Fans Traveling to U.S. Cellular and Wrigley Field this Baseball Season. Chicago Transit Authority. 2006-03-21. Retrieved on 2007-01-11. } As a result of the Brown Line construction and in effort to minimize delays, trains now stop one station north at Sheridan before evening Cubs games. The station was constructed with two island platforms that can access the express tracks, eliminating the need for trains to switch over. { CTA Provides Service to Wrigley Field This Baseball Season.

The Purple Line stations at Davis and Main are immediately to the east of their Metra counterparts, while the Washington/Wells, Quincy, LaSalle/Van Buren, and Randolph/Wabash stations on the express leg are within walking distance of Metra trains at Ogilvie Transportation Center, Union Station, LaSalle Street Station, and Millennium Station, respectively. [ Operating fleet ] Currently, the Purple Line is almost entirely operated with Boeing-Vertol -built 2400-series rail cars. { CTA Car Assignments. Chicago &quot; L &quot;.org. Retrieved on 2007-09-16. } Although the 2400-series cars were scheduled for retirement in 2010 with the delivery of new Bombardier -built 5000-series cars, delivery of the 5000-series cars in large numbers has been delayed to later in 2011. In spring 2007, small numbers of Morrison-Knudsen -built 3200-series rail cars were transferred to the line, { 3200-series cars at Linden. Flickr. 2007-07-29. Retrieved on 2007-07-30. } replacing Budd -built 2600-series rail cars transferred to other assignments. The Purple Line Shuttle usually runs four cars while the Purple Line Express runs six cars, although lengths of trains on the shuttle service can vary due to special circumstances and events. [ History ] [ The Northwestern Elevated era ] The Evanston Line was placed in operation on May 16, 1908 between Central Street, Evanston and the Loop when the former Northwestern Elevated Railroad extended its mainline service over leased electrified steam railroad trackage owned by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. { Borzo, Greg (2007). The Chicago &quot; L &quot;. Arcadia Publishing, p. 80. ISBN 0-7385-5100-7. } On April 2, 1912, the line reached its present-day terminal at Linden Avenue, Wilmette. The new terminal was established without permission of Wilmette residents, who feared rail service would encourage construction of large apartment buildings in the affluent community. { Borzo, Greg (2007). The Chicago &quot; L &quot;. Arcadia Publishing, p. 81. ISBN 0-7385-5100-7. } In 1922, the surface level section of the North Side &apos;L&apos; was elevated onto a concrete embankment structure between Leland Avenue and Howard Street, and was expanded from two to four tracks, thus allowing complete express service from Wilmette and Evanston to downtown Chicago. Several segments of the Evanston Branch itself ran at street level until 1928, when it was elevated onto a concrete embankment between Church Street and the North Shore Channel. It was placed in operation on January 29, 1928. { Borzo, Greg (2007). The Chicago &quot; L &quot;. Arcadia Publishing, p. 84. ISBN 0-7385-5100-7. } Nine stations existed after Howard, including a station at Calvary. That station was closed in 1931 and replaced by a new station at South Boulevard to the north. { Calvary.

Local service was restricted between Linden Avenue and Howard Street, operating at all times. The express service ran weekday rush hours only, stopping at all Evanston stations, Howard, Morse (formerly Rogers Park), Loyola, Wilson, Chicago, Merchandise Mart, and then all Loop stations. While skip-stop service was also introduced at this time, Evanston trains continued to make all stops at their respective stations. { &quot; CTA will start new skip-stop service on &apos;L&apos;; north and south routes affected in plan. &quot; Chicago Daily Tribune. 1949-06-30. } An express surcharge was also instituted for customers traveling to and from the Loop past Howard. Several attempts were made to reduce or eliminate the fare, backed by local politicians. { &quot; CTA passes up cut in express &apos;L&apos; train fare. &quot; Chicago Daily Tribune. 1957-09-06. } Right-of-way and trackage used by the Evanston Branch and the North-South Route (today&apos;s Red Line) between Leland Avenue and the Wilmette terminal was purchased by the CTA in 1953 from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. { &quot; CTA will buy &apos;L&apos; segment and asks bond bids. &quot; Chicago Daily Tribune. 1953-10-10. } In turn, the railroad received $7 million USD in CTA revenue bond s. { &quot; Rail buys CTA bonds, sells &apos;L&apos; right of way. &quot; Chicago Daily Tribune. 1953-10-17. } Midday and Saturday Loop Express service was discontinued in the 1950s and the local shuttle service began using one-man operations with single unit cars in the 1960s. On July 16, 1973, the Isabella station was closed, bringing the total number of stations on the Evanston branch to eight. { Isabella. Chicago &quot; L &quot;.org. Retrieved on 2006-09-23. } On November 8, 1973, the third rail system was installed on the Evanston Branch between South Boulevard in Evanston and the Wilmette terminal. Prior to this, Evanston shuttle trains had to be equipped with trolley poles and power collected through overhead catenary wires (similar to the Yellow Line before its conversion to third rail in 2004). The conversion to third rail allowed the CTA to retire the 4000-Series, which were nearly fifty years old, and put newer cars on the line. Since parts of the line are at grade level, some community members initially resisted the conversion and worried the proximity of the rail would be hazardous. { &quot; Residents hit CTA hot rail plan. &quot; Connie Lauerman. Chicago Tribune. 1973-06-07. } By the end of 1976, the additional stops after Howard were eliminated, and the Evanston Express ran nonstop between Howard and Merchandise Mart. The CTA cited complaints about delays in service due to the extra stops as justification for their removal. { &quot; Express &apos;L&apos; ends stops at 2 stations. &quot; Chicago Tribune. 1976-12-09. } However, on January 20, 1989, express trains once more began making additional stops outside the Loop, at the Belmont, Fullerton, and Chicago stations, partly in order to relieve overcrowding on the rapidly-growing Ravenswood (later Brown) Line. By the end of the 1990s, trains would make all stops between Belmont and the Loop. { &quot; Evanston Express adds stops Jan. 20. &quot; Chicago Tribune. 1988-11-04. } The express surcharge was eventually dropped in 1997 as an incentive for customers to use the new TransitCard system. { &quot; CTA to drop surcharge with use of new transit card. &quot; Jon Hilkevitch.

Trains departed Linden for downtown one hour earlier in the morning rush and one hour later in the evening rush. { The CTA announces bus and rail service improvements.

The poor condition of the century-old viaducts forced the implementation of permanent slow zones and were a point of contention for many Evanston politicians. They claimed CTA had secured funds and promised to begin replacing the viaducts starting in 1999, but had diverted the funds to other projects. The CTA responded that it only provided projected uses and had not committed the money to any specific purpose. { &quot; Legislators snub CTA over Evanston repairs; rebuilding sought of 6 old viaducts. &quot; Courtney Flynn. Chicago Tribune. 2003-06-20. } The Main Street viaduct was completely replaced over the weekend of November 12–13, 2005, requiring the temporary shutdown of the Purple Line.

Chicago Transit Authority. 2007-09-14. Retrieved on 2007-09-16. } The express service has often been targeted for elimination during service purges due to its &quot; auxiliary &quot; nature compared to other CTA rail lines, the rationalization being that there are readily available, albeit slower, alternatives along its entire route. One of the first moves at halting express service came in 1973 { &quot; CTA cuts 18 bus routes, 23 &apos;L&apos; stations. &quot; Tom Buck, Edward Schreiber. Chicago Tribune. 1973-01-16. } while one of the most recent was in 2005, when threatened service cuts included the Purple Line Express. { Chicago Transit Board Selects Reduced Service Plan. Chicago Transit Authority. 2005-04-13 Retrieved on 2006-09-23. } The CTA budget crisis continued into 2007, and the Purple Line Express was once again selected as one of several routes to be eliminated if additional funding was not provided. The suggested service cuts would have taken effect September 17, 2007. { CTA Outlines Contingency Plan. Chicago Transit Authority. 2007-05-24. Retrieved on 2007-07-30. } However, the final plan retained the downtown service, making the stop at the Sheridan station permanent to supplement the Red Line and provide additional capacity on the system following the elimination of thirty-nine bus routes. Express operation would be a day-to-day decision; if the Red Line was deemed too crowded, Purple Line Express trains would make all local stops between Howard and Belmont, resuming the regular route at that station. { Service Reductions and Fare Increases Effective September 16, 2007.

Beginning April 2, 2007, operation on the Purple, Brown, and Red Lines between Addison and Armitage was restricted to three tracks, down from the previous four, due to construction at the Fullerton and Belmont stations. Because of this, fewer trains operated to downtown during the rush period in order to prevent a bottleneck. Only every other train was sent to the Loop during rush periods; all other trains operated between Linden and Howard only. { Linden Purple Line Timetable. Chicago Transit Authority. 2007-03-02.

This line was returned to the Inner Loop in Spring 2009. [ Future ] One form of the CTA&apos;s &quot; Circle Line &quot; plan would call for a rerouting of the Purple Line Express service. Rather than continue to the Loop along with the Brown Line, trains would follow the Red Line after Belmont, making a stop at Fullerton and all current Red Line subway stops and terminate at a new station on Wentworth before heading north. However, this is merely a study and the final form of the Circle Line and its effects on current CTA rail service, if the project begins at all, remain to be seen. { Loop the Loop - Proposal for new Circle Line.
