Directed by George Sluizer and starring Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, the film is about the disappearance of a young Dutch woman and her lover&apos;s obsessive search. In France the film was released under the title L&apos;homme qui voulait savoir (The Man Who Wanted to Know). On the film&apos;s American release in 1990, The Vanishing received great critical acclaim from film critics. Sluizer later remade the film for an English version in 1993, but the remake was poorly received.

As they are driving, Saskia tells Rex of a recurring dream that she had, in which she is drifting through space in a golden egg. She tells Rex that this time there was someone else in another golden egg, and that if they were to collide, everything would be over. She said that being stuck in the golden egg was terrifying loneliness. Their car runs out of gas and they are stranded inside a tunnel. They quarrel for a while, but make up and eventually get going again. Later they stop at a petrol station, where Saskia goes into the shop for drinks and never returns. Rex waits, getting more worried and nervous by the minute as Saskia does not emerge. He soon starts to question people if they have seen her, but no one has any idea as to where she is. The only clue he has is a blurred photo he took of the surrounding area, in which he can just barely make out her red hair in a group of people next to the gas station entrance. Rex cannot accept his loss and spends the next three years compulsively looking for her. He has a new girlfriend, Lieneke (Gwen Eckhaus), but she becomes so fed up with Rex&apos;s obsession to understand Saskia&apos;s ultimate fate that she leaves him. His quest even results in him explaining her story on television, revealing that he had the same dream as Saskia about the golden egg, and this has inspired him to continue searching. In a series of intermittent flashbacks, Raymond Lemorne ( Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu ), a respectable, middle-class chemistry teacher — and Saskia&apos;s kidnapper — appears both alone and with his family, intricately plotting and planning his scheme to kidnap a random woman. Eventually, Raymond, fascinated by Rex&apos;s fanatical compulsion to know what happened to Saskia, confronts Rex and admits to kidnapping her. He explains that he felt the need to test himself, to find out whether he could commit what he considered the ultimate act of evil. Rex&apos;s ultimate curiosity concerning Saskia keeps him from killing Raymond, which Raymond is fully aware of. Raymond finally invites Rex to the very same park and gas station where Saskia disappeared, and simply tells Rex that if he drinks a cup of coffee, which he tells Rex is spiked, he will experience what happened to Saskia. Rex eventually drinks the concoction, passes out, and wakes up in a coffin buried under the earth. His own disappearance soon makes the headline of a local newspaper.

The film is faithful to the novel changing two factors. The film&apos;s plot is more complicated than the novel, including more flashbacks and a change in the film&apos;s character focus. { Mathijs, 2004. p.178 } The second major difference is that the characters Rex Hofman and Raymond Lemorne spend more time together after meeting up. { Mathijs, 2004. p.178 } [ Release and reception ] { European Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &apos;&apos;The Vanishing&apos;&apos;. } The Vanishing was released in the Netherlands on October 27, 1988.
