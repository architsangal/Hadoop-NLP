Kansas State is the oldest public university in the state of Kansas, and saw a record high enrollment of 23,588 students for the Fall 2011 semester. A branch campus is located in Salina, Kansas, housing the College of Technology and Aviation. Another branch campus, known as the Olathe Innovation Campus, is presently under construction in Olathe, Kansas. When completed, the Olathe facility will be the academic research presence within the Kansas Bioscience Park, and will research bioenergy, animal health, plant science and food safety and security. [ K-State Olathe Innovation Campus, Inc. http://kstateoic.ksu.edu/ English 2009-04-30 ] The university is classified as a research university with high research (RU/H) by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. [ History ] Kansas State University, originally named Kansas State Agricultural College, was founded on February 16, 1863, during the American Civil War, as a land-grant institution under the Morrill Act. [ Willard Julius History of Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science Kansas State College Press 1940 http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c%3Dhearth%3Bcc%3Dhearth%3Brgn%3Dfull%20text%3Bidno%3D5725255%3Bdidno%3D5725255%3Bview%3Dimage%3Bseq%3D0003%3Bnode%3D5725255%3A3 ] The school was the first land-grant college created under the Morrill Act. K-State is the third-oldest school in the Big 12 Conference and the oldest public university in the state of Kansas. The effort to establish the school began in 1861, when Kansas was admitted to the United States. One of the new state legislature&apos;s top priorities involved establishing a state university. That year, the delegation from Manhattan introduced a bill to convert Blue Mont Central College (a private college incorporated in Manhattan in 1858) into the state university. [ Willard Julius Bluemont Central College, the Forerunner of Kansas State College Kansas Historical Quarterly May 1945 http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1945/45_6_willard.htm 2008-01-29 ] But the bill establishing the university in Manhattan was controversially veto ed by Governor Charles L. Robinson of Lawrence, and an attempt to override the veto in the Legislature failed by two votes. [ Griffin C.S. The University of Kansas and the Years of Frustration, 1854–64 http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1966/66_1_griffin.htm 2006-10-06 ] In 1862, another bill to make Manhattan the site of the state university failed by one vote. Finally, upon the third attempt on February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan&apos;s offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds and established the state&apos;s land-grant college at the site – the institution that would become Kansas State University. When the college opened for its first session on September 2, 1863, it became only the second public institution of higher learning to admit women and men equally in the United States. Enrollment for the first session totaled 52 students: 26 men and 26 women. [ 19th century ] The college in 1878 The early years of the institution witnessed debate over whether the college should provide a focused agricultural education or a full liberal arts education. During this era, the tenor of the school shifted with the tenure of university presidents. For example, President John A. Anderson (1873–1879) favored a limited education and President George T. Fairchild (1879–1897) favored a classic liberal education. [ Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History Standard Publishing Co. 1912 http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/a/agricultural_college.html 2009-01-13 ] Fairchild was credited with saying, &quot; Our college exists not so much to make men farmers as to make farmers men. &quot; During this era, in 1873, Kansas State helped pioneer the academic teaching of home economics for women, becoming one of the first two colleges to offer the program of study. [ Craig Hazel Stover Blanche The History of Home Economics 1946 http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c%3Dhearth%3Bcc%3Dhearth%3Brgn%3Dfull%20text%3Bidno%3D5725268%3Bdidno%3D5725268%3Bview%3Dimage%3Bseq%3D7%3Bnode%3D5725268%3A5%3Bpage%3Droot%3Bsize%3Ds%3Bfrm%3Dframeset%3B 5 2009-09-01 0-585-06199-8 ] [ History of the K-State College of Human Ecology http://www.humec.k-state.edu/about/history-college.php 2009-09-01 ] In 1874, the college also became the first in the United States to offer printing courses, which led to journalism courses being launched in 1910; thus, today&apos;s A.Q. Miller School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communications, though no longer teaching printing, has the nation&apos;s longest continuously offered curriculum in mass communication. [ November 2011 ] [ 20th and 21st century ] The name of the school changed in 1931 to &quot; Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science &quot;. In 1959, the Kansas legislature changed the name again to &quot; Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Science &quot; to reflect a growing number of graduate programs, though, even in Kansas state legal matters, it is interchangeably referred to as Kansas State University. [ University Archives Facts and Flyers http://www.lib.k-state.edu/depts/spec/flyers/ 2008-03-05 ] { http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_76/Article_4/ } Milton S. Eisenhower served as president of the university from 1943 to 1950, and Dr. James McCain succeeded him, serving from 1950 to 1975. Several buildings, including residence hall s and a student union, were added to the campus in the 1950s. The 1960s witnessed demonstrations against the Vietnam War, though fewer than at other college campuses. Enrollment was relatively high through most of the 1970s, but the university endured a downward spiral from approximately 1976 to 1986, when enrollment decreased to 17,570 and a number of faculty resigned. In 1986, Jon Wefald assumed the presidency of Kansas State University. During his tenure, enrollment and donations increased. { Dickens Hall, from a 1907 postcard } On June 15, 2009, Kirk Schulz became the 13th president of Kansas State University. { Kansas State Collegian Schulz begins new term } In March 2010 he announced his K-State 2025 plan. { K-State News Services &quot; K-State beginning ambitious plan for next 15 years to be a top 50 public university &quot; } The initiative is designed to elevate K-State to a top 50 nationally recognized research university by 2025. [ Historic buildings ] [ List of oldest buildings on Kansas colleges and universities ] The university moved from the location of Blue Mont Central College to its present site in 1875. The original site is now occupied by Central National Bank of Manhattan, Kansas, and Founders Hill Apartments. Holtz Hall, built in 1876, was the first new building erected after the move and is now the oldest free-standing building on campus. The signature building at Kansas State University, Anderson Hall, developed in three stages between 1877 and 1885. Anderson Hall, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has housed the university&apos;s administrative offices for more than a century.

The College of Technology and Aviation is located at the Salina campus, and is commonly referred to as K-State Salina. K-State is also known for several distinguished lecture series: Landon Lecture, Lou Douglas Lecture, Huck Boyd Lecture, and Dorothy L. Thompson Civil Rights Lectures. In recent years, the Landon Lecture Series has had high profile speakers, including President George W. Bush, President Bill Clinton, Former Mexican President Vicente Fox and Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. K-State implemented an academic honor code in 1999. [ KSU Honor Code http://www.k-state.edu/honor 2007-03-02 ] When students are admitted, it is implied that they will adhere to the Honor Pledge: &quot; On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work. &quot; [ Research and cultural resources ] { Hale Library } [ Agriculture ] The university has had a long-standing interest in agriculture, particularly native Great Plains plant and animal life. The Kansas State University Gardens is an on-campus horticulture display garden that serves as an educational resource and learning laboratory for K-State students and the public. The Konza Prairie is a native tallgrass prairie preserve located south of Manhattan, which is co-owned by The Nature Conservancy and Kansas State University and operated as a field research station by the department of biology.
