[ tonnage ] [ ton ] The ton is a unit of measure. It has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years. It is used principally as a unit of weight, and as a unit of volume. It can also be used as a measure of energy, for truck classification, or as a colloquial term. It is derived from the tun, the term applied to a barrel of the largest size. This could contain a volume between 210 and 256 gallon s (800 to 1000 L), which could weigh around 2,000 pounds (900  kg) and occupy some [ 60 cuft m3 on ] of space. [ http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/narmain/narmain.html Naval Architecture for All United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics October 13, 2008 ] {. &quot; Historically, a very important and standard cargo for European sailing vessels was wine, stored and shipped in casks called tuns. These tuns of wine, because of their uniform size and their universal demand, became a standard by which a ship&apos;s capacity could be measured. A tun of wine weighed approximately 2,240 pounds, and occupied nearly 60 cubic feet. &quot; ( } { Gillmer, Thomas (1975). Modern Ship Design. United States Naval Institute.) &quot; Today the ship designers standard of weight is the long ton which is equal to 2,240 pounds. &quot; } In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as [ 2240 lb kg 0 ] ( avoirdupois pound s ).

From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units, including the tonne (metric ton), a non-SI metric unit defined as 1000  kg. The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms, including the ton and the term &quot; metric ton &quot; for &quot; tonne &quot; { A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units, edited by Donald Fenna, Oxford University Press }. In the United States and Canada [ http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-6/index.html Weights and Measures Act: Canadian units of measure Department of Justice 2011-07-06 ] a ton is defined to be [ 2000 lb kg 0 ]. Where confusion is possible, the 2240  lb ton is called &quot; long ton &quot; and the 2000  lb ton &quot; short ton &quot;; the tonne is distinguished by its spelling, but usually pronounced the same as ton, hence the US term &quot; metric ton &quot;. In the UK the final &quot; e &quot; of &quot; tonne &quot; is pronounced (/ˈtʌnɪ/) { The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. lists both /tʌn/ and /ˈtʌnɪ/ as pronunciations of &quot; tonne &quot;. }, or &quot; metric ton &quot; when it is necessary to make the distinction. Where accuracy is required the correct term must be used, but for many purposes this is not necessary: the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6%, and the short ton is within 10% of both. The ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech. The term &quot; ton &quot; is also used to refer to a number of units of volume, ranging from [ 35 to 100 cuft m3 on ] in capacity. It can also be used as a unit of energy, expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt, TNT detonated, or in refrigeration, ice melted. In Britain ton is used in slang in several contexts to mean &quot; 100 &quot;. As a cost or a speed, a ton is widely understood to be £100 or 100 mph { The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. lists colloquial use of &quot; ton &quot; from 1946 for £100, and later 100 mph, and for 100 in general. }. [ Units of mass/weight ] There are several similar units of mass or volume called the ton: [ In the UK &quot; ton &quot; (2240  lb) and &quot; tonne &quot; are usually pronounced the same, /tʌn/. As they only differ by 2%, ambiguity is not necessarily a problem; where accuracy is required in speech, &quot; long ton &quot; or exaggerated pronunciation of &quot; tonne &quot; emphasising the &quot; e &quot;, /ˈtʌnɪ/, are used. uktonne lower-alpha ] [ 2240 lb kg 7 on on ] [ 2000 lb kg 7 on ] [ 1000 kg lb 7 on ] [ The longweight and shortweight tons were used as a means of making an allowance for wastage in an industrial process. The workman is provided with a longweight ton and is expected to return a shortweight ton of processed product. These measures were particulary used in the operation of hammering iron blooms into shape.

[ lower-alpha ] [ Others ] The long ton is used for petroleum products such as aviation fuel. Deadweight ton (abbreviation &apos;DWT&apos; or &apos;dwt&apos;) is a measure of a ship&apos;s carrying capacity, including bunker oil, fresh water, ballast water, crew and provisions. It is expressed in tonnes (1000  kg) or long tons (2240 pounds, about 1016  kg). This measurement is also used in the U.S. tonnage of naval ships. Increasingly, tonne s are being used rather than long tons in measuring the displacement of ships. See tonnage. Harbour ton used in South Africa in the 20th century, 2000 pounds or one short ton. Both the long ton and the short ton are 20 hundredweight, being 112 and 100 pounds respectively. Before the twentieth century there were several definitions. Prior to the 15th century in England, the ton was 20  hundredweight, each of 108  lb, giving a ton of [ 2160 lb kg ]. [ October 2009 ] In the nineteenth century in different parts of Britain, definitions of 2240, 2352, and 2400  lb were used, with 2000  lb for explosives; the legal ton was usually 2240  lb { Definitions of 2000, 2240, 2352, and 2400  lb are included in citations listed in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. OED cites an 1858 dictionary of trade products &quot; the legal ton by weight is usually 20 cwt &quot;. }. Assay ton (abbreviation &apos;AT&apos;) is not a unit of measurement, but a standard quantity used in assay ing ores of precious metals; it is [ 29 1 6 ] grams (short assay ton) or [ 32 2 3 ] grams (long assay ton), the amount which bears the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bears to a troy ounce. In other words, the number of milligrams of a particular metal found in a sample of this size gives the number of troy ounces contained in a short or long ton of ore. In documents that predate 1960 the word ton is sometimes spelled tonne, but in more recent documents tonne refers exclusively to the metric ton. In nuclear power plant s tHM and MTHM mean tonnes of heavy metals, and MTU means tonnes of uranium. In the steel industry, the abbreviation THM means &apos;tons/tonnes hot metal&apos;, which refers to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced, particularly in the context of blast furnace production or specific consumption. A dry ton or dry tonne has the same mass value, but the material ( sludge, slurries, compost, and similar mixtures in which solid material is soaked with or suspended in water ) has been dried to a relatively low, consistent moisture level ( dry weight ). If the material is in its natural, wet state, it is called a wet ton or wet tonne. [ Units of volume ] [ Tonnage ] The displacement, essentially the weight, of a ship is traditionally expressed in long ton s. To simplify measurement it is determined by measuring the volume, rather than weight, of water displaced, and calculating the weight from the volume and density. { Displacement ton Dictionary of international trade retrieved 22July2010 } For practical purposes the displacement ton (DT) is a unit of volume, [ 35 cuft 4 ], the approximate volume occupied by one ton of seawater (the actual volume varies with salinity and temperature) { A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units, Donald Fenna, 2002, ISBN 0-19-860522-6 }. It is slightly less than the 224 imperial gallons (1.018  m 3 ) of the water ton (based on distilled water ). One measurement ton or freight ton is equal to [ 40 cuft 4 ], but historically it has had several informal definitions. It is sometimes abbreviated as &quot; MTON &quot;.

In the past it has been used for a cargo ship but the register ton is now preferred. It is correctly abbreviated as &quot; FT &quot; [ July 2010 ] but some users are now using freight ton to represent a weight of [ 1 t kg lb 0 in ], thus the more common abbreviations are now M/T, MT, or MTON (for measurement ton), which still cause it to be confused with the tonne, or even the megatonne. The register ton is a unit of volume used for the cargo capacity of a ship, defined as [ 100 cuft m3 4 ]. It is often abbreviated RT or GRT for gross registered ton (The former providing confusion with the refrigeration ton). It is known as a tonneau de mer in Belgium, but, in France, a tonneau de mer is [ 1.44 m3 cuft 4 ]. The Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) is based on net tonnage, modified for Panama Canal billing purposes. PC/UMS is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel&apos;s total volume; a PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity. { &apos;&apos;Panama Canal Tolls&apos;&apos;, } { Panama Canal Authority. Retrieved 10 May 2006. } The water ton is used chiefly in Great Britain, in statistics dealing with petroleum products, and is defined as [ 224 impgal cuft m3 4 ] { NIST: Units and Systems of Measurement Their Origin, Development, and Present Status }, the volume occupied by [ 1 long ton lb kg 0 ] of water under the conditions that define the imperial gallon. [ Units of energy and power ] [ Ton of TNT ] [ TNT equivalent ] A ton of TNT or tonne of TNT is a unit of energy equal to 10 9 (thermochemical) calorie s, also known as a gigacalorie (Gcal), equal to 4.184 gigajoule s (GJ). A kiloton of TNT or kilotonne of TNT is a unit of energy equal to 10 12 calories, also known as a teracalorie (Tcal), equal to 4.184 terajoules (TJ). A megaton of TNT (1,000,000 metric tonnes) or megatonne of TNT is a unit of energy equal to 10 15 calories, also known (infrequently) as a petacalorie (Pcal), equal to 4.184 petajoules (PJ). Note that these are small calories (cal). The dietary calorie (Cal) is distinct and equal to one kilocalorie (Kcal), and is gradually being replaced by the latter correct term. Early values for the explosive energy released by trinitrotoluene (TNT) ranged from 900 to 1100 calories per gram. In order to standardise the use of the term TNT as a unit of energy, an arbitrary value was assigned based on 1000 calories ( [ 1 kcal 3 on or out ] ) per gram. Thus there is no longer a direct connection to the chemical TNT itself. It is now merely a unit of energy that happens to be expressed using words normally associated with mass (e.g., kilogram, tonne, pound). { GC(42)/INF/3 - Measures to Strengthen Co-operation in Nuclear, Radiation and Waste Safety } { Radioactive residues of the Cold War period } The definition applies for both spellings: ton of TNT and tonne of TNT. Measurements in tons of TNT have been used primarily to express nuclear weapon yield s, though they have also been used since in seismology as well. [ Ton of oil equivalent ] A ton of oil equivalent (TOE) is a conventional value, based on the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil, of 41.868 GJ, 11.63 MWh, 1.28 TCE, 39.68 million BTU, or 6.6 - 8.0 actual barrels of oil (depending on actual specific gravity). { José Goldemberg and Oswaldo Lucon. 2010. London: Earthscan. pp20 } [ Ton of coal equivalent ] A ton of coal equivalent or tonne of coal equivalent (TCE) is a conventional value of 7  Gcal (IT) = 29.3076  GJ. [ Refrigeration ] The unit ton is used in refrigeration and air conditioning to measure heat absorption. Prior to the introduction of mechanical refrigeration, cooling was accomplished by delivering ice. Installing one ton of refrigeration replaced the daily delivery of one ton of ice.

Michon 2006-09-01 ] In North America, a standard ton of refrigeration is. &quot; The heat absorption per day is approximately the heat of fusion of 1  ton of ice at. &quot; Marks&apos; Standard handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 8th Ed., McGraw Hill, p. 19–3 This is approximately the power required to melt one short ton ( ) of ice at in 24  hours, thus representing the delivery of 1 ton of ice per day. A less common usage is the power required to cool 1 long ton ( ) of water by every 10 minutes = 13,440  BTU/h ≈ 3939  W. A refrigeration ton should be regarded as power produced by a chiller when operating in standard AHRI conditions, which are typically [ 44 °F ] for chilled water unit, and [ 95 °F ] air entering the condenser. This is commonly referred to as &quot; true ton &quot;. Manufacturers can also provide tables for chillers operating at other chilled water temperature conditions (as [ 65 °F or ] ) which can show more favorable data, which are not valid when making performance comparisons among units unless conversion rates are applied. [ January 2011 ] The refrigeration ton is commonly abbreviated as RT. [ Informal tons ] Ton is also used informally, often as slang, to mean a large amount of something (material or not), for example, &quot; Man, I just ate a ton of french fries back there &quot;. In Britain, a ton is colloquially used to refer to 100 of a given unit. Ton can thus refer to a speed of 100 miles per hour, and is prefixed by an indefinite article, e.g. &quot; Lee was doing a ton down the motorway &quot;; to money e.g. &quot; How much did you pay for that? &quot; &quot; A ton &quot; (£100); to 100 points in a game e.g. &quot; Eric just threw a ton in our darts game &quot; (in some games, e.g. cricket, more commonly called a century); or to a hundred of pretty much anything else.
