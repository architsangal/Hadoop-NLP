Like many other technological innovations, each of several companies made an attempt to produce a television recording standard that the majority of the world would embrace. At the peak of it all, the home video industry was caught up in a series of videotape format war s. Two of the formats, VHS and Betamax, received the most media exposure. VHS would eventually win the war, and therefore succeed as the dominant home video format, lasting throughout the tape format period.

The earliest of these formats, Laserdisc, was not widely adopted, but the subsequent DVD format eventually did achieve mass acceptance and replaced VHS as the preferred method of distribution after 2000.

[ History ] JVC HR-3300EG - a revision of the world&apos;s first VHS-based VCR. The original HG-3300 released in Japan lacked the LED display and button-based programming. In 1971, JVC engineers Yuma Shiraishi and Shizuo Takano led the effort in developing the VHS tape format. [ http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/20/world/shizuo-takano-68-an-engineer-who-developed-vhs-recorders.html Shizuo Takano, 68, an Engineer Who Developed VHS Recorders The New York Times 1992-01-20 2011-07-11 Andrew Pollack ] JVC originally collaborated with Sony Corporation and Matsushita Electric (aka Panasonic, National in Japan) in building a home video standard for the Japanese consumer. [ http://www.ce.org/Press/CEA_Pubs/941.asp VCR Ce.org 2011-07-11 ] Soon after, Sony and Matsushita broke away from the collaboration effort, in order to work on video recording formats of their own. Sony started working on Betamax, while Matsushita started working on VX. By the end of 1971, JVC produced an internal document titled VHS Development Matrix. In the document, it listed twelve objectives in building a home video recording unit. [ http://www.rickmaybury.com/Altarcs/homent/he97/vhstoryhtm.htm VHS STORY - Home Taping Comes of Age Rickmaybury.com 1976-09-07 2011-07-11 ] Suddenly, the commercial video recording industry in Japan took a financial hit. As a result, JVC cut its budgets and restructured its video division - even going as far as shelving the VHS project. However, despite the lack of funding for the VHS project, Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project in secrecy. By 1973, the two engineers successfully produced a functional prototype. In 1974, the Japanese government started a standards war of its own. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) attempted to force the Japanese video industry to standardize on just one recording format, for the sake of saving the country from consumer confusion of having too many video formats on the market to choose from. [ Bylund Anders http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2010/01/is-the-end-of-the-format-wars-upon-us.ars The format wars: of lasers and (creative) destruction Arstechnica.com 2010-01-04 2011-07-11 ] Later, Sony had a functional prototype of the Betamax format, and was very close to releasing a finished product. With this prototype, Sony persuaded the MITI to adopt Betamax as the standard, and allow it to license the technology to other companies. JVC believed that an open standard worked in the best interest of the consumer, as sharing the format among competitors without licensing the technology was better for the consumer. To prevent the MITI from adopting Betamax, JVC made an attempt to have other companies accept VHS, and thereby work against Sony and the MITI. { John Howells. &quot; The Management of Innovation and Technology: The Shaping of Technology and Institutions of the Market Economy &quot; [hardcopy], pg 76-81 } It was a major key to have Matsushita on-board because Matsushita was Japan&apos;s largest electronics manufacturer at the time. JVC succeeded in persuading Matsushita to back the VHS format because Matsushita was afraid to allow Sony to become a leader, and Betamax could only record one hour of video. Matsushita&apos;s backing of JVC persuaded Mitsubishi and Sharp to back the VHS standard as well. Sony&apos;s release of its Betamax unit to the Japanese market in 1975 placed further pressure on the MITI to side with the company. However, the collaboration of JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi and Sharp was much stronger, and eventually lead the MITI to drop its push for an industry standard. [ Initial releases of VHS-based devices ] The first VCR to use VHS was the Victor HR-3300, and was introduced by the president of JVC at the Okura Hotel on September 9, 1976. [ http://www.nipponsei.jp/n-hajimete/n-hajimete009.html Always Helpful!

The United States received its first VHS-based VCR - the RCA VBT200 on August 23, 1977. [ http://www.cedmagic.com/history/vbt200.html CED in the History of Media Technology Cedmagic.com 1977-08-23 2011-07-11 ] The RCA unit was designed by Matsushita, and was the first VHS-based VCR manufactured by a company other than JVC. The United Kingdom later received its first VHS-based VCR - the Victor HR-3300EK in 1978. { Fast-forward to oblivion as VCRs take only 5% of market } Quasar and General Electric would follow-up with VHS-based VCRs - all designed by Matsushita. [ http://vintageelectronics.betamaxcollectors.com/panasonicvhsgallery.html Panasonic VHS VCR Gallery Vintageelectronics.betamaxcollectors.com 2011-07-11 ] By 1978, Matsushita alone produced just over half of all Japanese VCRs. { Cusumano, MA, Mylonadis, Y. and Rosenbloom, RS (1992) &quot; Strategic Manoeuvring and Mass Market Dynamics: VHS over Beta &quot;, Business History Review, pg 88 } [ Technical details ] [ Cassette and tape design ] Bottom view of VHS with magnetic tape exposed Top view of VHS with front casing removed The VHS cassette is a 187  mm wide, 103  mm deep, 25  mm thick plastic shell held together with five Phillips head screws. The flip-up cover that protects the tape has a built-in latch with a push-in toggle on the right side (see bottom view image). The VHS cassette also includes an anti-despooling mechanism (see the top view): several plastic parts near the front label end of the cassette between the two spools. The spool brakes are released by a push-in lever within a 6.35  mm hole accessed from the bottom of the cassette, about 19.05  mm in from the edge label. There is a clear tape leader at both ends of the tape to provide an optical auto-stop for the VCR transport mechanism. A light source is inserted into the cassette through the circular hole in the center of the underside when loaded in the VCR, and two photodiode s are located to the left and right sides of where the tape exits the cassette. When the clear tape reaches one of these, enough light will pass through the tape to the photodiode to trigger the stop function; in more sophisticated machines it will start rewinding the cassette when the trailing end is detected. Early VCRs used an incandescent bulb as the light source, which regularly failed and caused the VCR to erroneously think that a cassette is loaded when empty, or would detect the blown bulb and stop functioning completely. Later designs use an infrared LED which had a much longer lifetime. The recording media is a 12.7  mm wide magnetic tape wound between two spools, allowing it to be slowly passed over the various playback and recording heads of the video cassette recorder. The tape speed is 3.335  cm/s for NTSC, 2.339  cm/s for PAL. VHS M-loading system. As with almost all cassette-based videotape systems, VHS machines pull the tape from the cassette shell and wrap it around the head drum which rotates at 1800  rpm in NTSC machines [ http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/vcr2.htm How VCRs Work 2011-02-10 2011-02-10 Marshall Brain HowStuffWorks 3 7 ] and at 1500  rpm for PAL. VHS machines, in contrast to Betamax and Beta&apos;s predecessor U-matic, use an &quot; M-loading &quot; system, also known as M-lacing, where the tape is drawn out by two threading posts and wrapped around more than 180 degrees of the head drum (and also other tape transport components) in a shape roughly approximating the letter M. [ Tracking adjustment and index marking ] Another linear control track, at the tape&apos;s lower edge, holds pulses that mark the beginning of every frame of video; these are used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback and to get the rotating heads exactly on their helical tracks rather than having them end up somewhere between two adjacent tracks (a feature called tracking ). Since good tracking depends on the exact distance between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the linear tracks, which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches. The control can additionally hold index marks. These are normally written at the beginning of each recording session, and can be found using the VCR&apos;s index search function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the nth specified index mark, and resume playback from there. There was a time when higher-end VCRs provided functions for manually removing and adding these index marks — so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the television program — but this feature has become hard to find in recent models. By the late 1990s, some high-end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic&apos;s Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) both on the cassette and in the VCR&apos;s memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles). { Panasonic Video Cassette Recorder NV-HS960 Series Operating Instructions, VQT8880, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. } [ Recording capacity ] { VCR showing the drum and tape. } A VHS cassette holds a maximum of about 430 m (1,410  ft.) of tape at the lowest acceptable tape thickness, giving a maximum playing time of about 4 hours in an DF480 for NTSC and five hours in an E-300 for PAL at &quot; standard play &quot; (SP) quality. Other speeds include &quot; long play &quot; (LP) (Not all VCRs include this record mode), and &quot; extended play &quot; (EP) or &quot; super long play &quot; (SLP); For NTSC, LP and EP/SLP doubles and triples the recording time accordingly, but these speed reductions cause a slight reduction in video quality - from the normal 250 lines in SP, to 230 analog lines horizontal. Also, video recorded onto tapes at the lower speed often exhibit poor playback performance on recorders other than the one they were produced on. As a result, commercial pre-recorded tapes were almost always recorded in SP mode. In some cases, budget labels such as Video Treasures (both LP and EP), Starmaker (EP), Burbank Video (LP), Avid Home Entertainment (EP), GoodTimes Entertainment (LP), and even Disney (LP) and Paramount (EP) commonly used a slower speed to reduce the amount of tape required as a cost-saving method. [ Video recording ] VHS tapes have approximately 3 MHz of video bandwidth and 400  kHz of chroma bandwidth, which is achieved at a relatively low tape speed by the use of helical scan recording of a frequency modulated luminance (black and white) signal, with a down-converted &quot; color under &quot; chroma (color) signal recorded directly at the baseband. Each helical track contains a single field (&apos;even&apos; or &apos;odd&apos; field, equivalent to half a frame) encoded as an analog raster scan, similar to analog TV broadcasts. The horizontal resolution is 170 lines per scanline, and the vertical resolution (the number of scanlines) is the same as the respective analog TV standard (576 for PAL or 486 for NTSC ). In modern-day digital terminology, VHS is roughly equivalent to 333x480 pixels luma and 40x480 chroma resolutions (333x480 pixels=159,840 pixels or 0.16MP (1/6 of a MegaPixel)). [ Taylor Jim DVD demystified McGraw-Hill Professional 2005 0-07-142396-6 9–36 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DikxuL2aX9cAC ] JVC would counter 1985&apos;s SuperBeta with VHS HQ, or High Quality. The frequency modulation of the VHS luminance signal is limited to 3 megahertz which makes higher resolutions impossible, but an HQ branded deck includes luminance noise reduction, chroma noise reduction, white clip extension, and improved sharpness circuitry. The effect was to increase the apparent horizontal resolution of a VHS recording from 240 to 250 analog (equivalent to 333 pixels from left-to-right, in digital terminology). The major VHS OEM s resisted HQ due to cost concerns, eventually resulting in JVC reducing the requirements for the HQ brand to white clip extension plus one other improvement. In 1987 JVC introduced a new format called Super VHS which extended the bandwidth to over 5 megahertz, yielding 420 analog horizontal (560 pixels left-to-right). [ Audio recording ] [ Original linear system ] In the original VHS format, audio was recorded as baseband in a single linear track, at the upper edge of the tape, similar to how an audio compact cassette operates. The recorded frequency range was dependent on the linear tape speed. For the VHS SP mode, this resulted in a mediocre frequency response of roughly 100  Hz to 10  kHz. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was an acceptable 42 dB. Both parameters degraded significantly with VHS&apos;s longer play modes, with EP frequency response peaking at 4  kHz. Audio cannot be recorded on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, even in the audio dubbing mode. If there is no video signal to the VCR input, the VCR will record black as well as generate a control track while the audio is being recorded. More expensive decks offered stereo audio recording and playback. Linear stereo, as it was called, fit two independent channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack. While this approach preserved acceptable backward compatibility with monoaural audio heads, the splitting of the audio track degraded the signal&apos;s SNR to the point that audible tape hiss was objectionable at normal listening volume. To counteract tape hiss, decks applied Dolby B noise reduction for recording and playback. Dolby B dynamically boosts the mid-frequency band of the audio program on the recorded medium, improving its signal strength relative to the tape&apos;s background noise floor, then attenuates the mid-band during playback. Dolby B is not a transparent process, and Dolby-encoded program material will exhibit an unnatural mid-range emphasis when played on non-Dolby capable VCRs. High-end consumer recorders took advantage of the linear nature of the audio track, as the audio track could be erased and recorded without disturbing the video portion of the recorded signal. Hence, &quot; audio dubbing &quot; and &quot; video dubbing &quot;, where either the audio or video are re-recorded on tape (without disturbing the other), were supported features on prosumer linear video editing -decks. Without dubbing capability, an audio or video edit could not be done in-place on master cassette, and requires the editing output be captured to another tape, incurring generational loss. Studio film releases began to emerge with linear stereo audiotracks in 1982. From that point onward nearly every home video releases by Hollywood featured a Dolby-encoded linear stereo audiotrack. However, linear stereo was never popular with equipment makers or consumers. [ Hi-Fi audio system ] Around 1984, JVC added Hi-Fi audio to VHS (in response to Betamax&apos;s introduction of Beta Hi-Fi.) Both VHS Hi-Fi and Betamax Hi-Fi delivered flat full-range frequency response (20  Hz to 20  kHz), excellent 70 dB signal-to-noise ratio (in consumer space, second only to the compact disc ), dynamic range of 90 dB, and professional audio -grade channel separation (more than 70dB). VHS Hi-Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation (AFM), recording each of the 2 stereo channels (L, R) on a frequency-modulated carrier and embedding the modulated audio signal pair into the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS&apos;s implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called depth multiplexing. The modulated audio carrier pair was placed under the luminance carrier (below 1.6  MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal over the same tape surface, but video signal&apos;s higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use this same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head&apos;s signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head&apos;s signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process was audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP or SP.) Since JVC had gone through the complexity of ensuring Hi-Fi&apos;s backward compatibility with non-Hi-Fi VCRs, virtually all studio home video releases contained Hi-Fi audio tracks, in addition to the linear audio track. Under normal circumstances, all Hi-Fi VHS VCRs will record Hi-Fi and linear audio simultaneously to ensure compatibility with VCRs without Hi-Fi playback, though only early high-end Hi-Fi machines provided linear stereo compatibility. Due to the path followed by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous—unlike that of the linear audio track—head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing. { Is VHS Hi-Fi sound perfect? Is Beta Hi-Fi sound perfect? } The problem is known as &quot; head chatter, &quot; and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down. The sound quality of Hi-Fi VHS stereo is comparable to the quality of CD audio, particularly when recordings were made on high-end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio recording level control. This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as compact cassette attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists. Home recording enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo mixdown s and master recording s from multitrack audio tape onto consumer-level Hi-Fi VCRs. However, because the VHS Hi-Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR&apos;s video-recording function, advanced editing functions such as audio-only or video-only dubbing are impossible. Some VHS decks also had a &quot; simulcast &quot; switch, allowing users to record an external audio input along with off-air pictures. Some televised concerts offered a stereo simulcast soundtrack on FM radio and as such, events like Live Aid were recorded by thousands of people with a full stereo soundtrack despite the fact that stereo TV broadcasts were some years off (especially in regions that adopted NICAM ). Other examples of this included network television shows such as Friday Night Videos and MTV for its first few years in existence. The considerable complexity and additional hardware limited VHS Hi-Fi to high-end decks for many years. While linear stereo all but disappeared from home VHS decks, it was not until the 1990s that Hi-Fi became a more common feature on VHS decks. Even then, most customers were unaware of its significance and merely enjoyed the better audio performance of the newer decks. [ Variations ] { Victor S-VHS (left) and S-VHS-C (right). } VHS-C adapter [ Super-VHS / ADAT / SVHS-ET ] [ S-VHS D-VHS ] Several improved versions of VHS exist, most notably Super-VHS (S-VHS), an analog video standard with improved video bandwidth. S-VHS improved the luminance resolution to 400 horizontal lines (versus 250 for VHS/Beta and 500 for DVD). The audio-system (both linear and AFM) is the same. S-VHS made little impact on the home market, but gained dominance in the camcorder market due to its superior picture quality. The ADAT format provides the ability to record multitrack digital audio using S-VHS media. JVC also developed SVHS-ET technology for its Super-VHS camcorders and VCRs, which simply allows them to record Super VHS signals onto lower-priced VHS tapes, albeit with a slight blurring of the image. Nearly all Super-VHS camcorders and VCRs made today have SVHS-ET ability. [ VHS-C / Super VHS-C ] [ VHS-C ] Another variant is VHS-Compact (VHS-C), originally developed for portable VCRs in 1982, but ultimately finding success in palm-sized camcorder s. The longest tape available holds 60 minutes in SP mode and 180 minutes in EP mode. Since VHS-C tapes are based on the same magnetic tape as full size tapes, they can be played back in standard VHS players using a mechanical adapter, without the need of any kind of signal conversion. The magnetic tape on VHS-C cassettes is wound on one main spool and uses a gear wheel to advance the tape. The adapter does not require a battery to function and is solely a mechanical adapter. It has an internal hub to engage with the VCR mechanism in the location of a normal full-size tape hub, driving the gearing on VHS-C cassette. Also when a VHS-C cassette is inserted into the adapter, a small swing-arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard tape path distance between the guide rollers of a full-size tape. This allows the miniature cassette to use the same tape loading mechanism of the full-size tape. Super VHS-C or S-VHS Compact was developed by JVC in 1987. S-VHS provided an improved luminance and chrominance quality, yet S-VHS recorders were compatible with VHS tapes. [ Damjanovski Vlado CCTV Butterworth-Heinemann 2005 0-7506-7800-3 238 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DMQZQIFaOhgoC ] Sony Betamax was unable to shrink that form any further, so instead they developed Video8/Hi8 which was in direct competition with the VHS-C/S-VHS-C format throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. Ultimately neither format &quot; won &quot; and both continue to be sold in the low-end market (examples: JVC SXM38 and Sony TRV138). [ W-VHS / Digital-VHS (high-definition) ] [ W-VHS D-VHS ] W-VHS allowed recording of MUSE Hi-Vision analog high definition television, which was broadcast in Japan from 1989 until 2007. The other improved standard, called Digital-VHS (D-VHS), records digital high definition video onto a VHS form factor tape. D-VHS can record up to 4 hours of ATSC digital television in 720p or 1080i formats using the fastest record mode (equivalent to VHS-SP), and up to 40 hours of standard definition video at slower speeds. [ D9 ] [ Digital-S ] There is also a JVC-designed component digital professional production format known as Digital-S, or officially under the name D9, that uses a VHS form factor tape and essentially the same mechanical tape handling techniques as an S-VHS recorder. This format is the least expensive format to support a Sel-Sync pre-read for video editing. This format is most notably used by Fox for some of its cable networks. [ Accessories ] Shortly after the introduction of the VHS format, VHS tape rewinders were developed. These devices served the sole purpose of rewinding VHS tapes. Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the rewind function on the standard VHS player would lead to kinks in the tape that would affect playback quality. Many lower end VCR&apos;s would leave the tape wound around the video head whilst rewinding or fast forwarding, so the rewinders were of some benefit on these machines, to save additional tape and head wear. The rewinder would rewind the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard rewind function on VHS players. However some rewinder brands did have some frequent abrupt stops, which occasionally led to tape damage. Some devices were marketed which allowed a personal computer to use a VHS recorder as a data backup device. The most notable of these was ArVid, widely used in Russia and CIS states. In the United States similar systems were manufactured by Corvus and Alpha Microsystems. { Videotrax: New System To Back Up Hard Disks. InfoWorld, May 26, 1986. } Also available was Backer from Danmere Ltd. of England. [ Signal standards ] VHS can record and play back all varieties of analog television signals in existence at the time VHS was devised. However, a machine must be designed to record a given standard. Typically, a VHS machine can only handle signals of the country it was sold in. The following signal varieties exist in conventional VHS: SECAM /625/25 (SECAM, French variety) MESECAM /625/25 (most other SECAM countries, notably the former Soviet Union and Middle East) NTSC /525/30 (Most parts of Americas, Japan, South Korea) PAL /525/30 (i.e., PAL-M, Brazil) PAL /625/25 (most of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, many parts of Asia such as China and India, some parts of South America such as Argentina, Uruguay and the Falklands, and Africa) Note that PAL/625/25 VCRs allow playback of SECAM (and MESECAM) tapes with a monochrome (black and white) picture (and vice-versa) as the line standard is the same.Since the 1990s, dual- and multi-standard VHS machines have become more and more common. These can handle VHS tapes of more than one standard. For example, regular VHS machines sold in Australia and Europe nowadays can typically handle PAL, MESECAM for record and playback, plus NTSC for playback only (provided the TV is able to display NTSC&apos;s 525/30 line standard - most [ March 2012 ] can). Dedicated multistandard machines can usually handle all standards listed, some high end models can even convert the content of a tape from one standard to another on-the-fly during playback by using a built-in standards converter. S-VHS only exists in PAL/625/25 and NTSC/525/30. S-VHS machines sold in SECAM markets record internally in PAL, and convert to/from SECAM during record/playback, respectively. Likewise, S-VHS machines for the Brazilian market record in NTSC and convert to/from PAL-M. A small number of VHS decks are able to decode closed captions on prerecorded video cassettes. A smaller number still are able, additionally, to record subtitles transmitted with world standard teletext signals (on pre-digital services), simultaneously with the associated program. [ Tape lengths ] Both NTSC and PAL/SECAM VHS cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. In order to avoid confusion, manufacturers indicate the playing time in minutes that can be expected for the market the tape is sold in. It is perfectly possible to record and play back a blank T-XXX tape in a PAL machine or a blank E-XXX tape in an NTSC machine, but the resulting playing time will be different from that indicated. To calculate the playing time for a T-XXX tape in a PAL machine, use this formula:PAL/SECAM Recording Time = T-XXX in minutes * (6.6/4.69) And to calculate the playing time for an E-XXX tape in an NTSC machine, use this formula:NTSC Recording Time = E-XXX in minutes * (4.69/6.6) Some new Panasonic NTSC/ATSC recorders also include a Very long Play (VP) mode which is not part of the official specification. It enables recordings at 1/5 the SP speed, such that a T-180 holds 3*5 == 15 hours.

[ VHS single ] VHS single, also known as videotape single or Video 45s (a play on the term &quot; 45 &quot; when used to describe vinyl records ) is a music single, using a standard-sized VHS cartridge. The format has existed since the early 1980s. In 1983, British synthpop band The Human League released the UK&apos;s first commercial video single on both VHS and Betamax as &quot; The Human League Video Single &quot;. { Virgin Records 1983 } It was not a huge commercial success due to the high retail price of £10.99, compared to £1.99 for a vinyl single. The VHS single format gained higher levels of mainstream popularity when Madonna released &quot; Justify My Love &quot; as a video single in 1990 following the blacklisting of the video by MTV. [ December 2009 ] U2 also released &quot; Numb &quot;, the lead single from their 1993 album Zooropa as a video single. [ Was this video single the big success? December 2009 ] Despite the success of these releases, the video single struggled as its releases were relatively periodical, the technology slowly being superseded first by CD Video (which proved unsuccessful due to the cost of capable LaserDisc players to play the video portion), music CDs with computer-accessible video files, then, by the early 2000s, by both DVD single s and CD+DVD releases. [ Other uses ] VHS was also commonly included in various products and services - including exercise equipment, kitchen appliances, and even computer software. Corporations used the VHS format to deliver addresses made by company executives to regional offices. Manufacturers would send out VHS tapes to their service centers, to demonstrate how to repair a new product. And retail stores would play VHS tapes demonstrating a product on a television set, requiring a VCR that supported encore function replay or auto rewind play. [ VHS vs. Betamax ] [ Videotape format war ] Size comparison between Betamax (top) and VHS (bottom) videocassettes. MII, VHS, and S-VHS are distinct from above......the undersides are more similar. VHS was the winner of a protracted and somewhat bitter format war during the late 1970s and early 1980s against Sony&apos;s Betamax format, as well as other formats of the time. Betamax was widely perceived at the time as the better format, as the cassette was smaller in size, and Betamax offered slightly better video quality than VHS —it had lower video noise, less luma-chroma crosstalk, and was marketed as providing pictures superior to those of VHS. However, the sticking point for both consumers and potential licensing partners of Betamax was the total recording time. To overcome the recording limitation, B-II speed (two-hour mode, NTSC regions only) was released in order to compete with VHS&apos;s two-hour SP mode, thereby reducing Betamax&apos;s horizontal resolution to 240 lines (vs 250 lines). [ Video Interchange Video History http://www.videointerchange.com/video-history.htm#BetaMax 2007-08-20 ] In turn, the extension of VHS to VHS HQ produced 250 lines (vs 240 lines), so that overall a typical Betamax/VHS user could expect virtually identical resolution. (Very high-end Betamax machines still supported recording in the B-I mode and some in an even higher resolution B-Is (B-I Super HiBand) mode, but at a maximum single-cassette run time of 1:40 [with an L-830 cassette].) Because Betamax was released more than a year before VHS, it held an early lead in the format war. However, by 1981, United States&apos; Betamax sales had dipped down to only 25-percent of all sales. [ Helge Moulding The Decline and Fall of Betamax http://tafkac.org/products/beta_vs_vhs.html 2007-08-20 ] A debate continues between pundits over the cause of Betamax&apos;s loss. Some say - including Sony&apos;s founder Akio Morita - that it was due to Sony&apos;s licensing strategy with other manufacturers, which consistently kept the overall cost for a unit higher than a VHS unit, and that JVC allowed other manufacturers to produce VHS units license-free and keep cost lower. [ http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html The Betamax vs VHS Format War Mediacollege.com 2008-01-08 2011-07-11 ] Others say that VHS had better marketing, since the much larger electronics companies at the time (Matsushita, for example) were on-board with VHS. [ Decline ] The VHS VCR was a mainstay in the TV-equipped living room for more than a decade, but is being replaced by newer technologies. For time shifting (off the air or cable/satellite taping), hard-drive based digital video recorder s have replaced the VCR as the time shifting device of choice, especially in households with subscriber-based TV services. The home camcorder market, one which VHS shared with alternative formats, has already transitioned to digital-video recording. But the largest impact on the VHS format was the introduction of the DVD format to American consumers in March of 1997. { &apos;&apos; &quot; Parting Words For VHS Tapes, Soon to Be Gone With the Rewind &quot; &apos;&apos;, Washington Post, August 28, 2005. } For home-video (that is, pre-recorded commercially-released movies, etc.) rental and sales, DVD has almost completely taken the place of VHS. At most electronics retailers, choice among VHS equipment is increasingly shrinking. New sales are focused on DVD-recorders and subscriber-based DVRs (such as TiVo ). Most electronics chains have stopped stocking VHS home-video releases, focusing only on DVD and Blu-ray Disc technology. Major Hollywood studios no longer issue releases on VHS. The final major Hollywood motion picture released on VHS in the United States was David Cronenberg &apos;s 2005 film A History of Violence.

Kugler is President and co-owner of Distribution Video Audio, a seller of distressed goods such as VHS tapes. According to Kugler, &quot; It&apos;s dead, this is it, this is the last Christmas, without a doubt. I was the last one buying VHS and the last one selling it, and I&apos;m done.

[ http://www.paranormalactivity.nl/nieuws.php The Official Dutch Site of Paranormal Activity 26 October 2011 ] Although VHS has quickly faded from mainstream home-video, a VCR is still owned in many US households. The Washington Post noted that as of 2005, 94.5 million Americans still owned VHS format VCRs. Many people hold on to their VHS-VCR for nostalgy reasons, because many movies only exist in that format or because their wedding movies or videos of other personal events in their life are still in VHS. In May 2012 the New York Times reported that VHS format stays popular in immigrant communities since movies are still available for next to nothing.

Though occasionally showing compression artifact s and color banding that are common discrepancies in digital media, the durability and longevity of a VCD depends on the production quality of the disc, and its handling. The data stored digitally on a VCD theoretically does not degrade (in the analog sense like tape.) In the disc player, there is no physical contact made with either the data or label sides. And, when handled properly, a VCD will last a long time. However, in practice, the surfaces of the disc do get touched by the operator&apos;s hand, causing body oil and dirt to collect on the disc, and eventually transfer to the lens and motor inside of the player, if not cleaned before use. Also, when used in an industrial or commercial environment when a disc is handled hundreds or thousands of times during its life, wear on the plastic can occur if the disc is not handled properly. VCD is susceptible to disc rot. Since a VCD can only hold 70 minutes of video, a movie exceeding that mark has to be divided into two or more discs. This format is currently popular in developing countries. [ DVD ] The DVD-Video format was introduced first, in 1996, in Japan, to the United States in March 1997 (Test Marketed) and mid-late 1998 in Europe and Australia. Despite DVD&apos;s better quality (480 typical versus 250 lines horizontal resolution), VHS is still (as of 2012) somewhat widely used in home recording of video content, due to the large installed base and the lower cost of VHS recorders and tape (compared to DVD). The commercial success of DVD recording and re-writing has been hindered by a number of factors including: [ http://desktopvideo.about.com/od/creatingdvds/f/dvdnoburn.htm Why Won&apos;t My DVDs Burn Desktopvideo.about.com 2011-03-21 2011-07-11 ] [ Jim Taylor http://dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#1.41 Why doesn&apos;t disc X work in player Y? Dvddemystified.com 2011-07-11 ] [ January 2011 ] A reputation for being temperamental and unreliable, as well as the risk of scratches and hairline cracks. Incompatibilities in playing discs recorded on a different manufacturer&apos;s machines to that of the original recording machine. Shorter recording time: Up to six hours on a single-layer disc (with sub-VHS quality) versus approximately 12 hours on a T-240/DF480 tape in EP. Compression artifacts: MPEG-2 video compression can result in visible artifacts such as macroblocking, mosquito noise and ringing which become accentuated in extended recording modes (more than three hours on a DVD-5 disc). Standard VHS will not suffer from any of these problems, all of which are characteristic of certain digital video compression systems (see DCT ) but VHS will result in reduced luminance resolution, which makes the picture look horizontally blurred (resolution decreases further with LP and EP recording modes). [ Blu-ray Disc ] A newer optical disc format is Blu-ray Disc, which is the designed successor to DVD. (A competing format to Blu-ray was HD DVD, which was withdrawn from the market, conceding to Blu-ray.) A single Blu-ray Disc can hold up to 128GB (over 25 times the capacity of a single-layered DVD) of information including up to 1080p High-definition video, high definition photos, music, and more. [ High-capacity digital recording technologies ] High-capacity digital recording systems are also gaining in popularity with home users. These types of systems come in several form factors: Hard disk -based set-top box es Hard disk/ optical disc combination set-top boxes Personal computer -based media center Portable media players with TV-out capability Hard disk-based systems include TiVo as well as other digital video recorder (DVR) offerings. These types of systems provide users with a no-maintenance solution for capturing video content. Customers of subscriber-based TV generally receive electronic program guides, enabling one-touch setup of a recording schedule. Hard disk-based systems allow for many hours of recording without user-maintenance. For example, a 120 GB system recording at an extended recording rate (XP) of 10 Mbit/s MPEG-2 can record over 25 hours of video content. However, the DVR technology does not allow for portability or long-lasting storage.
