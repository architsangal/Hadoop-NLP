[ Early life ] Colin Mochrie was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, the oldest of three children. He was shy as a child, stating that neighbours would have commented that he &quot; watched way too much television. &quot; [ Bridget Byrne http://news.google.com/newspapers?id%3DWDwVAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DbAgEAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D6694%2C4786788 Comedian keeps track of Santa Ocala Star-Banner December 24, 2000 7D ] In 1964, his family moved to a French neighbourhood just outside Montreal, Quebec, and five years later moved again to Vancouver, British Columbia.

He was hooked when he got his first laugh, which paved the way for a career in entertainment. After graduating from high school, where he was valedictorian, [ Guy MacPherson http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/cmochrie2.htm Colin Mochrie Interview The Comedy Couch November 27, 2007 2009-07-13 ] Mochrie attended the Studio 58 theatre school in Vancouver for four years, where he discovered the art of improvisational comedy. [ Bridget Byrne Improv crew popping up San Antonio Express-News 4F S.A. Life December 22, 2000 ] [ Career ] [ Improvisational beginnings ] Upon graduation from Studio 58, Mochrie found his first line of work as a member of the Vancouver TheatreSports League. He started working with the group in 1980. Fame was slow to start, as Mochrie &quot; literally had to pull people out of McDonald&apos;s to come see the shows. &quot; Mochrie originally had parts in plays while working for the group, though after a time working for the TheatreSports League became a full-time job for Mochrie. He met fellow improv comedian Ryan Stiles during this time. He was visiting a mutual friend in New Zealand when Stiles was doing comedy at Punchlines. After the two met, Stiles and Mochrie began working at TheatreSports together. It has been stated that the two met while members of Second City, [ Serena Markstrom Improv troupe rolls with it and rocks the house Eugene Register-Guard 14 June 15, 2007 2009-07-13 ] though, according to Mochrie, this is untrue. Following Expo &apos;86, Mochrie ended his tenure with the Vancouver TheatreSports League and moved to Toronto. Once there, Mochrie auditioned for The Second City comedy troupe, where Stiles was working.

The two were married in 1989 and had a son, Luke, in 1990. Mochrie worked for The Second City for three years, co-writing and starring in three productions and directing three seasons of their national touring company. As a member of the touring company, he performed in many skits, including one where he and two others are at a bar, and they help him to rewrite an anecdote from his youth involving his father taking him to a baseball game; and a five-minute version of a James Bond movie, complete with Mochrie in a downhill ski chase and parachuting off a cliff.

In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, but did not make the cut. [ Helen Branswell Toronto Comic Becomes British Celeb Toronto Star B4 August 25, 1996 ] Mochrie has stated that audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself chance to stand out.

He appeared on one episode and was again let go. [ Rob Salem Beating Hollywood at its own game E1 August 9, 1998 Toronto Star 2009-11-11 ] The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and remained a cast member until the show&apos;s end in 1998. After the British version of the show ended its run, Mochrie joined the American version of Whose Line hosted by Drew Carey on ABC. He was brought on alongside Ryan Stiles, who was also a regular member of the UK cast. [ ABC charts new series strategy Rob Salem Toronto Star July 19, 1998 1 ] Mochrie appeared on every episode from its debut in August 1998 to its finale in 2006. He noted his favorite sketches as &quot; Scenes From a Hat &quot;, where he would have to act out scenes written up by audience members, and &quot; Whose Line &quot; where he and Stiles would act out a sketch and have to add in lines written on pieces of paper. [ Who is Colin Mochrie Anyway? Peggy Hill Northern Stars Magazine August 27, 2000 ] He felt that his weak spots were the musical segments and the &quot; Hoedown &quot; sketch, which he said was the only time during the show when he felt total fear. Mochrie, who could not sing, usually spoke his lines instead of singing them. His co-stars on the show would frequently mock him for being Canadian and for his receding hairline, though this did not come until later as very early on in the UK version, Mochrie still had a fairly full head of hair. Instead, the bald jokes were done at the expense of the UK host, Clive Anderson. In the American version, he would often perform the female role in certain frequently-performed skits, such as &quot; Whose Line &quot; and &quot; Two Line Vocabulary &quot;. In the few times he played the man in the scene, the producers were making further fun of his baldness (e.g. Colin was Samson, and Ryan was his girlfriend, and Samson had lost all his strength because Ryan had cut off his hair). He would also be cast as the anchor in the &quot; Newscasters &quot; segment (along with Greg Proops and Brad Sherwood), wherein he would frequently begin by announcing himself with a fictitiously humorous name (e.g. Jose Canyousee) and continue with a fake news report that ended in an unexpected and pun-laden segue. According to his agent Jeff Andrews, during the airing of Whose Line Mochrie was better known in Canada as a &quot; commercial king &quot;, performing as characters such the Detergent Crusader for Sunlight detergent. In March 2005, a Nabisco advertising campaign starred Mochrie as the &quot; Snack Fairy &quot;, in which he wears a ballet tutu over ordinary slacks and a shirt. At the end of each commercial, he declares &quot; Snack happy! &quot; and waves his scepter while sporting a smile. Mochrie remained active elsewhere during his tenure as a Whose Line member. In early 1994, he played the role of Mike Brady in a musical version of The Brady Bunch, directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fueled, jittery, and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in his hand on the show. [ Jamie Tennant Here&apos;s the story of a play named Brady The Hamilton Spectator February 3, 1994 11 ] Shortly before his move to the U.S. version of Whose Line in 1998, Mochrie starred in Supertown Challenge as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed. [ 1999–present ] In an interview, it was revealed that in 1999 Mochrie worked on the Miloš Forman film Man on the Moon, but his scenes were deleted from the final movie. [ http://www.sbindependent.org/node/192 An Interview with...Colin Mochrie Ian Rice Stony Brook Independent March 2, 2005 September 2, 2010 ] Mochrie in 2006 Mochrie starred in the Canadian comedy series Blackfly. He appeared in This Hour Has 22 Minutes on CBC Television from 2001 through 2003, and on the WB Television Network series Drew Carey&apos;s Green Screen Show in 2004. Mochrie starred in Getting Along Famously in 2006. He was a guest star in three episodes of The Drew Carey Show : &quot; She&apos;s Gotta Have It &quot; (1999), &quot; Drew Live &quot; (1999), and &quot; Drew Live II &quot; (2000). He also appeared on Nickelodeon &apos;s Figure It Out as a celebrity guest panelist; in one segment of the show, he was slimed. He had a one-liner in the &quot; Bad Hare Day &quot; episode of Goosebumps, and he made special guest appearances in several episodes of The Red Green Show. In 2003, Mochrie, Leslie Nielsen, Wayne Gretzky, and Roy Halladay appeared in print and television advertisements to encourage people to visit Toronto after the SARS outbreak that struck the city. In May 2004, he hosted a tongue-in-cheek guide to surviving animal attacks on Animal Planet known as Wild Survival Guide. He has done a commercial supporting Habitat For Humanity. He appeared briefly in a commercial for Buckley&apos;s Cough Syrup, and he was featured in a commercial for New York Fries, manning a steamroller. He appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as the superhero Overly Sensitive Man (inspired from Whose Line). By 2004 Mochrie was appearing in so many media spots that a new Canadian television series, Corner Gas, made light of it by having him do a cameo appearance in the tenth episode. The gag had Mochrie appear shortly after the character Brent mentioned that Mochrie has a cameo in nearly everything. In 2005, Mochrie appeared in &quot; Burnt Toast &quot;, a series of eight comedic mini-operas, each depicting a different stage of a romantic relationship in a contemporary setting, produced by Canada&apos;s Rhombus Media. He also appeared in an episode of The Surreal Gourmet. Along with Rosie O&apos;Donnell, Mochrie hosts a video introduction to a tour of the bakery in the Pacific Wharf area of Disney California Adventure Park. In the video, he helps explain how sourdough bread is made. On December 25, 2005, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation premièred the TV movie The Magical Gathering. Mochrie starred in this, and his son Luke co-starred as Mochrie&apos;s character at a younger age. In February 2007, he made a guest appearance as a priest in the seventh episode of Little Mosque on the Prairie, a Canadian television comedy series. [ Comedian Colin Mochrie to host Canadian &quot; 5th Grader &quot; game show ] On March 28, 2007, Mochrie and his Whose Line costar Brad Sherwood hosted part of the Press Correspondents&apos; Dinner with the President. At that event, Sherwood and Mochrie featured Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove rapping. Rove&apos;s only line was &quot; MC Rove &quot;. On August 29, 2007, it was announced that Mochrie would host the Canadian version of the game show Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?. The first of five episodes aired on October 25, 2007. As a result, Mochrie became the fifth member of the American Whose Line? cast to become a game show host, after colleagues Brad Sherwood ( The Dating Game and The Big Moment ), Greg Proops ( VS., Head Games and Rendez-View), Wayne Brady ( Don&apos;t Forget the Lyrics! and Let&apos;s Make A Deal ), and Drew Carey ( Power of 10 and The Price Is Right ). Since 2002, Mochrie and Sherwood have intermittently toured North America as a two-man stage show called &quot; An Evening with Colin and Brad, &quot; playing primarily in small theater venues. { An Evening with Colin and Brad } A DVD of their performances, &quot; Colin &amp; Brad: Two Man Group &quot; was released on March 8, 2011. In 2010, he acted in the forthcoming Canadian television sitcom She&apos;s the Mayor, scheduled to debut in 2011. { &quot; She&apos;s the Mayor finds laughs in Hamilton &quot;. } { Hamilton Spectator, April 16, 2010. } On July 19, 2010, Mochrie starred as the divorce lawyer working on the case of Spinner and Emma in Degrassi Takes Manhattan. The image of Mochrie&apos;s face is used extensively in Animutation, a style of Flash animation. Neil Cicierega, the father of Animutation [ July 2010 ], would place Mochrie in almost every Animutation he made, making the inclusion of him in Animutation somewhat of a running gag. Mochrie is aware of his status among Animutation artists and fans, having been quoted, &quot; It was very odd when I first saw the animutations. Obviously the animators are more than a little crazy, but I am very proud of my standing in the animutation arena and hope that some day I can make millions off of it. &quot; [ http://colinmochrie.com/askcolin2.cfm Ask Colin Mochrie Colinmochrie.com J.
