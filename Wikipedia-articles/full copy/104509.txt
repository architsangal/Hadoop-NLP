He is a professor at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques and a distinguished professor at the University of Miami. He received the Henri Poincaré Prize in 1997, the Fields Medal in 1998, the Crafoord Prize in 2008 and the Shaw Prize in 2012. [ Biography ] Born into the family of Lev Rafailovich Kontsevich – Soviet orientalist and author of the Kontsevich system. After ranking second in the All-Union Mathematics Olympiads, he attended Moscow State University but left without a degree in 1985 to become a researcher at the Institute for Problems of Information Transmission in Moscow. In 1992 he received his Ph.D. at the University of Bonn under Don Bernard Zagier. His thesis proves a conjecture by Edward Witten that two quantum gravitational models are equivalent. His work concentrates on geometric aspects of mathematical physics, most notably on knot theory, quantization, and mirror symmetry. His most famous result is a formal deformation quantization that holds for any Poisson manifold. He also introduced knot invariants defined by complicated integrals analogous to Feynman integrals. In topological field theory, he introduced the moduli space of stable maps, which may be considered a mathematically rigorous formulation of the Feynman integral for topological string theory. These results are a part of his &quot; contributions to four problems of geometry &quot; for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998.
