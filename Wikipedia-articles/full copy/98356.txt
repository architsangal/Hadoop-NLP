These are shown below: [ Tesco Extra ] { Batley, West Yorkshire. } Tesco Extra stores are larger, mainly out-of-town hypermarkets that stock nearly all of Tesco&apos;s product ranges. Exceptions include Trowbridge, Stafford, Hexham, Kingston upon Hull, Stevenage, Borehamwood, Chesterfield, Clay Cross, Leigh, Wigan, Grimsby, Bulwell, Galashiels, Cumbernauld, Slough, Bradford, Eastbourne, Yeovil, Hanley, Staffordshire, Longton, Staffordshire, Cradley Heath, Nottingham Beeston Burnley, Leyland, and Widnes, which are in the heart of town centres. Cardiff (Western Avenue) and Cardiff (Pengam Green), Warrington and Walsall College are located in inner-city locations. The first Extra opened in 1997 in Pitsea and more recently in 2009 Maldon. The 100th store opened on 29 November 2004 in Stafford. The number of these is now being increased by about 20 a year, mainly by conversions from the second category. The largest store in England by floor space is Tesco Extra in Walkden, with [ 185500 sqft m² ] of floorspace. [ http://www.aewarchitects.com/whatwedo/foodretail/Tesco%20Walkden AEW Architects AEW Architects 16 August 2011 ] In November 2011, a Tesco Extra opened in St.Helens adjacent to the new St.Helens RLFC Stadium, but only as a one floor store. The largest in Scotland is the Silverburn store. The largest in Wales is at Parc Fforestfach, Swansea, which is [ 112000 sqft m² ] constructed in 2003. The 200th Extra store was opened in October 2010 in Bishop Auckland. Other large stores include Bar Hill, Cleethorpes, Newcastle upon Tyne, Milton Keynes, Stockton-on-Tees and Watford, which are all in the [ 120000 sqft m² ] range. Newer stores are usually on two floors, with the ground floor mainly for food and the first floor for clothing, electronics and entertainment. Some stores that did not have the second floor have been converted to this format in recent years. Most Tesco Extra stores have a café and as of October 2009, all stores have a Tesco Tech Support Team. [ Tesco Superstores ] Tesco superstores are standard large supermarkets, stocking groceries and a much smaller range of non-food goods than Extra stores. The stores have always previously been branded as simply &apos;Tesco&apos;, but a new store in Liverpool was the first to use the format brand &apos;Tesco Superstore&apos; above the door. [ http://www.retail-week.com/Stores/2009/02/tesco_launches_superstore_format_at_liverpool_one_piling_pressure_on_nonfood_ri.html Retail Week First store to be branded &apos;Tesco Superstore&apos; ] [ Tesco Metro ] { St Albans, England } Tesco Metro stores are sized between Tesco superstores and Tesco Express stores, with stores averaging [ 11000 sqft m² ]. They are mainly located in city centres, the inner city and on the high streets of towns. The first Tesco Metro opened in Neston in 1980. Since then all Tesco branches with a high street format, including those that opened before the Covent Garden branch, have been rebranded from Tesco to Tesco Metro. The Tesco store in Devizes was the last store to finish rebranding, in September 2006. The store had not been renovated for over 20 years. [ Tesco Express ] { Trowbridge, Wiltshire } Tesco Express stores are neighbourhood convenience store s averaging [ 2200 sqft m² ], stocking mainly food with an emphasis on higher-margin products (due to small store size, and the necessity to maximise revenue per square foot) alongside everyday essentials. They are found in busy city centre districts, small shopping precincts in residential areas, small towns and villages and on Esso petrol station forecourts. The 1000th Tesco Express site opened in July 2009. Tesco have now started building Tesco Express stores with only &apos;Assisted-Service&apos; tills, in which the customer scans all their own shopping and packs it, with the support of supervising staff when required. [ One Stop ] { Trowbridge, Wiltshire } One Stop, which includes some of the smallest stores (smaller than a Tesco Express), is the only Tesco store format in the UK that does not include the word Tesco in its name. The brand, along with the original stores, formed part of the T &amp; S Stores business but, unlike many that were converted to Tesco Express, these kept their old name. Subsequently, other stores bought by Tesco have been converted to the One Stop brand. Some have Tesco Personal Finance branded cash machines. The business has attracted some controversy, as grocery prices in these shops, often situated in less well-off areas, can be higher than nearby Tesco branded stores, highlighted in The Times 22 March 2010: &quot; Britain’s biggest supermarket uses its chain of 520 One Stop convenience stores—which many customers do not realise it owns—to charge up to 14 per cent more for goods than it does in Tesco-branded stores. &quot; Tesco responded to the article stating &quot; It is a separate business within the Tesco Group, with its own supply chain and distribution network. One Stop stores offer a different range to Express stores and its operating costs are different. One Stop’s price strategy is to match its nearest competitor Cost Cutter and is frequently cheaper. &quot; [ http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article7070471.ece Tesco’s secret chain charges customers more – Times Online The Times UK 11 November 2010 Marcus Leroux 22 March 2010 ] They can usually be found in smaller communities across the United Kingdom. [ Tesco Homeplus ] Tesco Homeplus is not Tesco&apos;s first non-food only venture in the UK. Until the late 1990s/early 2000s there were several non-food Tesco stores around the country including Scarborough and Yate. Although not in a warehouse style format, the stores were located on high streets and shopping centres, they stocked similar items to Homeplus stores. In both cases this was because another part of the shopping centre had a Tesco Superstore that stocked food items only. In May 2005 Tesco announced a trial non-food only format near Manchester and Aberdeen, [ http://www.tescocorporate.com/page.aspx?pointerid%3DDEC14C7BA76D451F8D81DBC4A14DE89C Tesco announces non-food store trials 13 March 2006 ] and the first store opened in October 2005: Stores offer all of Tesco&apos;s ranges except food in warehouse-style units in retail parks. Tesco is using this format because only 20% of its customers have access to a Tesco Extra, and the company is restricted in how many of its superstores it can convert into Extras and how quickly it can do so. Large units for non-food retailing are much more readily available. There are currently 13 Homeplus stores nationwide. The newest Homeplus store opened in Chester in July 2009. Two more were due to open in the first half of 2009 at sites around the country. All of these were to feature the Order and Collect desk where customers can purchase and collect most items straightaway. In 2012 The Times reported that Tesco was keen to exit leases on all of its 13 Home Plus stores and has been looking at options with property advisor Morgan Williams.

Products on offer include credit cards, loans, mortgages, savings accounts and several types of insurance, including car, home, life and travel. They are promoted by leaflets in Tesco&apos;s stores and through its website. The business made a profit of £130  million for the 52 weeks to 24 February 2007, of which Tesco&apos;s share was £66  million. This move towards the financial sector diversified the Tesco brand and provides opportunities for growth outside of the retailing sector.

Tesco moved ahead of Home Depot during 2007, following the sale of Home Depot&apos;s professional supply division and a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against the British pound. METRO was only just behind and might move ahead again if the euro strengthens against the pound, but METRO&apos;s sales include many billions of wholesale turnover, and its retail turnover is much less than Tesco&apos;s. Despite being in a recession, Tesco made record profits for a British retailer in the year to February 2010, during which its underlying pre-tax profits increased by 10.1% to £3.4  billion.

[ The Guardian UK 14 June 2008 David Leigh Government outlaws tax avoidance schemes http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jun/14/taxavoidance.tesco ] The scheme, identified by British magazine Private Eye, utilises offshore holding companies in Luxembourg and partnership agreements to reduce corporation tax liability by up to £50  million a year. Another scheme previously identified by Private Eye involved depositing £1  billion in a Swiss partnership, and then loaning out that money to overseas Tesco stores, so that profit can be transferred indirectly through interest payments. This scheme is still in operation and is estimated to be costing the UK exchequer up to £20  million a year in corporation tax.

These companies then lease the stores back to Tesco. At the time, The Guardian claimed that this arrangement would enable Tesco to avoid an estimated £1  billion tax on profits from the property sales, and also avoid paying tax on continuing operation of the stores, as the rate of corporation tax in the Cayman Islands is zero. Tesco defended its tax arrangements, saying it had a legal duty to its shareholders to organise its affairs in a tax-efficient manner and pointing out that the company already pays significant amounts of tax, including VAT, excise duty and fuel duty on behalf of its customers, PAYE and national insurance contributions on behalf of its employees and corporation tax on its profits. Following these revelations, several MPs called for an inquiry into Tesco&apos;s tax avoidance schemes.

Tesco denied that it had avoided paying £1  billion corporation tax but for legal reasons refused to answer further questions or to clarify the purpose of the tax structure they had created. Further investigations by The Guardian discovered that the tax structures were aimed at avoiding Stamp Duty Land Tax, and not corporation tax as originally thought. SDLT is levelled at 4%, and corporate tax at around 30%, so the figure of £1  billion tax avoided by Tesco has been revised to an estimated £90–£100  million. [ The Guardian UK http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/may/03/tesco.medialaw Tesco and tax: a complex web of companies, trusts and partnerships 3 May 2008 ] According to the Guardian, &quot; Tesco has been involved in a game of cat and mouse with HM Revenue &amp; Customs since 2003. On three occasions when the government has closed a loophole to prevent avoidance, Tesco has taken advantage of ingenious schemes to get around it. Tesco still has 36 stores wrapped up in UK limited partnerships—with Cayman Islands registered partners—which were established in 2006 before the latest loophole was closed. &quot; In September 2008, Tesco dropped the legal action after The Guardian apologised for its story, acknowledging &quot; These damaging allegations were unfounded and should not have been published. All profits generated by this sale and leaseback arrangement were earned by UK tax-resident companies and have been or will be included in Tesco&apos;s UK tax returns. The use of Cayman Island companies in the scheme was for legitimate stamp duty savings purposes. &quot; [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2008/sep/16/corrections 16 September 2008 Corrections and clarifications – Tesco – an apology The Guardian UK ] Costs were paid by the newspaper with undisclosed damages being paid to charity.

No shops are permitted to sell alcohol in the area and there are no pubs, bars or fast-food outlets in Bournville. Plans for a large Tesco store in St Albans, Hertfordshire, attracted widespread local opposition. This led to the formation of the &quot; Stop St Albans Tesco Group &quot;. In June 2008, St Albans Council refused planning permission for the proposed store. In April 2011, longstanding opposition to a Tesco Express store in Cheltenham Road, Stokes Croft, Bristol, evolved into a violent clash between opponents and police. The recently opened storefront was heavily damaged, and police reported the seizure of petrol bombs.
