[ April 2012 ] [ article October 2011 ] [ yes 1762 05 22 ] [ yes 1834 07 27 1762 05 22 ] { London } { British } { Tory } { Christ Church, Oxford } { Lady Georgina Lennox (1765-1846) } Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst KG PC (22 May 1762 – 27 July 1834) was a British politician. [ Background and education ] Lord Bathurst was the elder son of Henry Bathurst, 2nd Earl Bathurst, by his wife Tryphena, daughter of Thomas Scawen. He was educated at Eton from 1773 to 1778 and then at Christ Church, Oxford. [ Political career ] Lord Bathurst was member of the British Parliament for Cirencester from 1783 until he succeeded to the earldom in August 1794. Owing mainly to his friendship with William Pitt, he was a lord of the admiralty from 1783 to 1789; a lord of the treasury from 1789 to 1791; and commissioner of the board of control from 1793 to 1802. Returning to office with Pitt in May 1804 he became Master of the Mint, and was President of the Board of Trade and Master of the Mint during the ministries of the Duke of Portland and Spencer Perceval, only vacating these posts in June 1812 to become Secretary of State for War and the Colonies under Lord Liverpool. For two months during the year 1809 he was in charge of the foreign office. He was Secretary for War and the Colonies until Liverpool resigned in April 1827; and deserves some credit for improving the conduct of the Peninsular War, while it was his duty to defend the government concerning its treatment of Napoleon Bonaparte. Bathurst&apos;s official position caused his name to be mentioned frequently during the agitation for the abolition of slavery, and with regard to this traffic he seems to have been animated by a humane spirit. The current capital of The Gambia, Banjul, was originally named Bathurst after the earl. He was Lord President of the Council in the government of the Duke of Wellington from 1828 to 1830, and favoured the removal of the disabilities of Roman Catholics, but was a sturdy opponent of the Reform Bill of 1832. The Earl, who had four sons and two daughters, died on 27 July 1834. Bathurst was made a Knight of the Garter in 1817, and held several lucrative sinecure s. [ Family ] Lord Bathurst married Lady Georgiana, daughter of Lord George Henry Lennox, in April 1789. He died in July 1834, aged 72, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Henry. Lady Bathurst died in January 1841, aged 75. [ Legacy ] Bathurst was portrayed by Christopher Lee in the South Africa n television series Shaka Zulu.
