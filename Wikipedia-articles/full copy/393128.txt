[ History ] [ William Wallace ] [ April 2007 ] &quot; See approach proud Edwards power, Chains and slavery! &quot; After the death of Alexander III, the hopes of the people of Scotland rested with the Maid of Norway. Her death in 1290 left the country at the mercy of the English King. From that date until the crown was awarded to John Balliol, King Edward prosecuted remorselessly his schemes to bring the Kingdom of Scotland under his control. Balliol, as preceding kings before him paid homage, in respect of his lands in England, to Edward and, in return, suffered many humiliations at the hands of the supposed English suzerain. Scottish nobles and gentry, many from the Borderland, were compelled to swear allegiance to the &quot; proud usurper. &quot; From the West of Scotland came William Wallace, a Scots knight who led his countrymen in resistance to English domination. There are many places in the Scottish Borders associated with Wallace. It was in the church at Selkirk, supported by nobles and clergy, he was declared Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland. [ O&apos; Floddenfield! ] Statue of Fletcher outside Victoria Halls, Selkirk Selkirk men fought with William Wallace at Stirling Brig and Falkirk, and also with Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn, but it is Selkirk&apos;s connection with The Battle of Flodden in 1513, her response to the call of the King, the brave bearing of her representatives on the fatal field, and the tragic return of the sole survivor, provide the Royal Burgh with its proudest and most maudlin memories, it being the celebration of a five hundred year old defeat. Only one returned from the battle, &quot; Fletcher &quot;, bearing a blood-stained English flag belonging to the Macclesfield regiment. On his return he cast the captured English standard around his head before falling to his death as the last returning fighting Souter.

Although attributed to Robert Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century, as the &quot; Galloway Grace &quot; or the &quot; Covenanters&apos; Grace &quot;. It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the Earl of Selkirk at St Mary&apos;s Isle Priory, Galloway. Today it is used on occasions such as Burns&apos; Night. Scots : Some hae meat and canna eat, And some wad eat that want it, But we hae meat and we can eat, Sae let the Lord be thankit.
