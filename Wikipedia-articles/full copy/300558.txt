[ Palate Talk:Soft palate#Merge proposal August 2011 ] [ 05 1.01.104 ] [ 05 2.01.003 ] The soft palate (also known as velum or muscular palate) is the soft tissue constituting the back of the roof of the mouth. The soft palate is distinguished from the hard palate at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain bone. [ Function ] The soft palate is movable, consisting of muscle fibers sheathed in mucous membrane. It is responsible for closing off the nasal passages during the act of swallowing, and also for closing off the airway. During sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a portion of the excreted substance to the mouth. The uvula hangs from the end of the soft palate. Research shows that the uvula is not actually involved in snoring processes. This has been shown through inconsistent results from uvula removal surgery. Snoring is more closely associated with fat deposition in the pharynx, enlarged tonsils of Waldeyer&apos;s Ring, or deviated septum problems. Touching the uvula or the end of the soft palate evokes a strong gag reflex in most people. [ Speech ] A speech sound made with the middle part of the tongue (dorsum) touching the soft palate is known as a velar consonant. It is possible for the soft palate to retract and elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity in order to produce the oral speech sounds. If this separation is incomplete, air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as nasal. [ Muscles of soft palate ] [ Muscles of soft palate and fauces ] Tensor veli palatini Palato-glossal Palato pharyngeal Levator veli palatani Musculus uvulae The muscle of the soft palate play important roles in swallowing and breathing. Levator veli palatani and tensor veli palatani are the two muscles involved in elevating the soft palate during swallowing. [ Pathology ] [ Oral pathology ] Pathology of the soft palate includes mucosa l lesions such as pemphigus vulgaris, herpangina and migratory stomatitis, [ Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth J Am Acad Dermatol 65 2 459–60 2011 Aug 21763590 10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016 http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0190-9622/PIIS0190962210004883.pdf PDF ] and muscular conditions such as the congenital cleft palate and cleft uvula. { petechiae. } Petechiae on the soft palate are mainly associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, { Fact Sheet: Tonsillitis from American Academy of Otolaryngology. &quot; Updated 1/11 &quot;.

[ Brook I, Dohar JE Management of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis in children J Fam Pract 55 12 S1–11; quiz S12 2006 December 17137534 ] 10 to 30 percent of palatal petechiae cases are estimated to be caused by suction, which can be habitual or secondary to fellatio. { Page 134 in: } [ Michael Glick; Greenberg, Martin Harry; Burket, Lester W.
