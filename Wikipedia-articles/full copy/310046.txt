[ February 2011 ] [ 1938 1 31 ] [ Wyoming ] { Lusk, } { Wyoming } { Republican } { University of Wyoming } { Pentecostal } James Gaius Watt (born January 31, 1938) served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior for President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1983. [ Early life and career ] Watt was born in Lusk, Wyoming. He attended the University of Wyoming, earning a bachelor&apos;s degree during 1960 and a Juris Doctor ( J.D. ) degree during 1962. Watt&apos;s first political job was as an aide to Republican Party Senator Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming, whom he met through Simpson&apos;s son, Alan. During 1966, Watt became the secretary to the natural resources committee and environmental pollution advisory panel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. During 1969, Watt was appointed the deputy assistant secretary of water and power development for the Department of the Interior. During 1975, Watt was appointed the vice-chairman of the Federal Power Commission. During 1976, Watt initiated the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a law company &quot; dedicated to individual liberty, the right to own and use property, limited and ethical government and economic freedom. &quot; { Mountain States Legal Foundation } A number of attorneys who worked for Watt at the foundation later assumed jobs of responsibility with the federal government, including Ann Veneman and Gale Norton. [ Secretary of Interior ] During 1980, President-elect Reagan chose Watt to be his Secretary of the Interior. He was soon after approved by the United States Senate. Watt&apos;s tenure as Secretary of the Interior was controversial, resulting primarily from his alleged hostility to environmentalism and his endorsement of the development and use of federal lands by foresting, ranch ing, and other commercial interests. According to the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, for more than two decades, Watt had the record for protecting the fewest species by the Endangered Species Act in United States history. The record was surpassed by Dirk Kempthorne, a George W. Bush appointee who, as of August 27, 2007, had not listed a single species in the 15 months since his confirmation. { Kempthorne Wins 2007 Rubber Dodo Award : Protects Fewer Species Than Any Interior Secretary in History } Greg Wetstone, who was the chief environment council at the House Energy and Commerce Committee during the Reagan administration and later served as director of advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Watt was one of the two most &quot; intensely controversial and blatantly anti-environmental political appointees &quot; of American history. (The other was Anne Gorsuch, director of the EPA at that time.) { A look back at Reagan&apos;s environmental record | By Amanda Griscom | Grist | Muckraker | 10 Jun 2004 } According to the environmental groups, Watt decreased funding for environmental programs, { James G.

Watt resisted accepting donations of private land to be used for conservation purposes. { The Legacy of James Watt Time Oct. 24, 1983 } He suggested that all 80 million acres (320,000  km²) of undeveloped land in the United States be opened for drilling and mining in the year 2000. The area leased to coal mining companies quintupled during his term as Secretary of the Interior. Watt boasted that he leased &quot; a billion acres &quot; (4 million km²) of U.S. coastal waters, even though only a small portion of that area would ever be drilled. Watt once stated, &quot; We will mine more, drill more, cut more timber. &quot; { Mountain States Legal Foundation } Watt periodically mentioned his Dispensationalist Christian faith when discussing his method of environmental management. Speaking before Congress, he once said, &quot; I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the Lord returns, whatever it is we have to manage with a skill to leave the resources needed for future generations. &quot; { Power Line: Bill Moyers Smears a Better Man Than Himself } One apocryphal quote attributed to Watt is &quot; After the last tree is felled, Christ will come back. &quot; However, there are no reliable indications that he actually ever said this. Glenn Scherer, writing for Grist Magazine, erroneously attributed this remark to 1981 testimony by Watt to Congress. [ Glenn Scherer 2004-10-27 The Godly Must Be Crazy Grist http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2004/10/27/scherer-christian/index.html 2007-04-21 ] Journalist Bill Moyers, relying on the Grist article, also attributed the comment to Watt. After it was discovered that the quote was mistaken, Grist corrected their article and Moyers apologized.

Watt said that &quot; rock bands &quot; that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day during 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted &quot; the wrong element &quot;, who would rob people and families attending any similar events in the future. Watt then announced that Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton, a friend and endorser of President Reagan and a contributor to Republican Party political campaigns, would perform at the Mall&apos;s 1983 Independence Day celebration. { Campaign contributions of Wayne Newton in website of NEWSMEAT by Polity Media, Inc. Retrieved 2010-01-29. } During the ensuing controversy, Rob Grill, main singer of The Grass Roots, stated that he felt &quot; highly insulted &quot; by Watt&apos;s remarks, which he termed &quot; nothing but un-American &quot;. The Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad during 1978, &quot; obviously.... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element &quot;. Vice President George H. W. Bush said of The Beach Boys, &quot; They&apos;re my friends and I like their music &quot;. Watt apologized to The Beach Boys after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans of the group. { Tim Ahern, Associated Press, &quot; Newton concert goes off despite rain &quot;, &apos;&apos;Gettysburg Times&apos;&apos;, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 5, 1983, p. 7 in Google news.

Retrieved on 2010-5-29. } A public controversy erupted after a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by Watt during September 1983, when he mocked affirmative action by saying about a coal-leasing panel: &quot; I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent. &quot; { 556. James G Watt, US Secretary of the Interior. Simpson’s Contemporary Quotations. 1988 } Within weeks of making this statement, Watt submitted his resignation letter. { RMOA – Document } During 2008, Time Magazine named Watt as the sixth worst cabinet member in modern American history. { Top 10 Worst Cabinet Members. } { Time Magazine, November 12, 2008 } [ Later life ] During 1995, Watt was indicted on 25 counts of felony perjury and obstruction of justice by a federal grand jury. { Crimes Against Nature : Rolling Stone ( p. 3 ) } The indictments were due to false statements made to a grand jury investigating influence peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which he had lobbied in the mid-to-late 1980s. On January 2, 1996, as part of a plea bargain, Watt pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of withholding documents from a federal grand jury. On March 12, 1996 he was sentenced to five years&apos; probation and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community service.
