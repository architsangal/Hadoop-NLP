[ http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/5945/32609/33106 Joe Perry&apos;s position in the list www.rollingstone.com ] [ Biography ] [ Early life ] The paternal side of Perry&apos;s family are Portuguese, originally from Madeira. His grandfather changed the family&apos;s name from Pereira to Perry upon arriving in the United States of America. His maternal side is Italian, more specifically Neapolitan. [ http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0675128/bio Joe Perry (I) 2008-07-05 imdb.com ] Perry was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts and grew up in the small town of Hopedale, Massachusetts. There, his father was an accountant and his mother a high school gym teacher and later an aerobics instructor. She later retired to Arizona when Perry&apos;s father died in 1975. Perry also attended the prep school Vermont Academy, a boarding school of about 232 students in Saxtons River, Vermont. [ Aerosmith ] [ Aerosmith ] During Joe Perry&apos;s early years he formed a band with Tom Hamilton called The Jam Band. Steven Tyler, Joe, Tom, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer eventually joined and the band became Aerosmith. While initially dismissed as Rolling Stones knock-offs, the band came into its own during the mid-1970s with a string of hit records. Chief among these successes were Toys in the Attic (1975) and Rocks (1976), thanks largely to the prevalence of free-form, album-oriented FM radio. The group also managed hit singles on the AM dial with songs like &quot; Dream On &quot;, &quot; Same Old Song and Dance &quot;, &quot; Sweet Emotion &quot; and &quot; Walk This Way &quot;. During this time, Perry and vocalist Steven Tyler became known as the &quot; Toxic Twins &quot; for their notorious hard-partying and drug use. Aerosmith&apos;s crowd earned the nickname &quot; The Blue Army &quot;, so called by the band after the seemingly endless number of teenagers in the audience wearing blue denim jackets and blue jeans. The audience was abundantly female with long hair. Following Rocks, the group began to stumble - drug use escalated and the creative process became hampered by strained relationships within the band. They managed another hit record in 1977 with Draw the Line, on which Perry sang lead vocals on the track &quot; Bright Light Fright &quot;. A tour was scheduled for the fall of &apos;77, but increasing violence at concerts eventually derailed it. A cherry bomb was thrown onstage in Philadelphia at The Spectrum in October 1977, injuring both Perry and Tyler. In 1979, the band headlined over Van Halen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Foreigner during the world music festival concerts. An argument backstage in Cleveland resulted in Joe Perry&apos;s wife throwing a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton &apos;s wife. Perry quit Aerosmith partway through the recording of the album Night in the Ruts, with the remainder of his parts played by temporary guitarists. Perry took a collection of unrecorded material with him, which would later become the basis of his album Let the Music Do the Talking. [ Return to the spotlight ] Equipped with a new record label ( MCA Records ) and three new band members in singer Mach Bell, bassist Danny Hargrove and drummer Joe Pet, The Joe Perry Project released Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker in 1983. The album met the same fate as its predecessor, selling 40,000 copies. Despite the poor sales, The Project went out on a final tour in support of the album, adding then ex-Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford to the line-up. During this tour, The Project performed in a series of co-bills with Huey Lewis and the News. The following year, both Perry and Whitford rejoined Aerosmith, who signed with Geffen Records (which coincidentally was sold to MCA in 1990, absorbing the MCA label 13 years later). In 1986, Perry and Tyler collaborated with Run-D.M.C. in a remake of their 1975 hit &quot; Walk This Way &quot;, which brought their band renewed mainstream attention. After completing drug rehabilitation, Aerosmith went on to collaborate with various big-name songwriters and producers to launch their true comeback. Another string of successful albums (including the triple-platinum Pump in 1989 and 1993&apos;s seven-times platinum Get a Grip ) and many hit singles followed. Perry and Tyler resumed their friendship, again co-writing songs and performing very close together on stage. In 1998, Perry helped conceive the group&apos;s first number one single, &quot; I Don&apos;t Want to Miss a Thing &quot;, with pop songwriter Diane Warren. It appeared on the soundtrack to the hit film Armageddon, in which Tyler&apos;s daughter Liv starred. In 2006, Perry performed alongside Steven Tyler for a three-song medley ( &quot; Dream On &quot;, &quot; Walk This Way &quot;, &quot; I Don&apos;t Want to Miss a Thing &quot; ) with the Boston Pops Orchestra as part of a nationally-televised event to celebrate the Fourth of July in Boston, Massachusetts. [ Solo album ] Perry released his first solo record, the self-titled &apos;&apos;Joe Perry&apos;&apos;, in May 2005. It was recorded at his home studio (The Boneyard) in suburban Boston, with every instrument but the drums played by Perry himself. Critics also responded favorably; Rolling Stone magazine crowned it with three-and-a-half (out of five) stars, declaring &quot; A Joe Perry solo joint? about time! &quot; He was also nominated for &quot; Best Rock Instrumental &quot; at the 2006 Grammys for the track &quot; Mercy &quot; but lost to Les Paul. [ Return of the Joe Perry Project ] In 2009, while on tour with Aerosmith, Joe Perry announced that he would be releasing a new Joe Perry Project album entitled Have Guitar, Will Travel, which was released on October 6, 2009. The first single from the album was &quot; We&apos;ve Got a Long Way to Go. &quot; [ http://blogs.reuters.com/fanfare/2009/08/04/aerosmiths-joe-perry-takes-flight-with-new-solo-album/ Aerosmith’s Joe Perry takes flight with new solo album Blogs.reuters.com 2009-08-03 2010-07-04 ] This marks the first Joe Perry Project album since 1983&apos;s Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker, and the fifth Joe Perry solo album in total, counting the 2005 self-titled album. He toured Europe and the States for some month 2009 performing his solo album while Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler was menacing to quit the band.

Perry is now married to Billie Paulette Montgomery. They married in 1985 after meeting on the set of his &quot; Black Velvet Pants &quot; video in 1983. Billie appears on one of Perry&apos;s guitars, which is dubbed &quot; The Billie Perry Guitar &quot;. They have two sons together named Tony and Roman, while Billie also has a son from a previous relationship named Aaron. Adrian and Tony Perry are founding members of the rock group TAB the Band. [ http://joeperry.com/index.cfm/pk/content/pid/400051 About Joe Perry JoePerry.com 2007-07-01 2010-07-04 ] Perry&apos;s first grandchild, Austin, was fathered by his stepson Aaron, who is also the CEO for the Joe Perry&apos;s Rock Your World hot sauce brand. Currently Perry lives on Sleepy Hollow Farm in South Pomfret, Vermont where he raises Friesian horse s. He also has a home he resides in occasionally in Duxbury, Massachusetts. [ Equipment ] The main guitar associated with Joe Perry is the Gibson Les Paul. He has used many different types of Les Pauls since the 70s, including Les Paul Juniors, Les Paul Standards, and Les Paul Customs. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Gibson issued a Joe Perry signature Les Paul guitar; this guitar was customized with an active mid-boost control, black chrome hardware, and a translucent black finish. However, in 2004, this model was replaced by another Joe Perry signature Les Paul, the Joe Perry Boneyard Les Paul. This guitar is characterized by Perry&apos;s custom &quot; Boneyard &quot; logo on the headstock and a figured maple top with a green tiger finish, and is available with either a stopbar tailpiece or a Bigsby tailpiece; Perry typically uses a Bigsby-equipped Boneyard model in Aerosmith and solo live shows. The Gibson Joe Perry was a present from his wife Billie and then he was allowed to manufacture it. Perry has also endorsed an affordable replica version of the Boneyard guitar made by Epiphone that carries the same USA made Burstbucker pickups as the Gibson model. Perry also uses other Gibson models. Another model he uses frequently is a customized Gibson B.B. King &quot; Lucille &quot; guitar; however, instead of the black finish and &quot; Lucille &quot; signature on the headstock, Perry&apos;s guitar features a white finish, a &quot; Billie Perry &quot; signature on headstock and an image of Billie Perry on the front of the guitar. He has also used Gibson SGs, Firebirds, ES-175s, ES-335s, and ES-350s at various points in his career. Perry has been known to play guitars of other luthiers and manufacturers. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Perry frequently used various Fender Stratocaster s; many of these guitars were left-handed Strats turned upside-down and appropriately restrung. One of these &quot; upside-down &quot; models is still played occasionally by Perry onstage, usually for &quot; Sweet Emotion &quot;. Perry also uses Fender Telecasters, some modified with neck humbuckers. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Perry (along with fellow Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford) endorsed B.C. Rich guitars, and frequently used the Mockingbird (such as in the performance of &quot; Come Together &quot; in the film Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band ) and 10-string B.C. Rich models. He has also been photographed playing what looks like, judging by the headstock logo, a custom built Spector guitar, and some ESP guitars during the 80s. The six-string bass guitar is a trademark of Perry&apos;s guitar sound; instead of playing it like an ordinary bass guitar, he uses it like a regular guitar, playing riffs, chords, and solos. The six-string bass helped to create the characteristic growl of Aerosmith&apos;s &quot; Back in the Saddle &quot;, &quot; Combination &quot;, and &quot; Draw the Line &quot;. In the past, Perry used Fender Bass VI and Danelectro six-string basses; he also used a Gibson EB-6 for the bass solo on &quot; King of the Kings &quot; on the Joe Perry Project&apos;s Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker album (as indicated by the album&apos;s liner notes). Perry currently uses an Ernie Ball MusicMan six-string bass onstage. For amps, Perry uses a collection of various alternating vintage amps on stage, including 200 watt Marshall Major amps, Fender Silverface Dual Showman amps, a Fender Tweed Bassman and many more. In the studio he uses various vintage low wattage tube amps including a Fender Tweed Champ and an Epiphone Pacemaker Model EA50T manufactured in Kalamazoo, Michigan in the early 60s. For slide work, Perry typically uses a Dan Armstrong Lucite guitar, such as for &quot; Draw the Line &quot;.Joe has also been known to use a Pro Co RAT, Klon Centaur, talkbox, Dunlop Cry Baby and a DigiTech Whammy. Perry currently has a collection of about 600 guitars.

A quesadilla featuring a flavor of the namesake hot sauce is available as an appetizer at Hard Rock Cafe. Additionally, Perry was featured in a television episode of Inside Dish with Rachael Ray on a recent stop on Aerosmith&apos;s tour, in which he prepared a meal, displayed his passion for knives, discussed his hot sauce brand and cooking, and gave insight into what goes into meal preparation on Aerosmith tours. Until recently, Perry, along with Aerosmith band member Steven Tyler and other partners, co-owned Mount Blue, a restaurant in Norwell, Massachusetts. [ Influences ] [ July 2007 ] [ http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/aerosmiths_joe_perry_i_have_600_guitars.html Aerosmith&apos;s Joe Perry: &apos;I have 600 guitars!&apos; Joe Matera Ultimate-guitar.com 2007-01-20 2010-07-04 ] He is a huge fan of early Fleetwood Mac, particularly their first lead guitarist, Peter Green, which explains the occasional inclusion of the FM classics &quot; Stop Messin&apos; Round &quot; and &quot; Rattlesnake Shake &quot; in Aerosmith &apos;s sets. Steven Tyler has even mentioned that hearing Perry play &quot; Rattlesnake Shake &quot; brought them together. He is also a huge fan of guitarist Jeff Beck and looked at him as one of his influences. Beck played onstage with Aerosmith in 1976, as a &apos;birthday present&apos; for Perry. Perry was also strongly influenced by Jimi Hendrix as evidenced in particular by some of the playing on the Joe Perry Project track song &quot; The Mist Is Rising &quot;, and his covering the Hendrix classic &quot; Red House &quot; both with the Project and later with Aerosmith. He was a huge influence on Slash, who after hearing Rocks decided to take up the guitar rather than race BMX. Slash owned Perry&apos;s old &apos;59 Les Paul, but later returned it as a birthday present.
