[ Auster Aircraft Limited Merged with Beagle Aircraft. 1938 (as Taylorcraft Aeroplanes (England) Limited) 1960 Rearsby, Leicestershire, UK Aerospace ] Auster Aircraft Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer from 1938 to 1961. { Willis, issue 122, p.55 } [ History ] The company began in 1938 at the Britannia Works, Thurmaston near Leicester, England, as Taylorcraft Aeroplanes (England) Limited, making light observation aircraft designed by the Taylorcraft Aircraft Corporation of America. 1,604 high-wing Taylorcraft Auster monoplane s were built during World War II for the armed forces of the UK and Canada, primarily for the role of Air Observation Post. During the war the head office and drawing office were at a big old house on the outskirts of Thurmaston called &quot; The Woodlands &quot;. The fuselages and wings were manufactured at Syston where the works manager was called Sharp. Sheet metalwork was done at the old En tout cas works at Thurmaston. Final assembly, fitting out and testing took place at Rearsby aerodrome. The name changed to Auster (after the Roman name for the south wind ) on 7 March 1946, when production shifted to Rearsby aerodrome, all in Leicestershire. All designs were evolved from the early Taylorcraft with a sprung skid or tailwheel beneath the fin (except for a low-wing aircraft called the &quot; Agricola &quot; designed for crop-spraying; only two of these were completed). When the company was merged into Beagle Aircraft in June, 1961, the high-wing design was developed still further as the Terrier and, with a nosewheel, the Airedale. The various Auster models were extensively used in the UK and British colonies after WWII for a variety of activities such as Air Observation Post (AOP), mail delivery, VIP transport, private owner flights and joy rides at seaside airports and town carnivals. The Auster name was dropped in 1968.
