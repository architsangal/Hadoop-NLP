Historically, the extension was used for documentation in plain text, particularly of programs or computer hardware on a wide range of operating system s. During the 1980s, WordPerfect used DOC as the extension of their proprietary format. Later, in the 1990s, Microsoft chose to use the DOC extension for their proprietary Microsoft Word format. The original uses for the extension have largely disappeared from the PC world. [ Microsoft Word format ] Binary DOC file s often contain more text formatting information (as well as script s and undo information) than some other document file format s like Rich Text Format and HyperText Markup Language, but are usually less widely compatible. The DOC files created with Microsoft Word versions differ. Microsoft Word versions up to Word 97 used a different format from Microsoft Word 97 and later. In Microsoft Word 2007 and later, the binary file format was replaced as the default format by the Office Open XML format, though Microsoft Word could still produce DOC files. [ Application support ] [ Comparison of word processors ] The DOC format is native to Microsoft Word. Other word processor s, such as OpenOffice.org Writer, IBM Lotus Symphony, Google Docs, Apple Pages and AbiWord, can also create and read DOC files, although with some limitations. Command line programs for Unix-like operating systems which can convert files from the DOC format to plain text or other standard formats include the wv library, which itself is used directly by AbiWord. Because the DOC file format was a closed specification for many years, inconsistent handling of the format persists and may cause some loss of formatting information when handling the same file with multiple word processing programs. Some specifications for Microsoft Office 97 binary file formats were published in 1997 under a restrictive license, but these specifications were removed from online download in 1999.

(And some workarounds) Joel Spolsky 2011-05-23 ] [ Other file formats ] Some historical documentations may use the DOC filename extension for plain-text file format. The DOC filename extension was also used in historical versions of WordPerfect for its proprietary format. Some software applications use the name &quot; DOC &quot; in combination with other words (such as the name of software manufacturer) for different file formats. As an example, on the Palm OS, DOC is shorthand for PalmDoc, a completely unrelated format (commonly using PDB filename extension) used to encode text files such as ebook s.
