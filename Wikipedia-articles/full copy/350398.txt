[ http://www.localhistories.org/eastleigh.html A History of Eastleigh www.localhistories.org 2009-12-21 ] (‘Leah’ is an ancient Anglo-Saxon word meaning ‘a clearing in a forest’). There is additional evidence of this settlement in a survey from the time which details land in North Stoneham being granted by King Æthelstan to his military aid, Alfred in 932 AD. [ http://www.bishopstokepc.hampshire.org.uk/ Bishopstoke Parish Council website bishopstokepc.hampshire.org.uk 28 March 2010 ] The prefix ‘Est’ or &apos;East&apos; is thought to refer to its location relative to the established settlement of Baddesley. The Domesday Book of 1086 gives a more detailed account of the settlement, which is referred to as ‘Estleie’. In 1838 the London and South Western Railway Company (L &amp; SWR) built a railway from Southampton to Winchester. { Williams, R. A. (1968) The London &amp; South Western Railway, v. 1: The formative years, and v. 2: Growth and consolidation, David and Charles, ISBN 0-7153-4188-X; ISBN 0-7153-5940-1 } It was decided to build a station near the little village of Barton. This railway station was originally named Bishopstoke Junction. In 1868 the villages of Barton and Eastley were combined into one parish. A parish church, the Church of the Resurrection, was built in the same year, at a cost of £2,300. { Clarke, Kathleen : 1995, Page 6 } A local noted authoress of many novels, Charlotte Yonge, donated £500 towards the building of the church. { Clarke, Kathleen : 1995, Page 7 } She was rewarded by being given the privilege to choose a name for the &apos;new&apos; parish; either Barton or Eastly. She chose Eastly, but with a new modern spelling; Eastleigh. In 1891 the L &amp; SWR Carriage and Wagon Works from Nine Elms in London were transferred to Eastleigh. This was followed by the Nine Elms Locomotive Works which were moved there in 1909.These Railway Works were closed in 2006 but have since reopened, albeit on a smaller scale.

[ The Swan Centre ] The Swan Shopping Centre opened in 1989, and was built in the heart of the town&apos;s Victorian &apos;grid iron&apos; road layout and blocked off Market Street and High Street - although through access was possible for pedestrians while the centre was open. The Swan Centre included a French-style café and a new library [ http://www.swanshopping.com/ Swan Shopping Centre Eastleigh © 2007-2009 Swan Shopping Centre, Eastleigh 2009-06-27 ] (replacing the recently demolished Town Hall library) in the High Street atrium. The Centre originally contained a large shop unit which was reserved for a major fashion retailer (rumoured to be Dunnes ), however this never came to fruition and in the late 1990s, significant modifications were made to the &apos;Octogan&apos; (the Market Street atrium), including removal of the glass lift, replacement stairs and closure/in-filling of the mall that led to the southern part of Market Street (the shop units in this part were never let). These modifications were partly paid for by Littlewoods, who moved into the new enlarged shop unit. Following the demise of Littlewoods&apos; retail business, the unit is now occupied by T.K. Maxx. Anchor store s at the Swan Centre include Tesco Metro, W H Smith, New Look, Next, McDonald&apos;s, Argos and Boots. The Swan Centre has been largely successful commercially, with most of the ground floor units being occupied, however the retail units on the first floor have never been let. The High Street atrium used to have a crèche but now only has the library and centre management offices. In 2008, a project to extend the Swan Centre was started. The extension, at the eastern side of the centre saw a new structure constructed above the Tesco car park. This extension completed in March/April 2009 with the opening of a Vue cinema, AMF bowling alley and several restaurants.
