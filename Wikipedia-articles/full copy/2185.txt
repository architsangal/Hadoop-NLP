[ Arab Arabs Arab (disambiguation) ] Arab people, also known as Arabs ( [ عرب ], ʿarab), are a panethnicity [ http://www.hgm2011.org/ghazi_tadmouri_-_abstract.html Ghazi Tadmouri - Abstract Hgm2011.org 2011-03-15 2011-07-18 ] primarily living in the Arab world, which is located in Western Asia and North Africa. They are identified as such on one or more of genealogical, linguistic, or cultural grounds, { Francis Mading Deng War of visions: conflict of identities in the Sudan, Brookings Institution Press, 1995, ISBN 0-8157-1793-8 p. 405 } with tribal affiliations, and intra-tribal relationships playing an important part of Arab identity. { Nicholas S. Hopkins, Saad Eddin Ibrahim eds., Arab society: class, gender, power, and development, American University in Cairo Press, 1997, p.6 } The word &quot; Arab &quot; has had several different, but overlapping, meanings over the centuries (and sometimes even today). In addition to including all Arabized people of the world (with language tending to be the acid test), it has also at times been used exclusively for bedouin (Arab nomads [although a related word, &quot; `a-RAB, &quot; with the Arabic letter &quot; alif &quot; in the second syllable, once was sometimes used when this specific meaning was intended] and their now almost entirely settled descendants). It is sometimes used that way colloquially even today in some places. Townspeople once were sometimes called &quot; sons of the Arabs. &quot; As in the case of other ethnicities or nations, people identify themselves (or are identified by others) as &quot; Arabs &quot; to varying degrees. This may not be one&apos;s primary identity (it tends to compete with country, religion, sect, etc.), and whether it is emphasized may depend upon one&apos;s audience. If the diverse Arab pan-ethnicity is regarded as a single ethnic group, then it constitutes one of the world&apos;s largest after Han Chinese. [ Etymology ] [ Arab (etymology) ] The earliest documented use of the word &quot; Arab &quot; to refer to a people appears in the Monolith Inscription, an Akkadian language record of the 9th century BC Assyrian Conquest of Syria (Arabs had formed part of a coalition of forces opposed to Assyria). { Jan Retsö The Arabs in antiquity: their history from the Assyrians to the Umayyads, Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-7007-1679-3, p. 105, 119, 125-127. } Listed among the booty captured by the army of king Shalmaneser III of Assyria in the Battle of Qarqar are 1000 camels of &quot; Gi-in-di-bu&apos;u the ar-ba-a-a &quot; or &quot; [the man] Gindibu belonging to the ʕarab &quot; (ar-ba-a-a being an adjectival nisba of the noun ʕarab). The most popular Arab account holds that the word &apos;Arab&apos; came from an eponymous father called Yarab, who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. Al-Hamdani had another view; he states that Arabs were called GhArab (West in Semitic) by Mesopotamians because Arabs resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into Arab. Yet another view is held by Al-Masudi that the word Arabs was initially applied to the Ishmaelites of the &quot; Arabah &quot; valley. The root of the word has many meanings in Semitic languages including &quot; west/sunset, &quot; &quot; desert, &quot; &quot; mingle, &quot; &quot; merchant, &quot; &quot; raven &quot; and are &quot; comprehensible &quot; with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were metathetical from [ sem ʿ-B-R ] &quot; moving around &quot; (Arabic [ ar DIN ʿ-B-R ] &quot; traverse &quot; ), and hence, it is alleged, &quot; nomadic. &quot; [ Identity ] Arab identity is defined independently of religious identity, and pre-dates the rise of Islam, with historically attested Arab Christian kingdoms and Arab Jewish tribes. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim, with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely Christianity. Arabs are generally Sunni, Shia, or Ismaili Muslims, but currently, 7.1 percent to 10 percent of Arabs are Arab Christians. [ Philippe Fargues Christian Communities in the Middle East Oxford University Press 1998 0-19-829388-7 Andrea Pacini ] This figure does not include Christian ethnic groups such as Assyrians, Syriacs and those designated as Arameans or Phoenicians. The early Arabs were the tribes of Northern Arabia speaking proto Arabic dialects. Although since early days other people became Arabs through an Arabization process that could mean intermarriage with Arabs, adopting the Arabic language and culture, or both. For example, the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids which originated from Southern Semitic speaking Yemen made a major contribution in the creation of the Arabic language. The same process happened all over the Arab world after the spread of Islam by the mixing of Arabs with several other peoples. The Arab cultures went through a mixing process. Therefore every Arab country has cultural specificities which constitute a cultural mix which also originate in local novelties achieved after the arabization took place. However, all Arab countries do also share a common culture in most Aspects: Arts (music, literature, poetry, calligraphy...), Cultural products (Handicrafts, carpets, henne, bronze carving...), Social behaviour and relations (Hospitality, codes of conduct among friends and family...), Customs and superstitions, Some dishes (Shorba, Mloukhia), Traditional clothing, Architecture... Muslim but non-Arab people, who are about 80 percent of the world&apos;s Muslim population, do not form part of the Arab world, but instead comprise what is the geographically larger, and more diverse, Muslim World. Arabs have historically been racially classified as white/Caucasian { The Races of Europe by } { Carlton Stevens Coon. From Chapter XI: The Mediterranean World - Introduction: &quot; This third racial zone stretches from Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar to Morocco, and thence along the southern Mediterranean shores into Arabia, East Africa, Mesopotamia, and the Persian highlands; and across Afghanistan into India. &quot; } { Grolier Incorporated, Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 6, (Grolier Incorporated, 2001), p.85 } and, since 1997, by the U.S. Census as well. { US Census, &quot; About Race &quot;, } { US Census, &quot; Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin 2010 &quot; } Arabic, the main unifying feature among Arabs, is a Semitic language originating in Arabia. From there it spread to a variety of distinct peoples across most of West Asia and North Africa, [ http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Arab Arab Dictionary.reference.com 1945-03-22 2010-04-13 ] resulting in their acculturation and eventual denomination as Arabs. Arabization, a culturo-linguistic shift, was often, though not always, in conjunction with Islamization, a religious shift. With the rise of Islam in the 7th century, and as the language of the Qur&apos;an, Arabic became the lingua franca of the Islamic world. (See Anwar G. Chegne, &quot; Arabic: Its Significance and Place in Arab-Muslim Society, &quot; Middle East Journal 19 (Autumn 1965), pp.  447–470. It was in this period that Arabic language and culture was widely disseminated with the early Islamic expansion, both through conquest and cultural contact. [ http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa032300a.htm Islam and the Arabic language Islam.about.com 2009-11-03 2010-04-13 ] Arabic culture and language, however, began a more limited diffusion before the Islamic age, first spreading in West Asia beginning in the 2nd century, as Arab Christians such as the Ghassanids, Lakhmids and Banu Judham began migrating north from Arabia into the Syrian Desert, south western Iraq and the Levant. [ http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s1.html Banu Judham migration Witness-pioneer.org 2002-09-16 2010-04-13 ] [ http://www-personal.umich.edu/~andyf/hist_arab.html#Linguistic%20Situation%20in%20Pre-Islamic%20Middle%20East Ghassanids Arabic linguistic influence in Syria Personal.umich.edu 2010-04-13 ] In the modern era, defining who is an Arab is done on the grounds of one or more of the following two criteria: Distribution of Arabic as sole official language (green) and one of several official or national languages (blue). Genealogical : someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the tribes of Arabia – the original inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula – and the Syrian Desert. This was the definition used in medieval times, for example by Ibn Khaldun, but has decreased in importance over time, as a portion of those of Arab ancestry lost their links with their ancestors&apos; motherland. In the modern era, however, DNA tests have at times proved reliable in identifying those of Arab genealogical descent. For example, it has been found that the frequency of the &quot; Arab marker &quot; Haplogroup J1 collapses suddenly at the borders of Arabic speaking countries. (Regueiro et al.) 2006; found agreement by (Battaglia et al.) 2008 Linguistic : someone whose first language, and by extension cultural expression, is Arabic, including any of its varieties. This definition covers more than 300 million people. Certain groups that fulfill this criterion reject this definition on the basis of non-Arab ancestry; such an example may be seen in the way that Egyptians identified themselves in the early 20th century. Jankowski, James. &quot; Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism &quot; in Rashid Kakhlidi, ed., Origins of Arab Nationalism, pp. 244–245 Quoted in Dawisha, Adeed. Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century. Princeton University Press. 2003, ISBN 0-691-12272-5, p. 99 The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by Palestinian Habib Hassan Touma, { 1996, p.xviii } who defines an Arab &quot; in the modern sense of the word &quot;, as &quot; one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arab tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture. &quot; Most people who consider themselves Arab do so based on the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions.Few people consider themselves Arab based on the political definition without also having Arabic as a first or primary language. Thus Kurds, the Assyrian Christians and Mandeans of Iraq and its surrounds (who primarily speak Mesopotamian Aramaic ), Armenians, Shabak, Turcoman, Circassians and Baluch do not identify as Arab, and some Berbers have also rejected the label. { Gellner, Ernest and Micaud, Charles, Eds. Arabs and Berbers: from tribe to nation in North Africa. Lexington: Lexington Books, 1972 } Some other ethno-religious minorities within Western Asia and North Africa who do speak Arabic as their primary community language also do not identify with the Arab identity, most notably the Syriac Christian communities such as Maronites of Syria and Lebanon and the Copts of Egypt. The Arab League, a regional organization of countries intended to encompass the Arab world, defines an Arab as: [ An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic-speaking country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic-speaking peoples. Dwight Fletcher Reynolds, Arab folklore: a handbook, (Greenwood Press: 2007), p.1. ] The relation of [ ar ʿarab ] and [ ar ʾaʿrāb ] is complicated further by the notion of &quot; lost Arabs &quot; [ ar al-ʿArab al-ba&apos;ida ] mentioned in the Qur&apos;an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, Qahtan and Adnan. Versteegh (1997) is uncertain whether to ascribe this distinction to the memory of a real difference of origin of the two groups, but it is certain that the difference was strongly felt in early Islamic times. Even in Islamic Spain there was enmity between the Qays of the northern and the Kalb of the southern group. The so-called Sabaean or Himyarite language described by Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī (died 946) appears to be a special case of language contact between the two groups, an originally north Arabic dialect spoken in the south, and influenced by Old South Arabian. [ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] During the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged an Arab Empire (under the Rashidun and Umayyad s, and later the Abbasid s ) whose borders touched southern France in the west, China in the east, Asia Minor in the north, and the Sudan in the south. This was one of the largest land empires in history. In much of this area, the Arabs spread Islam and the Arabic culture, Science, and Language (the language of the Qur&apos;an ) through conversion and cultural assimilation. Two references valuable for understanding the political significance of Arab identity: Michael C. Hudson, Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy (Yale University Press, 1977), especially Chs. 2 and 3; and Michael N. Barnett, Dialogues in Arab Politics: Negotiations in Regional Order (Columbia University Press, 1998).

Today in Azerbaijan alone, there are nearly 30 settlements still holding the name Arab (for example, Arabgadim, Arabojaghy, Arab-Yengija, etc.). From the time of the Arab conquest of the Caucasus, continuous small-scale Arab migration from various parts of the Arab world was observed in Dagestan influencing and shaping the culture of the local peoples. Up until the mid-20th century, there were still individuals in Dagestan who claimed Arabic to be their native language, with the majority of them living in the village of Darvag to the north-west of Derbent. The latest of these accounts dates to the 1930s. Most Arab communities in southern Dagestan underwent linguistic Turkicisation, thus nowadays Darvag is a majority-Azeri village. { Seferbekov, Ruslan.

Early non Arab Semitic peoples from the Ancient Near East, such as the Arameans, Akkadians ( Assyrians and Babylonians ), Amorites, Israelites, Ebla ites, Ugarit es and Canaanites, built civilizations in Mesopotamia and the Levant; genetically, they often interlapped and mixed. [ http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769 Journal of Semitic Studies Volume 52, Number 1 Pnas.org 2000-06-06 2010-04-13 ] Slowly, however, they lost their political domination of the Near East due to internal turmoil and attacks by non-Semitic peoples. Although the Semites eventually lost political control of Western Asia to the Persian Empire, the Aramaic language remained the lingua franca of Assyria, Mesopotamia and the Levant. Aramaic itself was replaced by Greek as Western Asia&apos;s prestige language following the conquest of Alexander III of Macedon, though it survives to this day among Assyrian (aka Chaldo-Assyrian ) Christians and Mandeans in Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey and northwest Iran. [ Early history ] The first written attestation of the ethnonym &quot; Arab &quot; occurs in an Assyria n inscription of 853 BCE, where Shalmaneser III lists a King Gindibu of mâtu arbâi (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the Battle of Karkar. Some of the names given in these texts are Aramaic, while others are the first attestations of Ancient North Arabian dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated &quot; Arab &quot; : Arabi, Arubu, Aribi and Urbi. Many of the Qedarite queens were also described as queens of the aribi. The Hebrew Bible occasionally refers to Aravi peoples (or variants thereof), translated as &quot; Arab &quot; or &quot; Arabian. &quot; The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling Semitic tribes in the Syrian Desert and Arabia. [ August 2011 ] Arab tribes came into conflict with the Assyria ns during the reign of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, and he records military victories against the powerful Qedar tribe among others. { Ramallah, early 1900s } Medieval Arab genealogist s divided Arabs into three groups: [ Genesis 17:20 HE ] &quot; Ancient Arabs &quot;, tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as ʿĀd and Thamud, often mentioned in the Qur&apos;an as examples of God&apos;s power to destroy those who did not believe and follow their prophets and messengers. &quot; Pure Arabs &quot; of South Arabia, descending from Qahtan. The Qahtanite s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of Yemen following the destruction of the Ma&apos;rib Dam (sadd Ma&apos;rib). The &quot; Arabized Arabs &quot; (musta`ribah) of center and North Arabia, descending from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham. The Book of Genesis narrates that God promised Hagar to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation. ( ) The Book of Jubilees, in the other hand, claims that the sons of Ishmael intermingled with the 6 sons of Keturah, from Abraham, and their descendants were called Arabs and Ishmaelites : Book of Jubilees 20:13 And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of Keturah and their sons, went together and dwelt from Paran to the entering in of Babylon in all the land which is towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and Ishmaelites. Ibn Khaldun &apos;s Muqaddima distinguishes between sedentary Muslims who used to be nomad ic Arabs and the Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term &quot; formerly-nomadic &quot; Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in Egyptians, Spaniards and Yemen is.

[ http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm www.eyewitnesstohistory.com www.eyewitnesstohistory.com 2010-04-13 ] The Christians of Iberia used the term Moor to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.Muslims of Medina referred to the nomadic tribes of the deserts as the A&apos;raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term &quot; A&apos;raab&apos; mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The Qur&apos;an does not use the word [ ar ʿarab ], only the nisba adjective [ ar ʿarabiy ]. The Qur&apos;an calls itself [ ar ʿarabiy ], &quot; Arabic &quot;, and [ ar Mubin ], &quot; clear &quot;. The two qualities are connected for example in ayat 43.2–3, &quot; By the clear Book: We have made it an Arabic recitation in order that you may understand &quot;. The Qur&apos;an became regarded as the prime example of the [ ar al-ʿarabiyya ], the language of the Arabs. The term ar ʾiʿrāb has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun [ ar ʾaʿrāb ] refers to the Bedouin tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat 9.97, [ ar alʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wa nifāqān ] &quot; the Bedouin are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy &quot;. Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, [ ar ʿarabiy ] referred to the language, and [ ar ʾaʿrāb ] to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur&apos;anic verdict just cited. But after the Islamic conquest of the 8th century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following Abi Ishaq, and the term [ ar kalam al-ʿArab ], &quot; language of the Arabs &quot;, denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins. [ Classical kingdoms ] [ Palmyra Nabateans ] { Al Khazneh in } { Petra, Jordan, built by the Nabateans } Proto-Arabic, or Ancient North Arabian, texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs&apos; emergence. The earliest are written in variants of epigraphic south Arabian musnad script, including the 8th century BCE Hasaean inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE Lihyanite texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the Thamudic texts found throughout Arabia and the Sinai (not in reality connected with Thamud ). The Nabataeans were nomadic newcomers [ http://www.biblicalisraeltours.com/Arch/ArchaeologyJordan.htm Biblical Israel Tours Biblical Israel Tours 2010-04-13 ] [ August 2009 ] who moved into territory vacated by the Edomites – Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in Aramaic, but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The Nabataean Alphabet was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by Safaitic inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in Nabataean inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near Sulayyil ) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered &quot; proto-Arabic &quot;, but pre-classical Arabic. Five Syriac inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at Sumatar Harabesi, one of which has been dated to the 2nd century CE. [ Late kingdoms ] [ Lakhmids Ghassanids Kindites ] The Ghassanids, Lakhmids and Kindites were the last major migration of non-Muslims out of Yemen to the north. The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized Syria, the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the Hauran region and spread to modern Lebanon, Palestine and East Jordan. Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen &quot; Arabia Felix &quot;. { Reconstruction of the World Map according to Dionysus } [ April 2010 ] The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the Roman Empire &quot; Arabia Petraea &quot; after the city of Petra, and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east Arabia Magna. The Lakhmids as a dynasty inherited their power from the Tanukh ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital Al-Hira they ended up allying with the Sassanid against the Ghassanids and the Byzantine Empire. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying Kinda in 540 after the fall of their main ally Himyar. The Persians Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control. Harold Bailey The Cambridge history of Iran : The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods, Volume 1&apos;&apos;, Cambridge University Press, 1983, ISBN 0-521-20092-X p. 59 The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi&apos;a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arbia from &quot; Qaryah Dhat Kahl &quot; (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw) in Central Arabia. They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, till they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king Al-Mundhir, and his son &apos;Amr [ Islamic ] [ Muslim conquests ] [ Arab Caliphate ] { Caliph s } [ #a1584e Expansion under Muhammad, 622–632/A.H. 1–11 ] [ #ef9070 Expansion during the Rashidun Caliphate, 632–661/A.H. 11–40 ] [ #fad07d Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661–750/A.H. 40–129 ] Rashidun Era (632-661) [ Rashidun Caliphate ] After the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632, Rashidun armies launched campaigns of conquest, establishing the Caliphate, or Islamic Empire, one of the largest empires in history. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empires of Queen Mawia or the Palmyrene Empire which was predominantly Syriac rather than Arab. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and not a mere imitation of the earlier Arab kingdoms such as the Himyarite, Lakhmids or Ghassanids, although it benefited greatly from their art, administration and architecture.

However, the Arabs&apos; higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter&apos;s obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph Umar II strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the situation, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the Abbasid s came to power and moved the capital to Baghdad. Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Prior to the Arab conquest, North Africa was inhibited by various people including Punics, Vandals and Greeks. It was not until the 11th century that the Maghreb saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin Banu Hilal tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the Fatimids to punish the Berber Zirids for abandoning Shiism, they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring Hammadid s. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb, Although Berbers would rule the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the Almoravids, the Almohads, Hafsids, etc.), the arrival of these tribes would eventually help to Arabize much of it ethnically in addition to the linguistic and political impact on the none-Arabs there. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, Islamic Spain was divided into small kingdoms. [ Abbadid Taifa Nasrid Zengid dynasty Ikhshidid dynasty ] Abbassid Era (750-1513) [ Abbasid Caliphate ] Abbasids let a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the Battle of the Zab effectively ending their rule in all part of the Empire except Al-Andalus.

Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when Wilayas began to fracture, afterwards in the 1190s there was a revival for their power which was put to end by the Mongols who conquered Baghdad and killed the Caliph, members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which fractured from the Abbasid rule two years earlier, the Mamluk generals were taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature. Fractured Entities: Fatimids Ayyubid dynasty [ Ottoman Caliphate ] Arabs were ruled by Ottoman sultans from 1513 to 1918. Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate when they choose to bear the title of Caliph. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.

Prior to the emergence of the term Mizrahi, the term &quot; Arab Jews &quot; was sometimes used to describe Jews of the Arab world. The term is rarely used today. The few remaining Jews in the Arab countries reside mostly in Morocco and Tunisia. From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, following the creation of the state of Israel, most of these Jews fled their countries of birth and are now mostly concentrated in Israel. Some immigrated to France, where they formed a large Jewish community, that outnumbered Jews in the United States, but relatively small compared to European Jews. See Jewish exodus from Arab lands.

During this period the Muslim world became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the &quot; House of Wisdom &quot; (Arabic: بيت الحكمة) in Baghdad. Rival Muslim dynasties such as the Fatimid s of Egypt and the Umayyad s of al-Andalus were also major intellectual centres with cities such as Cairo and Córdoba rivaling Baghdad. { Vartan Gregorian, &quot; Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith &quot;, Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 ISBN 0-8157-3283-X } [ Culture ] Arab culture is a term that draws together the common themes and overtones found in the Arab countries, especially those of the Middle-Eastern countries.
