[ 6 ] The population was 15,538 at the 2000 census. [ History ] [ May 2011 ] Founded in 1850, the city of Gainesville was established on a 40-acre tract of land donated by Mary E. Clark. City residents called their new community Liberty, which proved short-lived, as a Liberty, Texas already existed. It was suggested by one of the original settlers of Cooke County, Colonel William Fitzhugh, that the town be named after General Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Gaines, a United States General under whom Fitzhugh had served, had been sympathetic with the Texas Revolution. The first hint of prosperity arrived with the Butterfield Stagecoach in September 1858, bringing freight, passengers, and mail. During the Civil War, the Great Hanging, a controversial trial and hanging of suspected Union loyalists, brought the new town to the attention of the state and came close to ripping the county apart.In the decade after the Civil War, Gainesville had its first period of extended growth, catalyzed by the expansion of the cattle industry in Texas. Gainesville, only seven miles from the Oklahoma border, became a supply point for cowboys driving herds north to Kansas. The merchants of Gainesville reaped considerable benefits from the passing cattle drives. Within 20 years, the population increased from a few hundred to more than 2,000. Gainesville was incorporated on February 17, 1873 and by 1890 was established as a commercial and shipping point for area ranchers and farmers. In the late 1870s two factors drastically altered the historic landscape of North Central Texas. The first of these was barbed wire. In 1875, Henry B. Sanborn, a regional sales agent for Joseph Glidden’s Bar Fence Company of DeKalb, Illinois traveled to Texas. That autumn, he chose Gainesville as one of his initial distribution points for the newly invented barbed wire which his employer had patented the previous year. On his first visit to Gainesville, he sold ten reels of the wire to the Cleaves and Fletcher hardware store –the first spools of barbed wire ever sold in Texas. World War II had an enormous impact on Cooke County. Camp Howze, an army infantry training camp, was established on some of the best farmland in the county. The construction of the camp helped bring Cooke County out of the Great Depression by providing jobs. The county population doubled and the area boomed. In the last several years, tourism has brought renewed prosperity to the area. The return of Amtrak on June 14, 1999 brought Gainesville back full circle to one of the original sources of its growth and success. In the early 1990s, Gainesville had 600 businesses and a population of 14,587. In the year 2000, the population was 15,538, with the population after the 2010 Census being just over 16,000 people. [ Courthouse ] Gainesville is home to a courthouse with an octagon al rotunda topped by stained glass, erected in 1910. &quot; The 1912 Cooke County Courthouse was designed by the Dallas firm of Lang &amp; Witchell. The courthouse was designed in the Beaux Arts style with some Prairie Style features and influences from famed Chicago architect Louis Sullivan. The courthouse in the center of Gainesville features black and white marbled interiors and a tall central atrium capped by a stained glass skylight under the tower. &quot; The courthouse is undergoing a major renovation project, resulting in the move of many county offices to surrounding buildings; thus allowing for construction to take place. ref &gt; [ Historic Courthouses in Texas Texas Historical Commission http://www.thc.state.tx.us/courthouses/chlistpages/cooke.html 2007-07-23 http://web.archive.org/web/20070612132614/http%3A//www.thc.state.tx.us/courthouses/chlistpages/cooke.html 2007-06-12 ] &lt; /ref &gt; [ The Great Hanging ] During the American Civil War, Gainesville was the scene of what came to be known as &quot; The Great Hanging &quot;. Confederate soldiers rounded up over 200 Texans, and on October 1, 1862, hanged 42 after a mock trial. This event sparked a reign of terror in which dozens of Texans suspected of being loyal to the Union were lynched by Confederate soldiers.
