As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,172. [ History ] Hiawatha was founded in 1857. John M. Coe, John P. Wheller, and Thomas J. Drummond were instrumental in organizing the city, and the site was staked out February 17, 1857. B.L. Rider reportedly was responsible for naming Hiawatha, taking the young Indian&apos;s name from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow &apos;s poem, The Song of Hiawatha. { Kansas Place-Names, John Rydjord, University of Oklahoma Press, 1972, p. 436 ISBN 978-0-8061-0994-7 } Hiawatha became the Brown County Seat in 1858, and the first school opened in 1870. The main street was designated Oregon Street after the Oregon Trail. Parallel streets north of it were named after Indian tribes north of the Trail, and streets south carried tribal names of those south of the Trail. Hiawatha is named after a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called The Song of Hiawatha. In the poem is legendary Onondaga and Mohawk Indian leader Hiawatha. Adjacent to the former Ioway-Sac reservation and the present-day Ioway Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Hiawatha is called Hári Wáta in Ioway, meaning &quot; I am looking far away &quot;. { Goodtracks, Jimm (1992) Baxoje-Jiwere-Nyut&apos;aji - Ma&apos;unke: Iowa-Otoe-Missouria Language to English. Boulder, CO: Center for the Study of the Languages of the Plains and Southwest. } This name may be the result of choosing Ioway words that sound like the English name. It has nothing to do with the Onondaga-Mohawk leader. [ March 2011 ] Hiawatha is nicknamed the &quot; City of Beautiful Maple s &quot; because of its countless trees that produce delightful colors in the fall season.

[ March 2011 ] According to The New York Times, &quot; the cartoonist Bob Montana inked the original likenesses of Archie and his pals and plopped them in an idyllic Midwestern community named Riverdale because Mr. Goldwater, a New Yorker, had fond memories of time spent in Hiawatha, Kan. &quot; [ Geography ] Hiawatha is located at [ 39 51 9 N 95 32 11 W type:city ] (39.852530, -95.536429).

[ Tourist attractions ] Davis Memorial [ 2008a ] [ September 2010 ] The Davis Memorial is a monument in the Mount Hope Cemetery, built by John Milburn Davis in honor of his wife Sarah after her death. Begun soon after her death in 1930 and completed in 1934, the monument consists of statues of the couple and a small shelter, carved from Italian marble. Its cost (approximately $200,000) led many in the community to criticize Davis for his free spending during the Great Depression. Today, the monument benefits the community financially because of the thousands of tourists who visit it. { Davis Memorial, Blue Skyways, 1999-01-21. Retrieved 2009-02-28. } The memorial was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

The middle school was the &apos;Warriors&apos; and the elementary school, the &apos;Braves&apos;. The District received much praise for its transition, including the National Congress of American Indians and organizations as far away as Washington, D.C. After narrowing down many potential new nicknames, the high school decided to retain its red pride, renaming itself the &apos;Red Hawks&apos;. The middle school obtained the name &apos;Hawks&apos; and the elementary school, &apos;Junior Hawks&apos;. Hiawatha avoided potential lawsuits and controversy by making a quick move to a nickname from which racism cannot be inferred.
