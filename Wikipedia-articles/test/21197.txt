Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed a playing card game called Hanafuda. The handmade cards soon became popular, and Yamauchi hired assistants to mass produce cards to satisfy demand. Nintendo continues to manufacture playing cards in Japan [ http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/index.html Nintendo&apos;s card game product nintendo 2009 ] and organizes its own contract bridge tournament called the &quot; Nintendo Cup &quot;. [ http://www.jcbl.or.jp/english/tournament.html list of japan contract bridge league tounaments jcbl japanese 2010 ] [ New ventures (1956–1974) ] In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi (grandson of Fusajiro Yamauchi) visited the U.S. to talk with the United States Playing Card Company, the dominant playing card manufacturer there. He found that the world&apos;s biggest company in his business was only using a small office. This was a turning point when Yamauchi realized the limitations of the playing card business. He then gained access to Disney&apos;s characters and put them on the playing cards to drive sales. { Love Tester } In 1963, Yamauchi renamed Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd. to Nintendo Co., Ltd. [ http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/service/nintendo_history_9911.html http://www.webcitation.org/5vQB0bQ5E 1 January 2011 Nintendo History Nintendo of Europe GmbH 1 January 2011 ] The company then began to experiment in other areas of business using newly injected capital. During this period of time between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a taxi company, a love hotel chain, a TV network, a food company (selling instant rice, similar to instant noodles ) and several other things. All of these ventures eventually failed, and after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales dropped, and Nintendo&apos;s stock price plummeted to ¥ 60. In 1966, Nintendo moved into the Japanese toy industry with the Ultra Hand, an extendable arm developed by its maintenance engineer Gunpei Yokoi in his free time. Yokoi was moved from maintenance to the new &quot; Nintendo Games &quot; department as a product developer. Nintendo continued to produce popular toys, including the Ultra Machine, Love Tester and the Kousenjuu series of light gun games. Despite some successful products, Nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required in the toy market, and fell behind the well-established companies such as Bandai and Tomy. In 1973, its focus shifted to family entertainment venues with the Laser Clay Shooting System, using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo&apos;s Kousenjuu series of toys, and set up in abandoned bowling alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines (such as the light gun shooter game Wild Gunman ) for the emerging arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs, Nintendo had found a new market. [ Electronic era (since 1974) ] Nintendo&apos;s first venture into the video-gaming industry was securing rights to distribute the Magnavox Odyssey video game console in Japan in 1974. Nintendo began to produce its own hardware in 1977, with the Color TV Game home video game consoles. Four versions of these consoles were produced, each including variations of a single game (for example, Color TV Game 6 featured six versions of Light Tennis). A student product developer named Shigeru Miyamoto was hired by Nintendo at this time. [ Famous Names in Gaming http://www.cbsnews.com/2316-100_162-1673418-2.html CBS 2010-06-13 ] He worked for Yokoi, and one of his first tasks was to design the casing for several of the Color TV Game consoles. Miyamoto went on to create, direct and produce some of Nintendo&apos;s most famous video games and become one of the most recognizable figures in the video game industry. In 1975, Nintendo moved into the video arcade game industry with EVR Race, designed by their first game designer, Genyo Takeda, [ http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/punchout/vol1_page1.jsp Iwata Asks-Punch-Out!! Nintendo 2009-07-07 ] and several more titles followed. Nintendo had some small success with this venture, but the release of Donkey Kong in 1981, designed by Miyamoto, changed Nintendo&apos;s fortunes dramatically. The success of the game and many licensing opportunities (such as ports on the Atari 2600, Intellivision and ColecoVision ) gave Nintendo a huge boost in profit. { Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) } In 1980, Nintendo launched Game &amp; Watch —a handheld video game series developed by Yokoi where each game was played on a separate device—to worldwide success. In 1983, Nintendo launched the Family Computer (commonly shortened &quot; Famicom &quot; ), known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), home video game console in Japan, alongside ports of its most popular arcade titles. In 1985, the NES launched in North America, and was accompanied by Super Mario Bros., one of the best-selling video games of all time. { Nagata, Kazuaki, &quot; Nintendo secret: It&apos;s all in the game &quot;, } { Japan Times, 10 March 2009, p. 3. } After the success of the Game &amp; Watch, Yokoi developed the Game Boy handheld game console in 1989. The Game Boy, the best-selling handheld of all time, remained dominant for more than a decade. Incremental updates in the Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Color over the next decade did little to change the original formula. The Nintendo Entertainment System was superseded by the Super Famicom, known outside Japan as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). This was Nintendo&apos;s console of the 16-bit [ 4 ] generation, following the Famicom of the 8-bit [ 3 ] generation, whose main rival was the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. A console war between Sega and Nintendo ensued. { Kent (2001), p. 431. &quot; Sonic was an immediate hit, and many consumers who had been loyally waiting for Super NES to arrive now decided to purchase Genesis.... The fiercest competition in the } { history of video games was about to begin. &quot; } Although relatively late to market, the SNES considerably outsold the Mega Drive/Genesis. Aiming to produce an affordable virtual reality console, Gunpei Yokoi designed the Virtual Boy, a table-mounted semi-portable console featuring stereoscopic graphics. Users view games through a binocular eyepiece and control games using a gamepad. Critics were generally disappointed with the quality of the games and graphics, and complained of gameplay-induced headaches. { Frischling, Bill. &quot; Sideline Play. &quot; The Washington Post (1974-Current file): 11.

[ Policy ] [ Emulation ] [ y June 2010 June 2010 June 2010 ] Nintendo, particularly Nintendo of America, is known for a &quot; no tolerance &quot; stance for emulation of its video games and consoles, stating that it is the single largest threat to the intellectual rights of video game developers. [ http://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#roms Nintendo - Corporate Information - Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.) 2009-07-24 ] Nintendo claims that copyright-like rights in mask work s protect its games from the exceptions that United States copyright law otherwise provides for personal backup copies. Nintendo uses the claim that emulators running on personal computer s have no use other than to play pirated video games, though a use that doesn&apos;t involve intellectual property in this way is seen in the development and testing of independently produced &quot; homebrew &quot; software on Nintendo&apos;s platforms. It is also claimed that Nintendo&apos;s claims contradict copyright laws, mainly that ROM image copiers are illegal (they are legal if used to dump unprotected ROM images on to a user&apos;s computer for personal use, per [ 17 117 ] (a)(1) and foreign counterparts) [ 17 117 ] and that emulators are illegal (if they do not use copyrighted BIOS, or use other methods to run the game, they are legal; see Console emulator for further information about the legality of emulators). However, Nintendo remains the only modern console manufacturer that has not sued an emulator manufacturer. [ May 2011 ] Emulators have been used by Nintendo and licensed third party companies as a means to re-release older games (e.g. Virtual Console ). [ Content guidelines ] For many years, Nintendo had a policy of strict content guidelines for video games published on its consoles. Although Nintendo of Japan allowed graphic violence in its video games, nudity and sexuality were strictly prohibited. Former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that if the company allowed the licensing of pornographic games, the company&apos;s image would be forever tarnished. { &apos;&apos; } { &apos;&apos;Game Over&apos;&apos;, David Sheff, 1993. } Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe went further in that games released for Nintendo consoles could not feature nudity, sexuality, profanity (including racism, sexism or slurs ), blood, graphic or domestic violence, drug s, political messages or religious symbol s (with the exception of widely unpracticed religions, such as the Greek Pantheon ). [ http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo of America Content Guidelines Filibustercartoons.com 2011-05-25 ] The Japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a &quot; Japanese Invasion &quot; by forcing Japanese community standard s on North American and European children. Despite the strict guidelines, some exceptions have occurred: Bionic Commando (though swastikas were eliminated in the US version), Smash TV and Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode contained human violence, the latter also containing implied sexuality and tobacco use; River City Ransom and Taboo: The Sixth Sense contained nudity, and the latter also contained religious images, as did Castlevania II and III. A known side effect of this policy was the Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat selling over double the number of the Super NES version, mainly because Nintendo had forced publisher Acclaim to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game, making it non-violent. [ http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/919/919357p10.html IGN Presents the History of Mortal Kombat - Retro Feature at IGN IGN Travis Fahs 2010-08-16 ] By contrast, Sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code was required to unlock the gore). Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat II to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging. [ http://www.mobygames.com/game/mortal-kombat-ii/cover-art/gameCoverId%2C22874 Mortal Kombat IIcover artwork at MobyGames ] In 1994 and 2003, when the ESRB and PEGI (respectively) video game ratings systems were introduced, Nintendo chose to abolish most of these policies in favor of consumers making their own choices about the content of the games they played. Today, changes to the content of games are done primarily by the game&apos;s developer or, occasionally, at the request of Nintendo. The only clear-set rule is that ESRB AO-rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America, [ http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/buyers_guide.jsp Nintendo of America Customer Service – Nintendo Buyer&apos;s Guide Nintendo.com 2011-05-25 ] a practice which is also enforced by Sony and Microsoft, its two greatest competitors in the present market. Nintendo has since allowed several mature-content games to be published on its consoles, including: Perfect Dark, Conker&apos;s Bad Fur Day, Doom and Doom 64, BMX XXX, the Resident Evil series, killer7, Eternal Darkness: Sanity&apos;s Requiem, BloodRayne, Geist and Dementium: The Ward. Certain games have continued to be modified, however. For example, Konami was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 Game Boy Color game Metal Gear Solid (although the previous NES version of Metal Gear and the subsequent GameCube game Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes both included such references, as did Wii title MadWorld ), and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo 64 port of Cruis&apos;n USA. [ http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060333p1.html IGN: Nintendo to censor Cruis&apos;n 1996-10-08 2009-07-24 ] Another example is in the Game Boy Advance game Mega Man Zero 3, in which one of the bosses, called Hellbat Schilt in the Japanese and European releases, was renamed Devilbat Schilt in the North American localization. In North America releases of the Mega Man Zero games, enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack would not gush blood as they did in the Japanese versions. However, the release of the Wii has been accompanied by a number of even more controversial mature titles, such as Manhunt 2, No More Heroes, The House of the Dead: Overkill and MadWorld, the latter three of which are published exclusively for the console. The Nintendo DS also has violent games, such as Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Dementium: The Ward, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Resident Evil: Deadly Silence. [ License guidelines ] Nintendo of America also had guidelines before 1993 that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, in addition to the above content guidelines:. Guidelines were enforced through the 10NES lockout chip. Licensees were not permitted to release the same game for a competing console until two years had passed. Nintendo would decide how many cartridges would be supplied to the licensee. Nintendo would decide how much space would be dedicated for articles, advertising, etc. in the Nintendo Power magazine. There was a minimum number of cartridges that had to be ordered by the licensee from Nintendo. There was a yearly limit of five games that a licensee may produce for a Nintendo console. D. Sheff: &quot; Game Over &quot;, p. 215. CyberActive Media Group, 1999. This rule was created to prevent market over-saturation, which had contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. The last rule was circumvented in a number of ways; for example, Konami, wanting to produce more games for Nintendo&apos;s consoles, formed Ultra Games and later Palcom to produce more games as a technically different publisher. This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies, as they could not afford to start additional companies. In another side effect, Square Co. (now Square Enix ) executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the Nintendo 64 along with the degree of censorship and control that Nintendo enforced over its games, most notably Final Fantasy VI, were factors in switching its focus towards Sony &apos;s PlayStation console.

It is displayed on any game, system, or accessory licensed for use on one of its video game console s, denoting the game has been properly licensed by Nintendo.

The report cites increasing carbon dioxide emissions (failed to be reduced per target) and a lack of waste management.
