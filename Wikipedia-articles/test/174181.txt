He was the longest serving prime minister in the history of Japan. [ Early life ] Satō was born in Tabuse, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and studied German law at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1923, he passed the senior civil service examinations, and in the following year, upon graduation, became a civil servant in the Ministry of Railways. He served as Director of the Osaka Railways Bureau from 1944 to 1946 and Vice-Minister for Transportation from 1947 to 1948. { http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/sato-bio.html Nobel Committee information on 1974 Peace Prize } Satō entered the Diet in 1949 as a member of the Liberal Party. He was appointed Minister of Postal Services and Telecommunications from July 1951 - July 1952. Sato gradually rose through the ranks of Japanese politics, becoming Chief Cabinet Secretary to Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida from January 1953 to July 1954. He later served as Minister of Construction from October 1952-February 1953. After the Liberal Party merged with the Japan Democratic Party to form the Liberal Democratic Party, Satō served as chairman of the party executive council from December 1957 to June 1958. Satō became Minister of Finance in the cabinets of Nobusuke Kishi (his brother) and Hayato Ikeda. From July 1961-July 1962, Satō was Minister of International Trade and Industry. From July 1963-June 1964 he was concurrently head of the Hokkaidō Development Agency and of the Science and Technology Agency, and was also state minister in charge of organizing the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo. [ Prime minister ] Satō succeeded Ikeda after the latter resigned due to ill health. His government was longer than many, and by the late 1960s he appeared to have single-handed control over the entire Japanese government. He was a popular prime minister due to the growing economy; his foreign policy, which was a balancing act between the interests of the United States and China, was more tenuous. Student political radicalization led to numerous protests against Satō’s support of the United States-Japan Security Treaty, and Japanese tacit support for American military operations in Vietnam. These protests expanded into massive riots, which eventually forced Satō to close the prestigious University of Tokyo for a year in 1969. { Feilier. Learning to Bow. Page 80 } After three terms as prime minister, Satō decided not to run for a fourth. His heir apparent, Takeo Fukuda, won the Sato faction&apos;s support in the subsequent Diet elections, but the more popular MITI minister, Kakuei Tanaka, won the vote, ending the Satō faction&apos;s dominance. [ Relations with mainland China and Taiwan ] Satō repeatedly refused to allow representatives from the People&apos;s Republic of China to visit Japan. [ November 2010 ] In 1965, Satō approved a US$150 million loan to Taiwan. He visited Taiwan in 1967. In 1969, Satō insisted that the defense of Taiwan was necessary for the safety of Japan. Satō followed the United States in most major issues, but Satō opposed the Nixon visit to China. { MacMillian. Nixon and Mao: The Week that Changed the World } Satō also bitterly opposed the entry of the PRC into the United Nations in 1971. [ Nuclear affairs ] Satō introduced the Three Non-Nuclear Principles on December 11, 1967, which means non-production, non-possession, and non-introduction of nuclear weapon s. He later suggested the &quot; Four-Pillars Nuclear Policy &quot;. [ May 2010 ] During the prime ministership of Satō, Japan entered the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Diet passed a resolution formally adopting the principles in 1971. However, recent inquiries show that behind the scenes, Satō was more accommodating towards US plans of stationing nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. In December 2008, the Japanese government declassified a document showing that during a visit to the US in January 1965, he was discussing with US officials the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the People&apos;s Republic of China. { Editorial: The U.S. nuclear umbrella, past and future } In December 2009, his son reported that his father agreed in a November 1969 conversation with US President Nixon to allow the stationing of nuclear warheads in Okinawa once it was restored to Japanese sovereignty. { Document on secret Japan-U.S. nuclear pact kept by ex-PM Sato&apos;s family } [ Okinawa issues ] Since the end of the Second World War, Okinawa had been occupied by the United States. While visiting the United States in January 1965, Satō openly asked President Lyndon Johnson to return Okinawa to Japan. In August 1965, Satō became the first post-war prime minister of Japan to visit Okinawa. In 1969, Satō struck a deal with U.S. president Richard Nixon to repatriate Okinawa and remove its nuclear weaponry: this deal was controversial because it allowed the U.S. forces in Japan to maintain bases in Okinawa after repatriation. { Ambrose. The Rise to Globalism. Page 235 } Okinawa was formally returned to Japan in May 1972, and from that agreement Japan asserts a claim on the disputed Senkaku Islands as well. [ Relations with Southeast Asia ] During Satō&apos;s term, Japan participated in the creation of the Asian Development Bank in 1966 and held a ministerial level conference on Southeast Asia n economic development. It was the first international conference sponsored by the Japanese government in the postwar period. { http://asj.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng/html/ess018.html } In 1967, he was also the first Japanese prime minister to visit Singapore. [ Later life ] Satō shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Seán MacBride in 1974. He was the first Asian to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. This event was mentioned in Fujio Akatsuka &apos;s Japanese comic &quot; Tensai Bakabon. &quot; One character says &quot; I can&apos;t believe anything since Eisaku Satō received the Nobel Peace Prize &quot; in the comic. [ August 2010 ] [ Personal ] Satō married Hiroko Matsuoka, the daughter of diplomat Yōsuke Matsuoka in 1926 and had two sons, Ryūtarō and Shinji. In a 1969 Shukan Asahi interview with novelist Shusaku Endo, his wife accused him of being a rake and a wife-beater. { http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839718,00.html } His hobbies included golf, fishing, and the Japanese tea ceremony. The 37th Prime Minister of Japan, Nobusuke Kishi was his older brother. Both Prime Minister Satō and his wife, Hiroko Matsuoka, are descendants of samurais. [ References ] Allisonson, Gary D.
